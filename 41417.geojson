She carried a camera, a parting gift from her father, and wore excessive amounts of blue bracelets. She was girthy by European standards, but was by no means fat. During the winter she had come to visit her boyfriend; she stayed with him for weeks in Memorial Hall.\r\n\r\nThis was her second visit, and ultimately, it would be her last. \r\n\r\nWhile he went to class, she would sit in his room and busy herself with little things: Making bracelets, writing e-mails, and tidying up. There were always issues she wanted to address and knew the grains of sand in her hourglass were slipping away. \r\n\r\nBut they wanted to live in the moment remembering the crazy past. \r\n\r\nAnd so they spent their evenings drinking cheap, canned beer instead. They would talk about the times that he had come to Paris and drunk Vodka straight out of the bottle. They would talk about their mutual love of Tom Waits or fucking in the sea. Sometimes, she would drink 14 beers and cry. \r\n\r\nMost of the time, she didn\\'t understand the jokes; her command of English was poor, but she laughed at them anyway. She\\'d marvel at the size of things and would readily take offence to Miller High Life\\'s moniker \"The Champagne of Beers\" as she crumbled the empty can and reached for another.\r\n\r\nHe always knew that their time was limited, by distance and by both of their restlessness, and so he\\'d sleep with her each night and relish the blessed absurdity that would highlight his thoughts for years. In the morning, they\\'d keep their moaning to a minimum to avoid waking his roommate.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day she left that place. She left the country knowing that it would never be the same. \r\n\r\nNeither of them liked constants.

While most people think he is the happy-go-lucky high school teacher he purports to be, some people have a suspicion that he is Ned Flanders, incarnate. His push broom mustache doesn’t do much to dissuade those few people. \r\n\r\nRegardless, Mark Korntheuer is what one might call a neighborhood institution. He’s lived in Maywood for over thirty years and has taught at the same high school just as long. His house is on 3rd Avenue in what is affectionately referred to as the “Lutheran Ghetto,” due to the high concentration of former and current Lutheran school teachers who chose to live in Maywood because they couldn’t afford the more pricey neighborhoods in the area. The house, of course, is immaculate. The yard is well groomed and it almost looks like he irons his lawn. \r\n\r\nThere isn’t much to say about him except that he’s a stand up guy. He’s a fervent Christian who regularly attends church. In the great Lutheran tradition, though, he can always drink one beer too many if the situation dictates it. \r\n\r\nThough he’s been recognized multiple times for his achievements at Walther Lutheran High School, the accolades have not gone to his head. Every morning he wakes up and happily goes to his job. He teaches students about geography and coaches the tennis team and is always willing to put in extra time with any one of his pupils. If you rise early enough on a Saturday, you’ll catch him and his wife on their morning walk – clad in Walther attire, of course. Mark is the friendly face you see at the grocery store. He’s the guy who never feigns interest in what you have to say, but pays only real attention. \r\n\r\nMark is the guy who future homeowners dream of having as a neighbor<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7th4sfn8mkb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.83604,41.89634]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dean the Cocksucker","description":"Posted by RammsteinIn a semi-opulent office, he sits in absolute piety. His clerical collar is immaculate just like his saviors\\' birth. His alcoholic wife or special-needs child is nowhere on his mind. He pages through a gold trimmed bible with his large hands and ponders the meaning of the sacred word. But his righteousness is a farce. He does not cope well - but unlike his wife who self medicates, he deludes himself into thinking an enemy is lurking within the confines of his own flock. Like a Catholic priest who turns his nightstand photo of God around before penetrating the alter boy, deep down, Dean knows what he has done, and what he is doing, is wrong. He dislikes homosexuality. He dislikes it so much that he loves it, he feeds on it. He believes that to tolerate such a facet of wickedness is to commit the same transgression yourself. And so he thinks further. He thinks only in hypothetical terms. He does not think of the effect his actions will have, but rather how good they\\'ll feel when he carries them out. The term \"hypocrisy\" has never bogged down his thoughts because he is an instrument of God - finely tuned to carry out His precise will. Never mind the fact that his assistant pastor dresses up like a cheerleader at basketball games or that he knits or that he\\'s deeper in the closet than Dean\\'s wife is in the bottle. No. He won\\'t pull that card until he\\'s ready to sink the entire ship. For now he\\'s content to sit, page through the bible and formulate plans for the next witch hunt.

Think what you will, but it\\'s simply not the case. Not only do I find strip clubs demeaning, but they scare me. I\\'m not one to tell anybody how to earn a dollar - ideologically I have no problem with fucking a pole for a living, but what I can control is whether I go there or not. I choose the latter in most cases.

Once the idea is verbalized you, as a part of the group, are past the point of no return. One evening I found myself stuck in Lake Station avoiding the glances of the enterainment.

It\\'s a curious feeling when you\\'re a virgin all over again.

Everybody has a friend who, whether because of intoxication or just plain obnoxiousness, tells the same fucking stories over and over. It\\'s annoying as all hell but you put up with them because they\\'re your friend and they mean well. Sometimes, we don\\'t choose our acquaintances. But, answer me this: Do we choose our religions? As I child, I had no say in the matter. Church was a sacred place by necessity; I was told it was, and as I child, you don\\'t object. It was self-evident why the church was sacred - because it was God\\'s house; it was a church, duh! There was even a point in my formative years, mostly as a teenager, when I actually felt the church as sacred. The eucharist, the pulpit, the cross - they meant something. I tried my best to entrust my soul to the Lord. And then I grew up and realized the church, any church, is no different from my jackass friends who can\\'t come up with something original. Every week - they read from the same book; they tell them EXACT SAME STORIES. I\\'m totally bewildered how ministers have come up with original sermons for the last century. Christ, I mean the gospel is only 5 books. Worshippers sing the same songs out of the same book. Lutherans revere, and are named after, a man who wrote a book called \"Discourse I Against the Jews,\" in which he outlines how much the Jews suck at life. How many times can one hear the story of Christ\\'s birth? WE GET IT, OK? Church is repetition at it\\'s best. I used nostalgia in class the other day. It seems to me that church is the ultimate nostalgic trip - it pines for the days when things were better, when Jesus Christ was rockin\\' out with his cock out. Thing is: it wasn\\'t that great back then. I don\\'t mean this in a literal sense, of course. I have a sense of appreciation for my religious upbringing. It taught me the values and morals which I like to think define me this very day. But at some point, you outgrow it. You see the hypocrisy; you see the parellels to your life; you recognize it as antiquity. You wish it well, and move on. What a mindless rant. Bottom line: I\\'m proof that sacred is a fleeting concept. Believe it if you want, but I\\'ll continue to think of it as nostalgia. And that\\'s just fine with me, because you can indulge in whatever nostalgic memory you choose. You don\\'t disrespect what other\\'s consider sacred, church taught me that. But I can certainly think \"sacred my ass\" - one thing church never taught me.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7th4sdeeyov"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04172,41.46303]}},{"properties":{"name":"Joe Scuedero","description":"Posted by RammsteinHis shop is a last bastion, of sorts.

Why we thought driving an automobile was an appropriate form of transportion remains lost on me. \r\n\r\nA comrade from foreign soil had made landfall and, being the gracious host, I obliged his request to start quaffing Funweisers early. Real early. We sat on my porch sippin\\' suds and trading stories. It had been a long time, indeed, and it felt like olds times as we sat shirtless - drinking, and talking. Once again, in our natural element. \r\n\r\nDetails became hazy as we upped the ante around noon with shots of jet-fuel ethanol; my roomate had no problem joining in the early afternoon fun. Soon enough, we\\'d all said goodbye to the Land of Sobriety and entered flat out drunkeness. But as any drunk worth his swagger knows that\\'s no reason to stop or even slow a good bender, and so we pushed forward. \r\n\r\nThe evening plans were simple: Surprise Niko\\'s friends who were unaware of this arrival. We logically assumed they were at Northside\\'s and headed out. My nameless roomate grabbed the keys and despite our complaints insisted his head was dry enough to get us half a mile down the road. We arrived there with no problem other than the fact nobody was there. After a few more Studweisers, we decided to double-back to Duffy\\'s where they \"musht be at, man. They GOTta be there, dude.\"\r\n\r\nThe ride back was uneventful. We sat smoking the Gauloises Niko had brought and laughing about whatever. We saw the neon lights no more than 100 feet down the road.\r\n\r\nWe had arrived.\r\n\r\nRight at the bottom of a 7 foot ditch. In his excitment, the driver had apparently turned at what he thought was the driveway, which turned out to be the railroad tracks. My 500 dollar, piece-of-shit car slammed its nose at a 40 degree angle into the ground - a phone pole just inches away. We looked at each other in disbelief. My head throbbed from the impolite introduction to the windshield.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody saw it. Back up, dude. Back up. We\\'ll park. Go in. It\\'s cool.\" \r\n\r\nBut people had seen it. A lot of people. \r\n\r\n\"Fuck it, dude. Nah, go, go go!\" \r\n\r\nAnd go we did. Tearing away from the bar in a cloud of stinky smoke from my back tires, we lost my last remaining hubcap whipping around the turn. But we had escaped to die another day. Revelry was high as we sat on the couch slamming shitty canned beer - the severity of our actions totally lost on us. The glow of police lights around the block didn\\'t concern us. \r\n\r\nThere is no real end to this post.

My question is broad, too broad. There is an air of nervousness about her, as perhaps there is to most people living in the region. I restate the question more clearly. Slowly, she opens up, even sounding candid at times about her experience of living in Northwest Indiana. \r\n\r\nRachel is small; her body obviously shaped by the never ending cadence of her feet on the pavement. She is a runner, and from what I can gather, a very good one. We begin there as I ask how being an athlete here is different as opposed to her native Detroit. \r\n\r\nShe tells me there differences are small, but not negligible. Valparaiso, which sits on the edge of expansive farmland, has much more open land compared to back home. There\\'s a stronger connection to nature here and she seems to dig it. \r\n\r\nWe open up. I learn that she\\'s studied abroad in London. I ask her what impact coming back to Valpo had on her after studying in, what many consider, the heart of modern history and culture. Her answer surprises me greatly. She does not speak ill of Valpo, in fact, quite the opposite. \r\n\r\nShe tells me that upon her return she found the, admittedly, boring space of Northwest Indiana more interesting. She was better able to appreciate her remaining time here. Having similar travel experience but greatly different opinions, I\\'m floored and ask her elaborate further. \r\n\r\nIt seems in seeing such a vastly different culture and landscape, she feels a sense of heightened sense of appreciation for her surroundings. \r\n\r\n\"Going to London taught me that I don\\'t necessarily have to be stuck around here forever.\" \r\n\r\nWhile still taken aback, I’m envious of Rachel. By having her horizons broadened, she has not lost focus on why she came here in the first place - to earn her degree. She acknowledges how mundane this place can be and occasionally sees the same vapid landscape I see. But somehow, she’s able to get past herself and realize that her time here is fleeting, and she makes the best of it; she even enjoys it. She has a good base of friends and sense of purpose and that seems to be enough for her, at least for now.\r\n\r\nRachel is self-assured. She will go on to bigger and better things. But the sense of appreciation she’s learned from living in this slow paced and flat world will never let her forget Northwest Indiana completely.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7th4se5vaco"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04724,41.46371]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ray Mottis","description":"Posted by RammsteinIt’s difficult to watch Ray move.

His vision is poor and his short-term memory is spotty. He suffered extensive nerve damage and keeping his balance is difficult. \r\n\r\nRay is not angry that his assailants were never found. He’s not even bitter that the attack happened. Now, his focus is elsewhere. He knows the way he lived is nothing but a pleasant memory. But now, stuck with the hand dealt him, he’s happy to give everything left of him away. His nieces and nephews come by and visit regularly, and he’s filled with joy each time. He spoils them with money and with his love. He tells them stories which never fail to bring a smile. \r\n\r\nIt’s hard to watch an uncle be prematurely and unfairly turned into a frail grandpa years before his time. But nobody else could ever play the role as well as Ray.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7th4sblqbf5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.83656,41.89124]}},{"properties":{"name":"Reaction","description":"Posted by RammsteinThat title caught your eye, no? It has nothing to do with the actual post. Turn back now.\r\n\r\nI have two kinds of opinions on The Big Easy: These photos reinforced both of them. \r\n\r\nHonestly, most of these pictures didn\\'t interest me in the least. And speaking in relative sobriety, I know why. New Orleans is a city which assigns no value or weight to modesty. It\\'s a loud, in your face, sodden place to live - that\\'s just fine. But growing up as I did, I can\\'t attach anything noble or particularly worthwhile to the celebration. I\\'m in the minority on this, I know, but something about a celebration which demands being an attention-whore just didn\\'t sit quite right with me. I could give two shits about the lude behavior and drunken debauchery - I\\'m no prude, in fact we\\'ll get to that - but I personally could not stomach going to Mardi Gras unless dragged. But that\\'s only me - I\\'m probably too introverted and shy to truly appreciate its splendor. I have no doubt it\\'s a great representation of a truly unique culture - it\\'s just not one I think I could embrace. Therefore, the biggest reaction to one of the pictures was, \"Ha, guy in a muscle suit, small dick - funny.\" \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, were it a necessity for me to go and indulge, I have no doubt that I could indulge to the max. Consumption to limit, and as my BAC rises as I write this (and as I planned it to) I can easily see why it\\'s such a celebrated event. Because let\\'s face it - which is more fun: Celebrating Ascension Sunday or celebrating Mardi Gras - the festival of decadence? My vote goes towards the latter. \r\n\r\nFrom the photos I could see how attending would be akin to entering a strange and dark universe. Floating in a drunken stupor in the middle of a whirlwind; New Orleans the torrent would sweep me away, an unfettered binge before the fast of the Holy Month (week?)(season?)(my confirmation class eludes me). The backdrop of the unique architecture and the foreground of creatures and ghouls...and the errant pair of breasts - that\\'d be quite a sight for eyes under the influence. \r\n\r\nI guess the question how these photos affected me hinges upon one thing: What state (or lack there of) I see them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7th4sn0crcm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03971,41.46371]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Sheffield Housing Projects","description":"Posted by Rammstein<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/Picture_005.jpg\">\"Nah, dude - we can\\'t do to this place what we did to the old place. We\\'ll make a little schedule and keep it looking nice. I know that sounds gay, but we\\'ll do it.\" \r\n\r\n- Pat Rohde\r\n\r\nThis is the quote which has been remunating in my head the entire day. I\\'m not sure what it was about this morning which made me realize that I\\'m, again, living in an absolute shithole - perhaps it was my unusual lack of hangover - but I was incensed before my day even began. \r\n\r\nNormally, I\\'m quite apathetic about such things. Nobody has ever confused me for a neat-freak. But at some point, you just have to say, \"C\\'mon!\" \r\n\r\nI go out of my way to avoid creating clutter and messes. As bad as it sounds, I generally eat off paper plates with disposable silverware, since I know that even if I stack the dishwasher, nobody will unstack it for months. Some might say, \"Well, take the initiative and keep the place up.\" Thanks for the insight, but I\\'ve tried that. I\\'ve taken painstaking effort to clean up after my behemoth roomates. I pitch the garbage, clean the pots and pans - but at some point, you acquiese, give into the flawed machine, and just say \"fuck it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s so aggrivating about this is we\\'ve been through this once - we trashed the last house so bad we were driven out, literally, by a plague of mother fuckin\\' fruit flies, cockroaches, and racoons. Firm resolutions were made to share the upkeep of our new abode. \r\n\r\nBut the anger is fleeting, because I too know my role in this whole mess. It wasn\\'t like I was running around in an apron insisting my roomates use a coaster when they enjoyed an adult beverage. In fact, I was generally 10 beers ahead of them. I\\'ve spit on the floor. I\\'ve thrown bottles and cans. I\\'ve been less than accurate in drunken attempts at pissing. \r\n\r\nI guess it just goes to show you that clutter and unkemptness is an inherent part of being a 22 year old male. Frat kids claim they\\'re undying love for their house one minute and throw up on the porch the next. We\\'ll live with the mess we\\'ve created.\r\n\r\nBut, just in case - anybody know where they\\'re charging cheap rent? <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7th4shcvv5v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04472,41.48922]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tim Eberhard","description":"Posted by RammsteinIn the Greek legend, Icarus forgot that his wings were not real and tragedy befell him. \r\n\r\nTim Eberhard used to have wings. As a fourty-something wrestling coach who had spent his whole life alone, he had plenty of time to build his wings by doing lat pull downs from dusk \\'til dawn. His team always thought if he ever fell out of an airplane, he could glide to safety on the width of his back. \r\n\r\nRather than find somebody to share himself with, he prefered instead to give himself away. No request for money would ever be denied. He gave away his time and resources at work and he gave away every ounce of strength in the gym when he came home. Though they brought him temporary salvation, his identity was that of a broken man who was slowly disappearing. \r\n\r\nAt night, he used to sit and drink iced tea while editing wrestling videos for his team. He would do this until afternoon the next day. When he could no longer sit upright, he\\'d sleep for an hour or two, only to go right back at it. Other nights, he would sit and sob. He\\'d often forgo meals because his torpidity had no interest in food. There were also days when he didn\\'t leave bed. \r\n\r\nBut he still had those wings. Those massive lats in which he took pride.\r\n\r\nSeveral months ago, Tim met somebody and they became engaged. His demeanor improved and his habits began to tilt towards healthy.  \r\n\r\nI saw Tim recently. The wings were gone. He was one of the few who didn\\'t succumb to hubris. He decided to strive for new horizons, and this time, the wings weren\\'t necessary.\r\n\r\nWe\\'re all happy for him.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7th4sgm5c61"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.84067,41.90263]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valpo at a Glance (Chocolate Shop Observations)","description":"Posted by Rammstein<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> ***Honestly, I do NOT think this about the town. I must have had a 4 foot stick up my ass the day I wrote this. Don\\'t take this with a grain of salt, take with an entire fucking bag.\r\n\r\nThe town - a seperate entity from the University which sustains it. It\\'s weather dependent; it\\'s all about perspective. It could be a sleepy Indiana town bustling with wholesome life, a lower income step up from the trailer, or the setting of a strange noir. But today, the weather is bleak, a lumberyard screams working class. Fat people waddle into the town hall, birth certificates in hand, to make ammends for their failed attempt at coitus interuptus and tie the knot the way their parents did: With a loaded twelve guage to their backs. The town uses cosmetics to hide the hard truth - the boutiques, the fancy new crosswalks - they can\\'t hide the red on the back of this city\\'s neck. Unmuffled half tons roar down the street. At three p.m. the bars force feed their addicted patrons. \r\n\r\nThere\\'s a charm to this town, alright: It\\'s the most charming place in the world to see in a rearview mirror.
