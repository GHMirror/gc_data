But in 1963 the Country Music Association announced it\\'s plans to build a Country Music Hall of Fame Museum on Music Rowe in Nashville. That same year the state of Tennessee chartered the Country Music Foundation. The CMF was a non-profit, educational organization that was charged with operating the museum. The original museum opened on April 1, 1967 and closed on December 31, 2000. The new 37 million dollar museum (seen above) opened on May 17, 2001. Jimmie Rogers, Hank Williams, and Fred Rose are just of the few who are in the Hall of Fame Museum.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlrgxrlf97"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.776957,36.158211]}},{"properties":{"name":"Franklin Battlefield (future National Park)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ConfederateCemetery.com\" href=\"http://www.ConfederateCemetery.com\">Tellinghistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/baf222.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The Country Club of Franklin Golf Course has been purchased by private preservation groups in Williamson County.

Despite his ordinary heritage, he built The Hermitage in Nashville, a stunning Ante-bellum plantation now restored as a museum dedicated to Old Hickory. In addition to revolving exhibits, a film on the history of the President and costumed tour guides, visitors will certainly want to see the first Hermitage cabins, where the former penniless orphan and future political leader and his beloved wife, Rachel, lived before achieving financial and political stability. \n\nDesigned in the Greek Revival style, The Hermitage was erected in 1819. Many prominent people of the early nineteenth century visited The Hermitage, including the Marquis de Lafayette (May 1825). Rachel died in 1828 and was buried in the Hermitage gardens on the east side of the home. Shortly after her death, Jackson was inaugurated the seventh president of the United States and served two terms. In 1834, while he was in Washington, the Hermitage was severely damaged by fire. In 1837, Jackson had the house rebuilt with the front of the home was painted white to conceal the smoke that blackened the bricks. Jackson died in 1845 and was buried in the gardens next to his beloved Rachel.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlrgwe0971"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.616554,36.213809]}},{"properties":{"name":"Winstead Hill","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ConfederateCemetery.com\" href=\"http://www.ConfederateCemetery.com\">Tellinghistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/699312235_2a9d13f5a8.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/700182190_2371a8c662.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/313481001_5e7d81ca51.jpg?v=0\">John Bell Hood stood at this hill looking north toward downtown Franklin on the afternoon of November 30, 1864.
