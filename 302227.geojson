Yellow flags were posted as 2-foot seas came ashore. Some swimmers said bait fish could be seen in the water.\n\nLifestar emergency services flew Corey Brooks, who was suffering reportedly from a 12- to 14-inch gash in his right calf, to St. Mary\\'s Medical Center in West Palm Beach. Brooks underwent surgery Sunday evening at St. Mary\\'s, according to his mother, Tammie Brooks of Port St. Lucie.\n\nReportedly, her son had more than 100 stitches in his leg and was resting in the facility\\'s intensive care unit after surgery.\n\nTammie Brooks said Corey had gone to the beach with family friends when she received the \"bad news he was bit by a shark. They told me he was airlifted here,\" she said, standing outside of St. Mary\\'s.\n\nShe said she was told her son had been playing in waist-deep water and thought one of his friends was pulling on his leg underwater. Then he saw a shark had bitten him and he ran crying for help.\n\nA lifeguard supervisor said guards were unable to forewarn swimmers because the attack occurred too far down the beach from the posted lifeguard stations to monitor the shark siting. Lifeguards were informed of the attack about 1 p.m., when a guard was told the boy was bitten as he swam in the surf with more than 20 other children.\n\nLifeguards then quickly called everyone onto the beach from the water and stabilized the boy.\n\nJoe Kostygan, chief lifeguard for Martin County, said the attack occurred \"quite a way down the beach\" from a guard station. \"It was out of the guarded area at the extreme end of the public beach.\"\n\n\nHe said, \"It\\'s been a heck of while at least 10 or 12 years\" since he could remember another attack there. The incident was probably \"a chance encounter.\"\n\n\"Shark attacks are such a chance encounter you could be looking right at it,\" and not see it, Kostygan said. Most swimmers were packed pretty close to shore. \"They would have noticed him if he was out further,\" he said of Corey.\n\nCorey was conscious and \"pretty calm\" but in pain, said Martin County Fire Rescue firefighter/paramedic T.J. Guzzi and fire medic Doug Young.\n\n\"He had a pretty significant bite, it did appear serious. He was stable, but we took him to St. Mary\\'s just to make sure,\" Young said.

He had come to spend the day with his aunt and uncle, Diana and Vance Flosenzier of Mobile, Alabama, his siblings and his cousins.\nVance was on the beach when he heard someone yell, \"Shark\" and a scream. When he turned toward the water he saw a growing pool of blood near where his daughters and nephew, Jessie, were playing. Then he saw the 200-lb, 6 1/2 foot bull shark and it clamped it\\'s massive jaws down on Jessie\\'s arm. Vance ran into the water and grabbed the base of the shark\\'s tail, essentially rendering it powerless. Thus began a life and death tug-of-war over Jessie.\n\nOn the second tug, the shark came free. Little did Vance know, that this meant the shark had severed Jessie\\'s arm, approximately midway between the shoulder and elbow. In addition, a large piece of his right thigh was torn out. Jessie fell back into the arms of another swimmer, who essentially saved Jessie from drowning.\n\nIn the short time it took his rescuers to get him to shore, Jessie had lost so much blood that there was essentially none flowing from the gaping wounds. Jessie lost consciousness. His aunt, took beach towels and tied off his arm and leg and then began CPR on him.\t\nA call to 911 brought a helicopter from Baptist Flight to the scene. When the helicopter arrived with Dr. Greg Smith and paramedic Chris Warnock, who asked about Jessie\\'s arm. At that time, no one had any idea what had happened to it. Because saving Jessie\\'s life was paramount, they did a \"scope and run\" where they did not do anything procedures on the scene, but rather scoped up Jessie and ran with him to the hospital.\nWith the wind the helicopter fought on the way to the beach now behind them, they arrived at Baptist Hospital in just a couple of minutes. During this time, Jessie\\'s uncle wrestled the shark to shore, where it was shot four times by local ranger Jared Klein. A volunteer fire fighter, Tony Thomas, used an expandable baton to pry open the shark\\'s mouth with a pair of hemostats and retrieve Jessie\\'s arm. Wrapped in moist towels and packed in ice, the arm was taken by ambulance to the hospital.\nEven as they were flying, there was grave concern for Jessie. He had no pulse and was clinically dead.\n\nWith the arrival of Jessie\\'s arm, doctors had two very complex issues in front of them. The first was obviously the most important thing and that was saving Jessie\\'s life. He had essentially lost most of his blood and was without a pulse for almost 30 minutes. Since it was bitten of fairly cleanly, plastic surgeon Dr. Ian Rogers had a good place to start. After over 11 hours of surgery, the doctors had successfully re-attached his arm.\n\nAt this point Jessie was alive, with his arm re-attached. However, going so long without blood, there was likely to be damage to all of his organs including his brain. Although he was alive, the doctor had no idea to the extent of the damage caused by the massive blood lost.\n\nBy the beginning of August, Jessie had improved to the point where he was focusing on the objects around him. Although still not clear the extent to which Jessie is aware of things around him, he is continues to make a steady recovery. On August 12, 2001 he was released from the hospital and returned home in an ambulance.\n\nJessie suffered severe brain damage as a result of this attack and loss of blood.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.baldwincountynow.com/articles/2009/04/15/local_news/doc49e522072ef8c628986250.txt\">Read about how the boy\\'s arm was found and reattached.</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"aaj6ed380331"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.07283,30.374652]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jevan Wright Killed by Shark, 09/00","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/Great_White_Shark,_Neptune_Island,_Australia_(1).jpg\">Black Point, near Elliston, AustraliaSeptember 25, 2000\n\npanic in the media and among the Australian public in general grew considerably when another fatal attack occurred in the same region only two days after the first attack.

The close proximity (both in time and place) of the two attacks suddenly focused public attention on the possibility of a ‘rogue’ shark, one that was specifically targeting humans, such as had been portrayed in the film Jaws. In response to the two attacks in South Australia there were calls for the shark to be hunted down and killed. So great was the hysteria that the writer of Jaws felt compelled to come to the defence of sharks.

The civil contractor, who works for the United States government, was spear fishing together with a friend who is an ex-diver for the Navy. Suddenly, while his friend was diving, Emory, who was close to the shore, felt a great amount of water rush up at him.\n\n“I thought it was simply a sudden surge, when instantly I felt as if I had been hit by a car or struck by a baseball bat on the leg. That’s when I realized that a shark had attacked me and held my left leg between its jaws to devour me. I punched its head with all my might, but it was as if I’d hit concrete covered in sandpaper,” he says.\n\nEmory goes on to say that in his case, there was a lot of blood in the water, and the shark actually retreated some distance away, lying in wait. His friend came to his aid, passing close to the shark without being attacked by it. Once outside the water he helped Emory apply a tourniquet, using a belt to try to contain the hemorrhaging a bit.\n\n“The wound was very big, I was bleeding, my blood pressure dropped very much, and I thought I was going to die. I felt as if I were dreaming, as if all that was a nightmare”, says Emory.\n\nWith the help of his friend and others, the injured man was retrieved from the water and transported by speedboat to the local military hospital.\n\n“I was stabilized at the hospital, but I thought I would lose my leg. The wound was very deep. They told me later that you could see my bone”, Emory remembers. “Luckily, I was transferred by jet to Fort Lauderdale, Florida where an ambulance drove me to the Aventura Hospital.

The sea was not rough I don‘t understand what brought the shark in the area.\n\n“The whole family is sad. My brother was an avid surfer whose life revolved around swimming.”\n\nWild Coast Guards managing director Khaya Mjo expressed shock at the attacks, which are becoming increasingly common in the area.\n\nMjo said the latest incident brought to four the number of people who had been attacked in the area.\n\nHe said sharks fed on turtles and had poor eyesight. “It might be that sharks mistake surfers for turtles, especially if you are paddling.”\n\nAbout 300 metres from the shore there is an area known as Shark Point.\n\nMjo, who served as a lifesaver at Port St Johns for some years, said: “I have never seen such gruesome attacks.”\n\nHe said there had been a surge in the number of surfers and this could be attracting the sharks.\n\nThe attacks have forced the Wild Coast Guards, the local municipality and the department of transport‘s maritime division to investigate alternatives for securing the beach.\n\nThe possibility had been mooted that shark nets could be erected. However, the KwaZulu Natal Sharks Board was not empowered to operate in the Eastern Cape.\n\nThere were other negatives to the shark net proposal. Mjo said the rough seas could easily damage the nets.\n\nThere was also a proposal for using electrodes to repel sharks, but environmentalist would “shoot it down” as this would also affect other species.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"aaj6ed3fyzv8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[29.5281600952,-31.6583495084]}},{"properties":{"name":"Madi Taff, 15, bitten June 1st 2008","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.therowes.net\" href=\"http://www.therowes.net\">Endofpath</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/06/2/bilde_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Madi Taff, 15, was bitten by a shark on June 1st 2008 while vacationing in Cherry Grove, South Carolina with her family.

A bull shark closed on the remora but in the low visibility bit Erich instead,\" she said.\n\nThe shark\\'s teeth went to the bone and Ritter was rushed to a hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he underwent an arterial graft and possibly a skin graft on the calf wound, she said.\n\n\"They were really pushing the envelope,\" Levine said. \"This is one of those things that can happen when you\\'re working with big animals and it was an accident.\"\n\nBut Dr. Sam Gruber, a University of Miami shark expert who worked with Ritter in the 1990s, said Ritter\\'s methods were not accepted by the scientific community and called him \"an accident waiting to happen.\"\n\n\"He has been getting more and more fearless, or some would say bold.

But even so, the incident was the first proven shark attack in the area.\n\nAccording to Sharks Board books there were claims of three incidents – in 1951, 1954 and 2004 – but there had been no hard evidence.\n\nIronically, it was Masiza who was attacked in 2004.

It is worth noting that one of the recommendations from the International Shark Attack File on how to decrease the already small chance of becoming a victim of a shark attack, is ‘Don’t go into waters containing sewage’.”\n\nBut Port St Johns municipal manager Zola Hewu denied that there was spillage of sewage into the ocean. “I am not sure what brought the shark to this area but it is definitely not the quality of the water,” he said. “If that was the case then there would have been more (attacks).”\n\nBangilizwe , of Mtonjana in Port St Johns – described by family and friends as a dedicated lifeguard who put other people’s lives before his own – was “a soldier at sea, very brave”, said his friend and trainer Thozamile Ndabeni yesterday.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"aaj6edbm0nx3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[29.5053291321,-31.6730331005]}},{"properties":{"name":"Snorkeller Killed by Shark 02/04","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/blue_htm_txt_BLUEbuttermilk.gif\">Near Sharm, EgyptA snorkeller died of blood loss after being bitten by a shark in Coral Bay, Sharm, Egypt at the weekend.\n\nThe Egyptian man was snorkelling close to shore with a group of holiday-makers on Saturday 14 February when the attack happened.\n\nThe injured man made it back to shore and was taken to hospital where he later died of shock due to blood loss.\n\nA member of South Sinai Divers Association (SSDA) confirmed the details of the incident. \"This is a one-off attack, and the last incident in Egypt was 6 - 7 years ago and was widely reported.\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"aaj6ed9vme4n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.310303,27.790491]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stephen Perkins, 52, bitten on August 31st, 2008","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.therowes.net\" href=\"http://www.therowes.net\">Endofpath</a><img src=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/graphics/2008/09/01/eashark101.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Stephen Perkins, 52, became the first person to be bitten by a shark of the UK coast.
