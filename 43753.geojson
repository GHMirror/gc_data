The planting itself took place over a one-week period in late May 1997.  Residents themselves determined where the trees were sited -- on their own property as well as on public land -- and were actively involved in the planting as well.  In conjunction with the 1997 show \"Joseph Beuys Multiples\" at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.  Project was coordinated by independent curator Todd Bockley with support from the Visual Arts Department, as well as the Education Department\\'s Teen Programs and Community Programs.\n\nMore Info:\nhttp://www.walkerart.org/archive/9/A343D1DFBAD672436161.htm<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6w0wv2fkgqh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.60104,47.379522]}},{"properties":{"name":"A Slow, Sad Decline","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/000000z013.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/edge1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/edge2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/edge4.jpg\">Edgewood Plaza, designed by for Joseph Eichler was once a jewel of a small shopping center, opening 1958 in his original California style.  When it opened, it began with a Lucky\\'s Supermarket as its anchor store surrounded by a collection of small shops. The Edgewood mall also housed Joseph Eichler\\'s headquarters and stands today as his only commercial shopping center. \r\n\r\nIn recent years the center has had African City Alive, Albertson\\'s supermarket, Country Side Delicatessen, Century Liquors, Moon\\'s One Hour Cleaners, a golf store, House of Wigs, a hair salon, a shoe repair store, Formico\\'s Pizza, Brother\\'s Farm Fresh Produce,a Shell Gas Station and the Maharishi Vedic School. \r\n\r\nIn the past 50 years, however, only minor improvements have been made and the mall has become dilapitated.  Some have estimated that sales at the center have dropped as much as 60 percent in the last decade.  The Albertson’s which has operated there for many years has had a mediocre reputation at best.  On one Internet bulletin board, a person called it \"the worst major grocery store\" he or she had ever visited.  \r\n\r\nAs Palo Alto Councilman Larry Klein told the Daily News, \"in emergencies we shopped there,\" said Councilman Larry Klein, who lives in the area. \"Our shopping was limited to things like milk and orange juice and batteries. It was in awful shape.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6w0wuscz3sn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.12558,37.44836]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cuisine of Thailand - Little Orchids","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://igargoyle.com/\" href=\"http://igargoyle.com/\">Nym</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/j_dX_YUVOIXKttPw9Y96BAJzPhr1RHzJb_u_bHE_XFRRQlA98OZzXskz8LEyLdP2R411STDkIUOvvJgC_I3Y_R6lnWlOGAMnE9BiYHzsGu0__2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 21614 Ventura Blvd, Woodland Hills, CA 91364Decent food, not much for atmosphere.

I was wandering around Ueno Park, leaving the crowd of people and Hanami parties behind, when you tapped my shoulder and asked me to take a photo of you standing in front of a temple, on top of the hill. You spoke charmingly with a British accent, Chinese-born and living in London. You were amazingly backpacking through Japan on your own for a month. We shared stories of our trips, and then you showed a map of your adventure plans. We swapped emails and addresses. We took pictures of ourselves. When I got back home I received a postcard from you in Nagoya - and later, stories of a dodgy hotel in Osaka, the peril of riding bikes in Kyoto, among other life\\'s off-kilter experiences. I sent winded emails of little things about me, hoping you\\'ll get in touch with me when you get home, but somehow you didn\\'t. Now it\\'s springtime again and I\\'m thinking of going to London. I want to give you a call when I do make it to the swanky shopping district of London - and hopefully, you\\'ll remember me, still, after the long-distance spell. But my nerves are weak now and \"all the umbrellas in London couldn\\'t stop this rain.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6w0wv15xgib"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.77459,35.714462]}},{"properties":{"name":"Humber Rust Tower We Kill You","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.wekillyou.net\" href=\"www.wekillyou.net\">Wekillyou</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/827dd08f00f6d70abfbce7c8b6691563.jpg\">Our Favorite<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6w0wuvxzav1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.609423,43.727134]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kings Cross, Australia","description":"Posted by Burk504<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/2_8_2_Kings_Cross.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/kings_cross_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/lost_jack_dad_pool.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/KajaMAlcoholic.jpg\">king\\'s cross, australiaKings Cross, Sydney, Australia is the place where Jack\\'s dad, Christian Shephard, was found dead in an alley.
