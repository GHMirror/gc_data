Unfortunately, the gallery was having a PRIVATE EVENT and I couldn\\'t go in. Incredibly lame. I was so annoyed! \n\nThree recent interactive drawing installations by Camille Utterback, Untitled 5 (2004), Untitled 6 (2005), and Alluvial (2007), invite playful interaction using a mirroring device that allows visitors to recognize an abstract representation of their own movements within a projected picture plane. The algorithms required to successfully render the desired effects are anything but simple. Utterback’s flawlessly designed interfaces do not allow the technology to overshadow the aesthetic quality and content of the work. By limiting the scope of each project to a finite range of exceedingly well-structured parameters, the artist ensures that her installations are easily accessible, revealing their complexities over time.

The French documentarian and cinema-essayist reflects on politics, art and culture at the start of the new millennium. In November 2001, Marker became intrigued, as did many other Parisians, by the sudden appearance of alluring portraits of grinning yellow cats on various public surfaces. Marker\\'s cinematic efforts to document the mysterious materializations of this charming feline throughout Paris are a recurring theme of GRINNING CAT.\n\nThis record of Marker\\'s cinematic peregrinations throughout the city - visually energized by his free-association montage style - chronicles strikes, demonstrations, memorials, election campaigns, celebrity scandals, international political incidents, and a seemingly endless variety of political protests. The personalized commentary running throughout GRINNING CAT offers the simultaneously learned and witty reflections of the filmmaker, now in his early eighties, on both the contemporary and historical implications of these varied events and personalities. And, as the mysterious cats begin to appear amidst the banners and signs in political demonstrations, Marker concludes the film with thoughts on the vital importance of such expressions of imagination in our public lives, echoing the May ‘68 slogan that \"La poésie est dans la rue\" (\"Poetry is in the street\"). \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tl5w6xu29"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.122023,42.374353]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cinema, Science, and Invention lecture @ the MoS 4 May 2007","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/3488_90_90_scale,crop_guest.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/40646519@N00/522396060/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/218/522396060_ec3f64c045.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 1 Science Park, Boston, MA 02114with John Underkoffler, founder and chief scientist of Oblong Industries, Inc., and science and technology advisor to Minority Report, The Hulk, Aeon Flux, and other film productions.

This presentation is part of the ongoing series Whitehead Institute Lecture Series.\n[view all Lecture listings]\nVisit the Whitehead Institute website\n\nOver the last few decades, the male-specific Y chromosome, the runt of the genomic litter, has been diagnosed as terminally ill. Some scientists declared that in another 10 million years or so the Y will be gone altogether, taking males along with it. However, Dr. Page and his colleagues have found that the Y has a unique and astonishing capacity to repair itself. Learn about their research as they continue to analyze the Y chromosomes of humans and other species, gaining deeper insights into the Y\\'s architectural beauty, evolutionary dynamism, and critical role in male fertility.\n\nThis is the third event in The House that Darwin Built series.\n\nDarwin\\'s theory of natural selection has transformed our understanding of the living world, down to the smallest molecules. Today, scientists use these theories to understand a host of complex biological problems.

The implication of wrong data in wrong hands, or at\n   the wrong time, during disaster response can result in things like\n   panic, identity theft and even have implications on national security.\n   In summary, Chamindra and his team would love to meet you, and hope\n   you\\'ll share any thoughtful ideas on how Sahana might evolve new\n   solutions, promoting adoption among larger NGOs and Government,\n   giving them more confidence in their ability to share data, in turn\n   improving timely relief to victims!\n2) Allan Doyle of <a href=\"http://museum.mit.edu/mwow\">http://museum.mit.edu/mwow</a> has made tremendous progress\n   with the MIT Museum project\\'s demo Nokia 770 handheld over the last\n   few months, providing a self-guided walking tour of MIT\\'s core,\n   where you can choose from nearby polished videos to watch along your\n   way, based on Wifi-tracking of your location.

The mission was more difficult than she could have imagined. The terrain was rough, the animals evaded her with frustrating ease, and what sparse knowledge existed of wild chimpanzees offered little insight.\nMany researchers perceived chimpanzees as primitive, simple creatures, but Jane saw something else altogether. The animals she observed displayed high intelligence, emotional responses, and complex social behavior. In fact, Goodall found striking similarities between chimpanzee and human behavior. In everything from warfare to parenting, facial expressions to displays of affection, the two species appeared to be closely related.\nWatching the Gombe chimp clan interact at close range in Jane Goodall\\'s Wild Chimpanzees, it\\'s hard to deny the connection. Poignant footage captures the great apes in their natural environment: playing games to pass the time, fighting with family members, vying for attention, and lounging in the grass on a hot summer day. Surprisingly humanlike, their mannerisms and interactions are so familiar as to be remarkable.\nThis film recounts the story of Goodall\\'s inspirational journey, from those first months of doubt and struggle to the breakthroughs that placed her among the luminaries of modern science. Informed by an open mind and years of close study, Goodall\\'s work redefined human understanding of chimpanzees and, ultimately, of mankind itself. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tl5yvwqes"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06956,42.36733]}},{"properties":{"name":"Imax Deep Sea 3-D","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/deepsea3D_poster_250px.jpg\">1 Central Wharf, Boston, MA 02112I\\'ve been meaning to Take Vigo here for a long, long time.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tl5zhnzx5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.051195,42.358897]}},{"properties":{"name":"Inconvenient Truth Screening @ the MoS, 14 march 2007","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/92203585@N00/378293806/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/150/378293806_aceb85b2fc_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1 Science Park, Boston, MA 02114An Inconvenient Truth Film Screening\nMarch 14, 2007\nLecture\nwith Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists; Leith Sharp, director of the Harvard Green Campus Initiative.

When the agent isn’t planning the killer’s next hit she\\'s cleaning his apartment or rolling around fantasizing about him even though the two never meet. The genre aspects take a back seat to Chris Doyle’s fantastic camera work and the amusing subplot surrounding Takeshi Kaneshiro as a mute who breaks into closed lunch stands and forces passersby to be his patrons.\n\n\nArea Premiere!\nHannah Takes The Stairs at 9:30   Buy Tickets\n(2007) dir Joe Swanberg w/Greta Gerwig, Kent Osborne, Andrew Bujalski, Ry Russo-Young, Mark Duplass, Todd Rohal, Tipper Newton [84 min]\n\nThe much-touted new wave of independent filmmaking continues with this outstanding, intimate romantic comedy. The alluring Greta Gerwig stars as the precocious Hannah, a fresh college graduate who falls for one, and then the other, of a pair of friends at a Chicago company where she is interning. HANNAH sports all of the hallmarks of the so-called “Mumblecore” movement: wry dialogue, improvised performances, a frank depiction of modern relationships and a wistful realism. Something of a romantic shaggy-dog story HANNAH is episodic, rambling and funny as it follows Hannah on her quest to end her ‘chronic dissatisfaction’ and find a boyfriend worthy of her.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tl5vraxs6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.122023,42.374353]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sevengaits Gallery closing Aug 2, 2007. 7PM","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/0/Picture_200.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 12 Crane St Southbridge, MA<b>Update</b>\nThis was just too far away.

From bouncy dance floor music to abstract compositions commissioned by dance troupes, Morgan Packard is a very well respected electronic sound master craftsman.
