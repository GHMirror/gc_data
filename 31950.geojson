Megan and Her Frustrations at Wal-mart","description":"Posted by AndybrdIt is the first Sunday of Spring Break, and five friends are up and getting ready to drive down to Virginia for a week.  They are currently in Ohio.  They get up, have breakfast, dress, re-pack the car, and are ready to leave.  There are two cars.  The reason for this with only five people is that one of the girls, Megan, will be driving home to North Carolina for the second week, while the others, (Mike, Stephen, Andrea, and Katelyn), will be returning to the north in various places.  \n        At about nine in the morning, all the people are in the cars, ready to go.  There is a decent covering of snow on the ground, and all are hopeful for warmer weather.  The cars make it down one short and sloped road, and proceed up the other when the first car starts to skid.  The road is very snowy.  All three girls are riding together.  The two get out to try and push the car, as does the one boy who is not driving.  They manage to get the car up the hill, but notice something that is possibly devastating.  There is a flat tire!  Eventually the group manages to pull into a nearby church parking lot.  They were not even a mile down the road, and disaster had already struck.\n        Well, the tire had to be changed.  Megan, who owned the car, only had a donut, so a place had to be found to fix the tire.  Being Sunday, the only place open was a Wal-Mart.  So, Mike changed the tire while everyone watched, since only one other had ever changed a tire before (and it was not the other guy in the group), and then the group moved to the Wal-Mart, carefully and slowly. While Mike was changing the tire, he didn\\'t really listen to the others.  He said \"I know what I am doing,\" even though several of the people said \"You are putting the bolts on backwards.\"  Eventually he realized what he was doing wrong, listened to the smart people, and the group was on its way.\nOnce there, the group found out that the tire and brake place in this Super Wal-Mart had a long wait.  Not only had there been a flat tire, but also now the slightly irritated group had to wait an unknown number of hours. Megan also had a broken headlight.  With that, she broke.  Well, not entirely.  Her break down actually waited until she called her mother to tell her what happened.  While on the phone, her frustration sprung forth, and she cried.  Who better to vent to than one’s parents, after all.  Once that was done, the group tried to figure out how to keep themselves occupied, and tried to not worry about getting to Virginia before it was too late to check-in at the condo they would be staying in.  And when one is in a super shopping center, it is not all that hard to keep one’s self entertained.\n        Or is it?  This little group learned that there is only so much to look at when none are in the mood to shop.  Some looking around was accomplished, but little was bought.  There really seemed to be nothing to do.  Then again, it was Ohio.  Sometimes, there really isn’t anything to do there.  As a result, the group ended up teaching Stephen how to play rummy.  Eventually, three hours were wiled away, and the tire was fixed.  Megan was able to get over most of her frustration, and this sad little group once again spent precious college life hours in a Wal-Mart.  Just goes to show that you can’t really escape that store, even if it is a flat tire that takes you there.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vtdja96ru9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.7799,41.09798]}},{"properties":{"name":"2. Soap Box Woman","description":"Posted by AndybrdThe first day of the trip, and the group is in Colonial Williamsburg, the one time capital of the state of Virginia, and current site of a living history museum. Here they explore the town, and see what they can see. Much is interesting, but little is odd. Except for one woman. She is not dressed in period clothing, suggesting that she does not work there. She is right outside the old Capitol, the original building in which many governmental decisions were made. She stands there, wearing a bright blue jacket, talking to another person. Suddenly, she stands on a box, and though few people are around, and only one person is paying her any attention, she starts a speech. The voice with which she speaks carries across the field next to the building, authoritative and knowing. Yet no one was listening to her, except for the man with whom she had been speaking. Here she is, on top of her soapbox, and the group is just walking away, while many others simply ignore her. She doesn’t speak for long, which adds to the idea that she was just practicing, but for what, who knows? The place is full of history, with many people on soapboxes, and she may have been preparing to be another, though there was no point. Hearing her was just out of place, especially with the town and the reasons for which the group was there. There was no reason for a statement here, and yet she was preparing to make one. Guess that you never really know what to expect, especially in a living history museum.

Stephen's Driving Skills","description":"Posted by AndybrdIt is now the third full day of the trip. The group managed to make it to Virginia without further mishap, and with time to check into their rooms. A day was spent in Williamsburg, and another of random shopping and mini golf. Katelyn froze that night, since it was chilly, but she has a habit of being cold. Stephen, who had the better car, and no recent flat tires, had been driving all week. He really doesn’t mind. In fact, he preferred to drive over anyone else, since it was his car. He is a decent driver, though can sometimes enjoy going allover the place.\nThe day started kind of gray, but was not overly wet. A few good hours had been spent exploring Jamestown, and the fort that had once been there. Now the group had moved onto Yorktown, that historic battle-site that changed the course of history. The group arrived there, went into the  visitor’s center, and participated in a short walking tour of the immediate field. Here, they learned of a driving tour. It is one that people can take on their own, following signs to important parts of the battle field. All in the group became excited, and decided to do it. Everyone piled into the car, and started. The first stop had a sign, which Mike read, and a short drive area. No one knew what was done there.  \"Come on, Stephen, there might be something there to see.\" encouraged Megan. He had already partially turned around, but the others put in their voices with Megan\\'s, so he did a really quick loop, and slightly sped down it to find that it was just a turn around area. He turned around, and drove onto the next informative sign. The trail takes visitors through wooded areas, where the road in places is only one lane, and can be rather winding. Stephen, deciding to make things more interesting, drives somewhat erratically down parts of the road. He even did some of those irritating little stop-and-gos, where he just hit the break so that the car jerked.  It was nothing too seriously bad, but enough to make sure that we were awake. After enough \"acks!!\" and \"Stop that!\" from people, especially the three girls in the back, Stephen finally let up on the sudden stops, though his driving continued erratically in other ways.\nHe zoomed between the signs, allowing all to have their chance at the reading at first. At one point, when Andrea was reading, the entire group just laughed, because the sign was long, and it was just funny.  The sign was just about a soldier that had set up in that area, but it went on and on. She read everything. Even the small print, with the \"Information provided by the Historical Preservation Group of Virginia and Yorktown.\"  When she got to that, someone shouted \"drive!\" and the car took off, cutting her reading in the middle of a pointless sentence.\n There were many signs along the trail, so Stephen decided to zip between them.  He was in a hurry, mainly because he was running out of gas. The car that is, not him personally. He needed to find a gas station. At one point, a wrong turn was made. Eventually, the group finished the little tour. Then they decided to enter the actual town of Yorktown, mainly to try and find a gas station. The problem was, there wasn’t one to be found, and Stephen got a little lost. He was getting frantic, and his driving was getting a little more erratic. He was taking some corners rather sharply, and ended up taking a longer route to a gas station than was necessary. This let the others in the car see some of the local foliage as it rushed by the window. Eventually he found gas and calmed down, and his driving returned to normal.\nDriving with Stephen is always interesting. He will take the scenic route, but will start going faster once he is ready to be finished. His driving allowed the group to experience Yorktown in a quick paced and sometimes gut wrenching way. Perhaps he was trying to recreate the heart-pounding adrenaline rush of a battle, in his own little homage to the place. That and he really wanted gas. Whatever his reasons for his driving, he definitely made visiting this place of war an experience.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vtdje700oc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.51119,37.23265]}},{"properties":{"name":"Big Brother","description":"Posted by AndybrdThe government is always watching, especially in the seat of power.  Though maybe they aren’t watching as much as they claim to be.  Sometimes, it is amazing what people can get away with when given incentive.  They can create a bit of shock and humor with only a little bit of permanent marker.  And of course, with defacing public property.\n        Here it is, the fourth day of the trip, and the group is in Washington D.C., the capitol of our country.  The group doesn’t have much time here, so they all decide to just go to the Mall.  They get off the subway, walk up to the capitol, find they can’t really get in, and then decide to hit one of the Smithsonian buildings.  Of course, now they need to walk back down the Mall.  They have to cross a few streets to get to the museum that they decide to explore.  At one such road, they are stopped, since the light is green for the cars, and not for pedestrians.  At this stop, someone notices a camera, and a sign pointing out the camera.  The interesting thing about this is not that a traffic camera is being pointed out, but that someone has written graffiti on the sign.  Written in black marker is the famous line “Big Brother is Watching,” along with 1984. That someone actually had the guts to write what many people are thinking, and that it is still up there is rather amazing.  With a government that is greatly trampling the rights and freedoms of the people, there is a sign that openly criticizes it, located in its heart.  And no one had taken it down.  A total stranger, by writing on that sign, has caught at least five people’s attention, and made them think while on Spring Break.  Just proves that some people can still speak up, even if it is anonymously.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vtdjd68ciu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.02394,38.89023]}},{"properties":{"name":"Car Inspection","description":"Posted by AndybrdOn the final day of the trip, the little group decides to head to Virginia Beach.  This way, they get to see the ocean, not something common in the Midwest.  Of course, there is only so much to be done on a beach in March.  Especially when the temperature is only in the low fifties.  Something else was needed to attract the little group to this place.  What could that be, but a lighthouse.  Actually two, to be exact.  Not far down Virginia Beach is Cape Henry, were the settlers of Jamestown first landed.  Right near here was built a lighthouse.  It is actually the first public works building in America, though definitely not the oldest lighthouse.  And right next to it is a more recently built lighthouse.  This is something exciting, especially since several of the travelers had never been in a lighthouse.  The decision is made to go there.  The only problem is that the lighthouses are in the middle of an army base.  That meant that all weapons of mass destruction had to be left behind.\n        Luckily, the group didn’t have any, and the base is actually pretty easy to get on.  That may or may not be a good thing.  To enter, i.d.’s must be presented, and then the car must be given an inspection.  This is done by a group of security officers, who can very easily give people a hard time.  Fortunately, these men where in a good mood.  They readily made jokes, and did not succeed in scaring the group.  The older of the inspectors talked easily, and was very relaxed.  He even mentioned his wife a few times.  Of course, some of what he said was funny, which made the group smile.  Then another inspector kept asking why the people were smiling so much.  Part of it was probably nerves; part was just because it was an interesting experience.  The inspector’s were good-hearted, showing that there is some relaxation, even on an army base, but they were thorough, and did their job well, demonstrating that the army is not lax, and takes care when anyone gets near the base.  Even in a time of war, army personnel still show that they are just more people, who know how to do their jobs.  They didn’t miss a beat, even when Megan confused them by saying \"don\\'t take the pudding!\" (the lunch was in the trunk).  The inspectors replied with \"What pudding?\" and \"What are you talking about?\", but still continued their search.  Even near a beach, the military still does its job.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vtdj4hisaz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.99586,36.91531]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ghost Stories","description":"Posted by AndybrdOn the last night of the trip, the people decide to actually do something at night.  Most nights, they have just sat and played some games, but on this night, there was something that interested them all.  In Colonial Williamsburg, Ghost Tours are given at night.  Ghosts tend to prevail in old places, and sometimes it is fun to be spooked.  \n        On these tours, there is a guide that leads a group around a small area, carrying a lantern, and telling stories about the “ghosts” in Williamsburg.  Certain locations have different stories, and the whole thing is done in fun.  The stories are believed by some to be true, but are not told to try and convince people that ghosts actually exist.  The tour was hardly spooky, except for one thing that made a few people jump: the cat.\n        It is near the beginning of the tour.  The guide has is partially through her first story, telling of the odd occurrences that happened in a specific house.  A large group sits, listening to her stories in the night.  There is not much noise, when suddenly a little bell is heard.  It is not part of the story.  The noise is coming closer to the group, and closer, when suddenly a cat comes out of the darkness, straight for the group.  The bell is just the noise from its collar.  It comes straight up to the group, and just wants some attention.  It goes through the group several times, until it gets bored.  As the guide continues her stories in a humorously spooky voice, the cat goes into nearby bushes, when people aren’t watching, and suddenly shakes some of the branches.  The cat seems to do this at a few key moments in the story, lending some extra surprise to the tales.  \n        The guide finishes the stories in that spot, and the group moves on.  At another location, near an old church, she talks about two little boys, whose ghosts are often seen.  As she is telling how the boys are often seen playing in the one road, where they run along up to the church, one of the group members spots a grey blur out of the corner of her eye.  She wonders, and looks…and sees that it is only the cat following the group.  Or at least, that is what is thought. \"I think I just saw the cat again\" she whispers to Stephen.  \"I didn\\'t\" he replied, as did the others.  No one else seems to have seen the cat.  In a place and time where there is great talk of spirits and the dead, one can never be sure what he/she is seeing.  And that cat had some spooky good timing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vtdj572cud"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.72062,37.27296]}},{"properties":{"name":"Katelyn freezes","description":"Posted by Andybrd\n        When traveling with friends for long periods of time, tempers can start to flair.  This is especially true when someone is not comfortable or happy.  Katelyn was the main example here.  At the beach it was windy, and cold, since it was still winter.  Still, the five ate lunch on a bench on the boardwalk.  The girls were cold, though none so much as Katelyn.  She was not happy as a result, and let it be known.  She refused to go onto the sand and near the water, and just wanted to get inside.  Everyone else partially ignored her, which just made her mood worse.  As a result, while three of the other’s were frolicking in the sand, she and Andrea started up the boardwalk, with her leading the charge in a hurried and angry huff.  Katelyn didn’t even want to tell the other’s were she was headed, she just wanted to go.  The two were also keeping hold of Stephen’s drink, which she called him on her cell, said \"Your drink is by the stairs.  See it?  Good.  Bye.\", and left it by some of the stairs leading to the sand. This made Stephen upset.  Her actions brought the tension levels up, and let the group learn a little more about her.  When she is unhappy, even in a nice location, she will let it be known.  In this place, the wind turned her mood sour, and let tensions build between her and Stephen that were taken out by both on another member of the group.  Luckily, it was only a small tiff, which was resolved once the group was moving and inside.  The trip was thankfully not ruined, and then tension lessened once Katelyn was less cold, and Stephen got over his drink being left.  When the temperature is bad, tempers are bad, and that is especially true with Katelyn.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vtdj71ux9r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.97801,36.8538]}},{"properties":{"name":"Protestation and the Amazing Spinning White House","description":"Posted by AndybrdLater that day, the group finds itself outside of the White House, home of the President.  Here, there are important decisions made, and many people gather.  Tourists go to see it, bird’s poop on it, and politicians want to be in it.  It is the place where the loudest voice of the people resides, and where that person is separated from the people by a large black fence, cops, and armed secret service men.  People cannot easily get in, though many want their voices heard.  Those who try the hardest are sometimes the ones most ignored by the place.  These are the protestors.  Not just those who come up for marches, but those who actually set up camp outside and stay there, trying to take a stand.  There is one particular person, who has been there for a very long time.  He stands there, with a tent.  He speaks to those who question him, and tells them what he waits for.  He protests the war, the crimes committed against people, and encourages peace.  He has signs that call for an end to the violence, and that list facts about the wars that the U.S. has been involved in over the last few decades, especially the recent ones.  \n        He is across the street from the front of the White House, the side that is closest to the road.  On this side, Megan uses her digital camera as a video, and records randomness, including turning it around to make the White House spin.  While she does this she narrates: \"There are the people, and now the White House is going to turn upside down.  Weeee.\"  She shows her silliness in this, and then her seriousness, as she goes to ask the man what he is there for.  He tells her that he lost someone in the war, and waits for when the government will finally pull out.  He prays for those that have been lost, and those that have suffered because of our politics.  He is one of the voices against Bush’s war, and actually does something about it.  He has been in this spot for over a year, rarely leaving it.  His peaceful protesting demonstrates what this country is about, more than the buildings, the museums, the memorials, and everything else that has built up in the seat of power.  Waiting there takes courage and willpower, and the ability to stand up and speak.  This man is America, more than that man in the White House, and proves the diversity of thought in any city.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vtdjdth3ce"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.03665,38.90038]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20794","metadata":null,"contact_name":"andybrd","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:andybrd","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20794","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":8,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20794,platial:user=andybrd","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":31950}
