Serving up untold variations of double-black, cruisers and glades for skiers and snowboarders, Aspen Mountain rises an impressive 3,267 feet from the heart of downtown Aspen. After two decades of faithful service, the famous Silver Queen Gondola received a complete overhaul in 2006 and now boasts 147 spacious Swiss-made cabins. The new cabins offer more interior space for up to six guests and floor-to-ceiling windows to soak in the surrounding vistas before plunging down the slopes.

The influence of renowned resorts such as Switzerland\\'s St. Moritz, Italy\\'s Cortina, and Spain\\'s Val d\\'Aran led to the creation of a unique mountain resort full of excitement and village luxury.\r\n\r\nOriginally designed to accommodate skiers of all abilities, Beaver Creek Mountain continues to welcome and challenge those who visit her slopes. From the gentle groomed runs of Strawberry Park to the rugged glades and bump runs of Grouse Mountain, Beaver Creek is enjoyed by a variety of nordic sports enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nWhen George Townsend first settled in the valley in 1881, he knew he\\'d found something special- an exceptional mountain, lined with aspen groves and beautiful vistas that would become a world renowned destination. In 1972, Vail continued his vision by purchasing the land and began designing a resort that combined western hospitality and European charm. Obstacles delayed resort completion, but on December 15, 1980, Beaver Creek finally opened to the public.\r\n\r\nMajor events have always found a home at Beaver Creek. The mountain was named as a potential site for the 1976 Winter Olympics. In 1989, the resort hosted the World Ski Championships. For the last several years Beaver Creek has hosted the Visa Birds of Prey ™ World Cup Downhill Ski race which brings together hundreds of athletes as they compete to be named World Champion.\r\n\r\nBeaver Creek is also popular as a summertime adventure destination hosting such events as the TransRockies Run and the Jeep King of the Mountain series.\r\n\r\nIn December 2005,  Beaver Creek celebrated 25 years of resort excellence, and continues to be a resort industry leader in guest service and terrain maintenance.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtin6gu9z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.51711,39.60253]}},{"properties":{"name":"Beaver Creek","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>Avon, Co<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtio98m10"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.518331,39.602448]}},{"properties":{"name":"Breckenridge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>History\r\n\r\nSummer 1859-\r\nGold is discovered along the Blue River and a base camp, later to be known as Breckenridge, is established. While none of this base camp remains today, Breckenridge does contain more than 350 historic structures, making it the largest historic district in the state of Colorado.\r\n\r\n1859-\r\nThe Gold Pan Saloon is established as a rough-and-ready bar for the miners. Today, the Gold Pan is still in business at 103 N. Main Street in Breckenridge, and stands proud as the oldest continuously operated bar West of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n1860-\r\nBreckenridge gets a post office to serve the more than 8,000 miners and merchants who flock to the area.\r\nBRECKENRIDGE HAS CHARACTER(S)\r\nSylvia is one of Breckenridge\\'s most enduring personalities. A miner\\'s widow living in Breckenridge in the 1860\\'s she occupied a women\\'s boarding house on Main Street and is said by many to still occupy the building. Sylvia was said to be a prospector herself, (though of suitors, not gold), but failed to strike it rich and passed away alone. Today visitors can try to spot Sylvia themselves at the former boarding house, now The Prospector Restaurant, located at 130 S. Main Street. Local lore suggests that she only reveals herself to males, still in hope of finding a mate.\r\n\r\n1869-\r\nBreckenridge Navy founded by \"Captain\" Sam Adams. Adams, seeking a water route from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, leads four boats on an ill-fated trip from the Blue to the Colorado River before hopes are abandoned.\r\n\r\nBRECKENRIDGE HAS CHARACTER(S)\r\nProfessor Edwin Carter was a Breckenridge local from 1859 to century\\'s end and a naturalist who spent his life collecting and preserving area wildlife samples. Carter eventually passed away from arsenic poisoning he received from the chemicals used in his taxidermy process, and bequeathed his entire animal collection to the City of Denver. His gift was the foundation of the Denver Museum of Natural History and many pieces can still be seen in Breckenridge at the Edwin Carter Museum located at 111 N. Ridge Street.\r\n\r\n1879-\r\nFather John L. Dyer, the \"Snowshoe Itinerant Preacher\" founds his Methodist church Breckenridge. Dyer spends winters on his twelve-foot-long wooden skis, traveling between mining camps to preach. The church he founded is located at 310 Wellington and still holds services today.\r\n\r\n\r\n1882-\r\nThe railroad arrives in Breckenridge. South Park &amp; Pacific Railroad Company lay rail tracks over what is current day Boreas Pass Road. Today visitors can view original narrow gauge rail cars, including a rotary snowplow, a coal tender and two boxcars, at the Denver, Leadville &amp; Gunnison Railway Park located at 189 Boreas Pass Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n1887-\r\n\"Tom\\'s Baby\" a 13.5 pound gold nugget is discovered near Breckenridge by local miners Tom Graves and Harry Lytton. Tom\\'s Baby is now on display at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in Denver.\r\n\r\n\r\n1898-\r\n\"The Big Snow\" comes to Breckenridge. Snow falls everyday from November through February, forcing residents to dig tunnels to travel through town and stopping all trains from visiting Breckenridge for months.\r\n»back to top\r\n\r\nBRECKENRIDGE HAS CHARACTER(S)\r\nBarney &amp; Julia Lancelot Ford were two runaway slaves who lived in Breckenridge in the late 1880\\'s. Barney was a successful in mining in his early days in Breckenridge, but was bilked of his fortune by his lawyers who took advantage of the fact that African Americans were unable to own property in Colorado at the time. Barney and Julia didn\\'t accept this fate, however. Instead, they worked to guarantee rights for African-Americans in the Colorado Constitution and returned to Breckenridge to gain a new fortune running the upscale Denver Hotel and Ford\\'s Chop House. Visitors can see the couple\\'s historic home at 225 S. Main Street in Breckenridge.\r\n\r\n1908-\r\nSchool children discover Pug Ryan\\'s treasure near Breckenridge. Pug Ryan and his gang robbed the Denver Hotel in Breckenridge in 1898, making off with considerable loot. The robbery resulted in a shoot-out and the death of all the gang members except Pug who escaped--never to return to claim his prize. The found treasure included the gold watch of the Denver Hotel\\'s owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n1909-\r\nMining era money funds the building of the stately brick K-12 schoolhouse, complete with an indoor swimming pool and pressed-tin ceilings. Today, the building is inhabited by Colorado Mountain College and the Speakeasy Theatre and is located at 103 S. Harris Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n1942-\r\nDredge Boat mining comes to a halt after more than 40 years when World War II requires all metal be melted down for the war effort. Today visitors can view where the progress stopped at Maggie Pond at the Base of Peak 9 or eat on a reproduced dredge at The Dredge Restaurant located at 108 Jefferson Avenue.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtirus75d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.048871,39.474249]}},{"properties":{"name":"Breckenridge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>Breckenridge, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtim9gppw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.037778,39.481667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Breckenridge, Colorado","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtitlb7et"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.045532,39.482713]}},{"properties":{"name":"Buttermilk","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>Home of the ESPN Winter X Games through 2010 (for an unprecedented run of nine consecutive years!), Buttermilk also welcomes beginners.

It is probably the most outstanding potential ski area in the Arapahoe National Forest, and possibly Colorado. The north facing peaks of Copper Mountain offer an excellent variety of development for expert, intermediate and beginner skiers. The unique thing is that all three varieties are separated by definite terrain features, and in all three cases the skier can ski back into the base area. The mountain has good snow and sparse tree cover created by old burns, which offers a tremendous opportunity to create natural type runs that blend in with the surrounding countryside.\"\r\n\r\nWe couldn\\'t have said it better ourselves. Blessed with a nearly perfect mountain, Copper is one of Colorado\\'s best ski areas, enjoying thirty years of awesome skiing and snowboarding.\r\n\r\nNative Americans and Native Coloradans\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred years ago, Copper was home to the Ute and Arapaho Indians who fished the streams, trapped and hunted deer, buffalo, elk and bear. Of course, they also enjoyed, respected and revelled in the natural beauty and scenery created thousands of years earlier and the abundant snow and sunshine that is recreated each day, season and year.\r\n\r\nWheeler Junction\r\n\r\nIn the mid 1800s, miners discovered Summit County. Mining villages sprung up throughout central Colorado and copper was discovered in the area that now takes its name from that mineral. By 1880, Judge John S. Wheeler established a settlement at the junction between the Ten Mile and Gore mountain ranges. The old buildings can still be seen in the area near the base of Alpine Lift - or, if you\\'re exploring in the summer months, scattered along the back nine of Copper Creek Golf Club. Wheeler recognized the potential for development (who wouldn\\'t want to visit such a beautiful scenic and natural wonder) and promoted the area as a trout fishing and horseback riding retreat.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado settlement boomed. Miners, loggers, fur traders and prospectors, as colorful and storied as the environment itself, staked claims and called Wheeler Junction home. An energetic and wild boarding house offered amenities such as china dishes, authentic silverware and tablecloths in the midst of a rough and tumble mountain town. Dances, balls and card parties filled the nights as settlers sought their fortunes in the rich opportunities the area offered.\r\n\r\nThe Ski Resort\r\n\r\nIn 1971, Chuck Lewis, Copper\\'s founding father, took one look at the current site of Copper and told his friends, \"I\\'m gonna build me a killer ski resort.\" He negotiated a deal to purchase 280 acres at the base and worked with the Forest Service to establish parameters and guidelines for the ski area. Chuck was both a renegade and a visionary. During the summer of \\'71, initial construction began on the ski trails.\r\n\r\nOver the years, new lifts were added and Copper grew to its current size of 2,433 acres.  What was once a sleepy little day ski area is now one of Colorado\\'s premier year-round destination resorts. In 1997, the resort was purchased by Intrawest - a worldwide leader in resort operations and development.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtizbxi3r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.138732,39.4944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Crested Butte","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>\r\nCrested Butte Mountain Resort\\'s Commitment to the Environment\r\n\r\nCrested Butte is committed to green and making sure the Gunnison Valley stays clean.

If a customer chooses to participate, one percent of his purchase is donated to the Open Space program which funds various organizations that help with the preservation of land in Gunnison County.\r\n    * Crested Butte Mountain Resort is implementing a resort-wide recycling program this year. Not only cans and bottles from the restaurants can be reused, but cardboard and paper for the offices will also be recycled.\r\n    * Parking is free at CBMR\\'s main lot if you have four or more people in your vehicle. Save money, save gas, and reduce emissions!\r\n    * CBMR donates 10% of the cost of their energy use to the Colorado Governor\\'s Office of Energy Management and Conservation to help fund the development of green power in the state.\r\n    * With the deconstruction of the Gothic Building this summer, construction materials like beams and glass will be recycled, and the parts that cannot be reused will be mulched to use less space in the landfill.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtiohphu5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.964249,38.899932]}},{"properties":{"name":"Denver International Airport","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtizveblx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.67,39.87]}},{"properties":{"name":"Georgetown, Colorado","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>39.706N, -105.696W<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtikzbli9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.304579,30.311664]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hofstra University","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>11 tower ct hempstead ny 11550<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtj073pfb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.608964,40.713474]}},{"properties":{"name":"Howelsen Hill Ski Area","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>Howelsen Hill Ski Area\r\n\r\n... holds a unique place in the history of skiing.

Keystone also has two world-class golf courses, renowned mountain biking terrain, horse stables, spas, and much, much more.\r\n\r\nBut it’s still just a place, high above the rest of the world, where going down a snowy mountain puts a smile on people’s face.\r\n\r\nCome to Keystone and find out for yourself why Max was so right, and why one of the three mountains here is named after him.\r\n\r\nYou can find the perfect line, let gravity do its work, and never let go of that smile.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtixl8rxb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.954336,39.60402]}},{"properties":{"name":"Keystone","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>Keystone, Colorado<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtix5c917"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.877,37.94857]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kingston, PA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>18704<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtivvx3aa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.890338,41.274223]}},{"properties":{"name":"Loveland","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>Loveland Ski Area is the closest ski area to Denver located 53 miles west on I-70 just east of the Eisenhower Tunnel. \r\n\r\n·Lifts are open from:\r\n-9:00 am to 4:00 pm Monday through Friday. \r\n-8:30 am to 4:00 pm on weekends and designated holidays. \r\n\r\n·Skiable Acres: \r\n-1,365 \r\n\r\n·Base Elevation:\r\n-10,600 feet (3231 meter) \r\n\r\n·Summit Elevation:\r\n-13,010 feet (3965 meter) Lift-served: 12,700 feet\r\n\r\n·Vertical Drop:\r\n-2,410 feet (735 meter)\r\n\r\n·Snowmaking Capability:\r\n-160 Acres\r\n\r\n·Lifts:\r\n-3 double, 2 triple, 3 quad, 1 surface lift and 1 tow\r\n\r\n·Average Snowfall:\r\n-400 inches (10 meters) based on 32year average\r\n\r\n·Longest Run:\r\n-2 miles (3 Km)\r\n\r\n·Slopes:\r\n-17% Beginner\r\n-42% Intermediate \r\n- 41% Advanced\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtinuwryc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.898114,39.680191]}},{"properties":{"name":"Maroon Lake Scenic Trail","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtiqiej86"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.938686371,39.1000594806]}},{"properties":{"name":"Monarch Ski Area","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>Monarch Mountain...all natural snow...all natural setting...all about having fun!

Building on its unusually rich history and prime location, Ski Cooper has in recent years earned recognition as one of the nation\\'s most successful and innovative smaller ski areas.\r\n\r\nSki Cooper\\'s origin goes back to World War II. In 1942, the U.S. Army selected a training site near an isolated railroad stop of Pando, CO. Nearby Camp Hale was built as the training site for the ski troopers of the famed 10th Mountain Division. The Army selected the site because of the availability of rail transportation, its rugged mountainous terrain, and a 250-inch average annual snowfall which assured a six-month-long ski training season at the nearby, 11,700-foot-high Ski Cooper. Following two years of rigorous training, the 10th Mountain Division was ordered to Italy in 1945 to spearhead the advance of the U.S. Fifth Army. In a series of actions that included Riva Ridge and Mt. Belvedere, the 10th Mountain Division breached the supposedly impregnable Gothic Line in the Appenines and secured the Po River Valley to play a vital role in the liberation of northern Italy. By the time of the German surrender in May, 1945, 992 ski troopers had been killed in action and 4,000 wounded, the highest casualty rate of any U.S. Division in the Mediterranean. \r\n\r\nFollowing the war, Ski Cooper opened to the public as a backyard ski area for the enjoyment of the local area residents. Today, as a seven-day-per-week ski area with modern lifts and full base facilities Ski Cooper has firmly established itself in a well-defined market niche as an affordable alternative in a region famed for world-class skiing. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtj0fx56x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.299256,39.358897]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sol Vista","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>SolVista ski area is comprised of two separate yet inter-connected mountains.

Over the years several ski trails have been identified as Historical Trails. A commemorative sign, with a brief narrative about the individual\\'s contribution to the ski area, has been installed at a convenient location along each trail. Please take the opportunity to visit these trails while you\\'re skiing and enjoy a bit of Winter Park history.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHughes At its dedication ceremonies in 1940, Winter Park Ski Area, then a Denver mountain park, consisted of only three formal ski trails.\r\n\r\nBerrien Hughes, a Denver attorney, dedicated sportsman, and noted skiing pioneer, had introduced many of skiing\\'s early enthusiasts to the rugged beauty and challenging terrain of the mountain around Winter Park. \r\n\r\nOn May 27, 1939, Berrien Hughes died of injuries incurred in a skiing accident on Loveland Pass just days before. The first named ski trail at Winter Park commemorated the man and his contribution to the sport. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCranmer If credit can be given to any one person, then George E. Cranmer must be designated the father of the Winter Park Ski Area. In 1935, Cranmer became manager of Parks and Improvements for the City of Denver. An active and ardent outdoorsman, Cranmer dreamed of a mountain city park that would become a winter sports center comparable to European resorts. Cranmer possessed the energy and purpose to push his dream to fulfillment. By 1940, the first ski tow at West Portal was dedicated and Denver\\'s Winter Park was a reality. In 1977, in recognition of his contribution to Colorado skiing, George Cranmer was inducted into the Ski Hall of Fame. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAllan Phipps In 1950, when the City and County of Denver concluded that it could no longer operate the Winter Park Ski Area, it called upon Denver attorney Allan R. Phipps to head the newly formed Winter Park Recreation Association. Long an ardent skier and civic leader, Phipps was the first chairman of the board, setting the pattern for leadership that still exists in Winter Park today. His induction into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 1988 recognized his leadership in skiing. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBradley\\'s Bash In 1950, Steve Bradley became the first executive director of the Winter Park Recreation Association. Under his direction, Winter Park became an industry leader in the development of new techniques to further the sport of skiing.\r\n\r\nAlthough he is best known for his development of the first snow grooming machine, the \"Bradley Packer,\" he was also skilled in the design and development of ski trails. Bradley was known for the excellence of the trails he cut. Bradley\\'s Bash is typical of his designs --- straight down the fall line, with no side hill traverses. Bradley continued as executive director until 1975 and was inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 1979. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJack Kendrick Jack Kendrick began his service to Winter Park in 1950, serving as one of the 15 original trustees appointed to operate the Winter Park Recreation Association. He was a great believer in the potential of skiing as a major tourist attraction in Colorado. Through his involvement in the Denver Chamber of Commerce and the Colorado Winter Sports Council, Jack Kendrick supported and worked for the growth of the sport from the mid-1930s. Jack was among those responsible for Colorado\\'s first powered ski tow, a rope tow installed on Berthoud Pass in 1937. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMulligan\\'s Mile The history of Winter Park is filled with the names of men and women whose contributions made Winter Park a special place. One such person was Dick Mulligan. Dick became Winter Park Ski Area\\'s caretaker in 1945, living at the base area in a bunkhouse which formerly had housed construction workers building the Moffat Tunnel. For 10 years, Dick ran \"his lift,\" the Practice Hill T-bar, welcoming many of the young sport\\'s earliest participants to Winter Park and skiing. \r\n\r\nA friendly outgoing Irishman from Kiowa, Colorado, Dick had a well-kwown love for conversation and an unexcelled gift for bold exaggeration. This trail, in reality only a half mile long, is a tribute to Dick and his gift of exaggeration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMt. Maury In 1953, Maury Flanagan arrived in Winter Park \"in search of better snow.\" Maury stayed to become one of the original members of the Winter Park Ski School and a Winter Park legend.\r\n\r\nKnown for his booming voice, his peers nicknamed him \" Fog Horn Flanagan.\" His outrageous sense of humor and unique teaching methods earned him a place of honor in local skiing lore.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, Maury married Glenda Rawls who founded the Winter Park children\\'s ski school in 1961 and served as its director until 1969. The original children\\'s teaching hill, Mt. Glenda, was relocated to this site during the construction of West Portal Station in 1980, and renamed in honor of Maury Flannagan.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRetta\\'s RunConsidered to be one of the most challenging trails at Winter Park, Retta\\'s occupies the location of one of the earliest lifts, the Meteor T-bar. As an invaluable volunteer during the early years of Winter Park\\'s Handicap Program, Retta Stanley gave selflessly of herself to the program and its participants.\r\n\r\nIn her own struggle with disability, Retta was stricken with cancer and lost one leg. Having no pity for any handicap, including her own, she became one of the first women three-track national champions. In April 1977, Retta lost her eight year battle with cancer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEngeldiveIn 1945, a 23-year-old skiing enthusiast named George Engel visited Winter Park on a ski vacation. One year later he returned to begin one of Winter Park\\'s longest and most successful personal stories.\r\n\r\nFirst employed at Winter Park as a ski patrolman, by 1948 George was operating the Winter Park Ski School which he owned until its sale to the ski area in 1982. He was instrumental in the advancement of American ski instructor\\'s organizations, serving as president of the region\\'s professional association for 10 years.\r\n\r\nWith his wife, Joyce, he owned and operated the Winter Park Ski Shop from 1946 to 1998. The two organized many social, cultural, and fundraising events for the community. The dedication of this trail in 1964 and his induction into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 1987, recognize George Engel\\'s continuous personal commitment to skiing and this community.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBalchRobert Balch first came to Colorado from Massachusetts in 1934 to compete in the National Ski Championships held in Estes Park. Four years later he was hired by George Cranmer to supervise development of Denver\\'s Winter Park at West Portal.\r\n\r\nBob immediately began designing ski trails and tows for the proposed Winter Park Ski Area. He was responsible for laying out the original trails: Hughes, Highway Run (later abandoned), Parkway Run and Bridge Run (now Larry Sale). Balch became Winter Park\\'s first manager in 1940, serving until his enlistment in the army in 1942.\r\n\r\nBalch would never return to his beloved Winter Park. He was lost in the Mediterranean when his troop ship was torpedoed in 1943. These trails, cut in 1945, and his induction into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 1978, commemorate Balch\\'s involvement in the development of Winter Park.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBill Wilson\\'s WayA Colorado native and member of the University of Denver ski team, Bill \"Waxy\" Wilson has skiing in his blood. Following service in the Navy during World War II, Bill pursued various interests in the ski industry before settling in Winter Park in 1954, becoming a ski school instructor and serving as assistant ski school director for George Engel. Bill became director of the ski school in 1982 when it was purchased by the Winter Park Recreation Association. As a member of the ski school, with his trademark pipe clasped tightly in his jaws, he lobbied tirelessly for the development of the beginner trail that now bears his name. Sadly, Bill passed away from cancer in October, 1984, never seeing the completed trail named in his memory.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMary JaneIn the early 1930s, members of the Colorado Arlberg Club began clearing the first man-made ski trail in the western part of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Mary Jane Trail, as it is now known, was named after a local lady of pleasure. Mary Jane, according to legend, acquired the land on which the existing trail now lies, as payment from railroad workers and miners for her favors.\r\n\r\nWhat started as a sheep trail for summer grazing has now taken its place in the annals of skiing. While Mary Jane is described as being no lady, her namesake trail is one of the finest to be found anywhere in the country. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtisqvt7t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.764279,39.886791]}},{"properties":{"name":"rippilicious","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>1203 emerson street, denver, co 80218<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtirt0y8c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.97644,39.735274]}},{"properties":{"name":"rippilicious","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>denver, colorado<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtiu2as6d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.984167,39.739167]}},{"properties":{"name":"rippilicious","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>colorado<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtimivhfh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.945061,39.725024]}},{"properties":{"name":"rippilicious","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a>80218<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtiyayxm2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.971652,39.732747]}},{"properties":{"name":"test","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rippinskiers.com\" href=\"http://rippinskiers.com\">Rippinskiers</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxtikfzh0l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.736481,35.565188]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/236618","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rippinskiers","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rippinskiers","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/236618","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":46,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=236618,platial:user=rippinskiers","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":30003}
