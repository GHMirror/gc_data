Anacortes is also the jumping-off point for folks going to the San Juan Islands, a favorite cycling destination. At the start, the culmination of lush forest and ocean feeds and moistens the soul. Heading eastward along the rushing Skagit River, you carry that feeling up to the top of Rainy and Washington passes in the Cascade Mountains. Descending to the east side of the Cascades brings you into the drier part of the state and the widely known orchard country of the Okanogan Valley. Leaving this valley, you\\'ll be climbing and descending several more passes full of ponderosa pines and finding many sleepy farming communities down along the rivers you cross. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68a6jfyiiej"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.611389,48.512778]}},{"properties":{"name":"Babb","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://projectpedal.com\" href=\"http://projectpedal.com\">Mike1630</a>babb, mt<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68a6jjz7m5v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.43573,48.85693]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bainville","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://projectpedal.com\" href=\"http://projectpedal.com\">Mike1630</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68a6jkwbsm2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.22169,48.14391]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bar Harbor, ME - Finishing Location","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://projectpedal.com\" href=\"http://projectpedal.com\">Mike1630</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44692228@N00/421947418/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/164/421947418_fe34642974_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/78239713@N00/403422570/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/140/403422570_5e2a25b3a3_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/78239713@N00/350353609/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/134/350353609_b5db3cef49_o.jpg\"></a>[ACA] Entering Maine, you\\'ll traverse forests and fields, arriving at Damariscotta on the coast.

The route takes a jump into Canada to access Waterton Lakes National Park, and then you\\'ll head back into the States at Del Bonita, a little-used border crossing. Cut Bank is the beginning of the Great Plains, and from here on you\\'ll start praying for tailwinds. Supposedly, heading eastward, tailwinds predominate in the summer. The route uses U.S. Highway 2, the main road through central and eastern Montana along the railroad, so camping spots can occasionally be somewhat loud. Wherever possible, side roads are used to relieve the monotony of being on the highway. Afternoon thundershowers are a constant companion out on the Plains.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68a6jilu44w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.325278,48.633056]}},{"properties":{"name":"Damariscotta","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://projectpedal.com\" href=\"http://projectpedal.com\">Mike1630</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68a6jnzwvyj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-69.52904,44.03109]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day Six...","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://projectpedal.com\" href=\"http://projectpedal.com\">Mike1630</a>60099 State Route 20, Marblemount, WA, 98267No EVDO connection. No cell phone single. We\\'ve set up camp where the Skagit River runs into the  Cascade River, surrounded on all sides by mountains ranging from 4,000 to 8,900 feet in elevation. It\\'s very beautiful. People in town (Marblemount) say that we are \"in for a treat\" tomorrow - I\\'m looking forward to it.\n\nBut I\\'m getting ahead of myself - I mentioned in my last post I was excited about uploading the first few \"official\" shots (I say \"official\" because we\\'ve been capturing tons with the two mp4 cameras and our Nokia), yesterday we stopped at a laundry mat in Concrete where I managed to import a few minutes here and there, and export them straight to quicktime-movies.\n\nThis 1st clip is one of the many takes we captures with the sun setting behind the camp-site. It was very cloudy and grey all day but around 8:30 the sun came down under the clouds enough to just light everything up.\n\n\nI\\'m so happy with this 2nd clip - we had set up in the morning to get their \"taking off\" moment, and on the 45 kit (HDV35), the guys had their zoom-lens (200). But Amanda had packed her SLR camera and one of the lens she has for it is a very long lens (a 300), we swapped it out and it looks just amazing.\n\n\nUnbelievably sharp depth of field. We stopped by a field yesterday to shoot some tall grass with the mountains in the background - and I couldn\\'t believe how many \"layers\" of field we could shift through.\n\nThe great news is it\\'s turned out to be much, much easier to film on-the-fly with the 45 kit mounted to the FX1. At first we were planning to only break it out for interviews. But Olivier is finding it very simple to focus and move at the same time - which I love, it\\'s just one more \"look\" we can play with for the film.\n\nI also can\\'t believe how much I\\'m loving the mp4 and Nokia footage, it gives a less \"cinematic / grandiose\" feel to the shot and makes it more personal. I\\'ve uploading some of it <a href=\"http://blip.tv/file/259057\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://blip.tv/file/259056\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blip.tv/file/259055\">here</a>... and one more <a href=\"http://blip.tv/file/259058\">here</a>. We\\'ve been slowly and carefully breaking out our 16mm, we only have 30 minutes of stock for the entire two months (if anyone has any 100 foot daylight spools they\\'d like to donate, please let me know, we could use it).\n\n\nBut... *deep breath* I do have some bad news. It was news that, I could tell, was very hard for Jay to come talk to us about. Amanda was curled up in her tent, and the four of us guys were at the picnic table looking at rushes and talking about whatever, when Jay let us know the situation with his knee. I\\'ve never actually talked about it here on the site, so this will require a quick catch-up: Jay is a snowboarder, actually a very good one.\n\nIn the 2005 he took the bronze in the world championship. Yea, I know, he\\'s good. But he\\'s had knee trouble for years, gone through 5 major surgeries, and at the moment is actually completely missing his ACL.\n\nBoth Larry &amp; Jay have been training, in the mountains, a great deal - so it\\'s hard to say if it\\'s the added weight to the bike that caused the problem, or if it just finally caught up with him. But only 10 miles into the ride this morning and his knee almost brought him to tears, and Jay\\'s a tough enough guy to know that\\'s a problem... especially on a flat day like they had this morning. So, Jay is going to stay behind - Larry is pressing on... alone. He\\'s, understandably, a bit terrified about the following 4,200 miles - but he\\'s also a bit excited about the solitude. It changes things for us, not in a bad way, but we\\'ll adapt with it.\n\nAs a crew we are still trying to find the best balance for what we are doing - I know it will take some time in this kind of on-the-move environment. For example, Jeff and I had a hell of time today with a simple crane shot - not too sure if any of that footage actually worked out.\n\nBut I am very sad to see Jay go - I know he was very excited and ready for this ride, I know he\\'s sad to watch Larry ride on without him. But I understand and encourage him not to push himself to the point of ruining his snowboarding career, or even just simply ruining his knee.\n\nIt\\'s going to be a hard good bye tomorrow morning. Well, it\\'s after midnight, I need to get some sleep. Goodnight for now.(PS) I found out that a lot of the videos I uploaded with Transmit on the road didn\\'t get transfered correctly and have been bouncing out bad files through the feed, sorry for this, I\\'ll only try to upload from now on with a more reliable connection. \n<img src=\"http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n61/mike_1630/technoratiicon.gif\"><b>tags</b>: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/pedal\">pedal</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/documentary\">documentary</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/indie\">indie</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/vlog\">vlog</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/blog\">blog</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/bicycle\">bicycle</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/coast-to-coast\">coast-to-coast</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/community\">community</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/funding\">funding</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68a6jhfvmtp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.431688,48.526717]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day Three...","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://projectpedal.com\" href=\"http://projectpedal.com\">Mike1630</a>We\\'re heading north on the 101 - 30 miles south of Crescent City.

Contact us through Pedal\\'s mySpace.\n\nBe creative. This process is simply an introduction. The more you include - the better for starting a conversation.\n\nThe deadline for introductions is May 1st.\n\n    (Note: I should make it clear that Pedal is not a safety net... meaning Pedal will not be financially involved or supportive in anyone\\'s travels.

I\\'m pretty heavy-eyed at the moment, so this might be a somewhat short post.\n\nI\\'m very excited to post the 1st sneak-peak raw interview of the trip. I met Jack Denson in Rockport and knew right away he was \"one of those people\" I\\'d love to talk with at several points during our way east (if he\\'s willing, of course). He\\'s got just a great personality, and he\\'s very relaxed on camera.\n\nWe lost him for a day after Marblemount, but drove past the bike shop in Winthrop and spotted him talking outside. Turned out he was spending the day at the KOA down the street and was happy to talk to us.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is we didn\\'t have the \"nice microphone\" on the camera with the HDV35 kit, we ran the XLR into the wide, so this is a shot-gun mic mounted to the front of the FX1. We have the nice-nice sound on the other tape, which, if I had the time, I could have synced up the two. But I\\'m on the run, so that will have to wait.\n\n\nI think the interview went great - I can\\'t wait to talk with Jack more, further down the road. Take a moment to check out his <a href=\"http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/jackdenson\">\\'Crazy Guy on a Bike\\' page</a>, also he\\'s helping to raise awareness for <a href=\"http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/\">Wounded Warriors</a>, so take a moment to support them in any way you can.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts or questions!

Take the cable car ride across the Whirlpool Rapids and visit the other attractions along the trail. Then you\\'ll cross back into the U.S., enjoying the view of the Niagara Gorge. Heading east, the route uses the Erie Canalway Trail for 90 miles along a waterway dripping with history. Take the time to explore the towns along the canal. At Palmyra, the route turns north to Lake Ontario, where it follows the lake shore to Sodus Bay, dips inland to Fair Haven, and then leaves the Great Lakes to cross the Adirondack Mountains and arrive at Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain.

In Erie, Pennsylvania, you can explore the miles of sand beach at Presque Isle State Park and the replica of the sailing ship Niagara, Admiral Perry\\'s flagship in the War of 1812 Battle of Lake Erie. Leaving Erie, the route enters the fruit and wine region of Pennsylvania and New York and hugs the relatively rural lake shore to the outskirts of Buffalo, New York. Views across Lake Erie of the Buffalo skyline and Canada usher the cyclist into the bustle of the southern end of the metropolis. A short side trip will take you to the Pedaling History Bicycle Museum in Orchard Park. The route passes the magnificent Basilica of Our Lady of Victory in Lackawanna, and seeing its magnificent Italian Renaissance and French Baroque architecture is a must.

Due to changing local conditions, it is difficult to predict any major wind patterns, but tornadoes are common in Iowa. They mostly occur in May and June.\n\nHeading east from Fargo and Moorhead in the Red River Valley, you begin to slowly leave the Great Plains. Lakes and hills become the standard scenery, and the resident mosquitos increase in number. The birthplace of the Mississippi River is in Lake Itasca State Park, in northern Minnesota. This area is so full of forests, lakes, and rivers that it draws many recreationalists during the summer months. The route follows the Mississippi River, until it heads east around the cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding towns. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68a6jm07icp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.789444,46.877222]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/111818","metadata":null,"contact_name":"system","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:system","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/111818","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":93,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=111818,platial:user=system","published":"2010-03-02T17:00:00Z","id":27592}
