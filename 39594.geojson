2007\n\nPrevious Visit: Wednesday, December 21st, 2005\n\nIf you attend only one more World Dive Bar Tour event this year, make sure it\\'s this week\\'s World Dive Bar Tour Christmas Spectacular at Canter\\'s Kibitz Room.  This year\\'s WDBTXMS is made all the more important now that we have heard the tragic news from Bill O\\'Reilly and others at Fox News that a \"War on Christmas\" is being waged this Holiday season.  So, as we cherish our Lord and Savior over kosher pickles and pastrami on rye, we do ask that Tour Devotees keep their ears open in case any Godless secularists in our midst fail to wish us all a \"Merry Christmas\".\n \nAs for the Kibitz Room, it\\'s the kind of place one could imagine The Little Baby Jesus himself being born in.  The drinks are moderately priced, the live music rocking, and the girl at the bar will probably lie about being a virgin.\n \nThe eggnog and revelry will begin at 9pm and get really interesting by 10, while WDRT fans are suggested to arrive around 8 for the bagels, lox, and pickled herring.  Come for one drink, or stay for one too many, bring anyone and everyone, and join us for a great time in the middle of the week.  If you arrive early or late, look for the people having a damn good time (it\\'ll be us), or start having a damn good time on your own (we\\'ll find you).\n \nCarpe Drinkem,\n \nAlex &amp; Damien, WDBT Co-czars\nNathan &amp; Travis, WDRT Consumers-in-Chief\n \n\"Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son.

On the contrary the Cinema Bar is neither trendy nor overpriced and has barely enough room inside for a big screen TV let alone a movie theater. However, the bar still features live entertainment by squeezing a folk or country/blues band into the corner, making it a one-of-a-kind stop on the Tour.\n\nAllegedly one of the oldest in the city so nice they named it twice, Cinema Bar gets its moniker because it\\'s situated within the borders of the crooked-street, red-light-camera-saturated, and arrogantly-christened \"heart of screenland.\" The soft glow of Christmas lights on the walls and bartenders\\' stiff drinks creates a cozy ambiance, crucial for such a claustrophobic space. As the seating is as limited as the standing room, expect to rub shoulders with fellow bar goers as the place fills up. And don\\'t worry, should either the stiff drinks or an dashing bar maiden/fella keep you from getting home, the Sun Burst motel across the street stays open late.\n\nAs usual, the casual debauchery starts around 9PM an gets really interesting by 10:00. Come for one drink, or stay for one too many. Bring anyone and everyone, and join us for a great time in the middle of the week. If you arrive early or late, look for the people having a damn good time (it\\'ll be us), or start having a damn good time on your own (we\\'ll find you).\n\nCarpe Drink\\'em,\n\nAlex, Damien, &amp; Travis, WDBT Co-Czars\n\n\"You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

Sadly, time has since erased all indications of this bar\\'s former glory, and the grasshopper mural has been covered by modern graffiti denoting which dangerous street gang presently controls narcotics distribution in the area. The latest LAPD \"Gang Injunctions\" maps show a violent turf war between the 18th Street Latinos to the south, and the Scientologists to the north. However, with only a black, painted door and no signs adorning the outside, it\\'s safe to assume that not one of L. Ron\\'s posse has ever ventured inside. You\\'ll have to wonder just how we even found the joint in the first place (Damien\\'s \"18th Street\" tattoo may provide some clues).\n\nThe complete anonymity from the outside hides the welcoming environs within, where, on the comfortable yet worn bar stools and booths, those on a budget will find that the Grasshopper is tailor made for the working man, boasting a reliable supply of cheap drinks poured by the lovely Loquecia. On a recent visit, a single Alexander Hamilton bought two domestics and an import for three thirsty drinkers, while an elderly man shooting pool in a sombrero sang along with the mariachi jukebox, claiming that the classic love ballad was written by his own uncle. So bring a 20 dollar bill, break a few quarters for the jukebox and a spot at the pool table, and sharpen your Spanish skills, as you will need them to play both. Most of all, come prepared for another truly amazing LA dive.\n\nAs usual, the casual debauchery starts around 9PM an gets really interesting by 10:00. Come for one drink, or stay for one too many. Bring anyone and everyone, and join us for a great time in the middle of the week.
