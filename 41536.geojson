More than 46,000 protesters rally in a march on the state capitol at Columbia, South Carolina, to protest the Confederate battle flag flying atop the statehouse dome. NAACP chair Kweisi Mfume, the main speaker at the event, called it the greatest civil rights rally since the 1960s. In August 1999, the NAACP had called for a national boycott of vacation spots in South Carolina in an attempt to force the state government to remove the Confederate flag from the dome of its statehouse. Controversy on this issue grows, involving the flying of the Confederate flag in other southern states as well.

At least two protesters have been killed in clashes.\n\nPolice fired tear gas at stone-throwing youths in Nepal\\'s capital Sunday, where at least 1,000 people assembled in one neighborhood, said a witness who declined to be named for fear of police reprisal. Police also fired rubber bullets, Private Kantipur Television reported, showing footage that included at least one injured protester.\n\nNepal\\'s home minister said Sunday that Maoist militants who joined protesters clashing with police in the capital have started shooting on security forces.\n\nHome Minister Kamal Thapa did not say whether there had been any injuries. Rebel chief Prachanda, whose organization is backing the ongoing anti-monarchy protest campaign, has promised not to carry out attacks in the capital, Katmandu.\n\n\"The terrorists have fired despite their pledge not to carry out violence in the capital,\" Thapa said.\n\nHe said \"the security forces have recovered cartridges at Gangabu\" neighborhood on the northwest edge of Katmandu where a curfew was not imposed but several protests were reported.\n\nAnother group tried to march into the city from a suburb but scuffled with police who managed to block them off, said a police official at the scene who asked not to be named because of the political climate.\n\nWitnesses and Nepali media reported protests in dozens of other towns and cities.\n\nOn Saturday, security forces killed at least two protesters and wounded five in provincial cities. Saturday was the 16th anniversary of the introduction of democracy in Nepal, an experiment that Gyanendra abruptly ended last year when he reclaimed absolute power for the royal dynasty.\n\nAt the time, he said the move was needed to bring order to a chaotic and corrupt political scene and to end a communist insurgency that has killed nearly 13,000 people in the past decade.\n\nMany Nepalis at first welcomed the king\\'s move. But the insurgency since has worsened and the economy has faltered, fueling the discontent that has been on display in recent days as thousands of workers, professionals and business people have for the first time joined students and political activists at protests.\n\nMore than 2,000 people protested in the southern town of Bharatpur on Sunday, angered by the death of demonstrator shot by security forces a day earlier. On Saturday, protesters set fire to at least a half-dozen government offices and forced riot police to retreat from the town\\'s main square.\n\nThe government extended the daylong curfew Sunday to the resort town of Pokhara, where the king was vacationing and clashes erupted a day earlier.\n\nGangadhar Baral said he was among a group of protesters throwing stones at security forces when soldiers opened fire in Pokhara on Saturday, killing one of his friends. A doctor reached by phone at the city\\'s Gandaki Hospital confirmed the death and injuries but declined to give his name because he was not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nThe curfew began at 10 a.m. Saturday and officials said it would stay in effect through Sunday. They repeated warnings on state television and radio that violators would be shot.\n\nSunday was the last day of a four-day general strike called by an alliance of the country\\'s seven main political parties and backed by the rebels.\n\n\"I have not opened my shop in four days and if this continues, I and my family will have no money left,\" said Ramesh Shrestha, a shop owner in Katmandu. \"Both the government and the protesters are fighting for their own reasons but it is the common people who are suffering.\"\n\nThe government on Sunday said rebels planned to attack the capital, despite their promises to refrain from doing so.\n\n\"We are not going to allow massive public gatherings in the city as it has been verified that there is Maoist infiltration,\" Information Minister Shrish Shumshere Rana told The Associated Press.\n\nRam Sharan Mahat, a senior leader of Nepali Congress, the country\\'s largest party, dismissed the claim.\n\n\"This is just an excuse. They are trying to tar this uprising with the Maoist brush, and to question its legitimacy,\" Mahat said.\n\nApart from Saturday\\'s shootings, the government has arrested more than 800 people since Wednesday. Police were seen Saturday detaining another 20 rights activists for defying the curfew.\n\nThe crackdown on the opposition has prompted condemnations from the United States, Japan, the European Union and neighboring India, all of which have been critical of the king\\'s power grab.\n\nFor the first time, the parties\\' protest has the backing of the communist rebels, with whom they formed a loose alliance in December.\n\n-- \n\nAssociated Press reporter Neelesh Misra contributed to this report. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6d3io42la4n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[85.316666,27.716667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Birmingham Riots","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.viscom.ohiou.edu/moore.site/bifir.jpg\">birmingham, alabama1963/09/15.

Between 2002 and 2005, protests against the Iraq war were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet, the United States and worldwide public opinion.\nThese anti-war demonstrations were mainly organised by anti-war groups, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan, though in some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the State. Europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters, including a rally of 3 million people in Rome, Italy which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally. [1]On March 20, 2003, the day after the invasion of Iraq had begun, thousands of protests and demonstrations were held around the world in opposition to the war in Iraq. In many cases, these protests were known as \"Day X\" protests, reflecting the fact that they had been organized to occur when war started, what ever day that might have been.\n[edit]\nUnited States\n\n\n\nProtesters attend a demonstration in Washington DC against President Bush\\'s Iraq policy.\nIn some U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, New York, and Portland, Oregon, demonstrators blocked traffic in the city centers with the goal of shutting the cities down, resulting in the arrests of over 3,000 people nationwide. In other cities, such as Boston, Atlanta, and Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, demonstrations were more peaceful. In still other cities, people engaged in counter-demonstrations in support of the war.\nIn San Francisco, 5,000 protesters, having planned weeks in advance to shut down the city on \"Day X\", blockaded the Financial District resulting in 2,000 arrests.

The protest, denouncing China\\'s economic instability and political corruption, was violently suppressed by armed soldiers ordered into Beijing by the PRC government.\nAlthough student protests had been occurring for over a year, the famous protest began in mid-April 1989. It was triggered by the death of Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the CCP between 1981 and 1987. Hu was forced to resign by Deng Xiaoping because of his soft attitude toward the student unrest in 1986. He was widely respected among students and intellectuals.

With the arrest of a 21 year old African American, Los Angeles\\'s South Central neighborhood of Watts erupted into violence. On August 11, 1965, a Los Angeles police officer flagged down motorist Marquette Frye, whom he suspected of being intoxicated. When a crowd of onlookers began to taunt the policeman, a second officer was called in. According to eyewitness accounts, the second officer struck crowd members with his baton, and news of the act of police brutality soon spread throughout the neighborhood. The incident, combined with escalating racial tensions, overcrowding in the neighborhood, and a summer heat wave, sparked violence on a massive scale.
