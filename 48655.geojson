This monument was constructed by Glutzon Borglum a sculptor. The work started on August 10, 1927 it took fourteen years to complete because of the lack of funding for the project. But the mountain was only worked on for a total of six and a half years due to weather delays and lack of money. \r\n\r\nThe project cost a total of 900,000 .  Our president Coolidge thought it was a good piece of America and thought we should dedicate it which we did in 1927.The project was worked on until the death of Gulzton in 1941.

This historical day happened on September 11, 2001 at about nine a.m. Hijackers crashed two planes on the two Twin Towers killing many innocent people. The other two hijacked planes landed elsewhere. The first landed and crashed into the Pentagon. The second crashed and burned in a feild located in Virgina.\r\n\r\n A few minutes later Tower 1 fell and collasped. Following Tower 2 fell not less than 10 minutes afterwards. Thus creating what we call now Ground Zero. Today Ground Zero is being made into a memorial. They are in the process of building a tower called the Freedom Tower. They have a \" Tribute In Light\" which only comes on on the night of September 11th. The two lights represents the lives lost and the two towers.

The NASA research and tourist station in Cape Canaveral, Florida! This research area was not originally named the Kennedy Space Center. The space center was made possible when the Public Law 85-568 was signed in by President Dwight D. Esienhower on July 29, 1958 creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration which in short is called NASA.In July of 1962 it made its home on the southeast coast.\r\n\r\n In late 1963, however, it was later renamed after our president John F. Kennedy since he paved the way for space exploration by landing man on the moon. Kennedy Space Center has helped the race to space for about fourty six years now. It has launched all manned space missions. The space center has help make possible the Mission To Mars, Hubble, Project Mercury, and the International Space Station. Kennedy Space Center has played a huge vital role in the race of space discovery and probably will become a bigger aid and help to those missions to come in the bright successful future that we all hope for.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7e0nnrmwgde"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.60487,28.38453]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lakeland Christain School","description":"Posted by Shorty101<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/50s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/lakeland_chrisitan_logo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/EEZU1NCARN3EYJCAJ8H2HZCA6HTNB4CAT3KZQ4CA1XJTDOCA9AA09OCA8Z00RICAOKPIL4CA36LW19CALC37VJCAJ8FFY3CAWR1OVWCAMR7WOTCAZOHJ1HCATXME52CAC1EUYVCA9O6TT6CAHXTWPR.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\">Â Lakeland, floridaLakeland Christian School was started by a teacher named Evelyn Wheeler.

Over the next couple of decades the statue has become a sign of freedom and democracy to all who come to the United States. The statue was sculpted by a man called Frederic Auguste Bartholdi. It was designed to commemorate the Declaration Of Independence. The completion date was set for the year 1876.  Both the United States and France helped make this monument possible. The Americans built the pedestal for the statue to sit upon while the statue was France\\'s sole responsibility. \r\n\r\nBoth sides had problems financing the project. America finished paying for the pedestal in August 1885. The pedestal itself was finally completed in the April of 1886. As for France, they finished the statue in July of 1884. The finished product arrived from France on the New York Harbor in July 1885. The statue was seperated into 350 peices and stuck into 214 crates. It was then that the statue was commenced and set up which only took about four months. On Oct. 28th,1886 is when the dedication took place. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7e0nnwxo3lg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.039879,40.699341]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Alamo","description":"Posted by Shorty101<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Mvc_SOTA1_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Alamo_500_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/AlamoBattle.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/HNMP1XCAM908FYCA0QRLGLCA8N22JZCAC72T57CA39UWVSCAKVKJ1DCAY7QD6VCAM2ROJ0CALSB9E7CAJ9JZP0CA2K4UEPCAY69XG1CA3H2A9BCAKTSN8UCAO5BD1ICAS7O86NCA57P9C1CACUHE7W.jpg\">san antonio, texasThe Battle of the Alamo took place in San Antonio, Texas. The cause of the war and the reason that the Mexican army even went through the town of Alamo was because the Texas people were rebelling against the Mexican goverment. The Texas army decided to meet the Mexican army halfway by building up and supplying cannons, ammunition, guns, and firepower to the Alamo. Many people came from all over to help defend the Alamo. \r\n\r\nPeople from groups for example like the New Orleans Greys who were there at the Alamo but chickened out and left only about 20 people there to fight in the battle. Lots of volunteers from Tennessee also came to Texas to participate in the the Battle of Alamo. The Mexican army arrived at the Alamo on Feb. 23, 1836. The Mexican army was well equipped and prepared for the battle ahead. Many of the Mexican army leaders were soldeirs that had fought in wars before which also was an advantage to the Mexican army for having more experience in the military feild. In the end the Texas army defeated the Mexican army and made the battlecry \"Remember the Alamo\" very famous.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7e0nntdd02s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.493333,29.423889]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Battle of Gettysburg","description":"Posted by Shorty101<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/800px_Battle_of_Gettysburg,_by_Currier_and_Ives.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/350px_Gettysburg_Battle_Map_Day1.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Chamberlains_Charge.jpg\">Gettysburg, PennsylvaniaThe Battle Of Gettysburg is one of the most important battles of the Civil War.

It started being built around the year 70 A.D. The Colisseum was completed in 80 A.D. Its ampitheatre held up to about 50,000 spectators and fans.  On its opening day it showcased over 100 games that involved gladiators and animals being killed.  The Colisseum was also flooded to use as a stage to host fake naval battles.\r\n\r\nIt took about 15 minutes to seat and get a show going for 50,000. In this way Romans are given the credit for making up tickets and assigned seating. The Colisseum has influenced todays stadiums such as the Yankee Stadium. The Colisseum was used for about 400 years until earthquakes, mistreatment, and neglect tore it apart. The Colisseum has no roof. It is a sturdy building that has a solid foundation but is open and light. The Colisseum is made out of white marble.

It is the most sacred religous spot. The English call it the \"Wailing Wall\" because it became a center for mourning over Israel\\'s exile and the destruction of the Temple. The Western Wall since 132CE has been receiving the prayers of the Jewish people. Most of them at that time were directed toward the recently destroyed Temple. \r\n\r\nThe Western Wall had a permanent place in the Jews daily life starting in the year 1520. But  most history books say that this is a place for prayer and assembly. No Muslim interest or followers ever go to this wall. The wall consists of 24 rows of stones reaching to the height of 18m with 6m above the Temple Mount.
