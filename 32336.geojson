All of the produce comes from Dole, even the organic stuff. I never buy produce here. But I do shop here for the staples of eggs, butter, milk, and water.\n\nI like the local teens working the registers.\n\nWhen you check out, a bagger has to take your groceries out to your car and bring the cart back in. They don\\'t let you do it yourself because the parking lot is on a hill leading directly into the Alewife Brook parkway and if you leave a cart out there it\\'s going straight into traffic.\n\nThey have good French cookies here. I also like the frosting-filled scones from the bakery. Reminds me of my childhood.\n\nThis is the worst place to go if you need a quick something to take with you on the airplane. They\\'ve got a lot of junk food and no deli to speak of. Also a very poor source of cheese, though they have hummus covered.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66zjzau1u1w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.133538,42.407121]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Chic Boutique","description":"Posted by Lachic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_vanilla_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 235 Elm St<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66zjzbecy11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-69.261268,44.827125]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little Joe's Coffee Shop","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/3/279829440_3150195810.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> You can get an egg sandwich and a fresh coffee here super cheap.

It looked a little scary. One of the neighbors made a few calls and found out that the wire belonged to rcn, the cable company. He called to ask them to do something about it. Nothing happened for about three months. Then, one day, a truck came from the cable company. I saw it out my window and thought, \"Oh good. They\\'re going to finally get rid of that wire.\" The cable guy was out there for over an hour, toiling away. When I went out later, I looked at his handiwork. He had wrapped some black electrical tape around part of the wire, tucked another part of the wire behind something attached to the pole, and coiled the wire up under a cinderblock on the sidewalk.
