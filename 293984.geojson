Three census agglomerations (CA) also straddle provincial borders: Campbellton straddles New Brunswick and Quebec, Hawkesbury straddles Ontario and Quebec, and Lloydminster straddles Alberta and Saskatchewan. Data for the combined provincial parts are provided at the end of the list of CMAs and CAs. Prior to 2008, data for the two parts of the Ottawa-Gatineau CMA may be added together to provide a total for the area, with the exception of medians, percentages, indexes and averages.","geography":"12","2010":null,"id":"aa18uzrdc9gw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"family characteristics":"Formerly Sudbury.","geography":"13","2010":null,"id":"aa18uzwkedqk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"family characteristics":null,"geography":"Source:","2010":null,"id":"aa18uzm8itgv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"family characteristics":null,"geography":"Statistics Canada.
