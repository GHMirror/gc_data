They had a lot of the backing music on DAT or synth, the performance seemed a bit lackluster and without passion.  Perhaps I was expecting something different than what they were expecting to deliver, but I was definitely not as impressed as I had expected to be.  It was a good show, don\\'t get me wrong.  But for 0+, and for the probably 00-300k they raked in for that night, we as an audience deserved more.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x88ccsicn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.33179,47.613787]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dunes","description":"Posted by Vlai44<img src=\"http://www.dunes.cc/visual/images/gallery/trippybooth2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1905 NE Martin Luther King Blvd., Portland, OR\"secret\" hole-in-the-wall hipster bar that hosts lots of HARSH NOISE shows.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x88c8omf1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.661794,45.536615]}},{"properties":{"name":"Favorite statue in Portland","description":"Posted by Vlai44<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/426b21b2585f123a18466d675528db92.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> On Main St. between SW 3rd &amp; 4th Avenues., Portland, ORThe \"Thompson Elk Statue\" (named after the 1879-1882 Portland mayor) located between the park blocks on Main Street and 3rd/4th Aves., facing the Federal Courthouse, Justice Center, Multnomah County Courthouse and Portland Building.
