An assessment of what State property may be affected, and what State services may be impacted needs to be made.\n\n\n    2) There is a predicted natural disaster, such as a hurricane. An assessment of what State property, personnel and services might be in the disaster's predicted footprint or path needs to be made. Preparations need to be made to evacuate personnel, secure property, and arrange for alternate methods of delivering the critical services that may be affected.\n\n\n    3) There has been a terrorist threat against State property and/or personnel. Steps need to be taken to identify what is being threatened, counter the threat, and protect threatened personnel and property. Additional property may be impacted due to its proximity to the threatened property, or the threat may contain only a general spatial reference, and the spatial component of this dataset may need to be used to identify the threatened
