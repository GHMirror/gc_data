Its archive chronicles a national treasure of free jazz and maverick rock that explodes the myth of Japanese conformity. \n\nP.S.F. Records originated in the Tokyo record shop Modern Music, which opened in 1980, and took its name from the 1985 album Psychedelic Speed Freaks by High Rise. At the time there were a lot of innovative groups around who had no chance of being released by a major label. P.S.F. was started out of a desire to capture some of these precious tunes on record.\n\nRenowned founder Hideo Ikeezumi says \"I only release what I like, and I hope that some of these sounds will appeal to the more discerning listener.\"\n\nP.S.F. also publishes the highly respected G-Modern, a quarterly magazine on avant-garde underground music. \"\n\n<a href=\"http://imageshack.us\"><img src=\"http://img56.imageshack.us/img56/8855/shop2cp5.jpg\" alt=\"Image Hosted by ImageShack.us\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://imageshack.us\"><img src=\"http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/4976/modernmusicaw3.jpg\" alt=\"Image Hosted by ImageShack.us\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69kzvuwc0ko"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.770004,35.669998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parallax Records -
