I had put all of my winter hats and coats away and was totally stoked to be able to be wearing shorts and flip-flops again. Apparently the weather did not get the memo. I mean its fucking April for crying out loud, I could understand a little inclimate weather during March, I mean it is right next door to February.

As I look around I see that not much has changed. It\\'s my first night back and I\\'m not working, so I have no choice but to drink myself into a coma while I recount all of the ridiculous things that have occured in the last ten days that I was away. By the time I get to retelling the Salt Lake City debacle I cant feel my lips and I am slurring my words. About the time that I should be telling teh story of Steven\\'s birthday all I can do is sway to the music with a cigarette hanging between my lips and mumble unintelligible things to myself.

We will say the Lords Prayer as a team, followed by some words of inspiration from Coach Christian before we charge out the door into the rainstorm that just hit about two hours ago to face the Flyers from St. Joseph. Gone are the sharp rips of athletic tape and the rattle of pads as the members of this team went from highschool students about to begin their weekend to warriors who are about to take the field for this friday night showdown. The stereo that blasts gangsta rap and heavy metal before practice and up to an hour before games is silent. The shoes have been laced up the jerseys squeezed over shoulder pads eye black applied. No more time for film study, no time for another session in the weight room, no time for last minute adjustments. The band is rocking the crowd is on their feet.

That much is evident the minute that you walk in the front door and are hit with the musky smell of smoke. Then as you look around at the empty beer bottles and pizza boxes, the carpet that is well past saving and the few random holes in the walls it becomes clear what you have just stepped into. You have just entered what may be the premiere bachelor pad in the greater Valparaiso area. If you set down for a second to observe what goes on inside apt. 114, you would see that the air is not \"smoky\" but filled with the aromas of our pine scented \"air freshner\". If you were to ask any of the three or four guys that are huddled around the \"playstation\" TV intensely aurguing over the outcome of a video game what happened to the walls they will tell you that the holes are just part of the game and what happens when someone loses a big matchup. As to the beer bottles and pizza boxes that litter the floor. Come on we are guys, we do our best but four single guys living in a three bedroom apartment is a bad start and then you have to factor in the constant rotation of three or four guys that crash on the couch. What is so great about this bachelor pad is that it is twenty four hours. Someone is always awake. I work nights at a bar and dont get home until four in the morning some nights, while my roommate has to wake up at a quarter to six every morning to go teach highschool, in addition the other two roommates have the normal uneven schedule of all college students. Someone is always awake, the door is always open. Come in have a drink, have a smoke, someone will give you a shot on the PS2, but you will lose.

Joe and Wright have really made a great contribution to this trip and we only met them like twenty minutes ago. We Walked into the Royal Wolf Saloon ordered a pitcher of Pabst Blue Ribbon because that was the only beer in the budget, and sat down at the bar. Joe was the one that started the conversation, he was almost to drunk to walk and in one of those everybody is my best friend moods that people are sometimes lucky to fall into. He began to \"enthrall\" us with his stories of all the sweet skiing that he has done, and where he plans on going. He got up to leave asked us if we wanted to smoke This was our third day without smoke so when the offer was put on the table we jumped at the chance like three men who had been in the desert and were offered a drink. We all piled into Steven\\'s Suburban. Ass much as Joe was so gung ho about blazing most of the rest of their weed with strangers, Wright was obviously not as enthusiastic. Then suddenly things change. Jeremy asks the same question of everyone he meets when we get drunk. \"Where you in a frat?\" Wright then gives the anwser that gives Jeremy an immediate erection. \"Yeah I was a Phi Delt.\" That was it we were all best friends. We all went around doing the \"secret\" handshake and then sat and listened as Wright entertained us with his stories of being hazed by Eli Manning. Before we knew it the weed was gone. We said our goodbyes and parted ways.

But why would they? After all they were hammered, and Lieder was moving. They had spent about an hour the previous night and the better part of the afternoon constructing a ski and snowboard jump on the hill next to Steven\\'s cabin in Alta, Wyoming. Following the day of shoveling and packing and shaping the snow into a jump requiring about twice the skill level that any of them possessed to successfully land it. Earlier in the day during their first run when it was warm and the snow was slow and slushy they had not been able to jump high enough so they built it bigger and waited until it dropped back below freezing that night so they could shoot down their icy launchpad to certain injury. They made a playlist of their favorite heavy metal and gangsta rapmusic then they bought a couple of bottles of sake and a thirty pack of beer. The procedure was simple. Pour a shot of sake, drop it in your beer and chug like your life depends on it. Continue until both beer and sake are finished. Once properly lubed up they proceeded to the launch area. Lieder for some reason had volunteered to go first. He stood at the top of the run looking at it, he then dropped in and made the short but icy trip to the ramp. Upon launch his board went straight up in the air along with his feet which were strapped in at the time. As he was making his descent with his feet above his head Lieder thought to himself \"This is not good.\" Needless to say the rest was not pretty.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621ni1aio5u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.03642,43.75399]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tour Guide","description":"Posted by Klieder<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621ni3tt7io"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0615,41.47978]}},{"properties":{"name":"Viva The Vegas","description":"Posted by KliederThey have to be funny to him.

People with every color of hair and skin and clothing imaginable have come through this town. He has seen drunker and funnier and dumber and louder and sexier and richer and crazier. On this morning though are two bleary eyed college kids that just stepped off a plane from Houston and are now guzzling the beers and shots of tequila he is putting in front of them like there is a fire in their stomachs they are trying to put out. He laughs as they react in horror when he tells them about his time spent in Utah and the fact that they only serve 3.2% beer and that you have to buy a ten dollar license at each bar to drink liquor. About this time the last member of this outrageous trio shows up and immediatley starts playing catch up as fast as he can. This goes on for about another hour and then it is time for the three to board their plane. The bartender probably thinks to himself I feel bad for whatever stewardess gets stuck with them.(little does he know that following two additional in flight beers one of the two lads from Houston puked all over himself.)

Up to this point I was getting pretty tired of being offered and then having to turn down offers to hit the crack pipe. I said lets go and we hopped in Steven\\'s Suburban to get some reefer before making the four and a half hour drive to Jackson Hole Wyoming. He said his name was Anthony. He was short wearing a black stocking cap,plain black T-shirt, ridiculously baggy black shorts and black socks and shoes. He was sporting some horribly done probably homemade tattoos, and carrying the filthiest old plastic Wal-Mart bag I had ever seen. I knew we were in for trouble when we had been in the car for less than two minutes and he already had a crack pipe out and started to smoke it. I looked at Jeremy and Steven and they had the same looks of shock and utter disbelief on their faces as I was sure was plastered across my face. Under normal circumstances we would have pulled over and kicked the guy out of the car or at least have made him put his piece away. This however was not normal circumstances. We needed enough ganja to make it nine days in Wyoming and right now this homeless crackhead was out only hope. While in route to the \"buy\" location our \"guide\" requested that we pull into a grocery store so that he could get a coke. We pull in, he goes into the store and returns in less than three minutes with a bottle of Boone\\'s Farm tucked into his oversized shorts. The drive from the store to our final destination takes about four minutes and in that time the little ratfink manages to swill teh entire bottle leaving his mouth bright orange. Now at the location I give him the 0 that we had agreed upon and he disappeared around the corner...and does not return. I had a feeling as soon as he shut the car door that my 0 was gone. Never the less we waited for fifteen minutes, he didn\\'t show. I get out of the car walk to the corner look both ways, of course he is long gone. I walk back to the Suburban and kick over some trash cans in disgust. Stupid trash cans, let that be a lesson.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621nhvjc7ed"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.83807,40.76598]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237577","metadata":null,"contact_name":"klieder","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:klieder","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237577","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":16,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237577,platial:user=klieder","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41961}
