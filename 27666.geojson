On day six he reached Blaenavon, known as the Birthplace of Steel. It is believed that the world\\'s first steelworks opened here in 1878. \n\nPostmaster Ken Booth, 63, (pictured) has only one counter in his town centre post office. To make ends meet, he has opened a bakery in the branch. He says: \\'Between the wars this town was thriving. There were about 17,500 people involved in or linked to the mining industry. Since the decline of the coal industry, Blaenavon has struggled to survive, but the town has refused to die and community services such as ours have been well supported.\\'  \n\nKen now believes the Government is introducing underhand measures that could force him to close despite widespread customer support. <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/consumer/article.html?in_article_id=336685&amp;in_page_id=5&amp;in_a_source=\">Read the full story</a> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/travelswithtoby\">Blog: Travels with Toby</a>\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrn4ic6o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.088056,51.776389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blyth post office","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrkp4dhj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.52161,55.12865]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brixham","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/GaryDeare1_100x110.jpg\">TQ5 8AGA blueprint for survival\r\n\r\nThe quiet Devon village of Galmpton near Brixham is an unlikely setting for a revolution. \r\n\r\nBut it is here that subpostmaster Gary Deare, 47, believes he has discovered a formula to transform the gloomy prospects of many threatened branches - with up to 3,000 facing the axe in the latest cull. \r\n\r\nSick of Government meddling, he has embraced the ideas of his local community to create a post office branch that is thriving against the odds. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/campaigns/savepo/article.html?in_article_id=416383&amp;in_page_id=508\">Read the full report</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/postoffice\">The campaign</a>\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrf9ek3b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.513381,50.395082]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brixham","description":"Posted by ThisismoneyBrixham<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrpchhr6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.74472,43.18583]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brixham","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/GaryDeare1_100x110_2_.jpeg\">TQ5 8AG<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrg7dvnj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.513381,50.395082]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cambridge","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://img.thisismoney.co.uk/i/pix/2007/01/KateEyles_200x220.jpg\">CB2 3AA, EnglandCambridge is lauded as a centre of academic excellence, but it also possesses an unenviable reputation  -  as home to the post office with the longest queues. \rThe branch in question is the main post office situated on St Andrew\\'s Street.

You bet. But rather than enjoy a cosy chat about it on the phone the editor decided it would be a far better idea if I got off my London-based backside and sampled this post office elixir first-hand.

But  there are a string of villages going W from Whitby up the Esk valley.    This is rural terrain with small winding roads and lots of steep hills and travelling around is not easy.   In winter roads may be treacherous - hills/ice/drifts (thought not much this winter).   In summer there may be \"tourist blockages\"  - especially since the screening of \"Heartbeat\"!  There are buses but infrequent. \n\nI live in Sleights - the second village up the valley from Whitby and have signed petition to keep our post office open.   It would be a real blow to the community if it closed.   Villages further up the valley have much worse communications and would be even more badly affected.\n\nSo, strength to the campaign.\n\nFrank Harwood<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyriwm1a8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.6633,54.45507]}},{"properties":{"name":"SouthWest","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrkyzl3i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.2627,50.59719]}},{"properties":{"name":"Southern","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/06/2/Flame_pic260706_60x60_7_.jpeg\">If you have never switched supplier\n\nGAS: British Gas - £568\nELECTRICITY: Scottish &amp; Southern Electric (Southern) - £379\n\nTOTAL ANNUAL BILL: £947\n\nIf you switch today\n\nBEST ONLINE PRICE (application and billing online): \nBritish Gas - £757\nSAVING: £190 (20%)\n\nBEST STANDARD TARIFF (Quarterly bills, cash/cheque): \nPowergen - £851\nSAVING: £96 (10%)\n\nBEST STANDARD TARIFF (Direct Debit): \nUtilita - £755\nSAVING: £192 (20%)\n\nSwitch your energy supplier now:\nhttp://www.thisismoney.co.uk/bills\n\nAll calculations are based on an annual usage of 20,500 kWh for gas and 3,300 kWh for electricity – Low users of gas or electricity may get a better deal from buying from separate suppliers.

At Watford, Hertfordshire, half the branches will go. Financial Mail asked customers and postmasters what they think.  We also asked Post Office boss David Mills to justify a closure plan that rips the heart out of local communities. \n\nCustomers waiting their turn at Vicarage Road post office smile wryly at a poster taped to the wall. It promises \\'one month for consultation with the community\\'. The month is up on February 20. But the shelves have already been emptied, the drinks refrigerator has been disconnected and the front doormat taken away. This tiny branch, close to the home of Watford football club, is among those facing the axe under the Post Office\\'s \\'urban reinvention programme\\'. <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/consumer/article.html?in_article_id=340294&amp;in_page_id=5&amp;in_a_source=\">Read the full story</a> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/travelswithtoby\">Blog: Travels with Toby</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrfkwbu5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.400063,51.652267]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wheatley","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75yyrq3h2in"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.13434,51.74659]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wheatley, Oxon","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/NeilMacCormack1_200x220_4_.jpg\">In March 2003, thousands of readers pledged to join our fight to save Britain\\'s post offices, and with the introduction of new payment methods for state pensions and other benefits, more people than ever were voicing their concerns. \n\nNeil MacCormack, 45, sub-postmaster at Wheatley in Oxfordshire, says: \\'If we do not act now, it will be too late.
