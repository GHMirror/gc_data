I come from a place where comic shop/sports card stores were ubiquitous, so this place just blew me away the first time I was there.\n\nCurrently, they are a little toy crazy.  I am hoping that trend dies down soon.\n\nNevertheless, they have the biggest selection ever.  Highlights include a VERY serious indie section and a comprehensive international section.  They also support local zines and mini-comics not to mention housing Jordan Crane\\'s amazingness.\n\nFurther features include having a nice gallery in back and have had shows by people like Rene French when not a lot of people knew of her total genius yet—not to mention the full floor to above-your-head MARVEL and DC walls (yes WALLS).\n\nPlease go there if you are in LA, even if only to lose yourself for a few good hours.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68o1v83mkrr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.353385,34.098042]}},{"properties":{"name":"secret headquarters","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/secret_headquarters_1_web.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/secret_headquarters_interior.jpg\">3817 w. sunset blvd. los angeles, caThis is a different kind of comic shop.  I would be more inclined to call this a comic gallery that sells comics.  You do have some of the standards but this place offers more \"high end\" comic fare and indie/small press offerings.  The guys who run it are nice (for comic store owners) and they support local work.  However, they also have some serious knowledge and put on really good art shows.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68o1v1ncxmc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.27904,34.091052]}},{"properties":{"name":"skylight books","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/getty_ditwl_bookstore_owner_20041030_3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/link_skylight.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/lucywindow2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/CB&amp;TMPGL.jpg\">1818 N. Vermont Avenue, los angelesFor this map, I limited my choices to 3 comic stores.  Meltdown comics is the biggest and the best for comics.  Secret Headquarters is the snobbiest and most galleryesque comic store.  However, Skylight Books is my favorite.\n\nSkylight Books has a hand picked comic section and the largest zine selection in LA.  They also specialize in small press literature.  Those are basically 3 of my favorite things besides bikes and coffee.\n\nIf you don\\'t know anything about comics, you can just pick something out of Skylight\\'s selection and it will be good.  If you know everything about comics, Skylight\\'s selection is small yet, picked by someone who seriously knows their stuff.  Further, they are the biggest supporter in LA of mini-comics and zines.  The guy in charge of indie and DIY press has been doing this as long as I have been putting out zines (or longer) and besides being amazingly cool, has knowledge of what is happening without the troll aspect found in every other comic dweller spot.\n\nLast, there are rarely comic trolls in the store, which is a relief.  My least favorite comic store is on the westest side of LA.  Just walking by the place gives you the sense of what I am talking about, most notably from the olfactory region.  On a recent visit to “the other side of town.”  The B.O. smell was overpowering to even my girlfriend, who can’t usually smell anything and there was fresh vomit blocking the front façade.  Although I find such scenes romantic as a comic nerd, I would much rather a well picked selection of the very best in mainstream and indie comics in a bookstore environment with a nice orange tabby to keep me company while I browse (who is especially fond of scratches in the chin).\n\nOverall, Skylight Books is simply the best all around bookstore in LA.\n\nLast, I HATE Los Feliz but I come here all the time just to go to this bookstore.  At all times, I avoid Los Feliz if possible but I find myself making trips to this store regardless.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68o1v50dyan"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.291631,34.103943]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/9750","metadata":null,"contact_name":"lolly","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:lolly","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/9750","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":31,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=9750,platial:user=lolly","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":31730}
