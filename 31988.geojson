But look at the satellite image for a second. Look at the spacing of those trees. Most of Goldhead is covered with turkey oaks. When you\\'re flying along I-95 south towards Orlando, you\\'re seeing woodlands that are artificially thick due to \"management\". Most forests in Florida would manage themselves, usually through fires. The reason that they are so thick in places is due to letting growth continue in an unnatural fashion. Fires are actually part of the life cycle of forests, God\\'s way of keeping things in check. Those turkey oaks (plus some pines) are another example of how Florida should look.\nGreat place.
