Tim defines his company not as a book or online publisher, or as a conference producer (though the company does all three), but as a technology transfer company, \"changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators.\" Tim is on the board of CollabNet, and was on the board of Macromedia until its 2005 merger with Adobe. In March 2007, Tim joined MySQL ABâ€™s Board of Directors\n\nIn 2001, Tim was involved in a dispute with Amazon.com, leading a protest against Amazon\\'s one-click patent, and specifically, Amazon\\'s use of that patent against rival barnesandnoble.com. The protest ended with Tim and Jeff Bezos visiting Washington D.C. to lobby for patent reform. Amazon has continued to file many patents, and the Barnes &amp; Noble case was settled. As of 2006, Amazon has not repeated the events by suing for patent infringement.\n\nIn December 2006, O\\'Reilly\\'s publishing firm donated 0,000 to Creative Commons, demonstrating his interest in the Free Culture movement.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66zfzvm8f92"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.47,51.900001]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/90147","metadata":null,"contact_name":"tracy_the_astonishing","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:tracy_the_astonishing","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/90147","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=90147,platial:user=tracy_the_astonishing","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":46226}
