The features that made the Dalston restaurant a classic are all in place here too, though at this branch the decor is more restaurant than café. A full range of starters is offered, and they are well made, but only the truly starving should indulge. Once a grill is ordered, a large salad and cold starters will be brought without any need to order extra: usually onion in chilli, and onion in pomegranate and turnip sauce. These are accompanied by endlessly replenished supplies of warm pide bread. Service is quick, efficient, and friendly. The grills are exceptional. A portion of kaburga lamb ribs was generous, with the fat richly flavoured from the grill. Turkish pizzas are also available. Continuing to stand out in this outstanding area, both branches of this business are unreservedly recommended.\n\nTime Out Eating &amp; Drinking Guide 2006\n\nSend to a frien\n\nBooking: Booking advisable Fri, Sat\nChild facilities: Babies and children welcome: high chairs\nDisabled: toilet\nTakeaway service: Takeaway service<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxbajkx7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.07339,51.561985]}},{"properties":{"name":"Acorn House","description":"Posted by Atodedeus69 swinton st, LondonAcorn House.

The pair used to work together at Putney Bridge restaurant (now closed), and while it was a much-lauded, more formal affair, one senses that they learned not only what to do but what not to do. The Soho restaurant may not be an imposing piece of architecture like their former territory, but it’s more approachable, and the set lunch/pre-theatre menu is a steal (three courses for £15.50 or £17.50 respectively). The wine prices are extremely kind, and the choice by the carafe (250ml, one-third of a bottle) is outstanding. Food is seasonal and indigenous where possible, though chef Demetre’s recipes pick ingredients and techniques from France, Italy, North Africa and the USA. Starters may include salad with fresh sheep’s ricotta and summer vegetables (a great-looking dish that tastes even better than it looks) and squid and mackerel ‘burger’ with barbecue sauce. Main courses take in bavette of beef persillade with exquisite dauphinoise potatoes, and gnocchi with parmesan and vegetables. To finish, a classic crème brûlée with langue de chat, or cheesecake with strawberries and strawberry caramel. Nearly everything we’ve tried has been cooked to an excellent standard. If you want to niggle, the room’s a bit bland and the lack of soft furnishings pushes the noise levels up. But Arbutus is an impressive operation with real heart and verve – and a worthy winner.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxab1cpk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.132247,51.514305]}},{"properties":{"name":"B's BBQ","description":"Posted by Atodedeus2800 W 5th St, Greenville, Pitt, North Carolina 27834, United States\r\nHaving been a frequent visitor to the Greenville, N.C. area for decades, being a consultant and contractor to various business and governmental entities in that area over the past years, it was like finding a porcine cuisine holy shrine when an old boss first took me to B’s Barbecue &amp; Grill for my first lunch there way back in the when. \r\n\r\nEven among fellow four-pig rated establishments, B’s is unique. It’s perfect fine-chop Eastern-NC-Style BBQ is simultaneously perhaps the greasiest of all the 4-pig-rated ‘cues, the grease in it immediately staining your clothes if a bite of it falls from you sandwich or fork and hits your lap, while also being probably the easiest to digest, not making you feel too full or queasy basically no matter how much you eat, two facts I’ve never been able to quite reconcile. You eat an equivalent amount of barbecue from Cooper’s, Bullock’s, Wilber’s, etc. and you will feel twice as full as you will from the same volumetric and weight balance of meat from B’s; go figure? \r\n\r\nIn a segment of the restaurant business known for its unique and eccentric establishments, B’s seemingly goes out of its way to promote their own little quirks, such as not having a listed business phone and for closing down unexpectedly at lunchtime when it looks like the amount of barbecue they cooked the night before will only feed the number of customers in-line inside the building, those waiting outside and in their cars being totally SOL for their barbecue until the next day when they start the process all over again. \r\n\r\nClosing down once all their barbecue is sold or looks like it will be soon sold isn’t totally unique to them, Bum’s in Ayden is also notorious for that as well as a couple of other lesser-known places, but B’s does this with such a glint-in-the-eye-delight it makes me wonder at times if they deliberately don’t cook quite enough for the next day’s anticipated demand just to make sure they will indeed completely sell out for that next day. Unlike many larger barbecue establishments, B’s does not and will not freeze and re-thaw and re-serve leftover barbeque for any reason, they simply won’t do that, which guarantees complete freshness but also a bit of frustration if you don’t arrive there early enough for lunch. \r\n\r\nOne thing that has always tickled me about the very mixed but typically so for the better barbecue establishments like B’s clientele which is a polyglot of and across all economic and social classes, barbeque being the great democratizer of American foods, chuted together inside the tiny dining room drawn there by a common love of some of the best barbecue you’ll ever have is to see the occasional white lab coat with engraved black nametag sported by someone who is obviously a physician from the nearby East Carolina School Of Medicine just down the road coming to, pardon the expression, pig out alongside their less medically educated fellow citizenry, being one member of the same profession that so routinely scolds you for eating such high-fat, high-bad-cholesterol but oh-so-perfect primally satisfying flesh of boar, their sometimes slight sheepish looks modestly communicating “well, hey, it is lunch and it is B’s for pete’s sake and like it’s any of your bid’ness but this is only a once-a-month treat I allow for myself.” \r\n\r\nIf you’re \"Down East\" for any reason, anywhere within driving distance of B’s anytime close to lunch, you simply have to try to get to them or you’ll kick yourself for not having done so. \r\n\r\nGetting to B’s from anywhere couldn’t be easier, just take US Highway 264 East or West and when you get to the Highway 43 exit near Greenville, take that south for a couple of miles and you’ll almost pass it the first time if you haven’t slowed down and are looking for it, B’s being at the corner of Highway 43/W. 5th Street and B’s Barbecue Road, 2800 W. 5th St. &amp; 700 B’s Barbecue Rd. in Greenville N.C. to be exact, a link to a YahooMap is below, and enjoy! \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxbkiuf5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.402419,35.613527]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bar Shu","description":"Posted by Atodedeus28 Frith St\nW1D 5LF Map\nSoho\n020 7287 6688<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx8hhh60"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.130825,51.512772]}},{"properties":{"name":"Beach Burrito Company","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 4 berwick street, londonN\\'s comment: This is the place you\\'ve been waiting for!

I can’t recall the exact number of nations represented but it is certainly true that there are few creeds and colours not to be found in this weather beaten old place we call home.\n\nSo, I guess, it should have come as no surprise to me to find myself having supper on the Goswell Rd in an “Italian” café now run by a Bulgarian who, in the evening, offers up Tex Mex food while I was seated at a table between two Chinese students and a German tourist\n\nBut there you have it, and more than acceptable it was too. Certainly better than any of the abominable meals I had last week each of which cost at least three times as much.\n\nWhile I looked at the menu, the owner brought out some store bought nachos for me to nibble on alongside some salsa which he had beefed up with the addition of plenty of green chilli.\n\nThe menu itself is short and to the point. About six or so starters, alongside the usual suspects of the Tex mex world, Chimichanga, Enchilada, Burritos and Fajitas. But, much is made of the fact that it is all made fresh to order so there is a need to be a little patient as the kitchen is small and he seems to be a bit of a one man band.\n\nWell, fresh it certainly was. A well made Quesadilla was stuffed full of smoked chicken and would have been a meal in itself for £4.50 coming, as it did with a good dollop of fresh guacamole.\n\nBut, I am in the last stages of “carbing up” for the big race on Sunday and decided I needed more. So, I added an order of mixed enchilada with a side order of Pico de Gallo.\n\nThe enchilada were as they ought to be, a mass of meat cheese and doughy goodness with an added dose of chillies to pump it up a bit. The Pico was bright and tangy and ,for £6, there was enough here to feed two people.\n\nChatting to the owner, it appears he used to work in a Mexican restaurant in North London when he first came to the country. The owners, still his friends, come from Oaxaca and suggested he try some of the more straight forward dishes when he was looking for something to bring in people in the evening and to offer up for take away and delivery.\n\nWell, he has made a very decent stab at it and is serving up some simple but tasty food ( remember the time when food was judged by how tasty it was rather than how clever or pretty?) at very reasonable prices. With a Diet Pepsi (I have to watch my weight don’t you know?) the bill was about £12.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx9b0w4r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.099701,51.526129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cottons","description":"Posted by AtodedeusNW1 8ANThere are two ways to approach Caribbean cuisine: one is to create new dishes from indigenous ingredients; the other is to do the classic dishes well.

A tangy papaya coulis gave a welcome zesty edge to king prawn and pineapple kebabs. Large portions meant we struggled to do justice to the mains: a superb traditional curried goat with rice and peas, and a less successful salmon fillet with spicy black beans, pickled red onions and sweet soy dressing, which we found a mite too sweet.

Once that green and sickly-sweet cocktail became a standard, you could almost hear the public address announcer: “The martini has left the building.”\n\nLuckily, its ingredients stayed in the building. And for those travelers who think a stiff martini is the perfect pairing for a weekend in the city, you won’t have to look far.\n\nThese days, you can get martinis made with care in two different kinds of New York bars: the old-school spaces, where it feels like having anything but a martini (or maybe a Manhattan) is just wrong; and at the new generation of cocktail bars, where the entrance is often hidden, the mixers are fresh-squeezed, bitters are back and every drink is made with almost appalling care by bartenders who would rather shake up drinks than chat up customers. There, a martini is a good test of the staff.\n\nThey usually pass. Witness the recent dialogue between a cocktail waitress and a customer at the Flatiron Lounge, one of the standard-bearers of the new-wave New York cocktail.\n\n“I’d like a martini. Can you suggest an interesting gin?”\n\n“Do you like Hendrick’s?”\n\n(Slight pause.) “Yes.”\n\n“Have you tried Hendrick’s?”\n\n“No.”\n\nGin amateur, totally (if politely) busted. The waitress continued.\n\n“It’s lighter, with cucumber tones. We suggest it with a cucumber instead of olives or a twist.”\n\nDone. And very refreshing. Only problem: the Flatiron can get packed, and packed bars are not conducive to martini-sipping. But be careful what you wish for: controlled entry can guarantee elbow room but can also force long waits in lines that range from annoying to extremely annoying.\n\nTopping the list of annoyance two Saturdays ago around 11 p.m. was the line outside Little Branch in the West Village, a faux speakeasy that in this case is identified with nothing more than a subtle plaque affixed to the door. As suspiciously good-looking clients who were “meeting someone who already had a table” flowed in, the line stagnated, and many people wandered off into the night.\n\nBut once you’re downstairs in the quirkily shaped basement space, you see the point. The bar is pleasantly crowded but not at all intolerable; the bartenders take things seriously back there, and — could it be? — those people “who already had a table” seem to have met friends who already had a table.\n\nHere the martinis are stirred unless you ask for shaken, with a bit of vermouth unless you ask for more, and with hand-cracked ice standard. The hand-cracked part in most settings would seem unseemly, but as the bartenders take a chunk of ice and batter it against their bare palm with a cocktail spoon, it seems an odd luxury (and surely you just missed the precracking Purell application). The only problem is that everyone is waltzing around the place with drinks (Is that caramelized ginger? Is that fresh cream?) so cool-looking that you might be tempted to stray.\n\nKeeping a martini cold is serious business, and different spots have different approaches. One is to freeze the heck out of just about everything that comes into contact with it, like at Pegu Club, another high-end cocktail standard. Both the stirring pitcher and the glass itself come frosted, and the ice, cracked in the hands of the bartender, is dumped on top of the gin, then stirred, and chills things for a bit longer than you might expect.\n\nThe other approach to keeping things cold is taken by Death &amp; Company, another of the subtly marked, Prohibition-inspired spots where crowd numbers are tightly controlled, resulting in an unusual scene for a popular New York bar: everyone gets a seat. (Here, they take your cellphone number and call you when they’re ready.) To give you more time with your cold martini, whatever doesn’t fit in your glass goes into a iced mini-carafe at its side.\n\nFewer lines, older crowds and reduced frills are what you’ll find at the more old-school spots, often in the grand hotels. The King Cole room at the St. Regis off Fifth Avenue charges a whopping 8 for a martini, but that includes mahogany paneling and a view of Maxfield Parrish’s “Old King Cole” mural. But it is a whopping size as well, and you’ll need to down it fast, before it gets warm — no carafe here.\n\nBemelmans, another old-school bar at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, takes care of the problem by serving in a smaller glass and adding an iced carafe with the leftovers. There’s live music (with cover after 9:30), murals by Ludwig Bemelmans on the walls, and bartenders in red vests who are jokey in safely salty ways (“Are these seats taken?” ask two men striding up to the bar. “Yes, by two hot girls coming soon.” Ha.) It’s the sort of place where if you order a Diet Coke, they bring it in an eight-ounce glass bottle and pour it over ice in a way that appears as minimally unclassy as possible.

It’s the only practical response.\n\nBut Dovetail isn’t about practicality, not with its rotating sherry list, its lamb’s tongue and its beef-cheek lasagne bedecked with king trumpet mushrooms.\n\nNo, this restaurant is a bold wager that a patch of the Upper West Side with an unreliable appetite for adventurous — even somewhat fussy — dining will embrace it, at least if it’s executed with skill and panache.\n\nAnd the bet seems to be paying off, because on that blustery night I encountered a dining room with just about all of the 80 seats filled by 8:30.\n\nWhat a warm surprise. And what a testament to the intriguing, compelling work that John Fraser, Dovetail’s chef and principal owner, is doing here.\n\nBoth he and his pastry chef, Vera Tong, come at their cooking with intellect and wit, but they seldom get too cerebral, too cute. Leaving quotation marks out of the titles of dishes, they leave it to you to make certain connections.\n\nThere’s an appetizer that combines two of the most fashionable ingredients in upscale restaurants these days, seared pork belly and a slowly poached egg, and as soon as you taste them together, you smile at what’s afoot. It’s breakfast for dinner, only at breakfast the belly is smoked and called bacon.\n\nIn one of the entrees, curls and chunks of lobster are scattered around monkfish, reminding you that this fish has often been cast as the poor man’s lobster, vaguely similar in texture but not nearly as sweet.\n\nSo you find yourself not only enjoying but also comparing the two kinds of seafood. Then you notice some seared foie gras, which may or may not be another inspired bit of culinary free-association, inasmuch as monkfish liver has been presented as the foie gras of the sea.\n\nIs that the idea? Does it matter? Not really, because the dish works, its less and more opulent players establishing something along the lines of a rhythm.\n\nAnd the real point is that such crafty plotting of a composition seems entirely plausible, given the amount of energy Mr. Fraser lavishes on his dishes.\n\nThe lamb’s tongue — breaded, fried and straight out of Mario Batali’s offal dreams — is part of a deconstructed muffuletta sandwich that includes olives, pimentos, a caper mayonnaise and a visually arresting spiral of salami, provolone cheese and more. That’s just an appetizer.\n\nThe beef-cheek lasagne is among the entrees, but it’s essentially a side to unerringly salted slices of sirloin steak. Many chefs would be content to throw a potato gratin at the beef.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Tong fashions a nifty brioche bread pudding studded with a brittle made of bacon. It’s breakfast for dessert, only at breakfast the bread pudding takes the form of French toast.\n\nMr. Fraser and Ms. Tong worked together at Compass, a restaurant that went through a changing cast of chefs, all saddled with its large scale and peculiar atmospherics.\n\nDovetail, which opened in December, is a better fit for them, the simplicity of its brown palette, bare wood tables and exposed brick at once balancing out, and allowing you to focus on, the ambition of their food.\n\nThe inconspicuousness of the restaurant’s entrance may be bonkers or in fact brilliant, a subtle signal of Dovetail’s confidence in its inner strength. The carpeting and padded walls in the back definitely make sense. They keep noise in check.\n\nDepending on where you sit, the restaurant can feel too plain for entrees that average above 0. The wines by the glass could be more exciting, and a few dishes don’t succeed, like an appetizer marriage of skate and chicken wings that’s inspired by semantics more than anything else.\n\nAll of that gives me concern about the possibility of a slightly disappointing dinner here. But most of my experiences were hugely positive.\n\nDovetail further strengthens its case with a nightly five-course tasting menu that’s kindly priced at 5. The Sunday prix fixe — three courses for 8 — is quite simply one of the best deals in town. And when I had it the options weren’t dreary second stringers.\n\nThey included the restaurant’s gnocchi, flavor-bombed with veal short rib and foie gras butter, and a shrimp dish that resurrects hollandaise and makes you wonder why it fell out of vogue. At Dovetail it avoids its potentially gluey fate, and it’s offset by the sweetness and tartness of grapefruit segments.\n\nThe shrimp are upgraded to scallops for the version of the dish on the à la carte menu on other nights. For the tasting menu on those nights, Mr. Fraser mixes things up anew, choosing ham, endive and kumquats as the scallops’ supporting cast.\n\nWhen I had that dish, the seafood was beautifully cooked, as was a yogurt-lapped lamb duo (leg and rack) and an autumnal treatment of tender venison with chestnut and yam.\n\nDid Mr. Fraser need both of those sidekicks for the venison? Sometimes he seems too eager to please, overworking dishes.\n\nBut he’ll also pull back and trust in the basic, homespun pleasures of something like the buttery white Cheddar corn bread at the start of every meal. It’s the epitome of comfort, and a potent antidote to the coldest of winter nights.\n\nDovetail\n\n***\n\n103 West 77th Street, Upper West Side; (212) 362-3800.\n\nATMOSPHERE A brown palette, bare wood tables and exposed brick create a simple, cozy stage for attention-getting food.\n\nSOUND LEVEL Moderately loud.\n\nRECOMMENDED DISHES Gnocchi with veal short ribs; lamb’s tongue; pork belly; scallops; halibut; venison; lamb; cod; brioche bread pudding; peanut butter praline tart.\n\nWINE LIST A diverse, comprehensive and somewhat expensive sampling from the New and Old Worlds, with too few truly appealing reds under 0 a bottle.\n\nPRICE RANGE Dinner appetizers, 2 to 7; entrees, 7 to 6; desserts, 0.

Getting on the DLR is like getting on public transport in a foreign city; the seats are odd, the signage is odd and some of the people on their way home are, well let’s not go into that eh?\n\nStill once you do get to Crossharbour station it’s all rather exciting. There are the old dock cranes around Millwall Dock, now silhouetted against the sky and rather frightening in their enormous stillness, the new houses with their lights reflecting in the still waters and then there is El Faro, a piece of Spain out here on the Isle of Dogs. With its outside terrace right up against the water, and the heady waft of garlic from the kitchens, it recreates the best of a holiday restaurant in Spain, without the downside of bald, fat blokes in England T-shirts necking down cooking lager at the next table.\n\nStarters range from a selection of cheeses or cured meats, through octopus, meatballs, squid Andulasian style and, rather surprisingly, sea urchins sautéed with eggs and wild mushrooms. Our homemade chorizo sausage cooked in cider was first class. Not at all oily or made up of greasy slices, but a tender, spicy and plump whole sausage, semi sliced along its length to avoid the ‘horse’s willy’ effect on the plate, which can be somewhat off-putting. Presentation at El Faro is well thought out all the way through, avoiding the café feel most tapas bars promote. King prawns cooked in a bath of olive oil and garlic were generous, the garlic unburnt and the oil good quality. Some bread would have been nice at this point, but I didn’t see any on the other tables (all full) either so maybe it’s not the done thing in Spain. House red, a gutsy well-priced Rioja, easily had the muscle to deal with the hearty flavours being served up.\n\nThere is less choice in the mains, reflecting the Spanish preference for lots of small dishes, but an entrecote steak from northern Spain was simply done and very good; high quality beef snuggled up to Cantabric pillow beans whose texture made it clear they had been cooked from dry and not out of a tin. The garlic and parsley ali-oli made all the right noises alongside. Good too was pork fillet wrapped in bacon and plumped on potatoes immersed in a sauce of wild mushrooms and rosemary. Generous portions, as well. We couldn’t finish it. Other tempting mains included Irish cod on spring garlic and tuna loin with ratatouille. And of course, there is a paella option.\n\nCrema catalana was frothy and fun with, at the bottom, a jam of apple and cinnamon. Like every course it was well above average and very fairly priced. Service is friendly and well meaning, but it’s not fine dining service even if the food and presentation is. El Faro is an oasis of quality in an area too dominated otherwise by Indian and Chinese places and with its waterside location it deserves to do as well as it is clearly doing. It may be a long way from Central London, but it’s a lot nearer than Spain.

Once that green and sickly-sweet cocktail became a standard, you could almost hear the public address announcer: “The martini has left the building.”\n\nLuckily, its ingredients stayed in the building. And for those travelers who think a stiff martini is the perfect pairing for a weekend in the city, you won’t have to look far.\n\nThese days, you can get martinis made with care in two different kinds of New York bars: the old-school spaces, where it feels like having anything but a martini (or maybe a Manhattan) is just wrong; and at the new generation of cocktail bars, where the entrance is often hidden, the mixers are fresh-squeezed, bitters are back and every drink is made with almost appalling care by bartenders who would rather shake up drinks than chat up customers. There, a martini is a good test of the staff.\n\nThey usually pass. Witness the recent dialogue between a cocktail waitress and a customer at the Flatiron Lounge, one of the standard-bearers of the new-wave New York cocktail.\n\n“I’d like a martini. Can you suggest an interesting gin?”\n\n“Do you like Hendrick’s?”\n\n(Slight pause.) “Yes.”\n\n“Have you tried Hendrick’s?”\n\n“No.”\n\nGin amateur, totally (if politely) busted. The waitress continued.\n\n“It’s lighter, with cucumber tones. We suggest it with a cucumber instead of olives or a twist.”\n\nDone. And very refreshing. Only problem: the Flatiron can get packed, and packed bars are not conducive to martini-sipping. But be careful what you wish for: controlled entry can guarantee elbow room but can also force long waits in lines that range from annoying to extremely annoying.\n\nTopping the list of annoyance two Saturdays ago around 11 p.m. was the line outside Little Branch in the West Village, a faux speakeasy that in this case is identified with nothing more than a subtle plaque affixed to the door. As suspiciously good-looking clients who were “meeting someone who already had a table” flowed in, the line stagnated, and many people wandered off into the night.\n\nBut once you’re downstairs in the quirkily shaped basement space, you see the point. The bar is pleasantly crowded but not at all intolerable; the bartenders take things seriously back there, and — could it be? — those people “who already had a table” seem to have met friends who already had a table.\n\nHere the martinis are stirred unless you ask for shaken, with a bit of vermouth unless you ask for more, and with hand-cracked ice standard. The hand-cracked part in most settings would seem unseemly, but as the bartenders take a chunk of ice and batter it against their bare palm with a cocktail spoon, it seems an odd luxury (and surely you just missed the precracking Purell application). The only problem is that everyone is waltzing around the place with drinks (Is that caramelized ginger? Is that fresh cream?) so cool-looking that you might be tempted to stray.\n\nKeeping a martini cold is serious business, and different spots have different approaches. One is to freeze the heck out of just about everything that comes into contact with it, like at Pegu Club, another high-end cocktail standard. Both the stirring pitcher and the glass itself come frosted, and the ice, cracked in the hands of the bartender, is dumped on top of the gin, then stirred, and chills things for a bit longer than you might expect.\n\nThe other approach to keeping things cold is taken by Death &amp; Company, another of the subtly marked, Prohibition-inspired spots where crowd numbers are tightly controlled, resulting in an unusual scene for a popular New York bar: everyone gets a seat. (Here, they take your cellphone number and call you when they’re ready.) To give you more time with your cold martini, whatever doesn’t fit in your glass goes into a iced mini-carafe at its side.\n\nFewer lines, older crowds and reduced frills are what you’ll find at the more old-school spots, often in the grand hotels. The King Cole room at the St. Regis off Fifth Avenue charges a whopping 8 for a martini, but that includes mahogany paneling and a view of Maxfield Parrish’s “Old King Cole” mural. But it is a whopping size as well, and you’ll need to down it fast, before it gets warm — no carafe here.\n\nBemelmans, another old-school bar at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, takes care of the problem by serving in a smaller glass and adding an iced carafe with the leftovers. There’s live music (with cover after 9:30), murals by Ludwig Bemelmans on the walls, and bartenders in red vests who are jokey in safely salty ways (“Are these seats taken?” ask two men striding up to the bar. “Yes, by two hot girls coming soon.” Ha.) It’s the sort of place where if you order a Diet Coke, they bring it in an eight-ounce glass bottle and pour it over ice in a way that appears as minimally unclassy as possible. In some quarters, the barman might be tempted to pour it through a strainer into a conical, stemmed glass and call it a DietCokeatini.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxjz4ch0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.992545,40.739578]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fox &amp; Anchor","description":"Posted by Atodedeus115 charterhouse street, londonThis beautifully restored pub is almost too good to be true.

By dinnertime the pita is made and Mrs. Halabi is at work in the open kitchen at the back of the 18-seat space, meticulously composing appetizer platters and tending to baskets of falafel in the deep fryer.\n\nMrs. Halabi says her restaurant is the first outpost of Druse cooking in New York, and I have no evidence to contradict her.\n\nHer experience and her traditions come from Daliat el-Carmel, Israel, where her family operates a restaurant and from where her grandmother, who owns a spice shop, sends regular shipments of the spices Mrs. Halabi deploys in her kitchen.\n\nThe Druse live mainly in the mountains of Syria, Lebanon and Israel, and much of their cooking will be familiar to anyone who knows the cuisine of the region.\n\nThe differences are in the details, like that Druse pita — called sagg pita, after the griddle it is cooked on — which Mrs. Halabi makes daily. It’s thinner than a crepe, as wide as a small pizza and pliable like lavash. A sprinkle of cornmeal gives it texture, but it is mildly flavored: an accompaniment, not an event in itself.\n\nAs such, it comes with everything at Gazala Place, and the best way to get a taste of almost everything is to order a platter of appetizers for the table and share it.\n\nThe platter will include a mound of creamy hummus and an appealingly chalky plop of labanee made with goat’s cheese doused with green olive oil. (“At home we use goat cheese for everything,” Mrs. Halabi told me.)\n\nA dollop of baba ghanouj, sweeter and lighter than most around town, rounds out the dips; the characteristic smoky char that the eggplant picks up from the grill is edged to the side by a bright, acidic addition of tahini.\n\nThe platter will also include fried things: falafel shaped like gumdrops and remarkably light (Mrs. Halabi says this is because she does not use fava beans in her falafel batter); kibbe, those little footballs of bulgur wheat and ground meat; and deep-fried cigars of potato or meat wrapped in sagg pita and spiced in a style that evokes Indian samosas.\n\nAs if that is not enough, it will also include two kinds of piping hot stuffed grape leaves (some with meat, some without), tabbouleh that is pert and fresh and has a distinctly hand-chopped texture, house-made yogurt to dip things in and sometimes more.\n\nThough I seldom needed much else after tackling that appetizer platter, the temptations were hard to resist. Mrs. Halabi is an accomplished baker. Her menu includes a roster of Druse breads (.50 to ) topped with spices, cheese or meat, or some combination of the three.\n\nOne night there was a tray of just-baked burekas sitting in the window. The sesame-and-spice-crusted burekas looked like fluffy, oversize everything bagels, but instead of the doughy reality of New York bagels they were as flaky and buttery as the best puff pastry, with a thick, rich filling of goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes hidden inside.\n\nMain courses are simple affairs. Eggplant abounds. There are good but not great beef and lamb kebabs (0.95 to 5.95) and a selection of good-value hummus plates (.50).\n\nAmong the hummus plates, some, like foule moudammas, are common in Middle Eastern restaurants here. Others, like one with a pile of lamb sausage on a bed of hummus with pine nuts, are more specific to the tradition Ms. Halabi is cooking in.\n\nSalads were the one weak spot. The Dalia (), for example, stinted on its promise of mint and walnuts and was overly generous with chopped iceberg lettuce and bitingly hot raw garlic.\n\nBut all is made right at dessert, especially when it’s a dish of osh al-saraia (.50), an alliance of cream, honey, orange blossom and rose waters cooked down to a gelatinous consistency and garnished with ground pistachios, and a pot of sludgy, black Turkish coffee to send you off into the night.\n\nGazala Place\n\n709 Ninth Avenue (49th Street), Clinton; (212) 245-0709.\n\nBEST DISHES Falafel; baba ghanouj; tabbouleh; burekas; kafta kebab; osh al-saraia.\n\nPRICE RANGE Starters, sandwiches and salads,  to .50; main courses, 0.95 to 9.95; desserts, .50 to .50.

Boom, Boom ) and I must have walked past it nearly 1000 times but never thought about going in.\n\nHowever, tonight, prompted by one of my regular sushi cravings and by a post on Chowhound asking if it was any good, I decided to pop by and give it a go.\n\nThe décor is very old school and, judging by the other clientele, designed to appeal almost entirely to an expat crowd. The service is just as old school and none the worse for that. Charming from start to finish.\n\nI know that once a week ( Monday? ) they have a very popular buffet. Tonight though, just the standard menu with its standard offerings which was fine by me as my sushi pangs always lead me in the same direction. Deep fried followed by raw.\n\nAfter a little comped dish of cabbage with tofu, I started, as ever, with assorted tempura which was very well done indeed with greaseless frying and light airy batter.\n\nTo follow a selection of sushi and sashimi from the a la carte menu. I plumped for Fatty Tuna and Sea Bass for the sashimi. Not quite as sparkling as that provided at Saki, but fresh enough and well presented. The nigiri were a pretty samey choice of eel, crab and bream, but well done and, as they should be, on pleasingly warm rice. Natto futomaki felt worryingly healthy but, I could have easily downed more than the six portions per roll. Best of all, though, was the temaki ( hand roll ) of salmon skin which had the crunch of the fried skin with the fatty layer underneath as a counterpart.

Once that green and sickly-sweet cocktail became a standard, you could almost hear the public address announcer: “The martini has left the building.”\n\nLuckily, its ingredients stayed in the building. And for those travelers who think a stiff martini is the perfect pairing for a weekend in the city, you won’t have to look far.\n\nThese days, you can get martinis made with care in two different kinds of New York bars: the old-school spaces, where it feels like having anything but a martini (or maybe a Manhattan) is just wrong; and at the new generation of cocktail bars, where the entrance is often hidden, the mixers are fresh-squeezed, bitters are back and every drink is made with almost appalling care by bartenders who would rather shake up drinks than chat up customers. There, a martini is a good test of the staff.\n\nThey usually pass. Witness the recent dialogue between a cocktail waitress and a customer at the Flatiron Lounge, one of the standard-bearers of the new-wave New York cocktail.\n\n“I’d like a martini. Can you suggest an interesting gin?”\n\n“Do you like Hendrick’s?”\n\n(Slight pause.) “Yes.”\n\n“Have you tried Hendrick’s?”\n\n“No.”\n\nGin amateur, totally (if politely) busted. The waitress continued.\n\n“It’s lighter, with cucumber tones. We suggest it with a cucumber instead of olives or a twist.”\n\nDone. And very refreshing. Only problem: the Flatiron can get packed, and packed bars are not conducive to martini-sipping. But be careful what you wish for: controlled entry can guarantee elbow room but can also force long waits in lines that range from annoying to extremely annoying.\n\nTopping the list of annoyance two Saturdays ago around 11 p.m. was the line outside Little Branch in the West Village, a faux speakeasy that in this case is identified with nothing more than a subtle plaque affixed to the door. As suspiciously good-looking clients who were “meeting someone who already had a table” flowed in, the line stagnated, and many people wandered off into the night.\n\nBut once you’re downstairs in the quirkily shaped basement space, you see the point. The bar is pleasantly crowded but not at all intolerable; the bartenders take things seriously back there, and — could it be? — those people “who already had a table” seem to have met friends who already had a table.\n\nHere the martinis are stirred unless you ask for shaken, with a bit of vermouth unless you ask for more, and with hand-cracked ice standard. The hand-cracked part in most settings would seem unseemly, but as the bartenders take a chunk of ice and batter it against their bare palm with a cocktail spoon, it seems an odd luxury (and surely you just missed the precracking Purell application). The only problem is that everyone is waltzing around the place with drinks (Is that caramelized ginger? Is that fresh cream?) so cool-looking that you might be tempted to stray.\n\nKeeping a martini cold is serious business, and different spots have different approaches. One is to freeze the heck out of just about everything that comes into contact with it, like at Pegu Club, another high-end cocktail standard. Both the stirring pitcher and the glass itself come frosted, and the ice, cracked in the hands of the bartender, is dumped on top of the gin, then stirred, and chills things for a bit longer than you might expect.\n\nThe other approach to keeping things cold is taken by Death &amp; Company, another of the subtly marked, Prohibition-inspired spots where crowd numbers are tightly controlled, resulting in an unusual scene for a popular New York bar: everyone gets a seat. (Here, they take your cellphone number and call you when they’re ready.) To give you more time with your cold martini, whatever doesn’t fit in your glass goes into a iced mini-carafe at its side.\n\nFewer lines, older crowds and reduced frills are what you’ll find at the more old-school spots, often in the grand hotels. The King Cole room at the St. Regis off Fifth Avenue charges a whopping 8 for a martini, but that includes mahogany paneling and a view of Maxfield Parrish’s “Old King Cole” mural. But it is a whopping size as well, and you’ll need to down it fast, before it gets warm — no carafe here.\n\nBemelmans, another old-school bar at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, takes care of the problem by serving in a smaller glass and adding an iced carafe with the leftovers. There’s live music (with cover after 9:30), murals by Ludwig Bemelmans on the walls, and bartenders in red vests who are jokey in safely salty ways (“Are these seats taken?” ask two men striding up to the bar. “Yes, by two hot girls coming soon.” Ha.) It’s the sort of place where if you order a Diet Coke, they bring it in an eight-ounce glass bottle and pour it over ice in a way that appears as minimally unclassy as possible. In some quarters, the barman might be tempted to pour it through a strainer into a conical, stemmed glass and call it a DietCokeatini.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxg8sqa8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.004784,40.730134]}},{"properties":{"name":"Locanda Locatelli","description":"Posted by Atodedeus8 Seymour Street, London W1H 7JZ\n\nExpensive but probably delicious Italian<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxd66h7n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.160269,51.514198]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mak's Noodle","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 77 Wellington Street, Central, Hong KongGreat little noodle shop in HK.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx5vpj4b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[114.154485,22.283106]}},{"properties":{"name":"Malmaison","description":"Posted by Atodedeus18-21 Charterhouse Square<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx5qm3gd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0999712944031,51.5205402082]}},{"properties":{"name":"Market","description":"Posted by AtodedeusNW1 7PN, londonThe Background: We have been planning for ages to have an international dinner club, where we go all over London in search of interesting ethnic restaurants.

Will Be the Chef (March 12, 2008)\n\nDiner\\'s Journal: Head Scratchers: the Hen Egg (April 11, 2008)\n\nTimes Topics: Three-Star Restaurants by Frank Bruni (NYC)\n\nTimes Topics: David Chang (Chef)\n\n\nRebecca McAlpin for The New York Times\nPeter Serpico and the other cooks at Momofuku Ko also serve the diners.\nBest of luck. Be strong. Be forewarned.\n\nYou can’t fixate on a specific night. You can’t fixate on a specific hour. You must have patience, an efficient computer and nimble, fast-moving fingers, because the way to grab one of the 12 coveted seats is to click-submit a reservation request at precisely 10 a.m. precisely six days before you aspire to dine there and then hope against hope and dream against dream and promise the cyberspace gods your firstborn male child if they speed your electronic wish to Ko before all the other electronic wishes get there.\n\nDrat! The gods must be lazy. It’s 10:00:09 and the computer is saying that every reservation has just been taken. Try again tomorrow, and the day after that. Promise the gods your chocolate Lab as well.\n\nKo doesn’t come easy, and that’s a big part of why it is, and will no doubt remain, the most talked-about new restaurant this year.\n\nBut it’s noteworthy beyond its addling all-computer reservation system and the intense, revelatory pleasures of its partly Asian, partly French, wholly inventive food.\n\nUnder the direction of the young chef David Chang, who has been celebrated to the point of deification, Ko boldly investigates how much — or rather how little — ceremony should attend the serious worship of serious cooking.\n\nAlthough dinner at Ko is a two-hour, eight-course, full-throttle commitment, it’s also an experiment in subtraction, in calculating which niceties can go without the enjoyment ebbing as well.\n\nProper tables and place settings? At Ko you belly up to a plain counter that wraps around a plain galley kitchen, and your chopsticks rest on a wine cork.\n\nLumbar support? At Ko you straddle a backless stool. Lovely scenery? There’s a plywood wall to your back and, in front of you, cooks so close you can count their beads of sweat as they not only prepare and plate your food but also hand it to you. You can feel the heat from the stoves like a sunburn on your brow.\n\nThere’s no hard liquor, no tea, no regular coffee and above all no choice. You eat dishes of Ko’s choosing in the order it chooses, and most everybody around you is having roughly the same meal.\n\nThe omakase experience at sushi bars is one point of reference; another is the feng shui of the French chef Joël Robuchon’s counter-centric L’Atelier restaurants. But Ko makes the interface between you and the cooks even more casual, more blithe: you sit like an Abdul in judgment of their ability to carry the Led Zeppelin tune blaring from the speakers, because try to carry it they will.\n\nKo pares down stuffy atmospherics in a particularly thorough way. It wagers that for a younger generation more focused on food than on frippery, a scruffy setting, small discomforts and little tyrannies are acceptable — preferable, even — if they’re reflected in the price.\n\nThey are. For 5 you get a number and caliber of dishes — including a wacky and wonderful blizzard of cold foie gras flakes and a cheeky panna cotta whose sweet, milky flavor mimics the sublime dregs of a bowl of cereal — that might cost 50 in a more formal environment.\n\nYou don’t get start-to-finish enchantment, but that’s not a function of insufficient coddling. It’s a function of where you set the bar for a restaurant that must master only a cluster of dishes on a given night, and that compels you to surrender so fully to its authority.\n\nUnder those terms there’s a promise of unwavering transcendence, and Ko in its early months serves a few dishes that merely intrigue along with others that utterly enrapture. It also falls prey to some inconsistency.\n\nTwice I was blown away by the first savory course, which follows an amuse-bouche of an English muffin soaked with whipped pork fat. It showcases uncooked fluke in a wash of buttermilk, yuzu and Sriracha that struck a thrilling balance of round and sharp notes, silky and spiky effects, coolness and heat. On top of this mix were enough toasted poppy seeds to give it a pleasant grittiness and a pointillist skin.\n\nBut the next time I had this dish, with scallop filling in for fluke, the Sriracha was a tamer presence, and the sauce was slightly watery.\n\nOne of the final savory courses, slices of short rib that are cooked sous vide for 48 hours before being deep-fried, was a miracle of tender-crisp contrast one night and a letdown of leathery-crisp redundancy on another.\n\nDeification may have come prematurely to Mr. Chang. But a low-key coronation makes sense.\n\nWith Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ssam Bar, both near Ko in the East Village, he has demonstrated a shrewd grasp of the culinary zeitgeist, bringing considerable skill and high standards to noodle soups, slider-size sandwiches, Asian burritos and chicken wings. He’s playful, never pompous, and despite the offal and other adventurous streaks on the menus at Noodle and Ssam, they resemble glossy snack bars, raucous and rollicking into the wee hours.\n\nThe last seating at Ko, which means “child of” in Japanese, is 9:30 p.m. This even-tempered child gives Mr. Chang and his cohorts, including Peter Serpico, a business partner who acts as the restaurant’s chef de cuisine, a smaller, more orderly sanctum in which to labor over a succinct lineup of dishes more classically artistic than the archetypal Momofuku pork bun, not to be found here.\n\nIt continues his exploration of his Korean heritage, adoration of pork belly and penchant for pickling. Pickled carrots and pickled mustard seeds surround the short rib, offsetting its heaviness with tart, acidic elements.\n\nHe’s also a fiend for smokiness, achieved with abandon and efficiency through the addition of a bacon purée — liquid pork belly! — to the dressing of a dish centered around scallop or trout, depending on the night.\n\nThe soft-boiled egg that he serves with hackleback caviar is dipped in smoked water, but that’s not the fun part. Next to it are cooked onions and tiny slivers of deep-fried fingerling potato. It’s a chip-and-dip of a more delicate order.\n\nLately he has replaced this dish with a less successful eggy meditation: a version of chawan mushi, the Japanese custard, with caviar, asparagus, argan oil and cashews, which don’t register forcefully or give the dish much textural contrast.\n\nThere’s lasagna, but it’s a dissident lasagna, the noodles entwined with snails, porcini, spring asparagus, a ricotta foam of sorts and — the genius touch — a Lilliputian bouquet of dehydrated broccoli rabe flowers. They’re crunchy, a smart hedge against any lasagna soupiness. And they’re adorable, like miniaturized marigolds.\n\nThere’s a Georgia pea soup with such resonant pea flavor that you wonder about the bastard pedigree of all prior peas in your life and almost fail to notice the morels and the delicate crawfish in the soup. I said almost. Crustaceans rarely get past me.\n\nAnd then there’s that arresting foie gras, a torchon of which is frozen so it can be shaved into a loosely packed snowball. This preserves the liver’s creaminess while tempering its unctuousness, and it’s rounded out with a brittle of cashews or pine nuts, a gelée of riesling or Sauternes, and litchi or pickled grapes. Ko rearranges the pieces from night to night.\n\nIts sense of mischief is underscored by the “wine pairing” for a course of soft-shell crab: a glass of chilly Budweiser, bringing to mind a day at the beach.\n\nMischievous, too, is the pastry chef Christina Tosi’s apple pie. It’s sculptured into individual-size rectangles and deep-fried, as if it came straight from McDonald’s, only McDonald’s wouldn’t accessorize it with sour cream ice cream and a swish of sweet, salty toasted miso.\n\nYou’ll love it, provided you ever get access to it. The unpredictability of accomplishing that — I entered into groveling, Ko-dependent arrangements with tireless friends and readers — has soured some would-be patrons, but Ko can’t be faulted for generating a demand in excess of the supply. And Mr. Chang to his credit doesn’t seem to be holding any seats in reserve for V.I.P.’s.\n\nJudging from the diners around me whenever I visited, the 10 a.m. reservations lottery favors people under 40, who are perhaps wiser in the ways of technology and more zealous and dexterous in their clicking. That’s probably as it should be: Ko looks to the future, ignoring the old rules and beckoning epicures open to new ones.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxcgby2e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.984691,40.729063]}},{"properties":{"name":"Morgan M","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 489 Liverpool rd, london ‘Why does this restaurant not have a Michelin Star?’ ask fans of Morgan Meunier’s unassuming restaurant buried in the depths of Highbury. A minor refurb has left the grown-up, muted dining room looking a bit more inviting, but it’s the worldly Gallic food that gets emotions truly charged: ‘the lobster cannelloni was so good I nearly wept’, coos one fan. There’s an a la carte option, but it’s the great value tasting menus (£45 for six courses or £39 for the vegetarian option) that are not to be missed. Flavours &amp; textures are perfectly judged: glorious chilled gazpacho comes with a tomato &amp; olive oil sorbet, roast saddle of rabbit is enlivened by its herb &amp; lemon jus, while new season lamb (confit shoulder &amp; roasted rack) comes with artichokes &amp; barigoule sauce. Monsieur Meunier will ask departing diners what they thought of their meal: testament to the fact that this is a passionately run place, with an attention to detail rarely found in these parts.\n\nWine List: This mid-sized list draws its inspiration from the food, so is dominated by France, with a smattering of bins from elsewhere. Its strengths are the classic areas of Bordeaux, Burgundy &amp; the Rhone, although there are some excellent bins from the south. The offer is lifted above the ordinary by some interesting older vintages, including a 1947 Jurancon. Prices are reasonable, so there is plenty under £30. Best Buy White 2005 ‘La Reine des Bois’ Lirac, Domaine de la Mordee, Rhone Valley, France, £39. Best Buy Red 2003 Chateau Grand Village, Bordeaux, France, £27.\nMorgan M’s Chef -\n\nChef: Morgan Meunier\nMorgan Meunier arrived from France to cook at Monsieur Max in Hampton Hill more than seven years ago, helping chef Alex Bentley gain a Michelin star. Four years on he became head chef of Admiralty restaurant in Somerset House. But Meunier was always keen to go it alone and in September 2003 he opened Morgan M as a showcase for his classic French background with a dash of modernism and Italian cuisine thrown in. His dishes also involve a consistent opposition of flavours and textures, such as diver-caught scallops with white chicory tarte tatin and an onion soubise or ravioli of snails in Chablis, poached garlic and red wine jus.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxchw6za"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.110016,51.548367]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Seoul","description":"Posted by AtodedeusKorean, sounds tasty<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxjwck7b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.110893249512,51.5220823027]}},{"properties":{"name":"Olala Noodles","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 33 St Francis Street, Wanchai, Hong KongStar Street / Pacific Place Three development.

Once that green and sickly-sweet cocktail became a standard, you could almost hear the public address announcer: “The martini has left the building.”\n\nLuckily, its ingredients stayed in the building. And for those travelers who think a stiff martini is the perfect pairing for a weekend in the city, you won’t have to look far.\n\nThese days, you can get martinis made with care in two different kinds of New York bars: the old-school spaces, where it feels like having anything but a martini (or maybe a Manhattan) is just wrong; and at the new generation of cocktail bars, where the entrance is often hidden, the mixers are fresh-squeezed, bitters are back and every drink is made with almost appalling care by bartenders who would rather shake up drinks than chat up customers. There, a martini is a good test of the staff.\n\nThey usually pass. Witness the recent dialogue between a cocktail waitress and a customer at the Flatiron Lounge, one of the standard-bearers of the new-wave New York cocktail.\n\n“I’d like a martini. Can you suggest an interesting gin?”\n\n“Do you like Hendrick’s?”\n\n(Slight pause.) “Yes.”\n\n“Have you tried Hendrick’s?”\n\n“No.”\n\nGin amateur, totally (if politely) busted. The waitress continued.\n\n“It’s lighter, with cucumber tones. We suggest it with a cucumber instead of olives or a twist.”\n\nDone. And very refreshing. Only problem: the Flatiron can get packed, and packed bars are not conducive to martini-sipping. But be careful what you wish for: controlled entry can guarantee elbow room but can also force long waits in lines that range from annoying to extremely annoying.\n\nTopping the list of annoyance two Saturdays ago around 11 p.m. was the line outside Little Branch in the West Village, a faux speakeasy that in this case is identified with nothing more than a subtle plaque affixed to the door. As suspiciously good-looking clients who were “meeting someone who already had a table” flowed in, the line stagnated, and many people wandered off into the night.\n\nBut once you’re downstairs in the quirkily shaped basement space, you see the point. The bar is pleasantly crowded but not at all intolerable; the bartenders take things seriously back there, and — could it be? — those people “who already had a table” seem to have met friends who already had a table.\n\nHere the martinis are stirred unless you ask for shaken, with a bit of vermouth unless you ask for more, and with hand-cracked ice standard. The hand-cracked part in most settings would seem unseemly, but as the bartenders take a chunk of ice and batter it against their bare palm with a cocktail spoon, it seems an odd luxury (and surely you just missed the precracking Purell application). The only problem is that everyone is waltzing around the place with drinks (Is that caramelized ginger? Is that fresh cream?) so cool-looking that you might be tempted to stray.\n\nKeeping a martini cold is serious business, and different spots have different approaches. One is to freeze the heck out of just about everything that comes into contact with it, like at Pegu Club, another high-end cocktail standard. Both the stirring pitcher and the glass itself come frosted, and the ice, cracked in the hands of the bartender, is dumped on top of the gin, then stirred, and chills things for a bit longer than you might expect.\n\nThe other approach to keeping things cold is taken by Death &amp; Company, another of the subtly marked, Prohibition-inspired spots where crowd numbers are tightly controlled, resulting in an unusual scene for a popular New York bar: everyone gets a seat. (Here, they take your cellphone number and call you when they’re ready.) To give you more time with your cold martini, whatever doesn’t fit in your glass goes into a iced mini-carafe at its side.\n\nFewer lines, older crowds and reduced frills are what you’ll find at the more old-school spots, often in the grand hotels. The King Cole room at the St. Regis off Fifth Avenue charges a whopping 8 for a martini, but that includes mahogany paneling and a view of Maxfield Parrish’s “Old King Cole” mural. But it is a whopping size as well, and you’ll need to down it fast, before it gets warm — no carafe here.\n\nBemelmans, another old-school bar at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, takes care of the problem by serving in a smaller glass and adding an iced carafe with the leftovers. There’s live music (with cover after 9:30), murals by Ludwig Bemelmans on the walls, and bartenders in red vests who are jokey in safely salty ways (“Are these seats taken?” ask two men striding up to the bar. “Yes, by two hot girls coming soon.” Ha.) It’s the sort of place where if you order a Diet Coke, they bring it in an eight-ounce glass bottle and pour it over ice in a way that appears as minimally unclassy as possible. In some quarters, the barman might be tempted to pour it through a strainer into a conical, stemmed glass and call it a DietCokeatini.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxjrg12l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.99956,40.726669]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pete Jones Skylight Inn","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 1501 south lee st, ayden, nc<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx92qvsg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.423119,35.461075]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ping Pong","description":"Posted by Atodedeus74 Westbourne grove, londonThen, what better time to break with British conventionality than by going on to the recently opened Ping Pong on Westbourne Grove which now holds Lazy Sumdays, made for enjoying as many steamed and grilled dumplings as you can hold after all that.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx7yyr6f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.192738,51.515302]}},{"properties":{"name":"Porchetta","description":"Posted by Atodedeus241 Smith St, Brooklyn, NYCarnivores in Margaritaville\n\n    *\n      E-Mail\n    * Print\n    * Reprints\n    * Save \n\nArticle Tools Sponsored By\nBy JONATHAN MILES\nPublished: November 19, 2006\n\nBACK in August, a man identifying himself as Andrew Fenton of Philadelphia stumped, thrilled and mildly sickened the cocktail wing of the eGullet Society for Culinary Arts and Letters, an online forum, by posting news of a creation he called Weeniecello. The concoction, he said, results from soaking Hebrew National hot dogs in 100-proof vodka for five weeks, yielding an infused vodka with, according to Mr. Fenton, \"a fine beefy taste, with a hint of salt and gentle spiciness.\"\n\nHis inspiration, he said, came at a barbecue, when he realized that the only thing detracting from the experience was that he was continually forced to put his cocktail down in order to eat. \"You can see the dilemma,\" he wrote.\n\nA hoax?\n\nPerhaps, though Mr. Fenton offered photos as proof. As one typical comment went: \"It is either brilliant or insane.\"\n\nThe line between brilliance and insanity, history shows us, is fragile; the line between meat and liquor, less so. But that may be changing.\n\nAt the Double Down Saloon on Avenue A, off Houston, a proud dive bar devoted to punkish excess, bacon-infused vodka goes into bloody marys, martinis and shot glasses, staving off protein deficiencies during the bar\\'s seven-hour happy hour.\n\nFar less anarchic — in fact, downright refined — is the pork-rimmed margarita that made its debut at Porchetta, a five-month-old restaurant on Smith Street in Brooklyn.\n\nInside the glass is a familiar margarita made with smoky añejo tequila, Cointreau and lime and tangerine juices. Clinging to the outside, however, is a rim of crushed pork cracklings spiced with ground chiles de árbol.\n\nYou don\\'t taste the pork, at first, sensing instead an indecipherable richness, a pleasantly fatty edge. Every now and again, though, you encounter a salty speck of pork that demands to be chewed, providing a weird but wonderful shock to the system: Hey, I\\'m eating my drink.\n\nIf this seems like the realization of a fantasy conjured up by undergrads in a pungent smoke-filled dorm room, think again. Porchetta\\'s chef, Jason Neroni, late of 71 Clinton Fresh Food, explained the drink\\'s origins: \"We had a ton of skin left over from the pork bellies we serve, a huge batch that everyone was snacking on.\"\n\nSince pork fat had infiltrated the dessert menu (in the crust of a lemon-curd tart), why not the drink list?\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, more than a third of Porchetta\\'s patrons ordered this union of aperitif and appetizer, happily straddling the border between the brilliant and the insane.\n\nPork Margarita\n\nAdapted from Porchetta\n\nPork cracklings\n\nDried chiles de árbol\n\n2oz. añejo tequila\n\n2Tbsp. freshly squeezed lime juice\n\nSplash of Cointreau\n\nSplash of freshly squeezed tangerine juice\n\nPickled green chili pepper, for garnish (optional)\n\n1.

Sichuan cuisine is most famous for its liberal use of chilli &amp; peppercorns &amp; the hot &amp; numbing experience these induce. Pig’s ear with Sichuan chilli is slightly musky in flavour &amp; has a satisfyingly resistant texture. Ma po dou fu is silky tofu set off by finely minced beef, &amp; a vast pile of king prawns (typical of the huge portions) lies atop a heap of peppers &amp; dried chillies. Meanwhile, a side order of sliced cucumber with sesame acts as a cooling agent. The insistent hit of chilli in the majority of dishes means there’s a somewhat one-dimensional quality to the cooking &amp; there will be many who find a meal here interesting rather than enjoyable. Nevertheless, when Eurostar rolls into nearby St Pancras, epicurious Parisians won’t be able to find a better example of London’s famously diverse restaurant scene than Snazz Sichuan. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxkuq7ez"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.129575,51.528857]}},{"properties":{"name":"Socarrat Paella Bar","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 259 W 19th Street, New York City, NY<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxh68ewd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.999452,40.742756]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sophie's Steakhouse","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 29-31 Wellington Street, London, UKWhich is just as well, as having served the Fulham Crowd for the last six years, Sophie\\'s Steakhouse is finally branching out to Covent Garden.

However, the Dome was never intended as an ivory tower or a one-note attraction. Too often, it seems that dining and entertainment venues forge their identities out of a single attraction; the result being a tourist magnet that is worth one snapshot, but never a return visit. That, quite simply, is not who we are.\n\nThe Dome is a venue for all with a passion for unembellished quality. Our motto of providing rare, simple elegance means nothing more than recognizing that good food comes from good ingredients, and that a truly authentic atmosphere comes from creating an organic environment. Bringing them together requires work, of course, but the difference is one that our guests can always sense what we are all about, even if they cannot quite describe it.\n\n  About Sirocco\n\nWhen it first opened in the winter of 2003, Sirocco revived the Bangkok dining scene in several ways. As the first of the Dome\\'s venues, it generated a lot of buzz simply because so many people were curious to finally see the view from the city\\'s second tallest building, and its highest outdoor balcony.\n\nWhat they found when they arrived took their breath away in ways they did not expect. Jutting into the city skyline like the deck of a flying ship, Sirocco was its own sparkling vista of soft light and clean lines, capped by the entrancing glow of the Sky Bar . But the real revelation was the food. Sirocco\\'s stunning atmosphere is a complement to its excellent cuisine, not a replacement for it. Our Chef has put together a refined and accessible menu of Mediterranean starters and entrees which is constantly being updated .\n\nAnd if that is not enough, Sirocco is also one of Bangkok \\'s best live jazz venues, featuring the vocal styling of international performers six nights a week. Never too loud or obtrusive, the music flows gently from the raised stage and covers the dining area like a soft breeze, an appropriately subtle counterpart to the clean, fresh flavors of the food.\nThis delicate harmony for the senses introduced Bangkok to its first taste of rare, simple elegance.\n\n  About Distil\n\nDistillation is the process of removing everything except the best, and such was the template for Distil. Part DJ bar, part smoking lounge, part restaurant, Distil combines the comforts of the casual with the distinction of the upscale . Located on the 64th floor of State Tower, it features the most amazing view of Chao Praya River and Bangkok \\'s city.\n\nBeyond Deliverance means attention-to-detail that no other bar in Bangkok can claim. We are not the only place to serve fine single - malt Scotches like Macallan and Glenmoranghie, but we are the only one to accompany it with a small carafe of genuine Scottish water. So your highland malt is cut with the same peaty, coastal flavor that created it.\nOur oyster bar features fresh imported oysters served by an oyster chef, as well as Iranian caviar and Atlantic Ocean lobster, which can be accompanied by a selection of champagne from our chiller or wine from our on - site cellar . Or if you prefer a Cuban cigar, you can choose one from our humidor and light-up on Bangkok \\'s highest smoking balcony, overlooking the Chao Praya River.\n\n  About Mezzaluna\n\nItalian food has enjoyed a hike in popularity in Bangkok in recent years, resulting in many new restaurants claiming to serve authentic Italian food . We are not quite sure what they mean by “authentic”, but we do not think they mean it the way we do : Italian food made by an Italian chef using all ingredients imported fresh from Italy .\n\nWe are not just talking about spices . Everything from the fresh vegetables to the aged cheese, from the unfrozen meats to the unprocessed grains and pasta flour, are all genuinely Italian in origin, assembled by the skilled hands of our in - house specialist . We even use imported water for our pizza dough, just to get the exact right crispness . You could say that our food doesn\\'t really leave Italy until it reaches your table .\nThe power of fresh ingredients is that less is more : the original simple flavors of top ingredients make possible real Italian - style dishes that are not necessarily complicated, just delicious . After all, it is this kind of Italian food that most Italians eat, which those who have been to Italy will always remember, and which aficionados have been missing for so long in Bangkok \\'s Italian restaurants.\n\n  About The State Room\n\nReaching the top has always been a metaphor in business, but now it can be a literal description as well. Height has always had powerful implications in the corporate mindset, which is why we have set aside the Dome\\'s pinnacle space for the special corporate functions of clients whose priority is to make a singular statement of ambition, ascent, or achievement.\n\nLocated on the 67th floor in the rotunda itself, The State Room is a perfect circle surrounded by an unbroken band of windows looking down on Bangkok . This perfect and unparalleled vista creates a visual perspective that is both memorable and effective, framing its host as an individual of importance, while the hollow dome roof above creates an acoustic effect that borders on the supernatural.\nBut as with all Dome venues, the view is just an accompaniment to service which is just as unique. Our corporate facilities include an independent gourmet kitchen with its own exclusive menu and staff. It is essentially a freestanding fine restaurant that only opens for exclusive corporate events.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx7ka63b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.56885,13.45374]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Only Running Footman","description":"Posted by Atodedeus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 5 charles street, londonThe Only Running Footman - a former dive that\\'s been spruced up beyond recognition and now does cracking grub from Welsh rarebit to beer battered haddock and chips.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx724grv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.14611,51.508441]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Shed","description":"Posted by Atodedeus129 Coast Road, West Mersea, UK\n    The Company Shed\n\n    Mersea Island is home to father-and-son team Richard and Joe Haward, producers of some of the finest farmed flat oysters in the country.

Hats off to St John with a nod towards France and the greatest creation of Joel Robuchon. Home made piccalilli so good, it gave a bow towards Gary Rhodes in his pomp. End of season spring lamb, sweetbreads, calf’s liver. It was all there.\n\nIf I had to construct a last meal menu, much of this would be on it. All on offer for £19.50 for two courses and £22.50 for three.\n\nMy chum is getting a little carb conscious in his dotage and was put to the test by a large plate of bread fresh and steaming from the oven which just whelped out for some butter to be slathered over it. I was a true friend and did it on his behalf.\n\nWe ordered three starters. A Gazpacho was everything it should be with a fresh zing in the mouthuls I was allowed to try. It came with some tapenade topped crisp bread with slivers of sardine.\n\nMy starter was one of the best things I have eaten this year. A croquette of pigs head turned out to be a large disc of head meat fried perfectly in crumbs to a crisp coating which when punctured gave off a steamy aroma of pork. It came on a pool of sauce grebiche which was not, as is so often the case, short on cornichons and the sharpness cut through the fatty meat perfectly.\n\nWe shared a plate of pork rillettes with cornichons and chutney which came with more griddled bread. Delicious, but so rich we agreed they should set the table with a knife, fork and defibrillator to save time.\n\nMain courses were, if anything, better still.\n\nA plate of sweetbreads and medium cooked calf’s liver in sizeable chunks came topped with a mound of mash potato that was, as the god of pommes puree, Joel Robuchon has now decreed law, almost as much butter as potato. Again, my chum was being carb aware and tried not to hoover it all into his mouth. I helped as much as I could but was already facing a task to finish my rump of spring lamb with braised lettuce, peas and pancetta.\n\nAccomplished cooking in both dishes exemplified by the sauces that had great depth but did not over power the main components. A rare balance these days.\n\nWith cooking that showed this attention to detail, you just knew puddings were going to be good and they were. An Amalfi lemon sorbet came in a pool of powerful limoncello and was a tad better that my own malt chocolate ice cream. Both were topped, however by some peanut cookies that crumbled at the slightest bite.\n\nI was being good and avoided Mr booze. My chum dived into an unfeasibly large glass of Chabli but left it there and we both stuck to water after that.\n\nI was being treated so did not see the bill but would guess that it came to about £60 including tip. Dinner would be closer to £75 for two.\n\nWith a £7.70 return to London Bridge, that still equates to less than a ton for cooking that is as good as anything I can recall in the 300 + posts on the blog so far.\n\nIt was pouring with rain when we left, but we didn’t care. A meal liked this restores ones faith in restaurants and, what’s more I still have that huge container of piccalilli to work my way through.\n\nA result in Reigate.

If it is HP, his title is alway an obscure lyric. If it is me, then it is usually a painful pun.\n\nSo, I was bound to be attracted to a restaurant that had the temerity to use the most excruciating pun possible as a name. Hats off to upper Glas.\n\nRelocated from a very successful 18 month stint opposite Neal’s yard in Borough Market, Upper Glas is now in the location that was, up until recently that Islington Stalwart, Lola’s\n\nLola’s was an odd place. More up and down than a manic depressive on a pogo stick it went through chefs as often as I do apology cards. The scene of some decent meals and some dreadful meals, it finally closed its doors a couple of months ago.\n\nI had passed the site every day at lunchtime, but seen little movement until Thursday night when I saw the lights on and much activity. A “ friends and family” night it transpired with the official opening being last night. So, I booked a table for two at 9pm.\n\nThe owners, who had been much in evidence the night before were conspicuous by their absence when we arrived and it showed as no one even bothered to look in our direction as we waited to be greeted. We waited and waited and waited a bit more until finally, someone noticed us standing there and showed us to a table.\n\nThey explained that the owners had a vacation booked in Africa and had left that morning. Well deserved, I am sure but on the opening day of your new venture, a tad weird, no?\n\nThe table configuration is weird too with large tables being separated into seating for two by the use of cloths and candles so you sit bench style but they try to make you feel like you don’t. It doesn’t work and I suspect they will find themselves having to change it very soon.\n\nSo, so far so bad and I was not sure that it was going to get any better. I was wrong. I am pleased to say that this turned out to be one of my meals of the year with one of the dishes of the year.\n\nThe predominantly Swedish menu is split into hot and cold dishes with the cold choices being small plates, mainly of fish at around £4-5 with the hot dishes of meat, fish and seafood being around £10-13.\n\nThere is a small wine list and a good selection of Nordic beers and Aquavits.\n\nAfter sampling a couple of beers, which we used two wash down a large amount of splendid homemade crisp bread, we ordered five small plates to begin. Each was, in its own way excellent.\n\nBeer battered beetroot was so much better than it sounds and topped with a thyme and walnut foam that actually had a taste.\n\nSpiced Matjes herring were toothsome and smokey ( apparently laid out to “age” on sandlewood we were told ) but not quite as delicious as small strips of herring marinated in vodka and citrus which gave it a real kick.\n\nPrawns in a dill mayonnaise on toast was, probably, the most standard dish but we still wiped the plate clean.\n\nBest of all, cured reindeer meat on top of a “panacotta” of wild mushrooms with lingonberries. A really tremendous dish with the dense dark meat being offset by the creamy but rich mushrooms. We almost came to blows over the last sliver of meat. It was that good.\n\nThe hot dishes were equally as good. A pike perch came with a herb crust and was served with meaty chanterelles. The perch was cooked perfectly and was as good a piece of fish as I have tasted this year. The Hasselback potatoes were the one duff note. Tough as old boots and we told them so.\n\nBest of all though and now set in my memory as one of “those” dishes that you dream about in quiet moments was a West coast casserole of mussel and fish with grilled crayfish. How can I describe it? A bowl with,perhaps, the best seafood sauce I have ever tasted, filled with chunks of perfectly prepared fish and mussels ( a few still in the shell ) and topped with a crayfish with the sweetest tasting flesh I can ever recall. The first bite brought out the sort of squeal of pleasure I have tried and failed to extract from any number of girlfriends over the years and each bite following bite was better than the last.\n\nI am not ashamed to say that I wiped the plate almost clean with my finger and was sorely tempted to pick it up and lick it so good was the sauce. For £10 a pop I am going to stick my neck out and say this was, arguably the best and best value thing I have eaten this year. I recommend you try it and try it soon.\n\nAfter that it was bound to be a bit of an anti climax. We shared a blueberry mousse thing that was a bit like a Christmas cake whizzed up and put in a martini glass. HP liked it. I did not.\n\nThroughout the meal, we stuck to beer and a few types of Aquavit all of which came in frozen glasses. Very good they were too.\n\nThey are offering a 50% reduction on food for the first couple of weeks which meant the bill in tip came to about £80 which was excellent value. It would still be good value even without the deduction.\n\nThe service was very sweet and Scandinavian. Although, the young women all seemed to be out way past their bedtime. Without a proper front of house though it did seem a bit rudderless and, while that was fine with less than 20 people in the place, it could be an issue if it begins to fill up.\n\nI hope it does fill up and stays full for a long time to come as, make no mistake, this is a very good restaurant offering food worthy of superlatives at reasonable prices with charming service and in decent surroundings. Isn’t that what restaurants are meant to do after all?\n\nIt seems London can learn a lesson from our Nordic chums<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxjio1bm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.104549,51.534364]}},{"properties":{"name":"Van Kerkwijk","description":"Posted by AtodedeusDelicious food in AMS<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kx86nmxk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.89370107651,52.3712171652]}},{"properties":{"name":"Veselka","description":"Posted by Atodedeus144 2nd Ave, New York, NY<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688kxiq9cdv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.987142,40.729012]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vinoteca","description":"Posted by Atodedeus7 St. John Street, LondonThis relative newcomer is a tribute to the fashionable Smithfield restaurant quarter of London.
