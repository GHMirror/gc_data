He was a year older than the rest of the kids on the block, and he was one of those guys who, like, pretends to throw a punch at people, then, when they flinch, he says \"Fuckin\\' Pussy!\" then punches them for real.\r\n\r\nI guess he thought being older than the rest of us made him in charge. And for a while, I guess he was. He was new, and he had lots of stories, and his mom was from England, which all of us thought was kind of cool. But he also always seemed to have this one, nasty, festering boil-sized white-head zit pressed right up against the outside of his nostril, which I thought was really gross. And probably, he could tell that I was always staring at his boil-zit and trying not to look like I was going to throw up, so he didn\\'t like me right from the start.\r\n\r\nBut we were all kids, and, ya know, sometimes Jon and I would fight and sometimes we got along just fine.  One time, he was bragging about how everyone in his family smoked pot, and he could get the best pot, and how he could even get the best pot seeds in the world and we could grow our own, if we wanted to buy some from him. Me and my buddy Blowhard were kind of interested in trying the pot, even though we were only in 6th grade, and both of our girlfriends told us that if they ever found out we smoked or did drugs, they would break up with us.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Jon agreed to get us some the next day. After school the next day, he came out and met us on the street and pulled a half a smoked joint out of his pocket. He said we could buy it for six bucks. We told him we thought that was a ripoff, and he shouldn\\'t charge us more than five. He told us we were idiots, and that this was the strongest fucking pot you could buy, and he was cutting us a deal. We told him that, for six bucks, he had to throw in some seeds too.\r\n\r\nHa! We totally worked him.\r\n\r\nHe agreed. He went back in to his house and came back out with three little seeds wrapped in toilet paper. We gave him the six bucks, and Blowhard told me to hold on to it all until we had a chance to smoke the half-joint and find a place to plant the seeds.\r\n\r\nI took it all back to my house. Closed my bedroom door and crawled into my closet. With the filing blade of a nail clipper, I punched a hole in the drywall in the back of my closet, then shaved it around, so it was about the size of a nickel. Then I stuck the half-joint and the toilet-paper wad of pot seeds into the wall. Then pushed my hamper up against it, and shuffled around my clothes and closed the door, and hoped my parents wouldn\\'t find it.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, Blowhard told me to get the joint and the seeds and meet him in the alley behind his house. I went home and tried to fish them out of the hole in my closet, but it wasn\\'t easy. I had to use a pair of tweazers to fish the joint out. And the wad of toilet paper was just jammed in there. I tried pinching the paper with the tweazers to ease it out of the hole, but all I succeeded in doing was tearing little pieces off, until, after a few minutes, I heard the \"plink, plink, plink\" that told me the seeds had fallen out and dropped to the floor behind the wall. \r\n\r\nBlowhard was pissed that the seeds were gone, and told me I should pay him back two of his three dollars because all we had now was the half-joint. Or, he said, he should just get to keep the joint himself. I don\\'t remember how we resolved it, but my guess is, I probably promised to pay him back his two bucks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we smoked the joint, but nothing happened. We went to Jon later and told him we wanted our money back, since we hadn\\'t gotten high. He told us we had probably smoked it wrong and to fuck off.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t really remember anyone hanging out with Jon after that. Not until about my junior year of high school, when I was in, like, Geometry for retards, and he was in the class with me. He was the only senior in the class, and he think he felt like kind of an idiot because of that. Which he was. He never really did anything in class except talk, and cheat off me during tests.  His brother, the year before, had gotten the role of the asshole scammer dude in the movie The Last American Virgin, and Jon never shut up about it. He went on and on about how his brother got \"so much pussy\" off that role, and about how, seriously dude, being famous was the best way to get pussy, and how he was going to be famous too. I was skeptical, since he didn\\'t seem to have any talents to speak of. I was even more skeptical when he finally came up with his grand plan for how he was going to become famous:\r\n\r\nOpen a hair salon.\r\n\r\nOh, shit, that was a funny one. \r\n\r\n\"No, seriously,\" he said, \"Like in Shampoo. Warren Beatty got so much trim in that movie.\"\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t really have the heart to argue with him at the time. I just figured, \"Yeah, whatever Jon. I\\'m sure you\\'ll get lots of pussy from cutting peoples\\' hair. You\\'ll be the most famous stud in Beverly Hills.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an idiot.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qxmcn5v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.388929,34.061193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Belmont: 55 Townsend Rd","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://Twitter.com/realestatecafe\" href=\"http://Twitter.com/realestatecafe\">Realestatecafe</a>55 Townsend Rd, Belmont, MA, usaOriginal asking price: 89,000Sales price: 82,000Closing date:  July 2006Days on market: 67Percent saved: 1%Dollars saved: ,000Assessed value: 69,000 (2006)Saved vs assessment:  7,000Sales price vs Assessment:  89%Analysis by The Real Estate Cafe for use by customers and clients seeking to buy specific properties.

The\ntruth is that the Bush Administration has used the McCain anti-torture bill to codify a policy of torture that is\nnow embedded in our legal system for perpetuity.\n\nProfessor Alfred McCoy is the author of a new book, \"A Question of Torture\", in which he gives a history of US\ntorture from the CIA\\'s development of torture techniques through the latest generation of systematic torture in\nthe Bush Administration\\'s \"war on terror\".\n\nMcCoy explains how the Bush Administration has purposefully crafted a strategy of torture. They have claimed\nexecutive powers and have had laws re-interpreted by Administration lawyers to give the government the power to\ncontinue the practice. Loopholes slipped into the McCain bill now ensure an enduring policy of torture.\n\nDemocracy Now interviewed Professor McCoy several weeks ago. We\\'ve taken about 9 minutes of clips frmo the 23\nminute interview and provided them here. The entire interview and transcript are available from Democracy Now.\n\nDue to the focus on detainees\\' human rights at Guantánamo, the U.S. is quietly expanding a detention center at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. In the past few years, the population has increased by 5 times. While there\nhas been significant legal action over Gitmo, little has been done for the detainees at Bagram.\nMany say the conditions at Bagram are far worse than even during the height of the Abu Ghraib abuse.\nAdded on April 29, 2006, 09:27 PM by halfandhalf \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qtxrx4z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.002529,40.718511]}},{"properties":{"name":"CBG 4LWM(4Life We MOB)","description":"Posted by MizzlyAtlanta<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qu6rcsh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"CYIANA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.myspace.com/lilkim\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lilkim\">Lilkim</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/1122288767_l.jpg\">AtlantaI LOVE LIL KIM <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qvzc9fw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"CYIANA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.myspace.com/lilkim\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lilkim\">Lilkim</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/1124310635_m.jpg\">AtlantaYESS<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7ql9io5o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cake Shop w/ Z's, OCRILIM, Aa, LAKE--- CANCELLED! sorry!!!","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34529475@N00/240592644/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/79/240592644_7351125aee_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34529475@N00/240592639/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/88/240592639_9d952da9d4_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34529475@N00/240592646/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/86/240592646_c583d605b1_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> New York December, 2 2006 at Cake Shop w/ Z's, OCRILIM, Aa, LAKE--- CANCELLED! sorry!!!

Yellow flags were posted as 2-foot seas came ashore. Some swimmers said bait fish could be seen in the water.\n\nLifestar emergency services flew Corey Brooks, who was suffering reportedly from a 12- to 14-inch gash in his right calf, to St. Mary\\'s Medical Center in West Palm Beach. Brooks underwent surgery Sunday evening at St. Mary\\'s, according to his mother, Tammie Brooks of Port St. Lucie.\n\nReportedly, her son had more than 100 stitches in his leg and was resting in the facility\\'s intensive care unit after surgery.\n\nTammie Brooks said Corey had gone to the beach with family friends when she received the \"bad news he was bit by a shark. They told me he was airlifted here,\" she said, standing outside of St. Mary\\'s.\n\nShe said she was told her son had been playing in waist-deep water and thought one of his friends was pulling on his leg underwater. Then he saw a shark had bitten him and he ran crying for help.\n\nA lifeguard supervisor said guards were unable to forewarn swimmers because the attack occurred too far down the beach from the posted lifeguard stations to monitor the shark siting. Lifeguards were informed of the attack about 1 p.m., when a guard was told the boy was bitten as he swam in the surf with more than 20 other children.\n\nLifeguards then quickly called everyone onto the beach from the water and stabilized the boy.\n\nJoe Kostygan, chief lifeguard for Martin County, said the attack occurred \"quite a way down the beach\" from a guard station. \"It was out of the guarded area at the extreme end of the public beach.\"\n\n\nHe said, \"It\\'s been a heck of while at least 10 or 12 years\" since he could remember another attack there. The incident was probably \"a chance encounter.\"\n\n\"Shark attacks are such a chance encounter you could be looking right at it,\" and not see it, Kostygan said. Most swimmers were packed pretty close to shore. \"They would have noticed him if he was out further,\" he said of Corey.\n\nCorey was conscious and \"pretty calm\" but in pain, said Martin County Fire Rescue firefighter/paramedic T.J. Guzzi and fire medic Doug Young.\n\n\"He had a pretty significant bite, it did appear serious. He was stable, but we took him to St. Mary\\'s just to make sure,\" Young said. Lifeguards and fire officials \"did a great job,\" he said. \"The scene was pretty controlled.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qmbevu4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.197792,27.261153]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cut Throat Cafe","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 157 Main St, Bailey, COCut Throat Cafe (303) 816-5099<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qq5jd36"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.473585,39.406412]}},{"properties":{"name":"DESTINY ROAD FAMILY VIOLENCE","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.myspace.com/llcoolj\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/llcoolj\">Llcoolj</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/06/0/me_3_.jpg\">AtlantaLOVIN LL ALWAYS<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7ql9mgko"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"DJ Mike Pope","description":"Posted by ErikajayneAtlanta<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qsr1zv5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Daughter Darling (Philadelphia, USA)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/19.jpg\">PhiladelphiaDaughter Darling - Shatter\r\n\r\nVideos:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.daughterdarling.com/colorblindsmall.html\">Colorblind</a> (Quicktime / stream)\r\n\r\nIf you can imagine Portishead, with more accsessible vocals, rich harmonies, classical style piano playing, gorgeous string sections and the most amazing beats ever programmed, then you have Daughter Darling.

Ended up timing it almost perfectly - the show started about 10 minutes after we arrived.  When we first got in the venue I noticed it was about 20 degrees hotter in there than outside.  Grrrreat!  \n\nMy wife had gotten me tickets to this sold-out show for my birthday.  I was initially excited but, as always, ready for the show to be a complete flop (because so many are.)  I was very pleasantly removed of that concern in short order. \n\nThey played a few tracks from their new album (yes, they actually do have a new album - and it\\'s actually good!), and they played a lot of their old hits.  Chains of love, blue savannah, Drama!, almost every damn thing off of their \"Pop 20 Hits\" album (although not You Surround Me, which is my favorite - ah well).  Despite the fact that they aren\\'t exactly young anymore, they were still great showman and Andy Bell had more energy than most 20-somethings.  The outfits he/they wore and the stage was just straight out of the 80s - it was hilarious.  This show is definitely in my top 10 list of shows.  After a while, I stopped caring that it was about 20000 degrees inside.\n\nSide note: after a very bad experience after a Skinny Puppy concert where I thought that I had permanent hearing damage, I am a real nazi about wearing earplugs at all concerts I attend.  Surprisingly the music was mixed so well and the levels were so perfect, I rarely felt I needed to wear my earplugs - except, for when the songs were over.  The crowd was so goddamn loud and insane (and the average age was around mid-30s, maybe even 40s!  I think we were some of the youngest people there.)  I have been to many-a-Morrissey show, who has a legendary cult following, but this crowd was about 10x more insanely in love with Andy Bell than the crowds I\\'ve seen for Morrissey.  Unbelievable, I know...but true!\n\nSide note 2: The photo below seems to actually be of the stage in Seattle, or at least very similar.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qpnkao1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.34092,47.611233]}},{"properties":{"name":"Esther Goodman","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/05/2/PB111881.JPG\">Ventura, CaHi Everyone<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qycc0tx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.292222,34.278333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fa Sho","description":"Posted by DboyzentAtlanta<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qtg3pdj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.buckcherry.com/\" href=\"http://www.buckcherry.com/\">Buckcherry</a>weatherford texasBig Fan<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qqbmi5n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.785237,32.750143]}},{"properties":{"name":"First Girlfriend","description":"Posted by Amyflotsom<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/hotness_1.jpg\">My first girl lived here, in high school.

Between 2002 and 2005, protests against the Iraq war were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet, the United States and worldwide public opinion.\nThese anti-war demonstrations were mainly organised by anti-war groups, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan, though in some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the State. Europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters, including a rally of 3 million people in Rome, Italy which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally. [1]On March 20, 2003, the day after the invasion of Iraq had begun, thousands of protests and demonstrations were held around the world in opposition to the war in Iraq. In many cases, these protests were known as \"Day X\" protests, reflecting the fact that they had been organized to occur when war started, what ever day that might have been.\n[edit]\nUnited States\n\n\n\nProtesters attend a demonstration in Washington DC against President Bush\\'s Iraq policy.\nIn some U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, New York, and Portland, Oregon, demonstrators blocked traffic in the city centers with the goal of shutting the cities down, resulting in the arrests of over 3,000 people nationwide. In other cities, such as Boston, Atlanta, and Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, demonstrations were more peaceful. In still other cities, people engaged in counter-demonstrations in support of the war.\nIn San Francisco, 5,000 protesters, having planned weeks in advance to shut down the city on \"Day X\", blockaded the Financial District resulting in 2,000 arrests.

Many events from Jan 29-Feb 17. See the website calendar for more information. Over one hundred years ago, the Chinese community began to participate in the parades of the City of Los Angeles. In 1898, the Chinese lion and dragon procession were regarded as one of the most beautiful units in the City\\'s Annual La Fiesta Parade. After the Vietnam War in 1975, Indo-Chinese refugees poured into the United States and soon became active in our community. Local family associations, Buddhist temples, and community-based organizations mushroomed and the parade became a focal point for community participation. Without a doubt, the Golden Dragon Parade is the highlight of the Chinese New Year in Southern California.\nParade starts at main Street and New High Street, then turns left up W Cesar chavez Ave, turning right on N Broadway, where it hits it\\'s longest stride.

There was a festival selling food on a stick and Urge Overkill was playing.  How could we not go? \n\nUO is Chicago-based band that was moderately successful back in the early 90s. A band I liked a lot back then.  They released an album called \"Saturation\" that would have done a lot better and maybe made a lot more famous back in 1993 had a lady named Liz Phair not released another little album called \"Exile in Guyville\" that very same summer. \n\nAnd I don\\'t begrudge either band/artist their success only, that summer everyone in Chicago kind of expected UO to blow up. Then came Liz singing about getting wet between her legs and f*ck and run and such and so everyone kind of forgot about Urge Overkill.\n\nSo, Liz stole all their thunder that year, but Urge Overkill managed to keep the moxie up, taking photos while driving around in vintage convertibles, posing in Mod furniture, singing about Erica Kane and keeping their hip-than-thou attitude up in general.\n\nI liked \\'em anyway. Still do.\n\nSo they played this little festival over the 4th of July weekend, and they were great, and really not-rock-starry at all. Lead singer Nash Kato - who was known for being a little bratty back in the day - was a very nice Rock Star in the present as he played for the sparse suburban crowd and even though the sound was not so great, they all played their hearts out. \n\nWhich was funny in another way, because if Nash Kato and Urge Overkill thought Liz Phair was a problem back in 1993, forgetabout it.  This weekend they were up against The Nuge. That is to say, at the very same time UO was on, they were up against Ted Nugent and his Cat-Scratch-Fever-Legacy on the festival\\'s Main Stage. \n\nSo in the end, UO played balls-out in spite The Nuge and everything else. Which was nice.\n\nIt was a good time, but in the end it wound up being weirdly nostalgic and all which really freaked me out because at one point I was thinking, \"Whoa, isn\\'t this how your parents are supposed to feel when they see, like, The Beach Boys playing Summer Fest or something?\"\n\nBut what was worse, the crowd was so small I managed to find a place right up front and the sound was really, really loud and I left with my ears ringing and hissing with tinnitus and I tell ya after all the rock shows I have seen in my life-- if my hearing went down after attending suburban festival--I was going to be flat-out-pissed-off.\n\nAfter UO was done, The Nuge was just finishing up his night\\'s set, and we could hear the big finale heating up. Concert-going-friend Jen had made a pit stop at the Port O John on our way out and she nearly tipped the thing over trying to escape so she could bust out and yell, \"Oh my god, Cat Scratch Fever!\"\n\nSo see, we really didn\\'t miss a thing.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qvap2kk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.154769,41.764702]}},{"properties":{"name":"HOME","description":"Posted by Smithd220<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/vertical/kidlandia/ICON_kidlandia_food_verD.gif\"> 220 NANOVER ST<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qljelfq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.442044,37.709763]}},{"properties":{"name":"HOME","description":"Posted by Smithd220<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/vertical/kidlandia/ICON_kidlandia_food_verD.gif\"> 220 NANOVER ST<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qj1qr7t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.442044,37.709763]}},{"properties":{"name":"HOME OF THE HAWKS","description":"Posted by Freddy002Atlanta<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qj19ile"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hamilton, Sandra","description":"Posted by DsgdsgLakewood, CO, 80227<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qumzwix"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.085359,39.666746]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hamilton, Sandra","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Lakewood, CO, 80227MCNERNEY, JERRY 1000<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qlp4fro"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.085359,39.666746]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harvard: 150 Still River Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://Twitter.com/realestatecafe\" href=\"http://Twitter.com/realestatecafe\">Realestatecafe</a>150 Still River Road, Harvard, MA Original asking price: 69,000Sales price: 19,000Closing Date: April 2006Days on market: 30Percent saved: 6.5%Dollars saved: 0,000Assessed value: 34,800 (2006)Saved vs assessment: 5,800Sales price vs Assessment: 97.8Analysis by The Real Estate Cafe for use by customers and clients seeking to buy specific properties.

DDG jumped on stage sportin\\' a suit and a funky dance style that kept everyone asking \"umm, so like, is he WITH the band or what?\" for the first few songs.\n\nAfter DDG took off his tie and busted out his hidden prop sweat bands (hint: they were in the drum kit!) all questions were answered and DDD led the crowd in a raucous dance to The Hopefuls\\' hit single \"Let\\'s Go!\"* and a good time was had by all.\n\nThat is until my car was illegally towed by the City of Chicago and I had to spend the next morning at the impound lot trying to get her out of hock.

The original owner, James A. Moore, was a flamboyant developer responsible for many of the early homes and structures in downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. The first building on the regraded Second Avenue, the Moore created a general shift away from Pioneer Square as the central business district while firmly establishing Second Avenue as the \"film/theatre district\" for Seattle. Architect E.W. Houghton gave the theatre a simple exterior with Italian and Byzantine terra-cotta details, while focusing much of the visual beauty on an opulent interior. Hailed as one of the most beautiful and completely equipped playhouses in the United States, the Moore boasted a grand lobby with mosaic floors, marble, onyx, carved wood, stained glass, and metal. There was also a ceiling fresco in old rose, cream and gold. Beams were supported by Muses representing Drama and Music. The theatre interior was resplendent with clusters of lights, rich hangings, and stained-glass paneling.\r\rThe Moore Theatre Twenty-five hundred enthusiastic Seattleites arrived for the opening night celebration. The program featured a locally written and produced comic-opera entitled \"The Alaskan\" which went on to a successful Broadway run. Throughout the first ten years the new Moore Theatre presented stage plays, operas, symphonies, and musicals.\r\rFor the next decade the Moore was host to the famous Orpheum vaudeville circuit. The largest of its kind in North America, all the legends and wonders of American vaudeville played the Moore stage. In fact, the Moore was also home to \"The Negro Ensemble,\" a popular local group of vaudevillians. However, while the Moore Theatre certainly has a history of diverse programming, receptivity to diverse audiences has not always been the case. Built into the theatre was a separate side entrance leading directly to the top balcony. Despite being the home to many, many black performers, African-Americans were not allowed entry into the theatre except through this \"back door\" to the balcony. When the Orpheum Theatre was built in 1927, the Moore\\'s vaudeville contract came to an end.\r\rThe Moore Theatre The Great Depression was, ironically, perhaps the most active and exciting time at the Moore. Due to the leadership of Cecilia Schultz, one of the great pioneers of the arts in Seattle, the Moore presented many of the most distinguished European and American singers, musicians, and dancers. Sarah Bernhardt, Lily Langtry, the Barrymores, Marie Dressier, and Anna Pavlova were just a few of the first-class performers seen at the Moore throughout the thirties.\r\rThe following decades at the Moore were rather unstable; programming at the Moore was less established as the theatre searched for a niche in an ever-changing market. After a three-year lease between 1949-51 in which the Moore was used as a revival house, the theatre became strictly a rental house. Throughout the 50\\'s and 60\\'s road shows, boxing matches, travel-films and special events were the mainstay of the Moore.\r\rAfter re-modeling in 1955, the Moore re-opened with a season featuring local \"artists-in-residence\" such as the Amusa Kabuki troupe. Other local visual artists were featured in the newly converted mezzanine art gallery. Among those presented in the first exhibit were Mark Tobey, George Tsutakawa, Guy Anderson, June Nye, and Kenneth Callahan.\r\rIn 1974 the Moore Theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. This status, however, did not guarantee financial or artistic stability as the theatre struggled to remain open. One year later two local film connoisseurs leased the theatre and after several months of cleaning and slight remodeling the theatre re-opened as the \"Moore-Egyptian\"--this time a foreign and \"revival\" movie theater. Home to the first Seattle International Film Festival, the Moore returned to stage arts when the pair lost the lease after five years and went on to open the Egyptian on Capitol Hill. \tThe Moore Theatre\r\rAfter the successive renovations and cleanings new and larger seats have been put reducing the capacity to 1419 seats; also the box seats have been taken out.\r\rIn the last twenty years the Moore has defined itself as a venue for both local community events, such as lectures, beauty pageants, and local dance or musical groups, and as a home for more \"alternative\" touring musicians and theatre. Virtually every musical genre, from the most hard-core punk to flashy funk, has had a place on the Moore stage in recent years.\r\r-Sean McIntyre\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.themoore.com%5C'\">www.themoore.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qmq6n8v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.34092,47.611233]}},{"properties":{"name":"Muebles la 57","description":"Posted by Scrapdex<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 16382 SW 15 st, Pembroke Pines, Florida 33027, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qwmgy42"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.365975,25.994557]}},{"properties":{"name":"NABIN KHADKA","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/2/NABIN_KHADKA.jpg\">NEPAL  dh_nk@yahoo.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qovdzk5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[84.124008,28.394857]}},{"properties":{"name":"NYC","description":"Posted by Dchrist76<img src=\"http://www.iloveny.com/\">New YorkThe greatest city on the East coast. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qxhwh2l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Napa Golf Course at Kennedy Park","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This course features a wide variety of differently designed holes.

Ron, Joe and Candace came to the party. When I was sitting on the couch in the living room listening to the bass beats to a certain type of music like Disturbed and Rammstein. This party was partially about our one year anniversary that I had with my boyfriend. I knew it probably would be good ideas to buy him a rare remix of his favorite type of music. Some of my other gifts that I included were limited box edition, a poster, a patch (which can be put on clothing or bag), and autographed poster. While opening his presents, we had tall bottles of Smirnoff’s Ice to drink. At the party, once he opened the CD, he immediately wanted to play and hear the intense sound banging on his ears.

Yes, my shower was adjacent to my range, and next to the kitchen sink, and if i wanted to, shower and saute at the same time! There was also no good place for Acorn\\'s litter box, so I\\'d put it in the shower, and take it out every time i wanted to bathe. Hence the show would smell like cat poo. Even though it was tiny, I liked the feel of the apartment; it had lots of light, roof access (top floor), it was the \"penthouse\" so to speak. In the summertime most of the residents, mostly older chinese women and their grandchildren, would leave their doors open and lights off throuhout the day. I could see clear through their entire apartments; they had peeling linoleum floors and walls packed with crap. Their places were darker, seemingly smaller, and unrenovated than mine, which had had new floors, a newish kitchen, and repainted walls. I had 2 a/c units (by accident), modern furniture and lived alone; Other people in my building didn\\'t have A/C, and keeping the doors open would help circulate air, kitchen smells, and basically add another of \"window\" to the tiny apartments. Apartments that they shared with their entire families just like the immigrants who had lives in these same tenements (with 5-10 people per apartment) a hundred years before. As a Chinese American young profession, I\\'d wonder how as Chinese people our lives in America could be world different. Still do.\n\nWalking up the stairs, I\\'d smell my neighbors cooking their dinners for their grandchildren and wished they\\'d ask me over. I\\'d also pass the single Latino gentleman on the third floor, and would hear music lessons; in his packed apartment I could see an upright piano, a computer desk, and a bed. I\\'d sometimes see him teaching the neighborhood Chinese kids guitar. When I\\'d open my apartment door  sometimes Acorn would rush out into the bonsai lady\\'s apartment across the way who\\'s door was open. In the summer, all she would do in the daytime was lay on her bed, with the lights off, fanning herself, int his tiny studio apartment filled with minuature trees. \n\nThough now i live a few blocks south of Canal, not too far away in a  nicer, larger unit, I miss Orchard St a little. When my friend Erin would stay over after a late night of drinks and dancing to Morrissey, we\\'d come back and she\\'d sleep on the couch, i\\'d sleep in mybed, and we\\'d talk until we fell asleep. We\\'d talk also while I was in bed and she was taking a shower too. In that apartment two people would always be right next to each other. Proximity brings people together, its true. Ever wonder why its always so fun to be confined in a small space with lots of people, like a slumber party? In my new place, Erin sleeps on my couch but is a good ten feet down the hall. I have to practically yodal her my secrets. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qwrqmxs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.990946,40.715094]}},{"properties":{"name":"Restaurant","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 8605 Rockaway Beach Blvd, Rockaway Beach, NYRestaurant (718) 634-5809<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qtm96p8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.811359,40.587426]}},{"properties":{"name":"Roshan","description":"Posted by Sind90022000NEPAL<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qj2jv2h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[84.124008,28.394857]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rosie Ruiz Wins Boston Marathon by Taking the Subway","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/day/dayimages/1980.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Boston, MAOn April 21, 1980 Rosie Ruiz, a 23-year-old New Yorker, was the first woman to cross the finish line in the Boston Marathon. She had achieved the third fastest time ever recorded for a female runner (two hours, thirty-one minutes, and fifty-six seconds), which was made all the more remarkable by the fact that she looked remarkably sweat-free and relaxed as she climbed the winner\\'s podium to accept her wreath. However, race officials almost immediately began to question her victory.\n\nThe problem was that no one could remember having seen her during the race. Monitors at the various race checkpoints hadn\\'t seen her, nor had any of the other runners. Numerous photographs taken during the race failed to contain any sign of her. Her absence was overwhelming. Finally, a few members of the crowd came forward to reveal that they had seen her jump into the race during its final half-mile. Apparently she had then simply sprinted to the finish line.\n\nAs race officials prepared to announce her disqualification from the race, they discovered evidence that she had also cheated during the earlier New York marathon, where she had earned the time that had qualified her to run in the Boston marathon. She had apparently achieved her time in New York by riding the subway. Officials stripped her of her Boston victory and awarded the title to the real winner, Jackie Gareau.\n\nRuiz has not been the only marathon contestant to earn a victory dishonestly. In September 1991, spectators noticed that the winner of the Brussels marathon, Abbes Tehami, had somehow shaved his moustache off during the race. It turned out that Tehami had only finished the race. His coach had started it for him.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qjls529"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.060278,42.358333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rosie Ruiz Wins Boston Marathon by Taking the Subway","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://forexbastards.blogspot.com/\" href=\"http://forexbastards.blogspot.com/\">Forexpeace</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/vertical/kidlandia/ICON_kidlandia_quiet_verD.gif\"> Boston, MA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qoo18tx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.060278,42.358333]}},{"properties":{"name":"SYNgasm","description":"Posted by BecomingthearchAtlanta hmjdgsf ,kjhfkjdshfjkdshfkjdshfkjsdhfkjdshkfhdskjfh<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qwfy726"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Saucebox","description":"Posted by Ioftigr<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/73364836_5e1e81dd66.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/73363155_e024c4e138.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 214 Sw Broadway, Portland, ORSince 1995, Saucebox has provided Portland amazing pan asian inspired cuisine, cocktails, and nightlife.

On a Saturday night. \r\nOn the way to my very own birthday party.  \r\nFlames! Shooting up from under the hood of my ’87 Plymouth Horizon!  Fire! Fire! Everywhere! \r\nAnd not a drop of water anywhere.  I mean, save for the tears streaming down my face, streaking my mascara while tourists took pictures as they wandered by saying helpful things like, “man, hope you have insurance.”\r\nBastards.\r\nThe firemen were cute though. And they were nice enough to shut down that entire busy little intersection just for me and my little old car fire while they took an axe to bust through the hood.\r\nAnd the policeman who filled out the report was kind enough to let me and my case of beer hitch a ride with him to my birthday party (your tax dollars hard at work Cook County!) \r\nI am happy to report I was still on time.\r\nYou bet I left the burned-up remains of the car in that questionably legal parking spot on Halsted and headed out for the night. What was the city going to do? Tow it?\r\nYeah, well at least I had the perfect ice-breaking opening line at the bar that night.\r\n“Hey – you know that fire on Halsted and Belmont earlier tonight?

My car was filled with the donated essentials for becoming a teacher: pens, children’s books, a paper cutter, shirts, suits, crayons, glue, etc. The car sat low on its shocks. I drove straight through—twenty-two hours tip to tail. It was a long, lonely drive (my wife followed me a month later), but it gave me time to think.\r\n\tSomewhere in the flat, desolate, dark part of Arkansas, I finally, firmly decided that everything up until that point, my whole life through, would be worthwhile if I could teach one child who might have gone without otherwise. I remembered an Emily Dickinson poem from a graduate course:\r\n\r\n\tIf I can stop one heart from breaking\r\n\t\tI shall not live in vain.\r\n\tIf I can ease one life the aching\r\n\t\tOr cool one pain\r\n\tOr help one fainting robin\r\n\t\tUnto his nest again\r\n\t\tI shall not live in vain.\r\n\r\nI taught that poem to my summer school class last month. I hope that in some desperate moment, one filled with self-doubt and recrimination—perhaps on an empty track of highway separating an uncertain future from a whirlwind past—they might remember that poem. That it might help. I hope it helps them end up where they belong.   \r\n\t     \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qqel5f0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.5252,41.49463]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tom's Secret Service","description":"Posted by MgiguereIt\\'s hard to guess who maybe working for the government in this day and age; the need for secrecy is paramount.

That\\'s how Tom Arrow sees it.  “The one thing I don\\'t enjoy about this job is how people misunderstand what we do.”\n\nAs a student intern, Tom has taken a position for the National Security Agency at Fort Meade in Maryland.  Most of his job is a secret even to him, but when you job involves gathering intelligence to keep the home front safe, it comes with the territory.  “It\\'s not like we personally search everyones e-mail and phone records,” he says.  “We have to maintain the security of the nation however.”\n\nThere is more the job than he lets by however, since most of it is classified.

To be fair, it is one mysterious government organizations, one that has gotten plenty of attention in the past year due a legal scandal involving unwarranted wire taps and released phone records.

Great fun.\n\nMy crafty passtimes include knitting, especially socks, drawing, drawing, drawing, paper mache, sewing, doll making, and printing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qlh2tbz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tracy","description":"Posted by VeryspatialSomerville, MAHere I am!\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qyvjxp1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tracy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/4/gerda100.jpg\">Somerville, MAGo Barb!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qoxislb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tracy","description":"Posted by EhkolstadSomerville, MA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qs3owyd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tracy","description":"Posted by JustincaSomerville, MA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qsrgqvx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tracy","description":"Posted by HeiferukraineSomerville, MAGood Luck!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aj7qtynmkd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trapped in Purgatory, every weekend in October 2006","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/0/New_York_Haunted_house_02.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 5050 Haylen Blvd. Staten island, NYTrapped in Purgatory will take you through the world of the tortured lost souls and Lucifer\\'s Rejects.

If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/6343\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans.

bawa oleh-oleh bapia keju, yang enak tentunya. Sehingga saya beli lebih dari 5 bungkus. Dan waktu itu, ada bakso yang enak tetapi makannya dan memang tempat jualannya dipinggir rel kereta-api, hanya berjarak kira-kira 5 meter dari rel.  Nama tempat itu saya lupa, hehee...\n\nMalang, salah satu tempat daerah malang yang saya kunjungi bernama \"Batu\". Tempatnya kearah bukit, sehingga merasakan sejuk dan kedinginan waktu itu (malam hari).

is a brilliant mover with a wonderful canter &amp; beautiful jumping form. This SCHOOL MASTER HAS DONE IT ALL. He has won Training level horse trials, he is suitable for lower level eventing, and dressage with potiential for more, is a nice enough mover for the show hunter ring,&amp; has fox hunting experience. Walk In The Park\\'s USEA # is 20,000 (even). Whip\\'s Further accomplishments with his junior rider include; Pony Club competitions through C-2, experience &amp; ribbons at dressage schooling shows, numerous Novice Level Horse Trials Placings (ALWAYS in the ribbons in the recognized events)through 2nd with scores as low as 29.5 and Pony Club National Champion in Tetrathlon. Whip is a great horse to just go have fun on and let the rider work on there own riding skills instead of the horse\\'s skills! Priced VERY fair for so much experience. Please see web for more pics www.fineequin2002.com\n\nWhip is not high strung at shows at all. He also fox hunts very well. His Usef# is 20000 if you want to see his scores. He has done very well showing dressage from what I know. He is a working 2nd level. He wears shoes all the way around. He goes in a waterford bit. He is not on any supplements at this time. He jumps 3\\'3 to 3\\'6 very comfortable. He is not prone to lameness issues. Whip is very well educated and will not tolerate any one hanging all over his mouth. That is about the worse vise he has. So soft hands are important. He knows his job inside and out. His owner is selling him because he belonged to her daughter who is off to college. She is the one who has done the great stuff with him as a junior. You are also welcome to talk with Debrah as well about any of his history( his owner). Just let me know when you want to come over and try him to see if it is a good match. We are around all next week.
