Ichkeul is the last remaining lake in a chain that\n    once extended across North Africa. The Park was inscribed on\n    the List of World Heritage in Danger during the 20th session of\n    the Committee (1996) as a result of significant deterioration\n    in the characteristics for which the site was inscribed. The\n    construction of three dams on rivers supplying Lake Ichkeul and\n    its marshes has cut off almost all inflow of fresh water,\n    causing a destructive increase in the salinity of the lake and\n    marshes. Reed beds, sedges and other fresh-water plant species\n    have been replaced by halophytic plants, with a consequent\n    sharp reduction in the migratory bird populations dependent on\n    the habitat the lake formerly provided. According to IUCN, all\n    reed-dependent species such as purple heron, purple gallinule\n    and reed warblers have disappeared. In June 1998 IUCN provided\n    technical data to indicate that the salinity of the water in\n    the lake may have reached excessively high proportions and that\n    the chances of recovery of the World Heritage values of the\n    site may be fast receding and expressed its concern at the slow\n    pace and effectiveness of the implementation of the\n    rehabilitation program by the State Party. The Tunisian\n    government has undertaken various measures to retain freshwater\n    in the lakes on a year-round basis and reduce the salinity of\n    the lake. The World Heritage Committee, during its 1998\n    session, recommended sending an expert mission to the site to\n    look into possibilities of developing additional rehabilitation\n    measures for Ichkeul and determining progress in the\n    implementation of mitigation measures by the Tunisian\n    authorities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vlti9az9zo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[9.674722,37.163611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ile Callot - Heures de passages en fonction des marees","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.roscoff-quotidien.eu\" href=\"http://www.roscoff-quotidien.eu\">Piotr</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/callot_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/callot_eglise.JPG\">L\\'ile est relié par \"terre\" à Carantec au gré des marées\n\n<a href=\"http://argoul.blog.lemonde.fr/argoul/2005/07/lle_callot.html\">Blog Ile Callot</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vlti47lq0o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.92478,48.677474]}},{"properties":{"name":"JEWISH, 1933-1944, Auschwitz-Birkenau (Poland), The Holocaust","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/jew_family.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/18192_2_.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Complete name: Auschwitz, Konzentrationslager Auschwitz-Birkenau, KL Auschwitz\n\nPer Wikipedia: \"the largest of the Nazi German extermination camps, along with a number of concentration camps, comprising three main camps and 40-50 sub-camps....Beginning in 1940, Nazi Germany built several concentration camps and an extermination camp in the area, which at the time was under German occupation...at least 1.1–1.7 million people were killed there, of whom over 90% were Jews...at least 1.1 million Jews...were killed [at Auschwitz-Birkenau ]...\"\n\nThis is now the site of a historical center preserving the history of the Holocaust:\nThe fortified walls, barbed wire, platforms,  barracks, gallows, gas chambers and cremation ovens show the    conditions within which the Nazi genocide took place in the former concentration and extermination camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest in the Third Reich. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vltiazbzwm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.35,50.066667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kells Monastery","description":"Posted by Jklmiller<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/450px_KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg\">53.725268 -6.876181The Book of Kells is not simply a religious manuscript.

The origins of the pilgrimage to Lourdes began with Bernadette Soubirous, the fourteen year old daughter of devout Christian pesants. Between February 11 and July 16, 1858, Bernadette saw apparitions of a white-robed lady 18 times in a small grotto called Massabiele, along the banks of the river Gave de Pau.  In the apparitions the lady told Bernadette to \"go tell the village priest to build a chapel here\" and that many people would soon come in procession to the holy grotto. On the day of the 16th appartition, March 25, the lady revealed herself as Mary.  During her ecstatic trance in front of the grotto that day, Bernadette suddenly rose from her knees, walked a short distance, and fell to the ground.  Fervently she began to dig in the earth until a small puddle of water appeared. Over the next few days the puddle gradually gormed into a pool and eventually became the sacred spring which Lourdes is now so famous.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vltiaev8ky"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.045559,43.098092]}},{"properties":{"name":"Louvre Museum","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/RPEN6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/pr_leonardo_da_vinci_vitruv_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> \"Now?\" Langdon managed. \"It\\'s after midnight.\"\n\"Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening?\" Langdon felt a sudden urge of uneasiness.

In his left hand, his scepter inlaid with all metals, and an eagle perched on the sceptre. The sandals of the god are made of gold, as is his robe.\n\nPausanias the Greek (2nd century AD) \n\nThis is the statue of the god in whose honor the Ancient Olympic games were held. It was located on the land that gave its very name to the Olympics. At the time of the games, wars stopped, and athletes came from Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, and Sicily to celebrate the Olympics and to worship their king of gods: Zeus.\nLocation\n\nAt the ancient town of Olympia, on the west coast of modern Greece, about 150 km west of Athens.\n\nHistory\nThe ancient Greek calendar starts in 776 BC, for the Olympic games are believed to have started that year. The magnificent temple of Zeus was designed by the architect Libon and was built around 450 BC. Under the growing power of ancient Greece, the simple Doric-style temple seemed too mundane, and modifications were needed. The solution: A majestic statue. The Athenian sculptor Pheidias was assigned for the \"sacred\" task, reminiscent of Michelangelo\\'s paintings at the Sistine Chapel.\n\nFor the years that followed, the temple attracted visitors and worshippers from all over the world. In the second century BC repairs were skillfully made to the aging statue. In the first century AD, the Roman emperor Caligula attempted to transport the statue to Rome. However, his attempt failed when the scaffolding built by Caligula\\'s workmen collapsed. After the Olympic games were banned in AD 391 by the emperor Theodosius I as Pagan practices, the temple of Zeus was ordered closed.\n\nOlympia was further struck by earthquakes, landslides and floods, and the temple was damaged by fire in the fifth century AD.

This great Norman stronghold and bridgehead into Wales was the first castle with a stone keep to be built in Britain by the conquering Normans in 1070. \"Knight\\'s Fee\" manors and castles like Penhow were established to protect the outlying farmlands and give advance warning of any Welsh uprising. The area that is now known as Gwent was settled by families that had come over from France with or in the wake of William the Conqueror, and we know that Sir Roger de St Maur was at Penhow by 1129, for he witnessed the charter that founded the priory of Monmouth in that year. In return for the task of keeping down the Welsh, providing a quota of men for guard duty at Chepstow every month, and for supplying one man mounted on a horse in times of War, Sir Roger was permitted to usurp the Manor of Penhow from its native Welsh prince, and gain a toehold on the feudal ladder. Sir Roger\\'s home was a cold stone Pele tower that stood alone on its rocky knoll, and directly overlooked the conquered natives in their \\'Welshry\\' at Talgarth. It was the first home in Britain of a family destined to become one of the greatest in the land. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vltifpk8qb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.833743,51.614179]}},{"properties":{"name":"Piazza Navona","description":"Posted by Chinsishe<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/2005_01_08_Day232_Navona.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/navona.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/Piazza_Navona_Fountain2.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/Rome_PiazzaNavona.jpg\">romeBernini\n1650 AD\nRome, Italy<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vltihb3xzn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.473071,41.898967]}},{"properties":{"name":"Picugi pyramids","description":"Posted by DsinisaStrange pyramid-like hills in Picugi, near Porec, Croatia.

In June, 1981 six young people from the mountain village of Medjugorje reportedly encountered Mary near the top of Mount Podbrdo, a small mountain located in central Yugoslavia. In a series of apparitions that still continues, but with much less frequency, she reportedly sent a message of faith, prayer, fasting, conversion and peace. In these apparitions Mary said she came to bring humanity back to her Son; and warned that Satan is especially active in these times and that it was necessary to pray fervently and often to ward off his advances.\n\nDuring the early \\'80\\'s, Medjugorje became well known initially throughout Europe, with newspaper reports in such disparate publications as Le Monde and the Financial Times; by the late \\'80\\'s it had become known throughout the world. As a result of its growing fame, more than ten million pilgrims had visited it by the tenth anniversary of the first apparition. On the tenth anniversary, conflict broke out among the Bosnian Serbs and Croats which has continued to this day. Despite this conflict, thousands of pilgrims still manage to make the dangerous journey to Medjugorje each year.\n\nLess well known than the apparitions themselves, is an unusual event that preceded them. In May, 1981, Father Tomislav Vlasic of Capljina, Yugoslavia was in Rome attending a conference on Catholic Charismatic Renewal. At this conference he asked to be prayed over for the healing of the Church since he had become increasingly pessimistic about his parish ministry. One of the individuals who prayed over Father Vlasic was Sister Briege McKenna, a member of the Sisters of St. Clare with a healing ministry. While she prayed, Sister Briege reported seeing Father Vlasic sitting on the celebrant\\'s chair in the sanctuary of his church and surrounded by a large crowd; beneath his seat were streams of living water which were flowing from the altar. Simultaneous with this, Fr. Tardiff another of the individuals praying over Father Vlasic, reported hearing the words, \"Do not fear. I am sending you my Mother.\" The apparitions in Medjugorje began several weeks later.\n\nSince the apparitions have lasted for such a long time, it has been possible to subject the visionaries to a large and diverse number of medical, physical and psychological tests. The physiological and psychological battery of tests they were taken through showed them to be bright, well-adjusted teenagers. The medical tests indicated no major physical problems. In short, they seemed to be experiencing something outside themselves which had a significant and long-term impact on their demeanor and behavior.\n\n In the reports of her appearances here, Mary is said to ask each of us to return to her Son; to become aware of the active and destructive role that Satan plays in the modern world and to protect ourselves against Satan\\'s actions through frequent, fervent prayer to Jesus. In addition, she requested fasting twice weekly, frequent reception of the sacraments -particularly the Eucharist - and personal surrender of our will to the will of God.\n\nTo emphasize the urgency of her requests, she entrusted the visionaries with ten secrets which purport to be descriptions of events that will transpire if humanity fails to correct itself. At this time (early \\'96), two of the visionaries have received the ten secrets. The remaining visionaries have received nine. She has also told the visionaries that when the apparitions cease at Medjugorje, they will cease at all other Marian apparition sites around the world. When this occurs, the events described in the secrets will begin to unfold.\n\nThe ten secrets of Medjugorje appear to be a continuation of the Fatima Secrets and are similar in general character to the secrets described at <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/77089\">Garabandal</a>.\n\nIn 1982, the Church established a commission to begin to evaluate the occurrences at Medjugorje. As part of the initial report, Father Tomislav Vlasic, the local pastor, sent the Pope and the Bishop of Mostar a letter detailing what little information is available about the secrets. In the letter he states:\n\n    \"According to Mirjana, during the apparition on December 25, 1982, the Madonna confided the tenth and last secret to her, and she revealed the dates on which the various secrets will come to pass. The Blessed Virgin revealed many aspects of the future to Mirjana, many more up to now than to the other seers. For that reason, I relate now what Mirjana told me in a conversation on November 5, 1983 I shall summarize the essential things she said, without any literal quotations:\n\n# Before the visible sign is given to humanity, there will be three warnings to the world. The warnings will be warnings on the earth. Mirjana will witness them. Three days before one of these warnings, she will advise a priest of her choice. Mirjana\\'s testimony will be a confirmation of the apparitions and an incentive for the conversion of the world. After these warnings, the visible sign will be given for all humanity at the place of the apparitions in Medjugorje. The sign will be given as the testimony of the apparitions and a call back to faith.\n# The ninth and tenth secret are grave matters. They are a chastisement for the sins of the world. The punishment is inevitable because we cannot expect the conversion of the entire world. The chastisement can be mitigated by prayers and penance. It cannot be suppressed...\n# After the first warning, the others will follow within a rather brief period of time. So it is that people will have time for conversion.\n# This time is a period of grace and conversion. After the visible sign, those who are still alive will have little time for conversion. For that reason, the Blessed Virgin calls for urgent conversion and reconciliation.\n# The invitation to prayer and penance is destined to ward off evil and war and above all to save souls.\n# We are close to the events predicted by the Blessed Virgin.\n# Convert yourselves as quickly as possible. Open your hearts to God. This is a message to all mankind.\n\nIn addition to these remarks, Father Tomislav added the following observations in August, 1983: \"They say that with the realization of the secrets entrusted to them by Our Lady, life in the world will change. Afterwards, men will believe like in ancient times. What will change and how it will change, we don\\'t know, given that the seers don\\'t want to say anything about the secrets.\"\n\nA further clarification of the character of the initial secrets came from a series of interviews conducted by Janice Connell several years after Father Tomislav\\'s report. In her interview with Marijana, she asked for any additional information about the secrets that Marijana was permitted to disclose. Marijana responded:\n\n     \"The first two secrets will be warnings to the world - events that will occur before a visible sign is given to humanity. These will happen in my lifetime. Ten days before the first secret and the second secret, I will notify Father Petar Ljubicic. He will pray and fast for seven days, and then he will announce these to the world.\"\n\nWhen pressed to give additional details, Mirjana stated:\n\n    \"Well, the first secret will break the power of Satan, and that is why he is so aggressive now.\"\n\nThe message of Medjugorje has the same components as the earlier messages at Fatima, Garabandal and a number of previous Marian apparitions. The local Church\\'s commission on the apparitions has yet to make a final determination on the events at Medjugorje. The strong and personal disagreements between the local Bishop and the local Franciscans ministering to the parish at the time of the initial apparitions combined with the outbreak of the civil war has made a full and fair evaluation of the events there quite difficult. The clerical disagreements appear to be related to the potent influence the Franciscans had when acting as spiritual counselors to the \"visionaries\". The local Bishop, Msgr. Zanic, thought the Franciscans were publicizing the events at Medjugorje much too quickly and too rapidly to properly evaluate and analyze what was happening there. The preliminary Church statement, finally issued in January, 1991 stated:\n\n    \" The supernatural characteristic (in the miraculous sense) is not established, but it is not excluded either; the Episcopal Commission continues its work to get a decision, a decision the bishops do not want judged prematurely. The pilgrimage, of national and international dimension, is the bishops\\' responsibility.\"\n\nThe message of Mary at Medjugorje is one of peace and acceptance - acceptance of the will of God, acceptance of whatever suffering that may come as humanity moves closer to a self-induced catastrophe, acceptance of Mary\\'s role as our loving Mother, and acceptance of God\\'s desire for us to renew our faith in Him through prayer, conversion, fasting and love. If we convert ourselves with the help of God\\'s graces, then and only then will we be able to achieve peace in our hearts, peace in our families, peace between neighbors and peace between nations.\n\n The purported apparitions at Garabandal and Medjugorje have created some confusion and conflict among the various religious authorities who have investigated the occurrences. In Medjugorje, the scientific group headed by Dr. Korljan, seems to have been given short shrift in the process of evaluation by several members of the clerical evaluation group. In turn, the clerical evaluation group divided between backers of the former Bishop and backers of the local Franciscans. In short, the Commission seemed to reflect the chaotic state of affairs in Bosnia and Croatia. This type of conflict serves to reaffirm the Catholic Church\\'s reluctance to affirm the reality of any apparition until a long-lasting and thorough evaluation takes place.\n\nIn Garabandal, one of the original \"visionaries\", Maria Cruz, recanted her original description of events and said she wasn\\'t sure she ever had a vision of Mary. To further complicate matters, Conchita noted in her diary that the Blessed Virgin had warned the girls that they would have to experience trials and suffering.\n\n and they would contradict one another. Further the Chancery of Santander, which is the local religious authority in the region, issued warnings about the apparitions shortly after they started thus giving the appearance of trying to quash these events before they were thoroughly examined. Within four months of the first apparition, the local Bishop had issued a statement calling events at Garabandal unproved.\n\nThe most troubling aspects of these two apparitions, aside from their marathon duration, is the predestination implied in the warning messages. Unlike previous apparitions, there is no contingency clause to the prophecies such as \"Unless men convert...\". The \"visionaries\" say that they know NOW the date that each of these events are to occur.\n\nFor example, at Garabandal Our Lady reportedly stated that the Miracle will occur on a Thursday evening at 8:30 PM (Garabandal time) between the 8th and 16th of either March, April or May. The Miracle will coincide with an important event in the Church and on a feast day of a martyr of the Eucharist. Russia will finally be converted after the Miracle occurs.\n\nLooking at the calendar from now through the year 2000 shows two years, 1996 and 2000, when the conditions mentioned above appear to be met. April 11, 1996 is the feast day of St. Stanislaus, Bishop of Cracow who was martyred while celebrating Mass and April 13, 2000 is the feast day of St. Hermenegild of Spain who was martyred because he wouldn\\'t receive communion from a heretical bishop. There are several other martyrs whose feast day falls within the dates mentioned at Garabandal. One is St. John Ogilvie of England whose feast day is March 10th. St. John was martyred because he refused to renounce his Catholicism. The next March 10th that occurs on a Thursday will come in 2005; another is St. Pancras of Rome whose feast day is May 12th. He was martyred for his beliefs at the age of 14. However, May 12th does not occur on a Thursday until 2005. This level of precise predetermination is difficult to embrace since it seems to eliminate the efficacy of any response by humanity to the grace given to it by God.\n\nIn addition, the secrets of Medjugorje appear to indicate an almost fatalistic view of the future. Medjugorje is perhaps the most important Marian site in the last sixty years. Millions have returned to prayer and a sacramental life as a result of visiting or learning about the events reportedly occurring there. Nonetheless, as with all apparitions, each of us are required to be discerning as St. Paul has urged, \"Test everything; retain what is good.\" (1 Thess. 5:21)\n\nIt is obviously possible for Heaven to choose specific dates for events to occur, but it seems to remove the hope that through repentence and changed behavior, humanity can petition God to relent as He did at Nineveh. This level of predetermination is not a characteristic of earlier Marian apparitions, nor does it appear to be consistent with other statements made about the end times,\n\"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but the Father only.\" (Matt 24:36-37).\n\nOnly time and further evaluation and discernment will uncover exactly what occurred in these two mountainous parts of Europe. Clearly, the response of the tens of millions of the faithful around the world would appear to indicate that these two events should not be taken lightly.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vlti78mjco"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[17.673611,43.195835]}},{"properties":{"name":"Solesmes Abbey","description":"Posted by Jklmiller<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/solesmes2.jpg\">solesmesThe abbey St-Pierre-de-Solesmes, founded in 1010, is a Benedictine abbey.
