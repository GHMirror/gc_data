The motel’s owner, Walter Lane Bailey kept a couple of rooms as a shrine to Dr. King and to Bailey’s wife, Lorraine, who died of a brain hemorrhage several hours after King was shot. By 1982, the Lorraine Motel was a foreclosed property. A group of prominent Memphians, concerned that this historic site would be destroyed through continued neglect and indifference, formed the Martin Luther King Memorial Foundation to save the Lorraine. Using a design report by a former Smithsonian Institution, Benjamin Lawless, and the Foundation started seeking funding for the nations’ first comprehensive exhibit chronicling America’s civil rights movement. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6d34v0le76e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.058001,35.134538]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tokyo, Japan","description":"Posted by CalestewartTokyo, Japanthe <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6d34unci38t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.766663,35.700001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Washington, DC","description":"Posted by CalestewartWashington, District of ColumbiaWashington is the capital of the United States.
