Military politics and hard feelings had led to the Union command splitting up and camping in different locations around town, which helped Forrest defeat them when he attacked. Union General T. T. Crittenden had ordered that all units be encamped together when he arrived to take command of the Union garrison on July 12th. But the order had thus far been ignored.\n \nThe Minnesotans heard the firing around the town square and had time to line up for battle. However, they had only advanced about 400 yards when the Georgia cavalry portion of Forrest\\'s command showed up. The Union artillery pieces began taking pot shots at the Confederates, but the Minnesota infantry stayed in place instead of moving forward. While the Georgians held the Minnesotans in place, another Confederate contingent swung around behind the Union line and attacked their base camp. Now they were really stuck. The boys in blue could neither advance nor retreat.\n \nAt this point, Forrest employed a trick he would use again at other times. He fooled Lester into thinking the Confederates had him soundly outnumbered. He said the other Union officers had already surrendered (a lie) and that Lester would need to surrender his command immediately or have his men put to the sword. \n \nLester bought the ruse and called for a secret ballot of the officers in his unit. They voted to surrender and Forrest captured the Minnesotans nearly without a fight. Lester would end up humiliated by the surrender and he and the officers who voted to surrender wound up being dismissed from the service.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpxuep4v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.40131,35.84715]}},{"properties":{"name":"7th Pennsylvania Cavalry Camp","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpl6bpor"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3840872049,35.8543874685]}},{"properties":{"name":"Camp of the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpj9sh5u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3837814331,35.8547613874]}},{"properties":{"name":"Camp of the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpq3axsp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3835775852,35.8541613771]}},{"properties":{"name":"Camp of the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fppqchc6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3835775852,35.8541613771]}},{"properties":{"name":"Camp of the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpvq6qt5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3835775852,35.8541613771]}},{"properties":{"name":"Camp of the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpoc271r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3837814331,35.8547613874]}},{"properties":{"name":"Camp of the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpvl6j5d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3835775852,35.8541613771]}},{"properties":{"name":"Double Springs Picket Post","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a>This was the approximate location of the first picket post (guards) that Forrest\\'s command came upon. Union General Crittenden had ordered that all pickets be doubled when he took command of the Union garrison the day before, but the order wasn\\'t carried out. Forrest quietly captured the surprised Union guard post camped here.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fppupzzv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.33714,35.83644]}},{"properties":{"name":"Final Picket Post","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a>Around this point Forrest\\'s command found the final picket post before town. In order to preserve the element of surprise, Forrest sent some men off the road, swinging around wide and then back onto the road between the pickets and the town. The Confederate cavalrymen came leisurely riding up to the pickets from town, so the guards mistook them for their own men coming out to visit the picket line. By the time the Union guards realized what was going on, they were surrounded by men with pistols pointed at them. \nForrest had captured all of the guards outside of the east side of town without a single shot. None of the soldiers in town had any clue what was about to happen.\nForrest ordered Colonel Wharton and his command to attack the soldiers camped around the Maney house and property. The rest of the command would ride as fast as possible into the town square. There, a portion of the command would start ridding the town of the blue coats. The remainder of the command would continue through town to the final Union camp on the west side of town near a branch of Stones River. The 3rd Minnesota Infantry and some artillery were camped there and this contingent was to capture them before they had the chance to put up a defense or run.\nStraight off, Forrest made a mistake that nearly cost him the day. Wharton started toward the Maney property and only a portion of his unit had followed him before Forrest and his aides set out on the road toward the town square. The bulk of Wharton\\'s men, unaware of what had happened, followed Forrest to the center of town. Wharton was unaware of what had happened until he began his attack at the Maney home. When his men hit the hastily erected resistance of the 9th Michigan infantry, he discovered he barely had enough men to make the charge. But he valiantly charged anyway.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpt24dqo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.37507,35.84422]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jim N' Nick's Barbecue","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 436 North Thompson Lane, Murfreesboro, TN Simply the best barbecue in town, hands down.

All of the current Maney Avenue was, at the time of the raid, the driveway up to the Maney House.\n\nFive companies of the 9th Michigan infantry were camped around the spring near the Maney house and a portion of the 7th Pennsylvania cavalry was camped in front of the house near where the current rail fence is.\n\nEarly on this July morning, Colonel Wharton and a portion of his Texas cavalry attacked the Maney property. They caught the Union soldiers sleeping and managed to capture or scatter most of the Pennsylvania cavalrymen, whom they hit first. By the time Wharton\\'s men made it back to the Michigan infantry camp, the alarm had been raised. The Michiganders had raised a quick barricade of hay bales and overturned wagons and began putting up a stiff resistance.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fpjbara6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.38496,35.85612]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rutherford County Courthouse","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/1/Digital_Download_070.jpg\">The Rutherford County Courthouse was completed in 1858.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8fppb02a1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.39195,35.84611]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Arnold-Harrell House AKA Daffodil Hill","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.pastigo.com\" href=\"http://www.pastigo.com\">Darrin365</a>One of the guides Forrest used in making his raid on Murfreesboro was Captain Edwin Arnold, who lived in Murfreesboro.
