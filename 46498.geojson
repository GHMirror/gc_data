For those of you who may want to get a game of golf in during your visit, we've also marked the Pebblewood Country Club.\n\nFor a more detailed map view, simply click on &amp;quot;map&amp;quot; in the upper right corner of the map.  You can zoom in and out of the map by using the scale on the left side of map.\n\nHOW TO GET PERSONALIZED DRIVING DIRECTIONS\n&amp;gt; Simply click on a pinpointed location on the map, OR scroll through and select a specific location from the list of hotels, B&amp;amp;Bs, etc. on the right-hand side of the page that coincide with the pinpointed locations on the map.\n\n&amp;gt; After selecting a specific location, the location name and address details will be displayed under the map.\n\n&amp;gt; Click on the website link that is provided below the address details, which will link you back to the location’s website or homepage.\n\n&amp;gt; On most of the websites we have linked to, there is a “Get Directions” or “Driving Directions” link to assist you in getting to/from your travel origination/destination points.\n\nIf you need further assistance with directions, please don't hesitate to contact us by phone at (708) 442-6108 or e-mail (John - jr2inla@gmail.com; Julie - jkcottrell@gmail.com).\n\nRUSH HOUR TRAFFIC\nKeep in mind that if you're driving from or through the Chicago-area to get to Michigan, the freeways are usually jam-packed beginning at 4:00 p.m.  Traffic is worse on Friday afternoons in the summertime as people leave work early and head out of the city - many on their way to summer/lake homes.\n\nThe normal trip time from Chicago to The Ryan's Cottage is 1.5 to 2 hours.  Friday afternoons in the summer can increase travel time to as much as 3 hours.  If at all possible, try to avoid travel during rush hour...  we want our guests to arrive safely and stress-free.\n\nEASTERN TIME ZONE REMINDER\nPlease remember, the wedding events take place on Eastern Time - you will lose an hour if you're traveling in from Illinois or Wisconsin!\n\nSHUTTLE PICK-UP/DROF-OFF LOCATION\nAs mentioned in the wedding invitations, parking is not available along the beach access road.  Therefore, alternate parking and a shuttle have been arranged to transport guests to the wedding ceremony/reception site.  As marked on this map, you may park your vehicles at The Episcopal Church of the Mediator, located at 14280 Red Arrow Highway in Lakeside, Michigan.\n\nShuttle pick-up schedule\n(max. capacity 24 guests per shuttle run)\n5:45 p.m. - 1st shuttle pick-up\n6:05 p.m. - 2nd shuttle pick-up\n6:25 p.m. - 3rd shuttle pick-up\n6:45 p.m. - Final shuttle pick-up\n\nReturn shuttle service will be provided for guests.\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Best Western New Buffalo","description":"Posted by Jr2inla<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/5d38bfb68571831a4872f123763b65b1.jpg\">49117-8200Best Western In New Buffalo\n18800 Laporte Road,   New Buffalo, Michigan, 49117-8200\n Phone: 269-469-4193<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fq8pfjlls"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.733499,41.776945]}},{"properties":{"name":"Comfort Inn Plaza","description":"Posted by Jr2inla<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/comfort_inn_new_buffalo.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 11539 O\\'Brien Court New Buffalo, MI 49117Comfort Inn Plaza - New Buffalo, Michigan\n11539 O\\'Brien Ct. , New Buffalo, MI, US, 49117-9277\nToll-Free: (888) 627-4364<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fq8ocp3ti"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.733853,41.771239]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gordon Beach Inn","description":"Posted by Jr2inla<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/gordon_beach_inn.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 16220 Lakeshore Road union pier michiganGordon Beach Inn\nUnion Pier, MI  49129\nPhone: 269-469-0800<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fq8pjfu21"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.699006,41.826226]}},{"properties":{"name":"Holiday Inn Express Hotel &amp; Suites","description":"Posted by Jr2inla<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/holiday_inn_new_buffalo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> new buffalo, miHoliday Inn Express - New Buffalo\n(269) 469-1400<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fq8jakurn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.731567,41.777521]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lakeside Inn","description":"Posted by Jr2inla<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/lakeside_inn.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 15251 Lakeshore Rd,  49116Lakeside Inn\n 269.469.0600\nmanager@lakesideinns.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fq8c01dwo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.679624,41.838891]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Buffalo Inn &amp; Spa","description":"Posted by Jr2inla<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/new_buffalo_inn_and_spa.bmp\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 231 E.
