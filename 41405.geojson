I went to a French restaurant next to the Old Ship Hotel, home to the best meal I’ve had in the UK so far! Unfortunately the fish and chips from a nearby takeaway were as average (and expensive) as I’ve come to expect over here.\nStill, if you have a few bucks to spend, Brighton is wonderful!

Of course we didn?t escape unscathed ? the chaos and diversions from other airports infected Stansted and our flight was delayed by three hours.\nWe were shepherded into the aircraft after nearly two hours of waiting. After everyone settled on board, the captain announced that our departure slot actually wasn?t for another hour, but sometimes if planes are ready earlier other slots come open, so we might be able to take off sooner. There were sounds of dismay from passengers, who after already waiting for four hours (including the two involved in checking in), were now facing another, stuck in a confined spot going nowhere.\nLuckily I?d brought a lot of reading material, and Ian had his DVD player. I can only imagine what the mothers with small children would have thought.\nWe were flying with Titan Airways, which is a small charter company that does UK to France runs specifically for ski package companies over winter. My theory is that the big, regular airlines get priority for flight slots, because we sat on the tarmac for the full hour before taking off.\nThe flight was okay, but when we arrived in Chambery the tiny airport was in chaos, given that the majority of flights were to London airports, to which flights were cancelled. Thanking our stars that we were arriving and not leaving, we found our bags and eventually found our bus, after tracking down representatives from the package provider, Crystal, who was meant to be transferring us.\nWe got a prime seat on the bus (I suffer from motion sickness, so this is important) and set off. We were informed we would have to transfer at Aime, which was met with more groans from passengers. After a couple of hours we arrived in Aime, which is at the base of the Alps. There we were split up into minibuses for our respective resorts. Once again we were among the first on board, which was good, because soon the minivan was overflowing with people.\nOur driver spoke no English (which was fair enough) and didn?t seem to care that the bus was overloaded. Two girls tried to squeeze into the seat next to Ian, asking if we could squeeze over a bit. Thankfully before the bus driver got too much momentum a Crystal representative came up and forced some of the people to get out and go into another bus. Two groups were split up, which caused a bit of consternation.\nBy now I realised that contrary to the promises of making things simple and efficient, Crystal just hired a bunch of teenagers who had no idea what was going on and sent them out to deal with customers problems, of which there were many.\nDuring one of several delays, we chatted to the young guy who was our Crystal rep. He unashamedly admitted he spoke no French and was not at all familiar with the resort we were staying at, and had only been in La Plagne for a couple of weeks since finishing his training somewhere else.\nWe eventually arrived in Belle Plagne, the village in La Plagne we were staying at, where the check-in staff tried to charge us, even though we?d paid for the package in advance through Crystal. Her English was worse than my French, and she didn?t or chose not to understand when I said ?nous avons deja achete, nous avons deja paye???). Calling over our Crystal representative didn?t help at all of course, since he spoke not a word of French. Luckily the same drama was happening at the other check-in desk with another group who had arrived with us, and somehow Crystal and the hotel sorted it out.\nAfter lugging our gear uphill through the car park we finally arrived at our room, which was in the highest apartments of the resort. .. great for skiing in at the end of the day. We opened the door and were confronted with a dinghy studio? with no double bed. Two twins, obstinately split, and a bunk bed. We decided to haul the mattresses off the bunks and put them between the twins, which were also kind of our living room couch.\nAfter doing a bit of nesting, it was time to go out for dinner. We?d been up since 6am and it was now 9pm. Ian pointed out that after all of my raving about how great Europe is because it?s so easy to travel to different places, with all the delays it took us the same time to get from Cambridge to La Plagne as it did from Adelaide to Falls Creek. It was a depressing thought.\nNevertheless, we?d arrived finally, and we were going to have Ian?s first ever French meal! We went to leave our apartment and the lock wouldn?t work. We then discovered the phone line to reception written everywhere didn?t work. After a fair amount of swearing we decided Ian would stay in the room while I walked back down the slope to the reception area and got them to deal with it. It turned out the door has a particular locking mechanism involving lifting the door handle while turning the lock, which of course no one had told us about. I also complained to the guy I summoned that we?d tried to call reception. He looked at me incredulously and said ?but 9 isn?t the reception number, it?s 5900!? I wanted to throttle him.\nAnother half an hour later we got to go to dinner. Thankfully the French eat later than us, so at 9:30 the restaurants were still serving. I got a salade au chevre chaud, after my gloriously memorable meal in Montpellier, while Ian got a not-so-French calzone. After trying my salad he vowed to order proper French food for the rest of the week. The aperitif and Belgian beer calmed us and by the end of the meal we were excited and happy about being in the French Alps.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf4865j26"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.743637,48.961076]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hoi An Ancient Town","description":"Posted by Cobi<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf4d62mn1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[108.333333,15.883333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home (Australia)","description":"Posted by Cobi<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf4aiooyk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[138.50906,-34.99154]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home (UK)","description":"Posted by Cobi<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf48lv783"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.11381,52.19845]}},{"properties":{"name":"Le soleil et la neige (or lack thereof)","description":"Posted by CobiLa Plagne, France  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/19962748@N00/350444409/\" title=\"photo sharing\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/350444409_2c4f422cf4_m.jpg\"></a>\n\nWe woke up to our first morning in La Plagne early despite our long day before, keen to hit the slopes. After dealing with a couple more Crystal stuff-ups with our lift passes we eventually got out there, both on snowboards for the first time since Canada.\nI realised that the better you get at something, the harder it is to try something else. Having not fallen down on skis for a couple of years, it was a shock having to get up again and again after falling over on the snowboard. It was lucky I was wearing my new helmet.\nI quickly got the feel for snowboarding again, but given the less than perfect conditions I was hesitant to do more than leaf (the basic, safe snowboarding technique), fearful of getting overambitious and ending up with an icy nosebleed. So I wasn?t getting much speed up, and it wasn?t as exciting as snow trips should be.\nI found La Plagne a pretty challenging resort for snowboarding, as there are a lot of uphill bits linking the runs, which make me fall over. I get a little bit of speed up, then see I?m coming up to a flat or uphill bit. I start thinking ?okay, just keep balanced, keep going, just don?t fall over, because then you?ll have to get off and walk and that sucks?? and will promptly fall over from concentrating too hard. Then the only option is to remove your bindings and skate along, while skiers zip past, or even worse if it?s uphill take your board off altogether and start trudging.\nSome time in the morning I fell off coming off a ski lift and absolutely caned my leg on a pole (once again, thanks to the helmet), but the final straw towards the end of the day was when I was doing the aforementioned cruising along a flat bit, hit a rock and fell forward, skidding along the ice until my face stopped me.\nI lay there for a while, gathering energy, then got up and vowed ?that?s it! This sucks! That really hurt. I am not snowboarding any more unless there?s more snow!? So I packed it in, taking my snowboard back to the rental place to swap for skis, which luckily is free in La Plagne.\nThere on in it was smooth sailing, or skiing rather. There was no more snow so I skied the rest of the week. I zipped around, waiting patiently when Ian had to take off his board or skate, elegantly disembarking from ski lifts, able to ski right to our door, and most importantly not falling over.\nSnowboarding in Europe is not the done thing, like in Australia or Canada. 80% of people ski, and 10% who were snowboarding two years ago have moved on to the next big craze, snowblades, which are the really short skis, as good for terrain parks as the slopes.\nWe did spend a lot of time on the slopes but there were other highlights. Many involved food. One was Ian?s first proper fondue, at a cute cabin-like restaurant at the base of Belle Plagne. Another was the constant supply of fresh, crusty baguettes and other bakery treats. Unlike in Australia, being in the middle of a mountain resort does not mean paying through the nose for fresh food. There is a bakery in Belle Plagne that has a line at all hours of the day, and it was charming watching people walking through the snow with baguettes in their hands. We indulged in French cheeses like Roquefort, and bought so many saucissons we had to take some home.\nOn the Thursday Ian hurt his shoulder falling over, as snowboarders do, and on Friday didn?t want to risk further damage, so we opted to return our gear early and set out for a mountain hike instead. We got the aforementioned foodstuffs together for a picnic, along with several beers, and set up the mountain (Ian carried the food of course).\nWe were rewarded with a sun-drenched peak with a view of Mont Blanc, where we sat and ate and drank until dusk. The food was a little less tasty than usual given it was half frozen, but the experience was worth it. We vowed next time we go on a snow trip to take a day off the slopes to do for a hike and picnic again, if the weather permits.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf45mdw2x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.743637,48.961076]}},{"properties":{"name":"London Exhibition","description":"Posted by CobiLondon, UK  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/19962748@N00/402558888/\" title=\"photo sharing\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/402558888_ff4351e4e7_m.jpg\"></a>\nI went to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which I’d never heard of before my Finnish friend Ilona took me there.

After a disappointing lack of snow during trips to the <a href=\"http://cobi.wordpress.com/2006/12/26/going-from-england-to-france-is-like-crossing-aust/\">French </a>and <a href=\"http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/cobi/england0607/1157679600/tpod.html\">Australian </a>Alps recently, I decided that if Norway didn’t have powder in peak season, climate change had beaten me, and I would have to give up.Norway has given me new inspiration. It was incredible. The conditions were perfect ? dry sunshine on the Friday, consistent snowfall on the Saturday. We went to <a href=\"http://www.hafjell.no/com/\">Hafjell</a>, near Lillehammer, which is a lovely little resort; it reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.skibanff.com/\">Sunshine</a>, my regular resort in Canada.\nAlso it was surprisingly affordable. I?d been cringing in anticipation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_krone\">Norwegian krone</a>, which is a currency even more devastating to the Australian dollar than the English pound. Though the food was expensive (which is understandable due to the climate), the ski rental was much cheaper than in Australia, France or Canada, and given that ski passes were included in our package, it was much cheaper to be on the slopes than in the pub!\nThis was the first trip I?d done in a while where I didn?t speak the language, which was no problem at all. All the Norwegians I met were so friendly and welcoming, most had flawless English, and those that didn?t were so apologetic it felt like they were in my country, not vice versa. After a day, during which I gave locals my usual barrage of language questions, I felt that if I were to live in Norway the language would be comprehensible within a few weeks. I don?t think it?s so different to other European languages.\nOn the Sunday we opted to stay in Lillehammer as we were flying out in the late afternoon. After a couple of evenings in the town we were somewhat familiar with it, and in any case Norway quaintly closes most shops on Sundays. So rather than wandering, the concierge recommended we visit <a href=\"http://www.maihaugen.no/\">Maihaugen</a>, the nearby open air cultural museum and exhibition space. We did, which gave me an insight into Norwegian life, as much because of the activities going on as the artefacts. Sunday appears to be family day so there were Norwegians everywhere, bobsledding, skating, building snowmen, drinking varm saft and eating sausages in flat bred.\nBetween the fabulous skiing and the friendly Norwegian culture Ian and I found Norway magnificent, so much so that we started to talk about moving to Oslo in a couple of years? time will tell.\n<em>You can view more gorgeous photos I took in Norway <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=norway&amp;w=19962748%40N00\">here</a>. </em>\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf4dx18r4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[10.47,61.119998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Panorama skiing - Panorama, British Columbia, Canada","description":"Posted by Cobi<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Panorama, British Columbia, Canada\n\t<a href=\"http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/cobi/canada2004/1078714620.html\"><img src=\"http://www.travelpod.com/cgi-bin/img_onedot.pl?tweb_UID=cobi&amp;tweb_tripID=canada2004&amp;tweb_entryID=1078714620\" width=\"329\"></a>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"http://xads.zedo.com/ads2/r?n=355;c=1130/958;s=46;x=2304;u=j\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"http://xads.zedo.com/ads2/x?n=355;c=1130/958;s=46;x=2304;u=j\" alt=\"Click here\"></a>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<b>Panorama, British Columbia, Canada</b><b> No time for articulate prose right now, I\\'m too busy with uni work. So here\\'s an email excerpt· </b>I\\'m almost home from Panorama, my bus home though doesn\\'t come for about 20 mins so I am at the university library. I left my backpack with the library people downstairs. I had a fantabulous time, it was great. Definitely worth 300 bucks. I am an intermediate skier now, as opposed to a beginner. I was even teaching others how not to snowplough, if that makes sense. It was so much fun. The first day was hard work though, I went out with Marie (French) Marion (Canadian, from BC originally) and Sarah (fellow Adelaidian, in 21st dinner pictures), but Sarah worked in Canada last winter hence is more experienced. Everyone was much better that me, and I was struggling! We got to the top of the second lift (it takes three to get to the very top) and reached the top of this slope and I was like \\'whoa - guys, I\\'m not sure about this\\' but of course once you get to that point you can\\'t exactly just turn back. So I spent all day snowploughing down these fearsomely steep (by my standards) and icy peaks. I was kind of disappointed because by the time I left Hotham when I was there I was doing black runs, but I was seriously struggling on these slopes at Panorama. I didn\\'t fall over - not even once all weekend - but I wasn\\'t really having fun, wasting too much energy on staying upright. That night when we were looking on the map - lo and behold we\\'d been doing black runs all afternoon! No wonder! 4 years with no practice and I\\'d just been launched back into black runs! It had been pretty damn cold, too. Still it made me feel much, much better. <img src=\"http://www.travelpod.com/users/cobi/canada2004.1078714620.panorama_010.jpg\">On the second day I wanted to have fun, so I went out with three people who were not quite as experienced as me (so that I could boost my ego from being worst of the bunch the day before), and I planned our itinerary from the map. It was a perfect blue sky sunshine day, we went on this really long, windy but relatively flat blue run route of about 6 runs to get back to the bottom, it was soooo beautiful, and as they weren\\'t downhill, relatively secluded.On Saturday night we went to the Glacier, the Panorama resort night club, and as there were about 100 UofC students between the International Business Student Club and the Ski Club, who went with us. I got to know this chick Nadine, who is the girlfriend of Rob one of the German exchange guys, he\\'s from Berlin, and she is too obviously, she\\'s just here for two weeks, so now I have someone I know in Berlin to show me around. Today was probably the most fun as it had been getting fairly icy as the snow melted in the sunshine, but it dumped down this morning, so lots of fun to play in. I got kind of soggy as the snow in BC is not as dry as in Calgary, and I had to wipe off my goggles regularly from so much snow, but it was worth it for the better skiing.\n    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf49akutf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.235649,50.459527]}},{"properties":{"name":"Singapore","description":"Posted by Cobisingapore<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf40eki4e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.849998,1.299999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sunshine Village, Banff, AB, Canada","description":"Posted by CobiBanff, AB, T1L 1J5<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf44ptjta"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.669599,51.172079]}},{"properties":{"name":"Year of the Pig","description":"Posted by CobiLondon, UK  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/19962748@N00/tags/chinesenewyear/\" title=\"photo sharing\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/134/406710086_4fed02a92f_m.jpg\" height=\"174\" width=\"231\"></a>\nUnfortunately you have to go to Flickr to see Chris and Ian rotated!\nChinese New Year turned out to be a big weekend. A couple of Hong Kong expats from Ian’s sustainable engineering course hosted a great party in Cambridge on Friday night, then on Sunday I went into London for the major Chinese New Year celebrations focused around Trafalgar and Leicester squares. We had Dim Sum (what we call Yum Cha in Australia, essentially Chinese brunch) at the (in)famous New World in the heart of Chinatown, noted in <a href=\"http://www.dimsum.co.uk/food/top-10-dimsum-restaurants-in-london.html\">this list of the top 10 Dim Sum places in London</a> for it’s trolley-to-your-table service.\nUnfortunately for our predominantly white Western group this meant being served last as the trolleys meandered amongst the tables. It reached the stage where we were flailing our arms as trolleys sailed past pleading ‘please, please give us dumplings’!? Eventually we were sated, then wandered amongst the crowds, buying jars of sauce and enjoying the deafening Chinese firecrackers.\nIt’s a very auspicious year for me, as was born in the Year of the Pig, and here it is again!

I suffered the consequences, and am now trying to recover from a virus turned chest infection before flying to the French Alps on Saturday, for Christmas.I\\'m starting to get to know London· my Finnish friend Ilona is currently living there working in a book shop, and she had a rare pre-Christmas weekend day off last Saturday, so I went to visit her. We went to a cute and cheap Thai place for lunch (oh how I miss cheap, good Asian food in Cambridge·), then went to the Victoria and Albert Museum, where we wandered through decades of world-renowned fashion design. It\\'s been a few years since I\\'ve worked in fashion but I\\'m still a sucker for a striking fabric creation, so this was a treat, and seeing world-famous outfits in the flesh (textile, rather) is a lot more interesting than reading Vogue.We then went to the Christmas Fair and ice skating rink outside the Natural History Museum and it hit me· this is Christmas. Growing up the Southern Hemisphere I always felt like Christmas was an odd interruption to the summer holidays. We go nine months of the year and then bam! Summer hits and everything happens. From Christmas to Easter is the time to be in Australia because there\\'s so much perfect weather and so many things to do. May to November is just plodding along work time, waiting for the next summer to come along. Whereas here in Europe, where most Christmas traditions began, Christmas is a respite from the cold and dark - it\\'s only a few days after the shortest day of the year - and all of the twinkling lights and carol singing brings some joy into an otherwise grey and dreary time. This is how it\\'s supposed to be! Here it gets dark at 4pm so Christmas lights actually do something, whereas in Australia, when the blistering hot sun is out until 8:30pm, lights and tinsel seem ridiculous. Last year before I left for England we had a Christmas in July, when family came down from the country - everyone came, because they weren\\'t busy with a million other things, like in December - and it was lovely. I\\'m going to try and encourage more Christmases in July in Australia because I\\'ve decided that\\'s what it\\'s all about. I feel like I\\'ve discovered the true meaning of Christmas, for non-religious people like me. Christmas is about finding some warmth in the coldest, darkest times of the year. It\\'s about getting some inspiration when you\\'re feeling a bit fed up with everything. Perhaps we need to give it a different name in the Southern Hemisphere, since for historical reasons that name in July is inappropriate - even better, we can keep Christmas and just add a winter holiday to our calendar!Merry Christmas, wherever you are!\n    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69uf44t00lt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/17451","metadata":null,"contact_name":"cobi","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:cobi","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/17451","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":18,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=17451,platial:user=cobi","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41405}
