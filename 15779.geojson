Consequently, they are not an exact representation of the expected wind field. The forecast wind radii are intended to show the expected size of the storm and the areas potentially affected by sustained winds of tropical storm force (34 Knot), 50 knot and hurricane force (64 knot) from a tropical cyclone. - Tropical storm force (34 Knot) radii are forecasted through 72 hours, - 50 knot radii are forecasted through 72 hours and - hurricane force (64 Knot) radii are forecasted through 36 hours NHC does not forecast wind radii beyond these times. Consequently, tropical cyclones may be forecasted at certain intensities without the corresponding wind radii. Users are reminded that the offical wind radii forecast represents the maximum possible extent of a given wind speed within a particular quadrant. As a result, not all locations falling within the radii will necessarily experience the indicated wind speeds. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the use of these data.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"STORMNUM":{"max":13.0,"min":13.0,"median":13.0},"NE":{"max":45,"min":45,"median":45},"VALIDTIME":{"max":null,"min":null,"median":null},"RADII":{"max":34.0,"min":34.0,"median":34.0},"SYNOPTIME":{"max":null,"min":null,"median":null},"SW":{"max":0,"min":0,"median":0},"SE":{"max":60,"min":60,"median":60},"TAU":{"max":3,"min":3,"median":3},"NW":{"max":0,"min":0,"median":0}},"features":[{"properties":{"STORMNUM":13.0,"NE":45,"VALIDTIME":"2009090403","RADII":34.0,"BASIN":"EP","SYNOPTIME":"2009090400","SW":0,"SE":60,"STORMID":"ep132009","TAU":3,"id":"a65ew6vh5chp","NW":0},"type":"Feature","geometry":null}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/","metadata":"http://C:\\Users\\Margot\\Desktop\\FortiusOneStuff\\NOAAHurricaneData\\ForecastInfo\\ep132009_2009090400_forecastradii.shp.xml","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"National Hurricane Center","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"hurricanes,knots,nhc,probabilities,speeds,storms,winds","published":"2009-09-04T12:00:00Z","id":15779}
