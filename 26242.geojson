She moved to Toronto in 1996, and quickly became a fixture at the city\\'s open mikes. There she met Doc (real name: Martin McKinney), an engineer and producer, and the two began working on a demo featuring his programming and her vocals. Sony eventually took interest, and suddenly Esthero went from a fledgling idea to a duo with Esthero\\'s name as their own and a record, Breath from Another, issued in spring 1998 on the label\\'s Work imprint. Breath\\'s mix of beats, lush vocals, and fractured bits of programmed samples caught on perfectly with the trip-hop trend of the time, and Esthero had success with singles like Heaven Sent and the hip-hop-flavored title track.\n\nHowever, it would take nearly seven years for a follow-up to appear. In the interim Esthero parted ways with Doc and struck out on her own, contributing vocals to projects like Black Eyed Peas\\' \"Weekends\" (2000). Signing with Reprise, she began work on new material, and returned officially in summer 2004 with the club single O.G. Bitch. Esthero followed the single in November of that year with We R in Need of a Musical Revolution, an EP that found her collaborating with Sean Lennon, Cee-Lo, and producer James Robertson (Skye Sweetnam) on a 21st century version of Breath\\'s assemblage sound. The EP set up a full-length entitled Wikked Lil\\' Girls, which was slated for release in early 2005.\n\n-allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66l1jq7fd1i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.392486,43.723057]}},{"properties":{"name":"Etobicoke Yacht Club","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ontariosailing.ca\" href=\"http://www.ontariosailing.ca\">Ontariosailing</a>300 humber bay park road west etobicoke ontario m8v 3x7<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66l1jynf1tl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.47916,43.61888]}},{"properties":{"name":"EyeTap Personal Imaging Lab","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://igargoyle.com/\" href=\"http://igargoyle.com/\">Nym</a><img src=\"http://www.eyetap.org/~billal/image/steve.jpg\">10 King\\'s College Road, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 3G4, CANADAThe EyeTap Personal Imaging Lab (ePI Lab) is a computer vision and intelligent image processing research lab focused on the area of personal imaging, mediated reality and wearable computers. Originally founded in 1998, it was formerly known as the Humanistic Intelligence Laboratory (HI Lab) at the University of Toronto by Professor Steve Mann. Its mandate from the beginning has been to research wearable computing and cybernetic concepts and to channel developments into practical, market-driven products and processes. Our recent name change reflects our renewed focus on the area of personal imaging of which Professor Mann has had 30 years experience of exploring, and with which we believe the penetration of wearable devices into the mainstream will begin first. ePI Lab research strengths include wearable computing hardware and Open Source Mediated Reality software. The lab hopes to develop a new generation of Personal Imaging Solutions and Mediated Reality interfaces to satisfy the huge demand for personal imaging across the world, and also overcome the challenges in our information saturated world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66l1jqlr88k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.364505,43.658558]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fastest Hill in Toronto","description":"Posted by Nubeli<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> You can go really fast downhill on this hill.

Pat received a Bachelor of Divinity diploma from CLU in June of 2002, as part of the Lamad style Bible School established at TACF in September of 2000. Mark Virkler was an integral part of her first year of that Bible  School. He imparted his heart for Hearing God’s Voice in everyday living and establishing a two way dialogue with God, so that life took on a whole new wonderful and exciting meaning.\n\nIt was there that Pat learned how hearing God’s voice every day would make that wonderful change in her life. Hearing God’s voice for herself and her family brought a much deeper and more intimate relationship with God and was the beginning of a brand new outlook on her purpose in life.\n\nShe encouraged her husband Rudy to learn how to hear God’s voice for himself and he took the Communion With God course with Mark Virkler. In applying what he learned, his life has also been transformed by hearing from God.\n\nDepending on God to counsel and advise them, they have served together at TACF in the Prayer and Care ministry for the past 5 years, helping many people to hear for themselves how much God wants to speak to them and share with them His love and care. \n\nPat and Rudy are also a part of the  Healing Rooms team at TACF. There they rely very strongly on hearing God’s voice for each person that they pray for. They have seen many people touched and healed as God’s heart for each one was prayed over them.\n\nBoth Pat and Rudy have a strong desire to see others learn to hear God’s voice and heart for themselves and become the man or woman that God has purposed for them to be. \n\nHearing God’s Voice is the best thing that anyone of any age can learn and then begin to see transformation in their life and ministry.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66l1jjic63n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.592063,43.696052]}},{"properties":{"name":"Play de Record ( Toronto, ON )","description":"Posted by Dsudorion<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/playderecord_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 357A Yonge Street,Toronto, Ontario,M5B 1S4,canada<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66l1js86xke"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.381616,43.65807]}},{"properties":{"name":"Port Credit -

And we still like to have fun.\n\nWe\\'re one of Toronto\\'s leading and best known independent record stores. We stock new releases from independent bands and artists from Canada, the U.S., England, and around the world. We\\'re committed (actually, obsessed would be more accurate) with stocking as much of this on vinyl as is possible.\n\nGenre-wise, we\\'re down with almost everything: the hip, the hop, the punk, the jazz, the hardcore, the reggae, the electronic, the indie, the un-indie. No classical or nu-country, however.\n\nRotate This is an equal-genre retailer. We do not exclude titles from stock based on race, creed, culture, religious affiliation or sexual orientation. We might not, however, stock a title we feel is not appropriate for our store, for any number of reasons. You want Brittany? Wicked, so do we. But we don\\'t sell her records. (Well, ok, maybe the UK 12\"ers but please don\\'t tell anyone).\n\nWe stock used vinyl as well, although the turnover is extremely high, and we find it difficult to keep much stock. If you\\'re looking to rid yourself of your dusty old record collection in exchange for some 45847s, we\\'d be more than happy to take a look. We are rather picky though, so please don\\'t bring in your Poco lps.\n\nWe\\'re also an official ticket outlet for most of the major concert promoters in town.\n\nNext time you\\'re out music shopping, and you\\'re looking for stuff that you just can\\'t find at the mall, definitely stop by. We swear that we won\\'t judge your purchases. Honest! (Kidding!)
