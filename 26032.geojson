Imagine my surprise when, having been distractedly waiting for the bus and counting to be sure I had all my packages, I looked across the street and suddenly came head-on with a different sort of package, this one belonging to an extremely large young man in tightie whiteys! There\\'s an even more suggestive vision of a young man in his stinkies a bit further down at Market and Van Ness but my heart palpitations were such that I was unable to focus on photography. To get the full-on impact, you really must see these ads at night when they\\'re backlit to reveal the soft young manflesh in all its glory.\n\nPity an avid admirer was blocking my view. I believe the ad was for Abercrombie and Fitch, but it could have been for CK. And really, who cares? The army of brightly lit hard-bodied young men aren\\'t really selling underwear, now are they? At any rate, I am simply glad to see that Bebe\\'s campaign featuring sexy pouting anorexic five-year olds covered in sparkles seems to have ended. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztf1cyxk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40778,37.784314]}},{"properties":{"name":"Adobe Book Shop","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/98938078@N00/81376516/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/43/81376516_5a5f7dd3f0_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 3166 16th Street, San Francisco, CA, 94103Adobe Book Shop<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztbuqt9a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.423432,37.764992]}},{"properties":{"name":"Albany Bulb","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/driftman.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> The Albany Bulb (just to the north of Golden Gate Fields racetrack) is a former city dump. the Bulb sprouts half a mile out into the bay at the end of a long spit once plied by trucks loaded with junk from construction sites. It used to be fenced off, rarely visited by anybody. Then it became a homeless encampment. Now, the mounds of dirt, old rebar and chunks of concrete are overgrown with fennel and pampas grass, forming a haven for birds and lizards, a playground for unleashed dogs and an outdoor gallery for sculptors. The Bay Trail runs out to the end. Rough side trails lead to twisted found-object metal sculptures, a crazy little plaster house with a circular staircase, and cartoon-style paintings of uncertain theme, often favoring devils, fast-looking cars and flaming urban wreckage.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt8upky3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.325296,37.889486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alcatraz","description":"Posted by Dylan<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/DSC00296.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztdpyzpw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.422907,37.826718]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alfred's Steakhouse","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/alfredsprivateroom.jpg\">659 Merchant Street, San Francisco CANow under ze ownership ov ze deefrunt Alfred zen ze original, still boasts ze tastiest stakes in ze kingdom.

Inside Bix - it has a swanky speakeasy-vibe - 1920\\'s art decor and a live band playing loud jaz music. The food was decadent and scrumptious.\n\nWe did hor d\\'oeuvres in a tapas fashion...we tried the \"Tuna Tartare on Olive Toasts\". I love the fresh fish in San Francisco. Heaven.\n\nWe also tried: \"Kampachi Crudo with Blood Orange, Fennel, Daikon Sprouts and Fiordolio Olive Oil.\"\n\nI first heard about crudo in a Vogue article by Jeffrey Steingarten. He\\'s a brilliant gourmand and he has such an evocative writing style...I also read about this Italian-style of doing raw fish in the NY Times...I think. This SF Gate article has a great way of explaining crudo: \"...crudo is shorthand for any kind of raw fish -- chopped tartares, marinated ceviches, sliced sashimis, paper-thin carpaccios. The stumpy word itself conveys little about the silky, sensual feel of eating a raw scallop glistening with olive oil and shivering under sheer fennel slices and bits of orange...\". And in this NY Post article...a chef has another way of explaining crudo: \"Crudo is basically Italian sashimi with good ingredients. Instead of wasabi, we use garlic, and instead of ginger, we use tomato.\"\n\nNow, Susan said she had really good crudo at Incanto - possibly better than Bix...As for myself, this first taste of crudo was delightful. Again, fresh fish - slice thin and marinated lightly. It melted in my mouth and left my palate swooning. I especially liked how it finished off with the blood orange - a clean citrus tang...\n\nWe also did some sliders in a gourmet fashion - \"Mini Lamb Burgers with Spicy Red Pepper Sauce\". A month or two ago, I picked up the movie \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\" DVD and I still have a craving for little burger bites. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzta6eg3t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.402519,37.796915]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blue Plate","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\" href=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\">Tanabutler</a><img src=\"http://www.blueplatesf.com/images/about_btm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.blueplatesf.com/images/about_top.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3218 Mission St, San Francisco, CABlue Plate 415-282-6777<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzti1p6d9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.420354,37.745175]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bluebottle Coffee Commpany","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caterina.net/\" href=\"http://www.caterina.net/\">Caterina</a><img src=\"http://spaceshipearth.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/dsc_2801.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 315 Linden St, San Francisco, caA real hole in the wall, but fantastic coffee.

These guns, which shot one-ton projectiles, were aimed at the Farallon Islands -- 25 miles offshore -- for target practice. Before its strategy could be deployed, guided missiles were developed. Some of the existing guns were scrapped, sold to Gillette and sliced up into razors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztcnykm9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.499678,37.827739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cadillac Ranch","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/TXAMAcadillac2.jpg\">Amarillo, Texas Over the decades, a lucky handful of offbeat attractions have grown in recognition and stature, celebrated frequently in magazine photo essays, in calendars, as backdrops for music videos and movies. These Great Monuments are rhapsodized as the embodiment of American hopes and dreams, folly and failure, art and commerce, materialism and spiritualism. Professional authors and screenwriters know a pre-baked, easy-to-get symbol when they see it. Who are we to buck the trend? \r\n\r\n The Cadillac Ranch, located along the tatters of historic Route 66, was built in 1974, brainchild of Stanley Marsh 3, the helium millionaire who owns the dusty wheat field where it stands. Marsh and The Ant Farm, a San Francisco art collective, assembled used Cadillacs representing the \"Golden Age\" of American Automobiles (1949 through 1963). The ten graffiti-covered cars are half-buried, nose-down, facing west \"at the same angle as the Cheops\\' pyramids.\" \r\n\r\n In 1997, development creep forced Marsh to move the entire assemblage about two miles further west. The line of cars is far enough out in a field to allow for suitably bleak photography. The distance from any authority also encourages ever-mutating layers of painted graffiti, which Marsh doesn\\'t seem to mind. \r\n\r\nVisitors are encouraged 24/7 -- just don\\'t steal any of Stanley\\'s colorful signs. The 62-year old Marsh has had a few interesting run-ins with the law over his brand of enforcement. In 1994, he was accused of threatening an 18-year old with a hammer and penning him inside a chicken coop. He\\'s been sued by a family claiming Marsh tricks teens into working for him after catching them red-handed with one of his signs. \r\n\r\nSounds like Marsh is just adding an unexpected thrill around a ranch visit, but then we didn\\'t try to steal a sign. Other bits of Marsh art can be found in the vicinity. There is a pair of legs between Amarillo and Canyon, Texas. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt2jaryl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-101.987076,35.187243]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe Du Nord","description":"Posted by Ejoliver77<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 2170 MARKET STREET San Francisco CASmall club on Upper Market.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt8vpbb2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.430435,37.766011]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe La Boheme","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/platialmission2006_012.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 3318 24th Street, San Francisco CAKak.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt3qxw71"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.418882,37.752241]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe Reverie","description":"Posted by Mcmcilvoy<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/ross.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 848 Cole St, San Francisco, CACafe Reverie is Cole Valley\\'s communal heart.

He\\'ll make you laugh even while advising you that the leopard print mumu makes your ass look, well, BIG.\n\nI popped in here just for a minute and ended up staying long enough to find a terrificly patterned set of 50s pajamas for 8 (this is a stellar set, I\\'d peg it at 5 or so if it were freshly laundered and pressed and presented in a tonier store) and a  red hoodie with a \"Sexy\" pull tag (in case anyone doesn\\'t notice immediately). \n\nAlley, dressed nattily in Clothes Contact finds (photos at right), advised buying lightweight clothes since Clothes Contact charges by the pound, but if things are extra heavy accommodations might be made to adjust the price. My pal bought a plush mauve velvet curtain to fashion into her reconstructed overalls and paid just 0--a good amount less than such a good piece of cloth might usually bring. Sure, she\\'ll need to have it cleaned but the price is a bargain including that cost. \n\nIf you\\'re not afraid to dig in and have a good eye and feel for quality fabric you can find some remarkable pieces to wear as-is or rework into your reconstructed fantasy wardrobe. \n\nThis is Clothes Contact\\'s 20th anniversary celebration, so if you get there soon you\\'ll get a 20% discount. \n\nRetro City Fashions has six shopping locations in the  Bay area: Held Over, Clothes Contact, Sharks, La Rosa, Mission Thrift, and Mars. retrocity@retrocity.com\n415.621.3212<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztglc6in"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.421987,37.764934]}},{"properties":{"name":"Coffee to the People","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/cupphoto.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/IMG_4524.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/platialhaightretailf2006_034.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/platialhaightretailf2006_036.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1206 Masonic, san francisco caCaffffeeeeeine!

Swimming across that dish is a scene that looks like a painting-- a painting in motion.\r\n\r\nDepending on where the camera obscura\\'s periscope like lens is pointed at the moment, the view on the dish is of the walls of the Cliff House, or of the man-made concrete cliffs across the street, or of the condos lining the Great Highway where Playland at the Beach to be or of the Seal Rocks and the Pacific. As people watch, birds fly across the screen, a surfer rides a wave, the sea lions stretch on the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"The camera takes six minutes to go all the way around, but you can stay as long as you like, \"Warren tells his guests. One man last week stayed six hours.\" At this point, Warren can put on a taped narration and go back into his box office, but more often than not, he stays around, just to watch the reactions and share the discovery. \"What you are seeing is a rotating picture of what\\'s happening outside at this very moment, \" Warren tells his small, rapt audience. \"It works on the principle of the periscope. It reflects eighteen degrees of the view from outside, through an optically flattened, front surface-finished mirror and a series of concave and convex lenses, on to a parabolic or curved screen.\r\n\r\n\"It was the first camera,\" Warren goes on to explain. \"The camera obscura was invented by Leonardo da Vinci in the sixteenth century. His neighbors thought it was the instrument of the devil. They thought he could predict the future, the past and the present. They banned the creation because they believed it was related to the super- natural. That\\'s because, \"Warren continues, in his soft voice, \"people would go in and then go out and see their friends and say, \"I saw you when I was in the camera obscura,\" and people would think they\\'d seen the future because they had no idea about projected image.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Warren, on the other hand, several centuries removed from da Vinci\\'s time, has a lot of ideas about the projected image and the camera obscura. There\\'s very little he can\\'t tell you about this rare device -- how Isaac Newton wrote about it, or Copernicus charted the stars with it, or Renaissance artists painted with it.\r\n\r\n\"I\\'ve been an artist all my life,\" he says, \"and vision and light and shadow are wondrous things to me. Inside you become entrenched, especially people into the visual arts or visual optics and light.\r\n\r\n\"The vision of your eye opens up in there,\" Warren says. \"You see things differently. Your optic nerve is being affected in a different way. It stimulates the chemical makeup and your emotions. It moves me to tears.\" As the camera swings around to capture the view across the street from the Cliff House, Warren tells his viewers, \"This is the old Playland at the Beach. If you are a registered voter, you can sign a petition as you go out to put something there other than more condominiums.\"\r\n\r\nThere\\'s a reason that the former site of Playland holds a special place in Warren\\'s heart. That\\'s where he first saw the camera obscura, when he was sixteen years old. As a young man, Warren had show business in his bones; he ran away with the carnival, he learned how to eat fire.\r\n\r\nThen Warren grew up. worked on his career as a salesman, and lost touch with his beloved camera. When things began to fall apart for him, he found it again.\r\n\r\n\"I ended up separated from my family,\" he says. \"My wife divorced me. I had five kids, and I went into a deep depression. How can you sell anything at that point?\r\n\r\nHe took up some of his old interests. He signed up for the docent\\'s course at the Exploratorium and began doing research on Playland at the Beach, Just as it was about to be torn down. He met Gene Turtle, one of the two men who had built the camera. As youngsters, Turtle and Floyd Jennings had discovered Leonardo\\'s plans by accident, thumbing through the Encyclopaedia Britannica for a science project. They showed their completed model to George Whitney, who owned the Cliff House and Playland.\r\n\r\nWhitney set up the camera at the Cliff House, but for the first few years it didn\\'t do well because no one knew what it was. Then Whitney got the idea to make it look like a giant camera. Though located at the Cliff House, the camera obscura was a Playland attraction until they tore the place down in 1972. Early in his career, photographer Ansel Adams hung around the camera so much that they quit charging him.\r\n\r\nWarren ran into Gene Turtle in the 1970\\'s and ended up doing a fire-eating demonstration at Turtle\\'s wife\\'s birthday party. In 1978, David Warren was perched on a ladder at the Balboa Theater, painting a mural on the side -it\\'s still there, with Marilyn Monroe as centerpiece, but that\\'s another story -- when Turtle approached him and asked whether he\\'d like to take over the operation of the camera obscura.\r\n\r\n\"I told him I\\'d do it as soon as I got down from the ladder,\" Warren recalls, \"and I\\'ve been doing it ever since.\"\r\n\r\nWarren proceeded to spend years trying to figure out how to get people in to see what the camera had to offer. \"It\\'s a wonderful thing,\" he says. \"You think you should be able to tell people what it is, But it\\'s a paradox. As a salesman, I knew that people would like to know about it, but I found out that you couldn\\'t tell them about it.\"\r\n\r\nHe finally hit upon a solution; tell them what it does, not what it is. Slowly, Warren has learned the tricks of wooing them in, has discovered where the magic line lies between those who come in and those who wander off. A few years ago, he added a pair of huge brass arrows, pointing to the entrance. \"Before, people would just walk by and start looking at the ocean,\" he says. \"Now, these get their attention.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the people come inside, Warren starts spilling his enthusiasm, as the camera obscura chugs quietly around on its motorized axis, panning the surf and the sea lions and the sinking sun. At one point, Warren says, there were three such cameras in San Francisco alone. Now, there are only a handful left in the world. Dave Warren can tell you where each one is and who if running it. That\\'s one of his projects -- forming an organization of all the camera obscura operators in the world, so they can share information.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun sinks low enough in the sky at the end of the day, the sun itself is captured on the rim of Warren\\'s satellitedish screen, a glowing ball of concentrated light. At that point, Warren will hold up a flat, white board, moving it into the field of projection so that he can show people the sunstorms around the edge of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"We always look for the sunspots,\" he says. \"It\\'s part of our show. We turn off the narration tape and do the sunset show in person. We see the green flash in here about twice a month. It\\'s caused by the spectrum of light being split by the atmosphere. The various colors of light are separated. When green comes along, it flashes, like the northern lights, just as the last rays of light leave.\" Warren can\\'t help himself; his voice fills with awe. \"It lasts only a tenth of a second, but it\\'s very beautiful. Liquid jade. When Jules Verne was writing, he said if there is a green in heaven, it\\'s surely this green.\"\r\n\r\nAs people leave, Warren nearly always seems to find some excuse to give them a free pass for another visit. (\"Next time, come back while it\\'s still light, so you can see the sea lions\" or \"Come back and bring a friend.\")\r\n\r\nThe camera never fails to surprise him. \"The most unusual thing happened just the other day,\" says Warren. \"We were watching a sunset, and all of a sudden there was a thud. The screen got black. I thought for sure a bird had hit the camera, Later, when I went up to close the hatch, I reached in, and there was a fish. A pelican probably dropped it,\" he says. \"He sure had good aim.\"\r\n\r\nBut even on more humdrum days, the object of his livelihood and his affections totally entrances David Warren. Someday, he\\'d like to create a mobile camera, on that he could haul up to Twin Peaks. \"Now that would be something,\" he says. Meanwhile, if you venture down the stairs that lead to the terrace below the Cliff House, you\\'ll find him, polishing the brass arrows or leaning out through the box office, trying to coax people over that invisible line. When someone gets within earshot, Warren is there, speaking softly. \"Have you seen the camera obscura?\"\r\n\r\n On a side note, Dave was the first “fire performer” and individual to light the burning man in the black rock desert.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt8dwpal"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.514215,37.778262]}},{"properties":{"name":"De Young Tower","description":"Posted by Mcmcilvoy<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/towerview.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This tower was all ours.

Some sources list his date of birth as February 14, 1819. Although he had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented. Norton also wrote to Queen Victoria, and he was referred to as His Imperial Majesty by local citizens and in the newspaper obituaries announcing his death.\r\n\r\nThough he was generally considered insane, or at least highly eccentric, the citizens of San Francisco (and the world at large) in the mid-to-late 19th century celebrated his presence, his humor, and his deeds—among the most notorious being his \"order\" that the U.S. Congress be dissolved by force, and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge to be built across San Francisco Bay. The King in Mark Twain\\'s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is reportedly modeled after him.\r\n\r\nHe is considered a saint by the followers of Discordianism and is referenced repeatedly in the seminal work of the religion, the Principia Discordia.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nNorton was born in England. Records vary as to the date and place of birth. His obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle, \"following the best information obtainable,\" cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was \"aged about 65.\" This suggests 1814 as his year of birth. Other, non-primary sources have his birth on February 14, 1819 in London. According to Drury (1986), immigration records indicate that he was two years old in 1820 when his parents emigrated to South Africa. Southern African genealogies suggest that his father was John Norton (d. August 1848) and his mother was Sarah Norden. Sarah was the daughter of Abraham Norden and niece of Benjamin Norden, a successful Jewish merchant, who displayed his eccentric side by frequently suing family members. This is supported by Cowan (1923) who stated that Emperor Norton I \"was of Hebrew [Jewish] parentage.\"\r\n\r\nNorton emigrated from South Africa to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a gift of 0,000 from his father (possibly his inheritance after his father\\'s death). He accumulated a fortune of 50,000 by 1853 (Cowan 1923). He enjoyed some highly impressive initial success in the real estate market when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice. The price of rice in San Francisco skyrocketed from 4¢ per pound to 36¢ per pound (9¢/kg to 79¢/kg). When Norton heard that a ship holding 200,000 pounds (100 tons) of rice was coming from Peru, he bought all the rice, hoping to corner the rice market. Unfortunately, shipload after shipload of rice came from Peru, and the price of rice plummeted. There was extensive litigation over the incident amongst Norton and his financial partners between 1853 and 1857. Although resulting in a victory for Norton in the lower courts, the cases eventually resulted in a defeat for Norton in the Supreme Court (Cowan 1923). Norton declared bankruptcy in 1858. He then left the city for a time, and shortly after returning announced his title to the offices of the Bulletin.\r\n\r\nThere are no known documents noting an eccentric personality or unusual behavior of Norton prior to the loss of his fortune, so it is not known whether his pronounced eccentricity was a permanent aspect of his psychology, or arose as a result of the stressful financial events of the 1850s. Nonetheless, after his sudden loss of financial stability, Norton seemed to become (in the absence of a proper diagnosis) somewhat \"odd,\" and began exhibiting delusions of grandeur, but it is entirely likely that all his declarations and behavior were the result of successful creative response to the pressure of poverty.\r\n\r\nSelf-proclamation\r\nHaving become fully disgruntled with the inadequacies of the political structure and state and federal governments of the United States, Norton took matters into his own hands on September 17, 1859, when, in letters to the various newspapers of the area, he summarily proclaimed himself \"Emperor of These United States\":\r\n\r\nAt the pre-emptory request of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last nine years and ten months past of San Francisco, California, declare and proclaim myself the Emperor of These United States.\r\n\r\nHe would, on occasion, add \"Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year \"reign\" over America.\r\n\r\nDecrees\r\nIn accordance with his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of state. Deeming that he had assumed power, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree that formally \"dissolved\" the United States Congress. He also observed that\r\n\r\n\"…fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Emperor ordered that \"all interested parties\" gather at Platt\\'s Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 so as to \"remedy the evil complained of.\"\r\n\r\nIn another imperial \"decree\" of January 1860, Emperor Norton I summoned the army to depose the elected officials of Congress:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished; \r\nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with; \r\nNOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress. \r\nNorton\\'s \"orders\" had no effect on the army, and the Congress likewise continued in its activities unperturbed. Norton issued further \"decrees\" in 1860 that purported to dissolve the republic and to forbid the assembly of any members of the Congress. These, like all of Norton\\'s decrees, passed unnoticed by the government in Washington, and by the nation at large. Norton\\'s battle against the elected leaders of America was to persist throughout his \"reign,\" though it appears that Norton eventually, if somewhat grudgingly, accepted that Congress would continue to exist without his permission.\r\n\r\nHis attempts to overthrow the elected government of America by force having been frustrated, Norton turned his attention and his proclamations to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, \"being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm,\" he \"abolished\" both the Democratic and Republican parties. On another occasion, the failure to refer to his adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:\r\n\r\nWhoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable word \"Frisco,\" which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nWhile it is unknown if he intended it as a formal decree, Norton called Minnie Rae, a preteen prostitute who worked in the city, \"the little countess.\" She apparently credited his pronouncement with saving her life in her \"autobiography\" (it is believed the book, which is now lost, was actually written by a journalist who interviewed her between 1871 to 1872).\r\n\r\nAfter examining a number of his \"Imperial Edicts,\" it is tempting to conjecture on the mental condition of America\\'s only sovereign monarch. Unfortunately, diagnosing the precise psychological condition of Norton is an impossibility, due to the anecdotal nature of all the documents that relate his behavior. It has been suggested that he may have been schizophrenic, as \"delusions of grandeur\" is a symptom frequently associated with that condition. However, it is also possible that he suffered from some other mental illness, or even that he was merely eccentric.\r\n\r\nFor all of his quirks and regardless of the precise nature of his psychological condition, it cannot be denied that Norton was, on some occasions, a visionary, and a number of his \"Imperial Decrees\" exhibited a profound wisdom. Among his many edicts were instructions to form a League of Nations, and he explicitly forbade any form of discord or conflict between religions or their sects. The Emperor also saw fit on a number of occasions to decree the construction of a suspension bridge connecting Oakland and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience being exhibited by the authorities:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees. \r\nGiven under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872. \r\nThis decree, unlike most, concerned events that eventually came to pass. Construction of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge began in 1933 and was completed in 1936. BART\\'s Transbay Tube was completed in 1969 and opened in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zpub.com/sf/history/nort.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt3lglfd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.461759,37.679851]}},{"properties":{"name":"Erika Shuch at Intersection for the Arts","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/ErikaShuchNewspaperresize.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 446 Valencia Street, San Francisco CA\nErika Shuch eez ze fluffly ladye hoo eez both ze pooformer und teachinger ov ze highest regardings.

Wilburn, 29, said they had sex in the classroom during school hours on \"one or two occasions,\" according to an investigation by the Hillsborough County school district.\n\nThey resigned last month after two students at Coleman Middle School reported they saw the teachers having sex. The classroom door was locked and a window was covered with paper, but a boy and a girl told school officials they could see inside.\n\n\"These teachers showed appallingly bad judgment,\" school district spokesman Steve Hegarty said Wednesday. \"We dealt with it quickly, and the teachers are no longer welcome in the Hillsborough County classroom.\"\n\nState officials will determine if the teachers will be allowed to work in other schools.\n\nBoth teachers have unlisted phone numbers and could not be reached for comment Thursday.

It is hard to believe these days, but back then people dumped all kinds of refuse straight into the ocean, including old cars, and their household garbage, which of course included lots of glass. By the early sixties, some attempts were made to control what was dumped, and dumping of any toxic items was banned. Finally in 1967, the North Coast Water Quality Board realized what a mistake it was and plans were begun for a new dump away from the ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, over 30 years later, Mother Nature has reclaimed this beach. Years of pounding wave action have deposited tons of polished glass onto the beach. You\\'ll still see the occasional reminder of it earlier life, such as a rusted spark plug, but for the most part what you\\'ll see is millions of pieces of glass sparkling in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn addition to searching for and collecting glass, Glass Beach has a very interesting array of tide pools to explore. Crabs, mollusks, and many aquatic plants make their homes in these ever changing environments. It is very easy to spend your whole day poking aound the tide pools and watching the busy little worlds that go on inside each one.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt57io9n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.813257,39.451968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Golden Gate Bridge","description":"Posted by Dylan<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/DSC00291.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt42r4pp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.479084,37.824006]}},{"properties":{"name":"Golden Gate Park","description":"Posted by Bkingbking<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/61512563@N00/121046759/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/121046759_459fd772ca_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/118_1841_IMG.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 9th Avenue at Lincoln Way San Francisco, CA 94122Golden Gate Park is enormous with everything from botanical gardens, playground, paddle boats (Stow Lake) polo grounds, lawn bowling, croquet, windmills, buffalo, fly fishing practice areas, exotic flower conservatory, tennis, model boat clubs (including submarines and speedboats that go 50mph!), Japanese tea garden, golf, outdoor theatre, concerts, and walking distance to the 9th &amp; Irving, Cole Valley and Haight neighborhoods where you can grab a coffee, burrito, or sit down to eat.

Now the park is home to nine lakes and ponds, colorful flower gardens, beautiful landscaping, a Japanese tea garden, two replicas of Dutch windmills, and a total of 1017 acres of land devoted to a variety of recreation including bicycling, soccer, and boating.

In the 60\\'s and 70\\'s, vegetarian restaurants were mostly small out-of-the way cafÃ©s. There was no high profile vegetarian restaurant in the United States. Greens changed that by raising the bar, by placing vegetarian cuisine on a level with other fine dining restaurants. We have been reviewed by food and design magazines from the time we opened. Today we are surprised if a good restaurant does NOT have vegetarian options.

The effect is dizzying, and if hash smoke were still flowing from the hookahs, your best bet would be to completely succumb, give up your day, drop to your knees on the thick layers of Persian carpet, and methodically work your way up from the floorboards -- examining the tiny portraits created in Chinese silk, the minuscule grasshopper band that plays instruments under glass, the Tantric figurines stolen long ago from Nepalese temples, the African instruments made of human skulls and snakeskin, the robes of an Indian child prince, and then moving up to a ceiling covered in animal skins (a hippopotamus, a full-grown giraffe, a Tibetan snow leopard) mingled with hand-woven tapestries and kaleidoscopic patterns of colored light sprayed from intricately carved Iranian lanterns. Over the blanketed windows you would notice an enormous Alaskan moose head smoking a joint. Several large clowns from Playland at the Beach grin from atop the carriage house; they are flanked by two Indian tigers that once stood at the City of Paris (now Neiman-Marcus). A figure in Chinese robes who once held court in the Lost Wax Museum (now McDonald\\'s) looks on with a sage eye, and the last Empress of China judges everything through beeswax eyes. \r\n\r\n\"I\\'m interested in anything and everything that is interesting,\" says Wickett, an elegant snow-haired 82-year-old wearing a Turkish shirt and slim-fitting slacks, who runs nimbly through his museum turning on lamps made of camel bladders and shifting Arabic gaming tables inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl, and onyx. \r\n\r\n\"This is just stuff, hardly worth writing about. This giant silver teapot was given to me while I was staying with the Shah of Iran. Just stuff,\" says Wickett casually. \"This is a whale rib pulled out of the Santa Cruz Mountains, which haven\\'t been under water for over 14 million years, I\\'m told.\" \r\n\r\nLike his \"stuff,\" Wickett\\'s past is \"just the past.\" Born to an affluent New York insurance family, Wickett grew up in Atherton at Mille Fleure -- John Sutro\\'s former estate -- with a four-story elevator, three guest houses, and tennis courts. He wore a tie every day; walls of ties stand here, testament to his sartorial past. He married a lovely girl and ran no less than 14 businesses, becoming one of the largest landowners in San Mateo; he was president of the Redwood City Rotary Club and the State Board of Realtors, and a founder of the United Way for the Bay Area; he served on the cotillion committee for a decade, during which he made sure the nerves of all underage debs were assuaged with a quick double-gin martini before their grand entrances (a secret well guarded until now). \r\n\r\nThen, in his mid-40s, John Wickett got divorced, sold his businesses, and went native. \r\n\r\n\"I had grown up so conservative, so Victorian,\" says Wickett. \"I just wised up one day, caught on that there was another side to life, something more interesting.\" \r\n\r\nAt one point Wickett lived in Melvin Belli\\'s old home on Twin Peaks, and in a synagogue nestled between Fillmore West and Jim Jones\\' church. He became a silent partner in Jim Gabbert\\'s Channel 20. Ten years ago he began filling the French laundry on Sutter with objects from distant shores and more distant eras. Each object came with a story -- like the ritual Philippine phallus used by grandmothers to aid virgins on their wedding nights, or the shaman mask made of the four elements of life (blood, sweat, semen, and shit), or Laughing Sal, the Playland matron who springs to cackling-and-grinning life at the flick of a switch. Wickett treats all of his possessions like living history. The chairs are for sitting and the costumes for wearing, when the occasion is suitable. \r\n\r\n\"I like to have events here if the people are interesting,\" says Wickett. It\\'s not surprising that the interesting people don\\'t always leave. Presently Wickett has a helpful couple living at his house, a woman silently tucked away in his museum loft space, a gentleman convalescing in his carriage house, and someone\\'s cat winding its way along a windowsill lined with antique glassware. \r\n\r\n\"No one pays rent, or gas bills, or phone bills,\" says Wickett, \"as long as they\\'re interesting.\" \r\n\r\nIt\\'s even less surprising that during Wickett\\'s fetes an interesting treasure or two disappears -- as with a giraffe hoof he notices has been recently cut from the skin hanging from his ceiling -- but Wickett just chuckles. \r\n\r\n\"People come in and ask about the three most valuable small objects I own. It\\'s OK, things get \\'souvenired.\\' I have four auctions and four trips to the Orient planned this year.\" \r\n\r\nSurprising that he would bother searching for the exotic. After living in the San Francisco Museum of Exotica, the real thing might almost disappoint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://130.212.44.5/custom/magazine/wickett.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztdt3gtw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444344,37.784721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Judy Rodgers, Zuni Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/judy_rodgers_zuni.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> San Francisco, CA<b>Restaurants:</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/36462\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/04/2/pic_5204w48h48.jpg\" alt=\"Zuni Cafe\" height=\"77\"></a>\n\nCo-owner and chef Judy Rodgers had the fortuitous experience of living with the Troisgros family, whose restaurant has three stars, near Lyons, France as a foreign exchange student. Perhaps it’s the smelling, tasting and living with perfection that has influenced her cooking today. Or, perhaps it was training at Chez Panisse, or cooking in France, Italy or Thailand. But, most likely, her signature style reflects her own desire for perfection. She believes in purity of the food. French food is French Food, not French mixed with Italian or Thai. She’s said to make the perfect roasted chicken. After graduating from Stanford with an art degree, Rodgers went straight to work at Chez Panisse, cooked and traveled around the world, then in 1987 became a partner in Zuni Café. Her style is American cooking with deep flavors—a blend of haute cuisine and homey. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzthg46n0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.420032,37.774567]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kabuki 8 Photo Booth","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a>1881 Post, Japan Center, San Francisco, CAAMC Kabuki 8 Color, one pose for .

Its fertile soil and Mediterranean climate translated into an abundance of fresh produce as well as treasured seafood and game. Legend tells that Kokkari is the site where Orion, a mighty hunter and a young man of gigantic stature and great beauty, fell in love with the daughter of the King of Chios. For the love of her, Orion foraged the island for wild game and seafood to prepare elaborate banquets in celebration of their love. Today we hope you will enjoy your own celebration as you dine at Kokkari Estiatorio on food \"fit for the Gods\" prepared with an Aegean palate and the style of innovative California fare. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt528z9v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.399707,37.797103]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Rondalla Restaurant","description":"Posted by Noseknows<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 901 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA, 94110La Rondalla Restaurant 415-647-7474<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt91pslh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.421379,37.758513]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lam ov Tu Lan Restaurant","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/July8wkndplatial2006_042.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/July8wkndplatial2006_040.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/July8wkndplatial2006_041.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 8 Sixth Street, San Francisco CA\nLam Phung, ze unassuming waiter at Tu Lan Restaurant, brightened palpitatinglyish when axed tou bee een ze Madame\\'s moobie!

Anything a visitor may seek, San Francisco can provide. Echoes of fun and amusement ring throughout the city from the cable cars atop Nob Hill to the sea lions barking at the wharf. \r\n\r\nTurning back the clock to the Depression, we find San Francisco bubbling as a haven of fun even then. \r\n\r\nThe place to go was a now-vanished amusement park, Playland-at-the-Beach. During the Depression and World War II, Playland thrived. Adults and children, families and couples on dates, sailors from all over the world went to Playland to ride bumper cars and roller coasters and explore the thrills of the Funhouse. For many San Franciscans, Playland was and still is their childhood, 33 years after its demolition. \r\n\r\nPlayland was located at Ocean Beach, just north of Golden Gate Park, below the point where the land rises to Sutro Heights. The attractions in this corner of the city had the added novelty of being where Western civilization meets the Pacific Ocean -- in a way, at the end of the world. \r\n\r\nFrom the mural-bedecked Beach Chalet at the western end of the park to Playland to the Cliff House and Sutro Baths, the recreational options lined up in a long row. Much of this ended up as part of the pleasure empire of the man called the Barnum of the Golden Gate, George Whitney. \r\n\r\nA little amusement area named Ocean Beach Pavilion had existed since 1884. In 1912, Arthur Looff and his partner, John Friedle, built Looff\\'s Hippodrome, housing a grand carousel built by Looff\\'s father. In 1922, the two added the Big Dipper roller coaster and the Chutes-at-the-Beach water ride. Whitney and his brother Leo came to town and opened a photofinishing concession booth in a smaller version of Playland. \r\n\r\nIn 1926, Whitney became general manager, and the park became Whitney\\'s Playland-at-the-Beach. He bought out shaky concessionaires during the Depression. By 1942, he owned everything from Sutro Baths to Fulton Street. \r\n\r\nWhitney\\'s Playland grew to more than three blocks of amusements next to the Great Highway. It included Topsy\\'s Roost Restaurant, which later became Skateland; a midway of games and vendors; a diving bell; and, of course, the Funhouse with long wooden slides, a human turntable that spun and threw people off if they didn\\'t hang on, distorting mirrors and air jets that blew women\\'s skirts up. \r\n\r\nPlayland was also the birthplace of the It\\'s-It, Whitney\\'s invention of ice cream sandwiched by two oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate. \r\n\r\nOnly the newly remodeled and now far more upscale Cliff House and Beach Chalet still stand. A condominium development erased any trace of Playland. \r\n\r\nBlue-collar times \r\n\r\nAnyone who remembers Playland is wistful, or maybe just nostalgic, for the gritty, blue-collar San Francisco. \"It wasn\\'t just toys for the rich. It was toys for everyone,\" said Dan Fontes, a muralist working in El Cerrito on a large rendering of Playland and the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nSan Francisco has changed. The blue-collar neighborhoods are mostly gone, and amusement is often more solitary than when the Playland fun house rang with screams and laughter. Still, Playland has not been lost. Anyone can find it. Its fragments are scattered all over the city. \r\n\r\nPlayland is best remembered by a laugh, the one that belonged to a huge mechanical woman who towered above the entry to the Funhouse from the 1940s until it closed in 1972 and she was auctioned off. \r\n\r\nHer name was Laughing Sal. \r\n\r\nAnyone walking down Playland\\'s Midway -- even nearby neighbors -- heard Sal\\'s bellowing laugh. She had devilish curly red hair and huge freckles all over her fat, terrifying visage. In the middle of it all was a gap-toothed smile that provided nightmare material for countless children. This was creepy, the same way a ventriloquist\\'s dummy is. \r\n\r\n\"She would stand there laughing and laughing, and you would stand there laughing and laughing, and you didn\\'t know why,\" said Sharon Jessup, a San Francisco native who grew up going to Playland. Sal\\'s continuous laugh was a drunken yelping guffaw, an evil cackle, the uninhibited outburst of someone going out of her mind. With arms extended, she heaved back and forth with a bit of a bobbing motion in her huge glass box. \r\n\r\nSal was constructed by the Old King Cole papier-mache company under commission to the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., maker of amusement park furnishings. Old King Cole started with a mechanical laughing department store Santa Claus. They fitted the Santa with a woman\\'s legs, breasts that jiggled on the end of springs and custom-made heads. With the addition of a 78 rpm recording of the most memorable laugh in the world, Laughing Sal was born. \r\n\r\nBy the 1960s, Playland was run down and a little seedy. Some say it started downhill when Whitney tore down the Big Dipper roller coaster in the late 1950s. Sutro Baths burned during its demolition in 1966, and Whitney stopped operating Playland in 1968. \r\n\r\nThe park took on a roving carnival feel, said Marvin Gold, who grew up nearby, going to sleep every night to the sound of Sal\\'s cackle. In 1972, Playland was put up for sale. When it closed on Sept. 4, 1972, Herb Caen wrote a column called, \"We\\'ll Never Go There Anymore.\" He reminisced over It\\'s-Its, Bull Pup enchiladas, a 40-cent corn dog and a ride on the carousel. \r\n\r\nToday, Playland is covered with housing. A Safeway stands on the site of the old diving bell. Gold said he remembers when workers came to smash the concrete foundation and heard a clang. They found the concrete lined with a steel tank, filled it in and built on top of it. \r\n\r\n\"One hundred years from now when they tear Safeway down, they\\'re going to find an old steel tank sitting there and have no idea what it was,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, and those slides, those beautiful wooden slides,\" he said of the long hardwood slides in the Funhouse. \"When I saw them cutting those slides into pieces ... I nearly cried. \r\n\r\n\"Playland was our second home.\" \r\n\r\nFor the next 30 years after Playland closed, people didn\\'t have to look far to find Laughing Sal. Although the main Funhouse Sal went to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk for 0,000, Playland\\'s back-up Sal found a home in the basement of the Cliff House, along with the penny arcade machines. They all were put into the Musee Mecanique, a collection that Ed Zelinsky he obtained from George Whitney. \r\n\r\nAll of the machines are still working, offering love tests, telling fortunes and showing the first silent films. Video games were added to a small arcade at the back -- early games like Pac Man and eventually the 3-D driving and shooting simulators we see now. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, the Musee was imperiled when the Cliff House was renovated. San Franciscans came to the rescue with a petition carrying more than 25,000 signatures. They were outraged that the National Park Service, which owns the Cliff House, hadn\\'t tried to find the historical Musee a new home. \r\n\r\nThanks to the public outcry, a home was found at Pier 45, where a row of crab stands leads to a building painted with a giant version of Laughing Sal\\'s face. Her missing tooth is the entry to Amusing America, which chronicles San Francisco\\'s place in the country\\'s cultural history of amusement parks. \r\n\r\nPlayland, Sutro Baths and the 1939 World\\'s Fair are all featured in interactive and informative displays, with the Musee Mecanique collection in the back. \r\n\r\nAnd at the door, as in her two previous homes, Sal is the greeter and gatekeeper who still bursts into laughter for a quarter. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at her luck, having survived the urban development that has put her into a museum version of a city that no longer exists. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at what amusement in San Francisco has become around her: a Fisherman\\'s Wharf that has become a commercial tourist center with many of the same type of attractions as Playland. \r\n\r\nDan Fontes, the muralist and a good source of history on Sutro Baths and Playland, says that when Playland was alive, \"Fisherman\\'s Wharf was a fisherman\\'s wharf, with fishermen.\" \r\n\r\nNow, it is the Playland of today, the city\\'s waterfront amusement center, even if it is there mostly for tourists. Playland\\'s remains are scattered elsewhere around the city, too. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s-It snacks are found in many grocery stores. \r\n\r\nCarousel in Yerba Buena \r\n\r\nThe marvelous carousel built by Charles I.D. Looff in 1906 and installed at Playland in 1912 eventually found its way back to San Francisco. Marianne Stevens, a preservationist, had bought it from Playland and restored it for a Long Beach mall. In 1998, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency bought it for  million and installed it in a beautiful glass pavilion at Yerba Buena Gardens. \r\n\r\nThe ocean wind even blew Playland\\'s ashes all the way to El Cerrito, where muralist Fontes and partner Ed Cassel are working with Playland collector Richard Tuck to create a tribute to that vanished beach area. \r\n\r\nThey\\'re creating a mural 32 feet long and 10 feet high depicting Playland, Sutro\\'s Baths and Museum and the Cliff House. Fontes said the reactions of former Playland visitors range from surprised delight to tears. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, on the very ground where Playland once stood, five ghosts of those bygone days arose. From a distance, the five 15-foot-high figures across the street from Safeway on 48th and Cabrillo look like ghostly black shadows. Up close, they\\'re monuments called Playland Revisited created by Ray Beldner, an artist who often visited Playland as a child. \r\n\r\nMade of perforated stainless steel, each tall, narrow sculpture represents a Playland icon.

What a fun collection! From the sassy green frock featured in the center of the store (photo at right) to autumn-hued trousers and delicately designed tanks (also shown at right),and bouncing over to the bouyant wine bottle cork halter top, Jennifer has a delightful way of redefining everyday fashion sense. \n\nMy visit found Jennifer busily at work creating a surplice wrap sweater dress. If you catch her at a slow time, she\\'ll tailor her designs for you on the spot! \n\nPorcelynne opened in February of 2006 and Jennifer, who attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and gave up the business for a couple years before committing to her design work, has recently left her day job to focus on her creations full-time. \n\nIf you are in the mood for a wardrobe update and want to support a local designer while looking different-than-most, here\\'s your place. Porcelynne also features the work of many local designers including Amy M. Cool\\'s highly touchable recycled fabric handbags and jewelry by 19 Moons and Tessa Poppe. I\\'m going to have to go back for the earrings created with Lite-Brites (photo at right).\n\nThe most intriguing of Porcelynne\\'s offerings is the \"Panty-A-Month\" club. You\\'ll get a new pair of stinkies designed by Jennifer every month--imagine how fun it could be to get this monthly offering from a lover in the subsequent months after breaking up--the turmoil the poor chump would go through knowing that you\\'ll be wearing the panties he bought you--he bought YOU--with your new lover. Oh, the possibilities!\n\nArt work in the gallery rotates; the current show features work created on heat-sensitive fax paper with a soldering iron (shown at right).

She\\'ll welcome you into her store, follow you into your dressing room, and gently sniffy-snif your handbag in search of minty treats. Please ask her lady, Laura James, before offering to share!\n\nRuby\\'s is a local artist space and features a wide variety of local handmade items to marvel over--surprising jewelry, colorful and comfortable clothing, eclectic accessories, and cutie-pie baby gear. Throughout my visit, I kept spotting stuff that I missed at first glance, most notably a nice selection of simple, comfortable-looking, and interestingly-patterned cotton skirts. (photo of skirt rack is over on the right&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;)\n\nI have enjoyed shopping at Laura\\'s original Ruby store in the Mission; one Christmas I bought handmade handbags and fuzzy animal-ear hats there for most of my gifts to family and friends. Ruby\\'s is a good place to find something reasonably priced and unique for thoughtful gift-giving.\n\nPersonally, I am craving the raven resin necklace that I recently spotted on Ruby\\'s website (see photo to the right) and I\\'ve got a few expectant momma friends who I think will enjoy dressing up their little bundles of joy in one-of-a-kind hipster baby togs (and starting at 0, these little outfits don\\'t cost much  more than standard cookie-cutter sleeper jammies!).\n\nFused glass pendants with vintage textile patterns (0-9) and handpainted resin necklaces (both pictured to the right) are interesting pieces to add to the right outfit and are the sort of jewelry that it\\'s hard not to move in on a for a closer look!\n\nI love the Fall-colored brocade and leather handbags; one I spotted looked perfect for opera season--lush fabric, nice long strap, and just big enough for tickets, opera glasses, and lipstick. (also shown over there&gt;&gt;&gt;)\n\nIf you\\'re a tourist, here you can buy a not-so-obviously-a-tourist-wearing-just-shorts  sweatshirt or a different-than-most scarf to keep warm, and one that you\\'ll probably even wear again (as opposed to the Fisherman\\'s Wharf tourist variety). Don\\'t forget to bring it with you next time! This is not L.A.!  \nNote: Photos of Ruby\\'s great handmade scarf selection and a glimpse of one of the interesting paintings on back of hoodies are over there on the right&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nBeyond the painted wave midway through the Haight Ashbury store is Vie Papiel, a store of a different sort, carrying vintage ephemera such as old prints, scary clowns, and framed works. Original hand-colored prints of buff men, brave lions, fair maidens and other interesting tidbits put me in mind of old carnivals and Auntie Flora\\'s Funhouse Library.

In June, 1981 six young people from the mountain village of Medjugorje reportedly encountered Mary near the top of Mount Podbrdo, a small mountain located in central Yugoslavia. In a series of apparitions that still continues, but with much less frequency, she reportedly sent a message of faith, prayer, fasting, conversion and peace. In these apparitions Mary said she came to bring humanity back to her Son; and warned that Satan is especially active in these times and that it was necessary to pray fervently and often to ward off his advances.\n\nDuring the early \\'80\\'s, Medjugorje became well known initially throughout Europe, with newspaper reports in such disparate publications as Le Monde and the Financial Times; by the late \\'80\\'s it had become known throughout the world. As a result of its growing fame, more than ten million pilgrims had visited it by the tenth anniversary of the first apparition. On the tenth anniversary, conflict broke out among the Bosnian Serbs and Croats which has continued to this day. Despite this conflict, thousands of pilgrims still manage to make the dangerous journey to Medjugorje each year.\n\nLess well known than the apparitions themselves, is an unusual event that preceded them. In May, 1981, Father Tomislav Vlasic of Capljina, Yugoslavia was in Rome attending a conference on Catholic Charismatic Renewal. At this conference he asked to be prayed over for the healing of the Church since he had become increasingly pessimistic about his parish ministry. One of the individuals who prayed over Father Vlasic was Sister Briege McKenna, a member of the Sisters of St. Clare with a healing ministry. While she prayed, Sister Briege reported seeing Father Vlasic sitting on the celebrant\\'s chair in the sanctuary of his church and surrounded by a large crowd; beneath his seat were streams of living water which were flowing from the altar. Simultaneous with this, Fr. Tardiff another of the individuals praying over Father Vlasic, reported hearing the words, \"Do not fear. I am sending you my Mother.\" The apparitions in Medjugorje began several weeks later.\n\nSince the apparitions have lasted for such a long time, it has been possible to subject the visionaries to a large and diverse number of medical, physical and psychological tests. The physiological and psychological battery of tests they were taken through showed them to be bright, well-adjusted teenagers. The medical tests indicated no major physical problems. In short, they seemed to be experiencing something outside themselves which had a significant and long-term impact on their demeanor and behavior.\n\n In the reports of her appearances here, Mary is said to ask each of us to return to her Son; to become aware of the active and destructive role that Satan plays in the modern world and to protect ourselves against Satan\\'s actions through frequent, fervent prayer to Jesus. In addition, she requested fasting twice weekly, frequent reception of the sacraments -particularly the Eucharist - and personal surrender of our will to the will of God.\n\nTo emphasize the urgency of her requests, she entrusted the visionaries with ten secrets which purport to be descriptions of events that will transpire if humanity fails to correct itself. At this time (early \\'96), two of the visionaries have received the ten secrets. The remaining visionaries have received nine. She has also told the visionaries that when the apparitions cease at Medjugorje, they will cease at all other Marian apparition sites around the world. When this occurs, the events described in the secrets will begin to unfold.\n\nThe ten secrets of Medjugorje appear to be a continuation of the Fatima Secrets and are similar in general character to the secrets described at <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/77089\">Garabandal</a>.\n\nIn 1982, the Church established a commission to begin to evaluate the occurrences at Medjugorje. As part of the initial report, Father Tomislav Vlasic, the local pastor, sent the Pope and the Bishop of Mostar a letter detailing what little information is available about the secrets. In the letter he states:\n\n    \"According to Mirjana, during the apparition on December 25, 1982, the Madonna confided the tenth and last secret to her, and she revealed the dates on which the various secrets will come to pass. The Blessed Virgin revealed many aspects of the future to Mirjana, many more up to now than to the other seers. For that reason, I relate now what Mirjana told me in a conversation on November 5, 1983 I shall summarize the essential things she said, without any literal quotations:\n\n# Before the visible sign is given to humanity, there will be three warnings to the world. The warnings will be warnings on the earth. Mirjana will witness them. Three days before one of these warnings, she will advise a priest of her choice. Mirjana\\'s testimony will be a confirmation of the apparitions and an incentive for the conversion of the world. After these warnings, the visible sign will be given for all humanity at the place of the apparitions in Medjugorje. The sign will be given as the testimony of the apparitions and a call back to faith.\n# The ninth and tenth secret are grave matters. They are a chastisement for the sins of the world. The punishment is inevitable because we cannot expect the conversion of the entire world. The chastisement can be mitigated by prayers and penance. It cannot be suppressed...\n# After the first warning, the others will follow within a rather brief period of time. So it is that people will have time for conversion.\n# This time is a period of grace and conversion. After the visible sign, those who are still alive will have little time for conversion. For that reason, the Blessed Virgin calls for urgent conversion and reconciliation.\n# The invitation to prayer and penance is destined to ward off evil and war and above all to save souls.\n# We are close to the events predicted by the Blessed Virgin.\n# Convert yourselves as quickly as possible. Open your hearts to God. This is a message to all mankind.\n\nIn addition to these remarks, Father Tomislav added the following observations in August, 1983: \"They say that with the realization of the secrets entrusted to them by Our Lady, life in the world will change. Afterwards, men will believe like in ancient times. What will change and how it will change, we don\\'t know, given that the seers don\\'t want to say anything about the secrets.\"\n\nA further clarification of the character of the initial secrets came from a series of interviews conducted by Janice Connell several years after Father Tomislav\\'s report. In her interview with Marijana, she asked for any additional information about the secrets that Marijana was permitted to disclose. Marijana responded:\n\n     \"The first two secrets will be warnings to the world - events that will occur before a visible sign is given to humanity. These will happen in my lifetime. Ten days before the first secret and the second secret, I will notify Father Petar Ljubicic. He will pray and fast for seven days, and then he will announce these to the world.\"\n\nWhen pressed to give additional details, Mirjana stated:\n\n    \"Well, the first secret will break the power of Satan, and that is why he is so aggressive now.\"\n\nThe message of Medjugorje has the same components as the earlier messages at Fatima, Garabandal and a number of previous Marian apparitions. The local Church\\'s commission on the apparitions has yet to make a final determination on the events at Medjugorje. The strong and personal disagreements between the local Bishop and the local Franciscans ministering to the parish at the time of the initial apparitions combined with the outbreak of the civil war has made a full and fair evaluation of the events there quite difficult. The clerical disagreements appear to be related to the potent influence the Franciscans had when acting as spiritual counselors to the \"visionaries\". The local Bishop, Msgr. Zanic, thought the Franciscans were publicizing the events at Medjugorje much too quickly and too rapidly to properly evaluate and analyze what was happening there. The preliminary Church statement, finally issued in January, 1991 stated:\n\n    \" The supernatural characteristic (in the miraculous sense) is not established, but it is not excluded either; the Episcopal Commission continues its work to get a decision, a decision the bishops do not want judged prematurely. The pilgrimage, of national and international dimension, is the bishops\\' responsibility.\"\n\nThe message of Mary at Medjugorje is one of peace and acceptance - acceptance of the will of God, acceptance of whatever suffering that may come as humanity moves closer to a self-induced catastrophe, acceptance of Mary\\'s role as our loving Mother, and acceptance of God\\'s desire for us to renew our faith in Him through prayer, conversion, fasting and love. If we convert ourselves with the help of God\\'s graces, then and only then will we be able to achieve peace in our hearts, peace in our families, peace between neighbors and peace between nations.\n\n The purported apparitions at Garabandal and Medjugorje have created some confusion and conflict among the various religious authorities who have investigated the occurrences. In Medjugorje, the scientific group headed by Dr. Korljan, seems to have been given short shrift in the process of evaluation by several members of the clerical evaluation group. In turn, the clerical evaluation group divided between backers of the former Bishop and backers of the local Franciscans. In short, the Commission seemed to reflect the chaotic state of affairs in Bosnia and Croatia. This type of conflict serves to reaffirm the Catholic Church\\'s reluctance to affirm the reality of any apparition until a long-lasting and thorough evaluation takes place.\n\nIn Garabandal, one of the original \"visionaries\", Maria Cruz, recanted her original description of events and said she wasn\\'t sure she ever had a vision of Mary. To further complicate matters, Conchita noted in her diary that the Blessed Virgin had warned the girls that they would have to experience trials and suffering.\n\n and they would contradict one another. Further the Chancery of Santander, which is the local religious authority in the region, issued warnings about the apparitions shortly after they started thus giving the appearance of trying to quash these events before they were thoroughly examined. Within four months of the first apparition, the local Bishop had issued a statement calling events at Garabandal unproved.\n\nThe most troubling aspects of these two apparitions, aside from their marathon duration, is the predestination implied in the warning messages. Unlike previous apparitions, there is no contingency clause to the prophecies such as \"Unless men convert...\". The \"visionaries\" say that they know NOW the date that each of these events are to occur.\n\nFor example, at Garabandal Our Lady reportedly stated that the Miracle will occur on a Thursday evening at 8:30 PM (Garabandal time) between the 8th and 16th of either March, April or May. The Miracle will coincide with an important event in the Church and on a feast day of a martyr of the Eucharist. Russia will finally be converted after the Miracle occurs.\n\nLooking at the calendar from now through the year 2000 shows two years, 1996 and 2000, when the conditions mentioned above appear to be met. April 11, 1996 is the feast day of St. Stanislaus, Bishop of Cracow who was martyred while celebrating Mass and April 13, 2000 is the feast day of St. Hermenegild of Spain who was martyred because he wouldn\\'t receive communion from a heretical bishop. There are several other martyrs whose feast day falls within the dates mentioned at Garabandal. One is St. John Ogilvie of England whose feast day is March 10th. St. John was martyred because he refused to renounce his Catholicism. The next March 10th that occurs on a Thursday will come in 2005; another is St. Pancras of Rome whose feast day is May 12th. He was martyred for his beliefs at the age of 14. However, May 12th does not occur on a Thursday until 2005. This level of precise predetermination is difficult to embrace since it seems to eliminate the efficacy of any response by humanity to the grace given to it by God.\n\nIn addition, the secrets of Medjugorje appear to indicate an almost fatalistic view of the future. Medjugorje is perhaps the most important Marian site in the last sixty years. Millions have returned to prayer and a sacramental life as a result of visiting or learning about the events reportedly occurring there. Nonetheless, as with all apparitions, each of us are required to be discerning as St. Paul has urged, \"Test everything; retain what is good.\" (1 Thess. 5:21)\n\nIt is obviously possible for Heaven to choose specific dates for events to occur, but it seems to remove the hope that through repentence and changed behavior, humanity can petition God to relent as He did at Nineveh. This level of predetermination is not a characteristic of earlier Marian apparitions, nor does it appear to be consistent with other statements made about the end times,\n\"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but the Father only.\" (Matt 24:36-37).\n\nOnly time and further evaluation and discernment will uncover exactly what occurred in these two mountainous parts of Europe. Clearly, the response of the tens of millions of the faithful around the world would appear to indicate that these two events should not be taken lightly.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt69eqlx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[17.673611,43.195835]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sleeepin' in mein leetl bed","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/codyeyes.jpg\">1815 Broadway, San Francisco CAI was in ze olde house out back, asleepinings.

In 1881, Adolph Sutro bought most of the western headlands of San Francisco and made his home there. Fifteen years later, Sutro Baths opened to a dazzled public at an estimated cost of over ,000,000. Spread over three acres, the Baths boasted impressive engineering and artistic detail. \r\n\r\nSwimming\r\n\r\nA classic Greek portal opened to a massive glass enclosure containing seven swimming pools of various temperatures. There were slides, trapezes, springboards and a high dive. Together the pools held 1.7 million gallons of water and could be filled in one hour by high tides. There were 20,000 bathing suits and 40,000 towels for rent. Balmy temperatures and abundant plants enhanced \"California’s Tropical Winter Garden.\" The Baths could accommodate 10,000 people at one time. \r\n\r\nEntertainment\r\n\r\nSutro’s dream was realized as San Franciscans streamed to the Baths on one of three railroads connected to the city. An amphitheater, seating up to 3,700 people, provided a variety of stage shows. Three restaurants could accommodate 1,000 people at a sitting. There were natural history exhibits, galleries of sculptures, paintings, tapestries and artifacts from Mexico, China, Asia, and the Middle East. \r\n\r\nThe Last Years\r\n\r\nFor all their glamour and excitement, the success of Sutro Baths was short lived. The Baths were not commercially successful and Sutro\\'s grandson converted part of the Baths into a skating rink in 1937, a task completed in the early 1950\\'s by new owner George Whitney. Sutro Baths never regained its popularity and the ice-skating revenue was not enough to maintain the enormous building. In 1964, developers who planned to replace the Baths with high-rise apartments bought the site. A fire in 1966 quickly finished the demolition work, but the apartment scheme was never realized. \r\n\r\nToday\r\n\r\nThe Baths became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1973. This area is popular today for the scenic and recreational values recognized by Adolph Sutro. Please use caution as you explore the remains of Sutro Baths and coastal rocks and try to imagine the elegance of life here over 100 years ago. \r\n\r\nFor more information call (415) 239-2366.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztadvrs9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.513834,37.780425]}},{"properties":{"name":"Swan's Oyster Depot","description":"Posted by Whysteriastar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/sanfran2006099.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> The BEST seafood place in San Francisco, real narrow inside, always a line out the door.\r\nTry the clam chowder, the bread, the salads, the oysters, the homemade horseradish, everything is amazing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt5asb9o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.42088,37.79082]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sweet Inspirations","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/princess_cake_1_3_.jpg\">2239 Market Street, San Francisco CAWhen ze Princess Cake eez in season, aryoooo veal be smitten.

Its whimsical style has delighted generations. \r\n\r\n\"A massive, grassroots effort to preserve it, chronicled nationally in the comic strip, \"Zippy the Pinhead,\" led to its acquisition by the City of San Francisco in March, 2000. \r\n\r\n\"Toppled by wind April 1, 2003, it was restored to its original site by SF Central Shops and the Department of Public Works. In January 2005, the Doggie was relocated to this spot to welcome all who visit Ocean Beach. \r\n\r\n\"\\'Long Live the Doggie!\\'\" \r\n\r\nThe last Doggie Diner head (on a pole) makes its home in the Outer Sunset district, and with talk of official landmark designation, it has transcended its origin as a whimsical advertising icon. \r\n\r\nStarted in 1949, the chain of Doggie Diner restaurants were everywhere by the 1960s. The Richmond district alone had three of them, and a three-dimensional (and once rotating) dog head with chef hat glared down gleefully at each of them. \r\n\r\n \r\nDesigned circa 1960 by illustrator Harold Bachman (who is still surprised at all the hubbub and said in early 2005 he just thought the darned thing would help sell hamburgers), this San Francisco institution has found a new location a block from its old home. The Doggie Diner Head now welcomes visitors to Ocean Beach from 45th Avenue and Sloat Boulevard, giving his sardonic grin to all who come west. (Probably a nice change of view, after looking south at the Zoo for over 40 years.) \r\n\r\nOn February 14, 2005, under threatening skies, a small, happy crowd welcomed the Doggie to its new home. Ed Lee, the head of San Francisco\\'s Department of Public Works, presided and welcomed third-graders from Ulloa Elementary School, some real canines (and their guardians), a couple of jugglers, and a passel of media. The Mayor couldn\\'t make it, but Supervisor Sean Elsbernd said how the Doggie was a great memory of his childhood, and Supervisor Fiona Ma\\'s representative talked of official landmarking! \r\n\r\nDoggie saviors Diana Scott and Joel Schechter of the Ocean Beach Historical Society attended and Diana gave a few words of thanks along with the exclamation of the day: \"Long Live the Doggie!\" \r\n\r\nNo sign of Zippy the Pinhead, but likely the Doggie will find its way into his world soon enough... \r\n\r\nThe Doggie was actually moved on January 28, 2005, and these great photos of city workers moving the Doggie are courtesy of Diana Scott of the Ocean Beach Historical Society. \r\n\r\nhttp://outsidelands.org/doggie_diner.php<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztbmm08t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.504033,37.735488]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Albion Castle","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/Albion_Castle_0290_L.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 881 Innes Avenue San Francisco Ca.The Albion Castle was built as a brewery in 1870.

In 1848, it was taken over by the U.S. Army. Then, in 1972, the federal government created the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and transferred the 1480-acre base from the military to the National Park Service. For the next 22 years, the base was gradually retired from military service and converted to park use. When the base was decommissioned in 1984, the Presidio became a national park. Unlike other national parks, The Presidio is being developed to include residences, shops and businesses.

The concept was developed by Peter Richards and was installed in collaboration with sculptor and master stone mason George Gonzales. Inspiration for the piece came from artist Bill Fontana\\'s recordings made of sounds emanating from a vent pipe of a floating concrete dock in Sydney, Australia. \r\nIn 1980, Richards (now a Senior Artist at the Exploratorium) received a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which enabled him to conduct an extensive period of investigation into the physicality of the Wave Organ phenomenon. The sculpture\\'s speaker horn and audio equipment were either built or acquired for use in some of the experiments of this period. \r\nA prototype, built at the same location, was presented as part of the New Music \\'81 Festival. Though very rudimentary in nature, it generated enthusiasm and support for a permanent work. Permit acquisition and fundraising efforts by Frank Oppenheimer, founding director of the Exploratorium, began soon after, but actual construction did not start until September of 1985, seven months after Oppenheimer\\'s death. The Wave Organ was completed in May of 1986 and was dedicated in June to the memory of Frank Oppenheimer. The Wave Organ is located on a jetty that forms the small Boat Harbor in the Marina district of San Francisco, walking distance from the Exploratorium. The jetty itself was constructed with material taken from a demolished cemetery, providing a wonderful assortment of carved granite and marble, which was used in the construction of this piece. The installation includes 25 organ pipes made of PVC and concrete located at various elevations within the site, allowing for the rise and fall of the tides. Sound is created by the impact of waves against the pipe ends and the subsequent movement of the water in and out of the pipes. The sound heard at the site is subtle, requiring visitors to become sensitized to its music, and at the same time to the music of the environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztf9u08e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.440259,37.808351]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Wax Museum At Fisherman's Wharf","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/IMG_4436.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 145 Jefferson St Ste 500, San Francisco, CA, 94133The Wax Museum At Fisherman\\'s Wharf<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztfo58h8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.414912,37.808361]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ti Couz Creperie","description":"Posted by Jimyoung<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/DSC04934.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.coastnews.com/restaurant-guide/images/mission/ticouz-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3108 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94103<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztfy0e6s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.422166,37.765028]}},{"properties":{"name":"Toadbacco cherries und rude smokingers.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/06september_047.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 3158 Mission Street, San Francisco CAGah!

Randhawa said, acting on information, the police arrested 35-year-old Benson Massey of Sector 38 last night. He was trying to dispose of a stolen laptop when he was nabbed. The police recovered two stolen laptops from his possession. He added that the interrogation of Benson today led to the arrest of 25-year-old Romy, also a resident of Sector 38-D. One laptop was recovered from him.\n\nThe accused stole the laptops over a period of five months. Two of the laptops were stolen from the Sector 9-based branch of the ICICI bank in May and September, while the third one was stolen from the Sector 9-based showroom of Reliance company in September.\n\nThree separate cases of thefts have been registered in the Sector 3 police station in this regard.\n\nElaborating on the modus operandi of the accused, the DSP said the accused would go to the offices, posing as trainees. Both these offices were conducting training-cum-refreshers courses for their employees from time to time. The accused would visit the office during the lunch hours when the course was suspended for a break, and take away an unattended laptop.\n\nGiving profiles of the accused, the DSP said both accused studied up to matriculation and were unemployed. Benson Massey is married and has five children, while Romy married recently.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzthlh8oh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[76.800003,30.75]}},{"properties":{"name":"UC Berkeley laptop stolen / info on 98K grad students","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a>University Avenue and Oxford Street, Berkeley CA\"According to police, an individual sold the stolen laptop around April 14 (2005) to a San Francisco man who posted it for sale on an Internet auction site about a week later.

It\\'s an amphitheater on the shore of the San Francisco bay.  The seats are made from recycled city cement from demolished curbs or graveyard stones.  The sound is provided by the bay - tubes extend from underwater to the amphitheater.  If you sit very quietly, a sloshing symphony will fill your ears.  I hear the best time to experience it is early in the morning.\n\nTo find the wave organ, follow the shoreline north of the exploratorium.  You will come to a marina, and you walk out on a little piece of land - it looks like you\\'re just going to a yacht club, (it\\'s near Yacht Road, in fact)  but you will have to trust and when you see a yellow diamond sign that says \"not a through street\" you are getting close.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztahnszb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.442627,37.805444]}},{"properties":{"name":"thieves tavern","description":"Posted by Micque<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/4/thieves.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> shotwell &amp; 20thneighborhood owner owned and operated juke joint (well stocked box) - beer, wine, saki, pool, pinball, cards, movies. cigarette-friendly but non-smoker sensitive by way of a great big ventilation system. \r\n\r\nbe certain to incite hubba-bartender (and previous \"hunky jesus\" winner) jeremy to dance on the bar when it\\'s slow! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uztfg1o65"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.415751,37.758781]}},{"properties":{"name":"wish","description":"Posted by Dvd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/868380p1.jpg\">1539 Folsom St, San Francisco, CAfav bar in the city. great music and good drinks. love the wish twists!!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68uzt7u663a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.414371,37.771207]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/221536","metadata":null,"contact_name":"madamegonzaga","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:madamegonzaga","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/221536","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":330,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=221536,platial:user=madamegonzaga","published":"2010-03-02T17:00:00Z","id":26032}
