I was wandering around Ueno Park, leaving the crowd of people and Hanami parties behind, when you tapped my shoulder and asked me to take a photo of you standing in front of a temple, on top of the hill. You spoke charmingly with a British accent, Chinese-born and living in London. You were amazingly backpacking through Japan on your own for a month. We shared stories of our trips, and then you showed a map of your adventure plans. We swapped emails and addresses. We took pictures of ourselves. When I got back home I received a postcard from you in Nagoya - and later, stories of a dodgy hotel in Osaka, the peril of riding bikes in Kyoto, among other life\\'s off-kilter experiences. I sent winded emails of little things about me, hoping you\\'ll get in touch with me when you get home, but somehow you didn\\'t. Now it\\'s springtime again and I\\'m thinking of going to London. I want to give you a call when I do make it to the swanky shopping district of London - and hopefully, you\\'ll remember me, still, after the long-distance spell.

Particular emphasis will be placed on blueberries for our local gardens. Some of the edible landscape plants discussed will likely include dwarf figs, tasty passion fruits, gourmet varieties of artichoke, grapes, berries, avocado and even caper plants and coffee trees and there may be a few surprises in store as well.\n\nRon and Rex agree that although many of these California specialties are not popularly grown in local gardens, they should be. You will not only learn about delicious plants that you can grow, but you will learn how to use them in the landscape, their nutritional needs, water requirements and other care.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qy7bga5ps"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.867323,33.615504]}},{"properties":{"name":"Exodus","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/a_11_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/b_8_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/c_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Exodus (formerly) data center.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qy7nw6qd7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.848454,33.687568]}},{"properties":{"name":"Forest Ave","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/2161832_Forest_Street_Shops_of_Laguna_Laguna_Beach.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qy7ithmc5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.78331,33.5422]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fountain at University Center","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/bent_water_uci_tokina_1224.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 4101 Campus Drive,  Irvine, CA 92612This fountain is located near the center of University Center.

As I grew up, my friends and I would float at night in swimming pools the temperature of blood; pools the color of Earth as seen from outer space. We would spend our summer days and nights bathed in chlorine - lit by the pure blue lights installed underneath diving boards. I used to think that the heat would suck every last drop from your swimming pool or redden our skins until it had the hue of raw flesh. I remembered you saying... And some people like summer. \"Have a great summer,\" their yearbook inscriptions bellow happily, as if they actually want me to enjoy myself, as if they actually would notice if I imploded in front of them. But with graduation here and the fact that I will probably never see any of my school mates again hovering in my brain, I can honestly say that I am going to have the best summer of my life and even my new manager at work can\\'t stop me.
