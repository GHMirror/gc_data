They asked if I could create a rendition of a particular painting by a (living) artist named DuBois. It depicted a classic nativity scene.\n\nI was to build the mosaic onsite as an \"in-store promotional\" kind of thing.\n\nI provided various preview images at differing sizes and colors, and the store requested that I go with the scheme that would construct a 90\" by 70\" version of the mosaic using 8 colors (the basic six plus orange and tan).\n\nA few years ago it would have been unthinkable to build a mosaic that required thousands of orange and tan 1x1 bricks, but these days, with the existence of Bricklink and such, it is actually feasible.\n\nBefore going to South Carolina (the Palmetto State, by the way), I prebuilt the orange, tan, and green pieces; mainly to make sure I had enough in stock, but also because I was only going to have three days to finish the mosaic onsite. I debated going ahead and filling in all of the numerous red pieces too (6000+ red 1x1s involved), but decided to wait.\n\nThe backing of the studs-out mosaic consisted of 12 extra large baseplates and 36 large (green) baseplates.\n\nEven after these several years of mosaic building there\\'s still room for me to learn things. In this case I learned just how much of a hassle it is to build these mosaics while they hang on a wall. Normally I cover a baseplate completely and then add that section to the other completed baseplates as they hang up, but in this case Christian Supply had asked that I hang the whole thing up first and add to it (to give an overall concept of final size from the very beginning).\n\nIt\\'s amazing how much harder it is to follow building instructions while standing up. Not to mention not having the pieces within immediate reach as you do while sitting at a table or on the floor or wherever.\n\nThe whole building process, onsite, took much longer than I was used to. I was actually afraid I might not finish in the three days time (there were about 30,000 pieces total in the mosaic, maybe a third of which had been prebuilt). I began to wish that I had prebuilt the red pieces along with the orange, tan, and green.\n\nI did get the mosaic completed on time, but it required my showing up at 7:30 each morning, two hours before the store opened, and it was a total of 34 hours of work (34 for hours within a three day timeframe, mind you).\n\nBesides that, the event was fairly typical. People came by to watch me build. Kids went \"oooh\" and \"ahhh\".

That was only five weeks away when I was first contacted, and two of those intervening weeks I was to be away from my studio on the AMGEN exhibit. Hmmm.\n\nTime to call for back-up.\n\nHenry Lim and I have been friends now for over a year, but had not yet had an opportunity to collaborate on a LEGO project. If this FORUM request was going to be filled, then collaboration would be necessary.\n\nWe decided that Henry would design four smaller buildings while I would design four larger buildings. We discussed overall layout of the \\'cityscape\\' (roughly two basic blocks with interweaving road baseplates), color scheme, and such. We would not build skyscrapers which actually existed (trying to design and construct buildings from reality would have taken much too long), rather we would just study some buildings and find inspiration.\n\nWe will be the first to admit that the designs of the buildings are rather straightforward and simple, but keep in mind that TIME was the main parameter we had to deal with here. Not only did we have to design and build these relatively quickly, we had to then disassemble them, get them to Orlando, and then rebuild them during the tradeshow (we discovered we would actually have about 5 days of building if necessary -- two days of setup, three of actual tradeshow interaction).\n\nAfter various designs, we each settled on our buildings. We used about 100,000 bricks total among all the buildings.\n\nHenry flew from Los Angeles to my place with all of his needed LEGO bricks in tow. Once he arrived, we completed the disassembly of my buildings (after sketching quick notes as to how to reassemble them onsite). A couple of days later we then loaded up my car and drove to Orlando with many, many bricks.\n\nThe actual preshow and exhibition went off without a hitch. Before opening day we each managed to get some significant building completed, and as per the request of the FORUM folks we managed to finish building the last (yellow) skyscraper a few hours before the show ended on the last day.\n\nThe trick, we had learned, was to have \\'pre-fabricated\\' groupings of bricks which made reassembly go much more quickly. For example, the tall red building (which alone used about 22,000 bricks) had a lot of repition. In fact, it consisted of seven identical rows interrupted by an intermediate row. Those seven identical rows used pieces which were kept assembled in larger pieces between prototype and final display phase.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md6u9nvo8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.379444,28.538056]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sleeping at the Buttes Chaumont","description":"Posted by Micropopetah<img src=\"http://us.a2.yahoofs.com/groups/g_7111448/86ee/__sr_/b722.jpg?grYemFEBnz_Zvikd\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> What a Park!Two months old.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md6x8t20t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.380943,48.879082]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stellabella Toys","description":"Posted by Micropopetah<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/toystore.gif\">1360 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md6l2h3sq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.100277,42.373534]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steve Jobs Lego","description":"Posted by Micropopetah<img src=\"http://www.nanoblog.com/images/jobs_lego.jpg\">1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md6y56hpv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.03075,37.331856]}},{"properties":{"name":"Swimming Lessons at SW Pool","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/89348550@N00/165565014/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/44/165565014_6b358b2a91_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/DSC02685.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/DSC02687.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/218659535_2bc1349d65.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/218659277_e438107090.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/218659222_c34485afc7.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 6820 SW 45th portland, OR503 823 2525\n503 295 7923\n\nCarolyne and KC, the teenage instructors, were great.

The joints of the robot are driven by Faulhaber DC-motors of different sizes. The robot\\'s total height is about 155cm. The skeleton of the robot is constructed from carbon composite materials to achieve a low weight of about 30kg. Alpha\\'s head consists of 16 degrees of freedom, which are driven by servo motors. We have 3 DOFs to move the eyes, 3 DOFs to move the neck, 4 DOFs to animate the eye browns and 6 DOFs to animate the mouth.\n\nUsing speech recognition, speech synthesis, face localization, speaker localization, facial expressions, and gestures with eyes and arms, Alpha can engage in multimodal conversations with multiple persons.\n\nAt RoboCup 2004, Alpha took part in the Humanoid League Free Style competition of and won the third price with a dance performance. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md6jlyqw1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[7.849999,47.990001]}},{"properties":{"name":"the fun place","description":"Posted by Micropopetah<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/05/1/Sunset.jpg\">Seattlecome have fun in the sun<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md6w2jx7u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.330833,47.606389]}},{"properties":{"name":"volkspark friedrichshain","description":"Posted by Micropopetah<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md6jggjg9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.4325027466,52.5265091923]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/221017","metadata":null,"contact_name":"micropopetah","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:micropopetah","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/221017","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":72,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=221017,platial:user=micropopetah","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":28298}
