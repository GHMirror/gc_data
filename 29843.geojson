An openly emotional and even passionate viewpoint is realised with a profound respect and influence for the arts and crafts tradition. Alexander\\'s collections combine an in-depth working knowledge of: bespoke British tailoring, the fine workmanship of the French Haute Couture atelier and the impeccable finish of Italian manufacturing.\n\nIn less than 10 years McQueen became one of the most respected fashion designers in the world.

From their NoLita boutique, they\\'ll custom tailor the staple gear you wear every day: button-downs (barrel or single-cuffed w/ mother-of-pearl buttons), suits/jackets (handsewn buttonholes and collars), and, more unusually, jeans, which they produce in sets of three -- because one is the loneliest number to ever have its crotch disintegrate. As for fabric selection, unlike other tailors with their binders of dainty swatches, Sew lets you finger full bolts of textiles, including vintage 60s/\\'70s argyle, plaid, and houndstooth (for Caddyslacks?).\n\nSew also purveys ready-to-wear accoutrements, like cashmere shirts from Abaton and Sew-designed 7-fold ties; even though they\\'re not bespoke, wear one, and no one will mistake you for that d*ckhead Marcus Halberstram. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pej4pgmg2j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.995197,40.72226]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steven Alan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>103 Franklin St, NYNew clothing<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pej4poq6u8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.005597,40.718385]}},{"properties":{"name":"TEES.com","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>147 Ave A, New York, NYSome of the coolest t-shirts and best quality tees i\\'ve found so far.
