This was one of the best times I have shared with both of my parents.It was actually the first time I drank beer(more than a sip) too, but of course I didn\\'t like the taste then. At the time, I was grossly obssesed with the Holocaust, so we made the journey out to Ausweiz and a few of the smaller camps. Seeing where the devastation occured made a huge impact on me. Germany althogether is such a historically rich place that when I cam home I had a new appreciation for traveling.  \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43t9mkoot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.576543,48.136022]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","description":"Posted by Naronaldamsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43t21hdvn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://herestolife.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://herestolife.wordpress.com\">Herestolife</a>amsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43t4agsnc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://plaza.ufl.edu/kharyssa\" href=\"http://plaza.ufl.edu/kharyssa\">Kharyssa</a>amsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43szm69yb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium","description":"Posted by Mglassco<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> amsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43t3rqdpb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium","description":"Posted by Bluenude3<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/dr_paddo_mushroom_shop_amsterdam.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/brussels_pissing_statue.jpg\">amsterdam, netherlandsI don\\'t really remember everyone that went on this trip, or much about the trip at all for that matter! I know we stayed at The Flying Pig (a hostel), visited the Rijksmuseum, walked by Dr. Paddo\\'s Mushroom Shop, walked into several coffeeshops,walked the Red Light District at night, and ate at <a href=\"http://www.pancake.nl/#\">The Pancake Bakery </a>.Our first night there we visited the <a href=\"http://www.coffeeshop.freeuk.com/Database/ShopsB/BlueVelvet.html\">Blue Velvet</a>  coffeeshop and I almost lost Matt after the hash. He stared at a statue of the Mother Mary on top of a cathedral and claimed it was talking to him. More hallucinogenic fun followed back at The Pig and essentially, we just wandered around Amsterdam lost the whole trip. There was a great drawing exhibit at the Rijksmuseum with a bunch of Albrecht Durer. Other than that, few memories and fewer pictures!\r\n\r\nBrussels was about a four hour stop that we fanegled through our EuroPass rules. Got to see the palace and the Statue of the Pissing Boy (Manneken-Pis). Beer sucked, but then we had been drinking German beer for too long by this point in the summer!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43t87xjqs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.myspace.com/eyeballpaul06\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/eyeballpaul06\">Eyeballpaul</a>amsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43td2097v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium","description":"Posted by Photodieteramsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43taxp1q7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium","description":"Posted by Anonymousamsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43tcqsakf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium","description":"Posted by Dandan1amsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43tfoamfp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://globetrottingrien.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://globetrottingrien.wordpress.com\">Redenclave</a>amsterdam, netherlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43ta8pv3t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.890976,52.373739]}},{"properties":{"name":"Belgium Airport","description":"Posted by Mdesmetbrussels, belgiumhasta la vista!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43t4kc0n0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.325266,50.865074]}},{"properties":{"name":"Germany Airport","description":"Posted by Mglassco<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Munich, Germany<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43t20o5w5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.579999,48.139999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Germany Airport","description":"Posted by Paiz310Munich, Germany<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g43temxnbl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.579999,48.139999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jaeger's Hostel","description":"Posted by Aaronmasser<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ztwmmTmejhU/R_DFvJmNqOI/AAAAAAAABEY/8XZkxu8VNuQ/DSC01005.JPG\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ztwmmTmejhU/R_DFvJmNqOI/AAAAAAAABEY/8XZkxu8VNuQ/DSC01005.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> munich, germanyGood location, 36E each per night.
