are celebrating the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Saudi Arabia. The Revolution is not over by any means, however, his departure marks a significant turning point in the struggle for liberation after 33 years of oppression and corruption. The United States, Saudi Arabia and other western nations have for decades funded this tyrant with billions of dollars in economic aid and massive amount of military support. The Western nations have edge their bets against the revolution hoping that it would be crushed in fear that the revolution will succeed and spread to Saudi Arabia and affect the flow of the precious oil. The Yemen and Egyptian struggle is proof that even with massive support to these dictators and little support for the peaceful people’s revolution from outside, and even with the brutality of the state security system, the struggle can be victorious in the end.  It is now absolutely clear that the Arab spring CANNOT be crushed, yes, set backs will accrue but as long as the people are determined and united to rid themselves of tyranny and oppression they will overcome. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13658445\">www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13658445</a>\nViva Revolution Libya, Iran, Algeria, Bahrain, Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Saudi

Yemen\"></a>\n\n<i>Internally displaced people from northern Yemen are among those affected by the current clashes in the country. </i>\nUNHCR / Hugh Macleod / November 2010<u><b>UNHCR worried about refugees and displaced people in strife-torn Yemen</b></u>\nGENEVA, June 3 (UNHCR) – Two refugees are among those killed in recent clashes in Yemen that have displaced thousands of Yemenis and refugees alike. The UN refugee agency has expressed alarm at the deteriorating situation, which is affecting its ability to help these vulnerable groups.\n\"In Al-Hasaba, north of [Yemen's capital] Sana'a city, two Somali refugees were killed in the fighting last week,\" said UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards at a news briefing in Geneva on Friday. \"They were a 14-year-old boy and a young woman who had fled the violence in Somalia to seek refuge in Yemen.\"\nThe escalating violence between security forces and armed tribesmen has forced dozens of refugee families to flee Al-Hasaba for the surrounding areas. Where possible, they are staying with relatives or friends. Those with no support network could be offered other shelter possibilities. For example, the non-governmental organization, Interaction in Development Foundation (IDF), is considering renting a building to provide temporary accommodation. UNHCR and its partners are supporting the refugees' relocation by offering emergency funds, water and relief supplies. Some 150 refugee families have so far received emergency assistance.\nThe clashes in Al-Hasaba are also affecting Yemenis already displaced by years of conflict in Sa'ada in the north. Among these internally displaced people (IDPs) living in Al-Hasaba, more than 80 families have fled the current fighting and returned to Sa'ada city and the surrounding areas.
