But in 1963 the Country Music Association announced it\\'s plans to build a Country Music Hall of Fame Museum on Music Rowe in Nashville. That same year the state of Tennessee chartered the Country Music Foundation. The CMF was a non-profit, educational organization that was charged with operating the museum. The original museum opened on April 1, 1967 and closed on December 31, 2000. The new 37 million dollar museum (seen above) opened on May 17, 2001.

The stadium also has a Prescription Athletic Turf, which was installed in 1988. It quickly rids itself from any drainage problems with a system of underground pumps. The stadium has just recently added a huge television screen named the War Board. One thing that has and never will change is Florida State\\'s winning record at home!

The tower is 984 ft. tall and consits of an open iron framework making it currently the highest manmade structure in the world. It was the largest attraction at the exposition and today it remains the most recognized structure in all Europe. But it was nearly never built. After being awarded the contract to build the tower, Eiffel realized the Exposition Comittee would only grant one fourth of the money needed to construct the tower. Eiffel himself didn\\'t have the finances to build the tower. He made a deal that would make him a very rich man. He agreed to independentley find the funders for the tower but he would get sole control of the tower and it\\'s profits for twenty years. To everyones suprise (including Eiffel\\'s) the tower was paid off in it\\'s first year. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a697agskuhtp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.295442,48.857996]}},{"properties":{"name":"Embarrass, Minnesota","description":"Posted by Andrew2Embarrass, Minnesota<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a697aguuyfia"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.198022,47.659465]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fifty-Six, Arkansas","description":"Posted by Andrew2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/56.jpg\">addressOne word to describe this city is SMALL!
