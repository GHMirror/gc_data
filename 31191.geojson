Sunset Boulevard, Portland, OR 97239This is library location is a green building. Here is what their website say: Hillsdale Library was awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED™) Gold certification in 2004. LEED™ is a national rating system and accreditation tool used to develop high performance, sustainable buildings. Buildings are awarded points and achieve a certain level of certification based on project procedures and design elements that are indicators of a \"green building.\" The library, opened in March 2004, was the first Multnomah County building to receive LEED™ certification, a goal established by Multnomah County officials when they approved the construction of the building. The City of Portland has adopted LEED™ as the basis of design for all of its new construction.\r\n\r\nAs a green building, Hillsdale Library offers many benefits, including: environmental protection (reduced air and water pollution, reduction in solid waste creation, and minimized depletion of natural resources); economic advantages (reduced operating costs and optimized economic performance over the life of the building); and health and safety benefits (better indoor air quality, decreased harmful pollutants indoors and out, and increased personal satisfaction). \r\n\r\nTo achieve LEED™ certification, Hillsdale Library incorporates many environmental design elements that significantly reduce or eliminate the building\\'s negative impact on the environment, while providing an inviting, friendly and comfortable place for library users of all ages. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a650eusghfwp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.693654,45.479109]}},{"properties":{"name":"Huntington Beach Public Library","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/hb_library3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 7111 Talbert Avenue, Huntington Beach, CA 92648A large public library with cozy reading spots, sound proof booths, eating area, and conference rooms.
