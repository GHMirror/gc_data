At that time, the Carter Farm consisted of 288 acres on the south edge of town bordering the Columbia Pike.  Their cotton gin was located 100 yards from the house where eventually the main line of Federal breastworks were constructed.  The Federal line commander was Cox who supervised his army in a defensive position surrounding the southern edge of town.  He used the existing breastworks built in 1863 and constructed others on the west side of Columbia Pike.  About 60 feet from the Carter House, near their farm office and smokehouse, were the inner breastworks.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67x8wa2bs82"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.87362,35.91943]}},{"properties":{"name":"Position of Federal Artillery","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ConfederateCemetery.com\" href=\"http://www.ConfederateCemetery.com\">Tellinghistory</a>The 6th Ohio Artillery was placed just East of the Cotton Gin.
