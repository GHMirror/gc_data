The NRC calculator appears to be a bit more limited in its functionality than the NERC tool. Yields detailed tables and accompanying graphs for each of the following: waste management overview, reductions in GHG emissions through recycling, energy savings from recycling, life-cycle stage comparisons, air emissions and waterborne wastes, select natural resource savings, number of trees saved. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634go1mipka"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.033724,38.900687]}},{"properties":{"name":"New York Wa Building Materials Reuse Calculator","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>Steinman Hall, Rm 102[NOTE: This calculator is available for downloading only to registered users of the NY Wa Materials Exchange] \r\nThis tool helps to estimate the environmental benefits of salvaging and reusing building materials, rather than buying and installing new ones.

The Paper Calculator provides users with the U.S. average energy and wood consumption and environmental releases of different paper types across their full lifecycle. For each of thirteen major grades of paper and paperboard, it allows the user to compare the environmental impacts of papers made with different levels of recycled content, and to see how using less paper or changing other specifications can reduce environmental impacts. Finally, the Paper Calculator helps users to measure and communicate the environmental benefits of better paper choices. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634go3rmr5i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.987511,40.738517]}},{"properties":{"name":"WAste Reduction Model (WARM)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.EPA created WARM to help solid waste planners and organizations track and voluntarily report greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy savings from several different waste management practices.
