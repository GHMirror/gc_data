Most of us know of this disease as a Staph infection, but it is more appropriately termed methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA.  This data is of observed incidence rates taken from the CDC surveillance sites across the country.  The surveillance sites are ranked by descending order of population size (CDC) (please use the given inverse site numbers to map the data).  Also shown are the number of cases, community associated illnesses, community onset of illnesses, hospital onset of illnesses, and the total.  The incidences are based per 100,000.
