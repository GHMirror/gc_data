There\\'s a statue of Mary in the yard next to it that\\'s equally as creepy. I’m not sure how long this church has been closed up and unused, but there are likely to be more churches that close their doors post-Katrina, and the building s will be left to decay and fall into disrepair.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7471wboa1fu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.049612,29.964567]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chapter 13 - Fun City - Naked City - Rotten Apple - The Big Apple - The Big Lady - The Dirty Side","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://placekraft.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://placekraft.blogspot.com\">Placekraft</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> New York, NY<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7471w010mjx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dirty's Restaurant","description":"Posted by Joycamp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1710 Durham Drive, Houston, TX 77007<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7471wczr4do"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.410553,29.775705]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hidden Trolley Car","description":"Posted by HundredflowersIt\\'s in plain view yet no one notices it, an old red line trolley car stashed under an overhang and set back from the street.
