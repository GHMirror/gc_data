As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:  \nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?
