And so, from the North, heading southbound, you need to go past Gravelly point, and turn around (which is not as bad as it sounds). Two options are:\r\n        (a) take the Airport exit and follow signs to Terminal C, and then signs for GW Parkway North\r\n        (b) continue on GW south until you reach Daingerfield Island, where you can turn around and head north\r\n      Option (a) is faster, though option (b) is a little more straight-forward.\r\n\r\nBike Directions From the Mall:\r\n\r\n    * From the mall, head towards the Lincoln memorial\r\n    * Cross Memorial bridge on the left side\r\n    * Follow trail as it curves back towards the river.

Once on the Bridge, stay in one of the three right lanes (the left-most lane will take you to 14th St.) After crossing the bridge and getting on to what is called the Southwest-Southeast Freeway, stay in one of the two left lanes -- do not stay in the right lanes, even though some signs indicate you need to exit to remain on 395 North. Instead, follow the signs that take you to Pennsylvania Ave (one of the last exits). Take the exit and you will cross over the Sousa Bridge. Once over the river, make the first right, immediately after crossing the railroad tracks, onto Fairlawn. Take the next right into the park (and back over the tracks) and at the river make a right (which takes you under the bridge). Park in the lot at the Pavilion. # From DC: Take Penn. Ave east and follow directions above from Sousa Bridge. # From Maryland: Use the DC directions, or take 295 S to Penn Ave East and turn right onto Fairlawn. Follow the directions above. Bike Directions (From Central DC): * Get on Penn Ave, heading South and East, just east of the Capital * Stay on Penn Ave through many intersections until you come to the Penn Ave/Sousa Bridge * Cross Penn Ave to the north side (wherever you see it is safe--you could cross one light before the bridge and then bike the sidewalk, against traffic, until you hit the bridge) * Get to the Bike Route (you may see a small green sign marking this bike route), which does a curve north, then south through a small green grassy area before it enters the north side of the Sousa Bridge via the pedestrian walkway * Bike, or walk your bike, over the Penn Ave/Sousa Bridge to the other side * Stay on the bike path, taking the first left, down the embankment and towards the Anacostia River (you will see the open-air, concrete monstrousity, Roller Skate Pavillion ahead) * At the bottom of the embankment, take a right towards the Pavillion and the fields are on your right, south of the Pavillion<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65g19m366o2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.971159,38.876935]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bluemont Fields","description":"Posted by Spacebas<img src=\"http://www.wafc.org/fields/images/bluemont.jpg\">Bluemont Park is just off of Wilson Blvd (near the corner of Wilson and Manchester), just west of Glebe Rd, near the I-66/Glebe Rd exit. Park in the North Parking Lot, which is near the tennis courts, and near the corner of Wilson and Manchester. The park can also be accessed from Rte 50. If heading out of DC, take 50 West and make a right on N. Manchester Street. The entrance to the south parking lot will be on the right. Note: this lot gets locked at sunset (usually). To access the north lot from Rte-50 you will need to zig zag through the neighborhood (Manchester does not go through). Continue on Manchester until it dead ends and make a left on 4th STREET. This road dead ends on Montague. Make a right on Montague St and then a right onto 4th ROAD, which dead ends on the other side of Manchester. Make a left on Manchester and the parking lot will be on the right. Bike Directions - from the Mall (courtesy of Lisa Berman) The Bluemont fields are completely bike accessible - plan on it taking 35 - 40 minutes to Bluemont from the Mall area and about 45 - 50 back to Adams Morgan. * From the mall, head towards the Lincoln memorial. * Cross Memorial bridge on the left side. * Follow trail as it curves back towards the river. (veer left -make u-shape - don\\'t go straight) * Cross PedX crosswalk over GW pkwy. * Take a left on GW trail (north) towards Rosslyn. * Go about 1.5 - 2 miles until Rosslyn. * After you climb the zig-zagging bridge (linking GW trail to Rosslyn) you will find yourself in Rosslyn at the corner of N. Lynn St. and Lee Hwy (29). * follow the other bikers on the sidewalk (this is on Lee Hwy) until the trail picks up again (about 2 blocks; sidewalk turns to pavement). * Basically you are going to parallel 66 for about 5 miles. * Stay left and follow the \"Custis Trail\" (there will be many exits to side streets in Arlington) * You will take one sharp left turn on a bike-overpass over 66 before Glebe Rd. If you hit Glebe, turn-around and make a sharp right turn. * Follow path until it intersects with the W&amp;OD trail. * Take a left here and go approx. 1.5 miles until you reach Bluemont. * You are very close when you go through an underpass (under Wilson Blvd.) * The fields should be on the right after you emerge, just past the Tennis courts. * If you stray into a wooded area and see a Frisbee Golf course, you have just passed the fields, so turn around. You can also access the Curtis bike trail coming from Georgetown: * Take Key Bridge to VA, stay on right side. * Take a right at second light onto Lee Hwy (29). * This becomes the Custis Trail If you plan to take the trail home... (Bluemont to Dupont Circle, Adams Morgan, Mt. Pleasant, etc.) I would: * take the Key bridge into Georgetown * take left at intersection of N. Lynn and Lee Hwy (29) * Cross Key on the right side * Merge with traffic and take a left onto 33rd St. * Take a Right on P St. * Follow P until you see the right exit for the Rock Creek Pkwy (just before Dupont Circle) * Take Right exit (yes you are going against traffic!) * Take a left and pick up Rock Creek Pkwy trail!
