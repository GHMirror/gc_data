Almost everyone north of bear creek and east of Gst has to go down Gst to get to the south part of town. Build a bridge and atleast half of the people would be able to use that route....

Taking 4 lanes of traffic and try to squeeze them into 2 lanes west of G st. makes it very difficult to get across on the side streets, especially at Gary and Oleander and Christian life center area. Olive drops to only 2 lanes just west of that area, which creates a heavy stream of traffic. 4 lanes would break that up a little.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6llxec5tyrf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.464916229,37.3184003181]}},{"properties":{"name":"Overgrown tree blocks view of stop sign","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\" href=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\">Mercedsunstar</a>A tree at Bancroft and Barclay is blocking the view of a stop sign and some are worried an accident is going to happen if it isn\\'t trimmed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6llxec8iiml"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.47449,37.35587]}},{"properties":{"name":"Patched sidewalks","description":"Posted by SystemMerced<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6llxe8lzcu5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.481944,37.302222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tall dry weeds creating a fire hazard","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\" href=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\">Mercedsunstar</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Tall dry weeds between homes and the railroad tracks near Santa Fe Avenue are just waiting for a discarded cigarette to light them up. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6llxe17bzmm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.468049049,37.3043034449]}},{"properties":{"name":"Traffic at Cormorant Dr.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\" href=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\">Mercedsunstar</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> MercedG St. and Cormorant Drive\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6llxebwfyyc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.481944,37.302222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trash","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\" href=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\">Mercedsunstar</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6llxef1qykz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.40981,37.31785]}},{"properties":{"name":"Weed abatement needed","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\" href=\"http://www.mercedsunstar.com\">Mercedsunstar</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6llxe89925i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.42968,37.32499]}},{"properties":{"name":"West st.
