La\\'ie\\'s kind of <i>weird</i>.  It\\'s mostly Mormon, and it\\'s where Brigham-Young University is, and they\\'ve set up this phenomenally successful Polynesian Cultural Center to make money for the university.  So you\\'ve got an odd situation where a bunch of Mormons have become the curators of a culture that died out, to make money for their church.  So La\\'ie has some weird influences.  The mormon population means the grocery stores don\\'t sell liquor, and everything, even the beaches, are closed on Sundays.  But the Polynesian influence means...  Well, here\\'s what the La\\'ie McDonalds looks like:\n\n<a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/LaieMcDonalds1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/LaieMcDonalds1.jpg\" alt=\"Image hosted by Photobucket.com\" width=\"600\"></a>\nInside it\\'s big and weird and shaded, and looks more like a fancy restaurant than a fast food franchise.  There are lots of vitrines (plexiglass museum display boxes) inside, full of Polynesian artifacts like the instruments they\\'d play ancient hula music on, and a fountain in the back.  And, apparently, this McDonalds does karaoke.\n\nI wasn\\'t in La\\'ie for even an hour before I got missionaries trying to pimp their good friend God to me.  \"Our friend Jesus thinks you\\'re really cute.\"  (Note:  Not a literal quote.)  They\\'re clever in La\\'ie; they send attractive young women after the young guys.  I found myself talking to a girl from Japan and another from Nevada for a while before I read their nametags more closely (I figured they were guides with the tour group I was near), and realized they weren\\'t actually really friendly, outgoing people who though I looking interesting and wanted to be friends.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:18EegjV1ms4J:www.str.com.br/English/Scientia/memeplexes.htm+%22altruism+trick%22&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari\">Altruism Trick</a> makes me sad.  When people act like they\\'re interested in me, and act like they want to be my friends... and then I find out they\\'re doing it because they want to sell me something, whether it\\'s an idea or a product... it makes me sad, and it makes me wary, and it discredits their whole cause to me.\n\n(Gilligan\\'s Island was filmed on O\\'ahu, or rather, on Coconut Island, which is off the coast of O\\'ahu on the Windward Side.

American culture is a pulpy fluid with big solid chunks still in it, unshredded cultures that survive on, floating in the goo. For the moment.\n\nAnd then, occasionally, America turns the blender on. And when they turn it off again, you can buy sushi and Top Ramen in grocery stores without having to go to the ethnic foods section.\n\nThis is one of the things living in Hawai\\'i has taught me. Here, the blender is more active than usual. You can buy dim sum out of a plexiglas display on the counter of 7-11, and when you throw the cellophane away outside, the trash can says \"Mahalo\" instead of \"Thank You.\" This is a place where cultures meet, and get pureed together so the rest of America can digest them easier.\n\nAnd that\\'s good, because it adds variety. And it\\'s bad, because the \"variety\" it creates is just more mass-produced, mono-culture crap with no meaning left behind it, goo with a different flavor but the same consistency as everything else.

In the above photo, a monk is balanced on the points of <i>six spears</i>, and they didn\\'t break his skin.  It was insane.\n\nThere were 18 monks in this exhibition, ranging in ages from 5 to 22 (yes, they\\'re all younger than me.  It was humbling.  Like most things in my life), plus their grandmaster, who did some incredibly badass feats.  In fact, they all did incredibly badass feats.\n\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/twinfingers.gif\" alt=\"Image hosted by Photobucket.com\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/keikikungfu.gif\" alt=\"Image hosted by Photobucket.com\" height=\"357\">Like <b>doing handstands, using only two fingers</b>... and then <b>doing <i>one-handed handstands</i>, using only two fingers</b>.\n\nThe coolest part was that the youngest monks... were 5-year-old triplets.  The Shaolin Triplets.  They were not only badass, they were adorable too -- kind of shy when they first came out on stage, and then way cool when they started doing things.  They did headsprings.  People did lots of headspings in this show.  They also leaned over and planted their heads on the ground... and then <i>walked around them</i> spinning their bodies, keeping their heads planted on the stage.\n\nThere were lots of weapons demonstrations, and animal-style demonstrations.  There was a guy who demonstrated drunken boxing, and then drunken sword fighting, and then drunken staff fighting.  There were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip-up\">kip-ups</a> in every single demonstration.  They did lots of flips and tucks and cartwheels and stuff, all right out of my gymnastics class -- except they never landed on their feet, they always landed on their backs, which was a little odd.\n\nThe grandmaster did demonstrations where big, burly men in the audience would get a chance to try to hurt him.  He took repeated kicks to the crotch from very large men, and chain-punches to the stomach... and then the monks brought in a battering ram, and a bunch of them rammed it into his stomach a lot.  The Shaolin Triplets did a \\'shell game,\\' where kids from the audience had to close their eyes while the three kids ran around and rearranged themselves, and then the kids had to guess which of the three was which.  And there was a really cheezy computer animated video accompanying it, and a very \\'80s World music soundtrack.  So in addition to being extremely badass, it was also extremely exploitative.\n\nAfterwards, they signed autographs and posed for pictures...  and my friend Japalino was totally crushing on her \\'dreamboat monk\\' (which was the coolest thing ever -- my friend had a crush on a monk!  A monk who could kick your ass!).  And I was thinking...\n\nThis is a bunch of <i>monks</i>, from China.  And here they are, in the West, encountering women who wear less clothing than they\\'ve ever seen, and getting treated like rockstars.\n\nHow weird must <i>that</i> be?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63fu7ato3tq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.860918,21.311146]}},{"properties":{"name":"And then he pushed me out the door.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> [March 11, 2005] Or I jumped.  I don\\'t remember.  I do remember screaming \"OH MY GOD!!!\" at the absolute top of my lungs as I found myself abruptly falling out of an airplane.\n\nThink about the last time you flew somewhere.  Think about cruising altitude, when the clouds cleared below you, and you could see the ground.  Remember it?  Remember how much you could see, and how far away it looked?\n\nIt\\'s just like that.  Only it completely surrounds you, there\\'s no tiny scratched doublepane plexiglass airplane porthole restricting your view.  It\\'s all around you everywhere you look.  You\\'re up above the clouds, and above you is sky, and below you is the ground.\n\nIt\\'s just like looking out an airplane window.  Except you\\'re falling towards it at terminal velocity, 124 miles an hour, and the wind is worse that you\\'ve ever felt it, and it\\'s coming <i>up</i> instead of sideways, and it\\'s in your sinuses and in your throat and your cheeks won\\'t stop flapping and your voice doesn\\'t get any louder, yet you still can\\'t hear yourself, and you\\'re wishing you\\'d worn a hoodie instead of a tanktop, because goddamn it\\'s cold.  And it\\'s all getting BIGGER, and more detailed, and closer.\n\nOne way or another, I stepped out of the plane, and fell.  And my first thought was \"I JUST JUMPED OUT OF A PLANE!!  WHY!  WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING??\"  \n\nO\\'ahu is a small island.  From three miles up, it seems like you can see the whole thing.  You can certainly see most of the North Shore, and the east side, the Windward side, of the island too, and the mountains and plains in the interior.  If you can\\'t see the whole thing, you can see enough that it seems like it.  I don\\'t know what it\\'s like to skydive anywhere else, but skydive on O\\'ahu, and you can see it all, this extreme range of landscapes.  Big, lush mountains to one side of me; gorgeous, blue-green ocean on the other side, and under me is forests and farmlands and a town that\\'s rapidly resolving itself into roads and houses and swimming pools.\n\nSo my first thought got interrupted by my second thought, \"Oh my god this is so incredibly cool!\"\n\nI really don\\'t have the words for it.  It was incredible.  I was in freefall, I didn\\'t have a clue what I was doing, but there was far too much to see and feel for me to actually worry about it.  There was The World, and I was too engrossed in it to really be concerned with my own imminent mortality any more.\n\nFreefall lasted a full minute.\n\nAnd then, with a tremendous yanking on my extremities, the parachute opened, and the wind cut out its upward flooding, and resumed a more normal sideways motion.  We weren\\'t falling anymore, we were flying.  And it was suddenly really quiet.\n\nI said something like \"Oh, we can talk now.\"  I was a little shocked at the whole thing.\n\n<b>Existential Crisis at 17,000 Feet</b>\nThere\\'s something about dropping like a stone from a plane three miles in the air towards the North Shore of O\\'ahu that really makes one go \"AHHHHHOHMYGODWHATTHEFUCKWASITHINKINGSTOPwow, this is REALLY FUCKING COOL!  Why the FUCK didn\\'t I ever DO THIS BEFORE!!  ... Shit.  What\\'ve I been doing with my life?\"\n\nAt that moment, I felt like I\\'d just utterly wasted 24 years, because they really didn\\'t hold anything that could compare to the world I was approaching.\n\nI talked to Wisconsin about it too, because he\\'s been on a \"What am I doing with myself?\" trip more intense than mine since I met him.  He said he felt the same thing too.\n\nI really want to talk about it.  I want to crystalize it in memory, I want to remember every detail I can so I don\\'t lose any of them over time, and I want to tell people bout it.  I want to be able to share it, and I don\\'t want to lose it.\n\nBut I don\\'t have the words.  I don\\'t know if I\\'d say it was a religious experience for me (because that would be dumb), but I think it\\'s the closest I\\'ve ever gotten to one.\n\nPlus, the edges have already lost their sharpness.  As soon as I landed, the Brit and I were going \"Oh my god!  That was awesome!  Wasn\\'t it awesome?  That was awesome!\"  Meanwhile, Wisconsin just had this shocked look on his face.  And then he fell down and lay on his stomach in the grass for a little while.\n\nI wish I\\'d done that.  Taken a minute, by myself, to let it sink in, to pay attention to how I felt and how I\\'d just gotten done feeling, to remember the way it looked and the way it felt, and just <i>focused</i>, instead of jumping back into company.\n\nI think this really could\\'ve changed my life, if I\\'d paid attention to it.  Not, like, massively overhauled my life, but adjusted its course slightly, pointed it in a more specific direction.  (Actually, I think it <i>has</i> -- just not as much as it <i>should</i> have.)  Because... JESUS CHRIST that was intense.  And beautiful.\n\nIt made me wonder why I waste my time on the things I waste my time on, when there\\'s intense and beautiful things to experience out there.\n\nAnyway.  I talked to Wisconsin and my coworker about it.  I want to start doing stuff like that, big, adventurous stuff, on a regular basis.  Shark cage adventures, skydiving, glider riding, bungie jumping if we can find it, stuff like that, once every month or two.  Make it part of What We DO.  Because there\\'s so many things like that that I\\'d like to do, but haven\\'t yet, and I don\\'t have <i>any</i> good reasons not to.\n\nBut that\\'s not the point, is it?  The point is that I don\\'t push myself to do the things that I get the most out of, I\\'m just content to keep on wasting my time.  The point is to raise the bar for the rest of my life, so I don\\'t spend it willfully doing so much mediocre bullshit and dreaming about the things I don\\'t have the guts to actually try.\n\nI\\'m working on that.  Just nowhere near as hard as I <i>should</i> be working on it.\n\n<i>\"...As I look back at countless crossroads, and the middle where I stay.

When I went there in 2005, we\\'d come for one, and ended up doing the other.\n\nA friend of mine at the hostel was turning 21, and rather than have his friends spend money on gifts for him, he wanted us to join him in doing something dangerous, thrilling and expensive with him.\n\nHe decided on a shark cage adventure in Hale\\'iwa (\"holly-eeva\").  So three of us paid 25 and rented a ridiculous red sportscar (which I got to drive), and drove to the North Shore at 8 in the morning.\n\nWe were met by a guy at the dock, who told us it was too windy for the shark cage thing.  The wind made the water choppy, which would make the boat ride suck and the visibility bad.  But if we still wanted to do something expensive and adventurous, he told us, we could go to the Airfield and go for a glider ride.\n\nNone of us were that enthusiastic about gliders, but we had the car, and we\\'d paid 25 that we were going to get refunded anyway, so I drove us to the Airfield.\n\nAnd along the way, we got behind a van for Skydive Hawai\\'i.  \\'Hmm,\\' we thought.  \\'Skydiving...\\'\n\nAt the Airfield I passed the van and turned the car around.  \"You here to skydive?\" the van\\'s driver asked us?\"  Actually, we\\'re just turning around, we told him.  \"Because if you <i>are</i> here to skydive, I\\'ll make it half price.  20.  But you need to make up your minds, because the plane takes off in 10 minutes!\"\n\nThe next 10 minutes were spent initialing waivers.  In 2005, 27 people around the world would die skydiving; that works out to about one every 160,000 jumps, but it\\'s still a huge liability.\n\nAfter that, we got in the plane, which had no door, and flew up to 17,000 feet.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a nice, relaxing morning,\" my friend Wisconsin remarked at one point, \"in a cage, surrounded by sharks!\"\n\n<i>(Read my <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/post/873214\">blog entry</a> about the jump itself, and the effect it had on me.)</i><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63fu76w69kd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-158.20004,21.57588]}},{"properties":{"name":"Driving through Kalihi Valley at night on New Year's Eve is like the Gaza Strip, as a ride at Disneyworld.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> [December 31, 2004]You\\'re surrounded by explosions, as the working class celebrates the birth of the new year (or maybe the death of the old one?) as noisily and brightly as possible. You swerve to avoid geysers of green and blue flame in the road, and wince when you roll over strings of bursting firecrackers when the road\\'s too narrow or busy to swerve. The air is thick with smoke and sound, and some of the explosions are so loud, so near, that you can\\'t help but jump.\n\nBright, noisy, colorful and over-the-top, with little danger you\\'ll actually be hurt: Terrorism, Disney-style. All it needs are some snappy musical numbers about the Israeli/Palestine conflict, and a love story.

The best part was when two of the guys were about to get in a fight, but since they were standing in front of the dude soloing on his trap set, they turned it into a freestyling competition instead.

When Kamehameha the Great invaded from the Big Island, O\\'ahu\\'s armies made their last stand in the pass, and Kamehameha\\'s armies drove them over the cliffs.  When they built the original Pali highway here, they found the bones of hundreds of Hawai\\'ian soldiers.  The Lookout gives you this incredible panorama of O\\'ahu\\'s Windward, east side.  You can see both the cities on the Windward side, Kaneohe and Kailua, from the pass.\n\nWhen you stand in the pass, on the old Pali Highway, the wind gets funneled between the cliffs and hits you so hard it\\'ll support you if you lean against it.  Then you walk another ten feet forward, and the wind dies, just dies, none left.\n\nThe old Pali Highway is my favorite thing about the Lookout.  When they made the new Highway, they left the old one, and over the decades it\\'s gotten overgrown and fragmented, and strewn with fallen rocks.

That\\'s about it.\n\nSaturday when my coworker and I were walking to meet our friends, a group of Asian folks passed us. My coworker turns to me and goes, \"How\\'s it feel to be a minority?\" My Lonely Planet said that there *is* no ethnic majority in Hawaii -- there\\'s heaps of white people, and comparably-large heaps of asians, and a bunch of others too, without any ethnic group seriously outnumbering the others.  But on O\\'ahu there\\'s 2% more people of Japanese decent than there are caucasians.\n\nI\\'ve been in lots and lots of situations where I stood out because of my hair color, or my clothes, or the way I act. But I don\\'t think I\\'ve really been in a place where I felt like I was a minority because I was white. This is a new experience for me. I went to a concert this week where I wanted to dance, but nobody was dancing, and I was one of, like, three white guys in the club. I didn\\'t end up dancing, but even then, I was more afraid that they\\'d go \"Look at that guy! He isn\\'t local!\" than \"Look at that guy! What a howlie!\" (\\'Howlie\\' is traditionally spelled \\'haole\\'. Haoles were mythical creatures with no souls. Today, it\\'s applied to foreigners, or especially white people.)\n\nIt\\'s new and different.

He\\'s 37, and still lives with his mother... and this is really the first time he\\'d ever been on a trip on his own. \n\nAfter he checked in, he spent the next three days standing or sitting in the patio. He never tried to find something to do (\"Television\\'s boring.\"), and he was too afraid of getting lost and being unable to find his way back to go sightseeing, even in the neighborhood. So he just stayed in the patio, looking terribly bored, for three days. The first night I had to ask him to stop following me around while I worked, because his questions were getting on my nerves (standing in the driveway: \"So... this is where people park their cars?\").\n\nImagine Ralph from The Simpsons fundamentally unchanged at 37, except that age has removed all the cuteness and endearingness from his naivety, slow-wittedness and lack of social skills.\n\nHe smells like he chronically sleeps in his clothes, after a hard night of smoking in bed. This is odd, because he doesn\\'t smoke.\n\nHe was hoping to move to Hawaii. However, he doesn\\'t like the heat, and even as cold as the nights have been getting here recently (sometimes I sleep with a hoodie on... mostly because I only have one blanket, and it\\'s very thin), they were still too hot for him to sleep comfortably. He likes beaches, but he can\\'t swim. He doesn\\'t really have a profession, but he used to work in a grocery store. He wanted to come to Hawaii because he used to see shows about the hotels here on the Travel Channel, and he thought that if he could get a job in one of those hotels, like as a busboy? Then his life would be good. He also came here because his Jr. High teacher was from Hawaii, and he was hoping he could find his teacher.\n\nYeah.\n\nAt 37, as far as he could tell, he has less life experience, less marketable skills, and less common sense than any teenager I could name. And he severely creeped everyone out. Until I found out his story, and told the rest of the staff. After that, he just depressed us all heavily.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63fu75759rz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.82231,21.300017]}},{"properties":{"name":"thirtyninehotel:  My favorite nightclub in Honolulu, or possibly anywhere","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 39 N Hotel Street, Honolulu, HIthirtyninehotel is a \"multimedia art gallery\" -- a gallery with art on the walls that\\'s open for the First Friday Gallery Walk, that doubles as a nightclub with DJed and live music.
