The signature hole is #5, a 420-yard, par 4, featuring a panoramic view of the entire countryside. The White River comes into play on five holes. The terrain is fairly flat and easy to walk. However, there is some rolling terrain on the back nine that can cause an uneven lie every now and again. Furthermore, numerous maple trees can affect your shots on the front nine. Geoffrey Cornish and Bill Robinson added three new holes and\n    redesigned the others in the 1960\\'s. The 5,573-yard men\\'s tee has a ladies\\' course rating of 71.8 and slope of 113.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1ty5uq1pm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.65922,43.9222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Patrick's Place","description":"Posted by MecrosbyMain Street &amp; Merchant\\'s Row, Randolph, Vermont<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1ty3kua47"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.66488,43.92273]}},{"properties":{"name":"Randolph Village Pizza","description":"Posted by Mecrosby1 South Main Street, Randolph, Vermont<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1ty5bwli9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.665186,43.921843]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Randolph Depot","description":"Posted by Mecrosby2 Salisbury Street, Randolph, Vermont<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1txzhweoh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.666719,43.923098]}},{"properties":{"name":"Three Stallion Inn","description":"Posted by Mecrosby<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 665 Stock Farm Road, Randolph, VT 05060<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1tyebr0w1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.646648,43.915875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Three Stallion Inn","description":"Posted by Mecrosby<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 66 Stock Farm Road, Randolph, Vermont<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1ty69swde"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.65028,43.928644]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/226585","metadata":null,"contact_name":"mecrosby","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:mecrosby","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/226585","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=226585,platial:user=mecrosby","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48394}
