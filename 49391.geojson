One of the main reasons that Nazi Germany established the camp there was because it was a central intersection of roads and railways. The Camp is not only remembered for its location but that mostly jews in 1942 were carried from all over Europe in little cars ment for a small load but they seemed to squish a huge amount of people in it for days to basiclly arrive to their death in Gas Chambers and being shot dead on. Familys were seperated and possibly never being seen again.1.3-1.5million were killed in Gas Chambers about 90% were Jews.\r\n\r\n  There is a lot more that I could say but you get the point that it was and still is a very horrific event that happened to inocent peopele lead by Adolf Hitler. I believe that it is a Very important place of History because of what happend and when people are able to come and see this historocal place I am sure that they will be shocked. This is definitly a place of history. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kc3kehb2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[8.710003,49.561937]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eiffel Tower","description":"Posted by Rains<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/8.jpg\">Paris, France The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 International Exhibition. The man who was behind this massive monument is Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. The tower was completed between March 28-31,1889. It took two years 2 months and 5 days to complete it. Only one worker was killed.\r\n\r\n I believe that the Eiffle tower is such a wonderful place of history it has been through a lot such as the tower has been painted 6 diff. colors that takes 50 tons of different shades of brown. The tower is 990 feet tall. It is a symbol of Paris known world wide. Usually when people go to Paris they definatly want to go to visit the Eiffel Tower and also watch its light show that appears just about every night.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kcfxxx0d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.350966,48.856558]}},{"properties":{"name":"MT.

After talking negotioating with President Calvin Coolidge the project recieved Congressional approval. The carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941 with a few injuries but no deaths. Historian Doane Robinson thought of the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure that the carving could be accomplished. Borglum had been involved with the carving of Stone Mountain. The first carving of George Washington was finished and dedicated first on July 4,1934.Second was the face of Thomas Jefferson in 1936,Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17,1937. In 1937 a bill was passed to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B.Anthony but a rider was passed and said to only finish the heads that have already started at the time. In 1939 the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated. President Coolidege insited that along with Washington,two Republicans and one Democrat be portrayed.\r\n\r\n There was many challenges that this historical site had to go through before it could actually be finished including the contraversy wiith the Members of the American Indian Movement. They led an occupation of the monument in 1971 naming it \"Mount Crazy Horse\" Led by a man John Fire Lame Deer who planted a prayer staff atop the mountain. Lame Deer said the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidnets faces. Mt. Rushmore is a very famous attraction over 2 million visitors travel to the memorial.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kc9468wy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-100.244591,44.227513]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stone Mountain","description":"Posted by Rains<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/yes.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/stone_mountain.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/cool.jpg\">Valdosta GA Stone Mountain was carved in 1909 by Helen Plane, then a chapter president of what is now known as the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), the carving has had many identities. Plane\\'s idea was to honor General Robert E. Lee. When artist Gutzon Borglum was contacted, he added an army of 750 men to the idea. Begun in 1923, Borglum left the project (and the state) in 1925 in a flurry of charges and counter-charges over virtually every aspect of the project. \r\n\r\n The second artist to attempt carving Stone Mountain was Augustus Lukeman, who removed Borglum\\'s work and centered on four central figures, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee and a color-bearer. Time ran out for Lukeman in 1928 when the lease to create the carving ran out. \r\n\r\n Following the state\\'s purchase of the land in 1958, Walker Hancock (sometimes listed as Walter Hancock) began working on the project and carving started again in 1963. In 1970 Spiro Agnew dedicated the carving, filling in for President Nixon who was embroiled in the Kent State fiasco. The carving was declared complete in 1972. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kcdmbazs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.280458,30.848375]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stonehenge","description":"Posted by Rains<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/866649371_c56fb1b1a5_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/867475106_d76f97137f_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/866649361_19adf59b56_m.jpg\">Stonehenge, England  Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in the English county of Wiltshire, north of Salisbury. One of the most famous prehistoric sites in the world, Stonehenge is made  of earthworks surrounding a circular setting of large standing stones. Archaeologists believe that the standing stones were created around 2200 BC and the surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which have been predicted as the earliest phase of the monument it has been dated   to about 3100 BC. The site and its surroundings were added to the UNESCO\\'s list of World Heritage Sites in 1986 with Avebury henge monument, and it is also a legally protected Ancient Monument. Stonehenge is managed by English Heritage while the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.\r\n\r\n  The Stonehenge complex was built in several construction phases spanning at least 3,000 years, although there is evidence for activity both before and afterwards on the site, maybey extending its time frame to 6500 years.\r\nUnderstanding what the Stonehenge is exactlly about is a a hard thing to understand but it I believe it is a important landmark because when you look at it you wonder what in the world it is. People come all over the world to see what exactlly it looks like and hopefully be able to be able to learn more about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kcc36nsx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.826606,51.180016]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Alamo","description":"Posted by Rains<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/3.jpg\">San Antonio, Texas.Originally named Misión San Antonio de Valero, the Alamo served as home to missionaries and their Indian converts for nearly seventy years. In the early 1800s, the Spanish military stationed a cavalry unit at the former mission. The soldiers referred to the old mission as the Alamo (the Spanish word for \"cottonwood\") in honor of their hometown Alamo de Parras, Coahuila. The Alamo was home to both Revolutionaries and Royalists during Mexico\\'s ten-year struggle for independence. The military Spanish, Rebel, and then Mexican continued to occupy the Alamo until the Texas Revolution. San Antonio and the Alamo played a critical role in the Texas Revolution. \r\n\r\nThe final assault came before daybreak on the morning of March 6,1863 as columns of Mexican soldiers from the predawn darkness and headed for the Alamos walls. Cannon and small arms fire from the inside beat the alamo back several attacks. The struggle continued until the defenders were overwhelmed. By sunrise the battle had ended and Santa Anna entered the Alamo to survey the scene of his victory.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kc52tkae"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.493722,29.425037]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Pyramids Of Giza","description":"Posted by Rains<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/20151400_ab4ee5aeea_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/images9.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/138122342_3ac41a95e8_m.jpg\">  There are three main Pyramids here, which were built in the 4th Dynasty (circa 4650 B.C). The Pyramids of Ancient Egypt were built as tombs for Kings and Queens it was a privilege to have a Pyramid tomb. However, this tradition only applied in the Old and Middle Kingdoms. Today there are more than 93 Pyramids in Egypt; the most famous ones are those at Giza.\r\n\r\n When People are able to visit Egypt this is a very popular site to visit becaue famous kings and queens in their time were usually buried here.

The statue of LIberty is made out of a whole lot of bronze and copper. The Statue was finished in June of 1884 and stood in Paris until it was dismantled in 1885 so tit could be shipped pff to The U.S.A. It traveled in 214 crates. It was finally transported and assembled along with the pedestal 1883 but the whole thing wasn\\'t finished until 1886. On October 28, 1886 President Grover Cleveland accepted The Statue on behalf of the United States and said \"we will not forget that liberty here made her home; nor shall her chosen altar be neglected\".\r\n\r\n I belive that the Statue If Liberty is a important monument because when I think of New York In always think of the Statue of liberty and thousnad of Millions of people visited this landmark. Although you were able to go up in the head but after an event that occured you are now unable to go. but still people still watch from below to see the torch and the crown and are amazed at her features. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kc9np4im"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"The liberty Bell","description":"Posted by Rains<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/wowww.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/images_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/images1.jpg\">Philadelphia,Pennsilvania The bell arrived in Philadelphia on September 1, 1752, but was not hung until March 10, 1753, Although it ended up cracking they thought the cause of the break would have been\r\ncaused by flaws in its casting or, as they thought at the time, to its being too brittle. Philadelphia workers named John Pass and John Stow were given the cracked bell to try to fix it and make it more thick. The bell was originally called the Pass and Stow Bell but they didn\\'t really like it so they changed it to The Liberty Bell.  \r\n \r\n I believe that the liberty bell is a very iportant landmark because as the American Flag is a symbol of the United States so is the Libert bell it was used to help wounds of the war by traveling around the world.On September 25, 1920, it was brought to Independence Hall and rung in ceremonies celebrating the ratification of the 19th amendment. It has become a national monument known all around the world.

It was built between 1792 &amp; 1800 it has been the executive residence of every U.S president since John Adams. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the home in 1801, him and his architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe expanded the building outward creating two colonnades which were ment to conceal stables and storage.\r\n  \r\n  The White House I believe is a big historical place because ti has been through a tremendous amount of construction etc.In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by British troops, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior walls. Reconstruction began almost immediately and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed house in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the South Portico in 1824 and the North in 1829. Due to crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had nearly all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing, and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved and the section was expanded. The third floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; both new wings were connected by Jefferson\\'s colonnades. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946 creating additional office space. By 1948, the house\\'s load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. The interior rooms were completely dismantled, resulting in the construction of a new internal load-bearing steel framework and the reassembly of the interior rooms.\r\n                      <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6x9kc046my8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036667,38.895]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/96655","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rains","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rains","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/96655","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=96655,platial:user=rains","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":49391}
