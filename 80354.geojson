EDT dancers perform to live music by the EDT Folk Orchestra, and the company's extensive repertoire of folk dance and music includes such diverse countries as Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, Germany, Lebanon, Mexico, Mongolia, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Tibet, Turkey, Russia, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. . .to name but a few!\n\nEach year, the company presents as many as 300 programs, including full ensemble performances, smaller ensemble programs, school workshops, residencies and informances. In celebration of the enduring nature of folk dance as a participatory activity, the company also hosts annual community dance parties where audience members explore their own cultural traditions as well as those of others through dance and cuisine.\n\nThe majority of EDT's performers are also active in either the wider arts community and/or in various ethnic communities of the Minneapolis and St. Paul area and beyond. EDT performers' involvement in the wider community is crucial to the many bridges that have been built between EDT and the arts and ethnic communities in our region and beyond.","id":"a62n8w16xg3v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2777944444444,44.9698027777778]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fitzgerald Theater","description":"Fitzgerald Theater\n10 East Exchange Street Saint Paul\nhttp://fitzgeraldtheater.publicradio.org/\n$40\n\nFrom David L. on Yelp.com:\nI saw Prairie Home Companion live here as a kid.

The play has been held over until 9/11/10 - so I wanted to get this review in so you'd know to get your tickets for this amusing and sweet production!\n\nThe serene approach from the parking lot to the property eased us in to the rustic charm. I understand there's a dinning room to enjoy a meal on property, before your show. We came just for the theater, though.\n\nI was surprised by the size of the theater. It seats over 600. The rural auditorium has a barn-crossed-with-country-club feeling, though it didn't get in the way of enjoying the performance one bit. I think this would be a great venue for something like Oklahoma, Paint Your Wagon or Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nThe Dixie Swim Club -- and it looks like most (if not all) of this season's shows -- is not a musical. It's a touching comedy about 5 college swim team friends who meet at a beach cottage on the outter banks of North Carolina each August for some girl time. Each scene is set in one of those Augusts: 22 years after graduation, 27 years after graduation, 32 years after graduation and 55 years after graduation. The set is simple and so is the story. To tell specifics would be too much of a spoiler. Suffice to say: the lines they sling as they update one another (and us) on their lives will put a smile on your face and create something you can enjoy with a group of girlfriends or generations of women within your own family.\n\nTickets are $20-30 depending on the show time.\n\nOur host/emcee did a great job introducing the event and, evidently, has written \"the book\" on the Old Log Theater.\n\nDepending on the production, I would totally go back!","id":"a62n8w8h5lfo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.5576777777778,44.910325]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pantages","description":"Pantages\n710 Hennepin Avenue, Minneapolis\nhttp://www.hennepintheatretrust.org/our-theatres/pantages-theatre\n$25-60\n\nFrom the Pantages Theater on Yelp.com:\nSpecialties\n\nThe Trust's activities include Broadway touring productions, concerts, comedy, speakers and other variety entertainment plus educational initiatives including the SpotLight Musical Theatre Program for high schools, Critical View student reviewer program, Teen Ushers, the Access Program and Kids' Night.\nHistory\n\nEstablished in 2001\n\nHennepin Theatre Trust, owner of the historic State, Orpheum and Pantages Theatres, is a non-profit organization devoted to enriching the vibrant cultural atmosphere of the Twin Cities.

Honestly never to a theater as nice as this one. Although I did not a play or musical here, I did a tour of the facilities and grounds and was absolutely impressed. The balcony view on the fifth floor was impressive, especially overlooking the Mississippi River and Minneapolis.\n\nLoved seeing all the various shows that have played here and all the stars that have been privileged enough to perform. The pictures along the hall of all the actors, singers was incredible! Seeing shows from the 1970s gave me a real sense of the beauty, amazement and historical significance at the Guthrie.
