Residence refers to the &quot;usual place&quot; where a person lives. The proportion of males in a population changes by age, beginning from 50 or more percent at birth through the mid-twenties, when the proportion of males commonly decreases to less than 50 percent progressively. Areas with above-average male populations tend to be younger, the site of a military base, or a select group quarters facility. This data variable is part of ESRI's Updated Demographics (2009/2014).\n\nThe geography depicts states at greater than 25m scale, counties at 1m to 25m scale, Census Tracts at 250k to 1m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 250k scale. \n\nThe map is designed to be displayed with semi-transparency of about 50% for overlay on other basemaps, which is reflected in the legend for the map.\n\nESRI's Updated Demographics Data (2009/2014) â€“ Population, age, income, sex, race, marital status and other variables are among the variables included in the database. Each year, ESRI's data development team employs its proven methodologies to update more than 2,000 demographic variables for a variety of geographies.
