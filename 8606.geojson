The database was compiled to examine spatial and temporal variability in historical hazard events and associated losses. U.S. county boundaries are adjusted to 2000 designations. Event and Loss Data Sources: The data were derived from several existing national data sources, of which National Climatic Data Center's monthly Storm Data publications are the major data source.\n\nData was geocoded for latitudes and longitudes at batchgeocode.com and then uploaded into Finder as a csv.
