The map service was developed by ESRI using ESRI highway data, Tele Atlas, DeLorme basemap layers, and Automotive Navigation Data (AND) road and railroad data for the world, and Tele Atlas Dynamap® and Multinet® street data for North America and Europe.\n\nTip: Add this service on top of any imagery, such as World Imagery, to provide a useful reference overlay that also includes street labels at the largest scales. (At the largest scales, the line symbols representing the streets and roads are automatically hidden and only the labels showing the names of streets and roads are shown.)\n\nView the coverage maps below to learn more about the levels of detail:\n\nWorld coverage map: Shows the levels of detail throughout the world.\nNorth America coverage map: Indicates the levels of detail in North America.\nEuropean coverage map: Shows the levels of detail in Europe.  \nScale Range: 1:591,657,528 down to 1:4,514\n\nCoordinate System: Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere (WKID 102100)\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"esri","published":"2014-08-10T11:12:43-04:00","id":90196}
