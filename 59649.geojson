And in the end, its fate symbolized the problem that is plaguing residential areas.\n\nDesigned by renowned Bay Area architect Julia Morgan, the house was built during World War I for Camp Fremont in Menlo Park, according to the Julia Morgan Conservancy. Moved to Palo Alto after the war, the house had double arches over the front door and other classic Morgan features.\n\nBut to Ovadia Mizrahi, a Palo Alto resident and builder who bought the property in June of 1996, the house was \"a shack.\" Mizrahi tore it down Aug. 13, a deed that angered neighbors and preservationists and accelerated the groundswell of residents demanding better protection of the city\\'s older homes.\n\nThe city \"wouldn\\'t give us one day in saving a magnificent example of a Julia Morgan that hadn\\'t been tampered with since the day it was built,\" said Gladys Woodhams, a longtime preservationist who lives a block away.\n\nWhile Woodhams said the house was in \"splendid condition,\" owner Mizrahi said, \"In my opinion the house is worth nothing. It was a shack. It was below code. The house was falling apart. The plumbing was bad.

Palo Alto\\'s \"Planned Community\" process (PC in government lingo) enables developments that offer outstanding civic benefits, but do not conform to standard zoning regulations. In the case of this 18,921 square-foot law firm headquarters, it was the size that did not conform --- it was some 80% bigger than Palo Alto zoning allowed.\n\nThe PC process essentially allows the developer to play “Let’s make a deal” with the city. In some cases, this does result in beneficial construction that might not ordinarily be built, such as when a city is able to use their leverage to pull for affordable housing units in new apartment complexes.\n\nOther times, the process can feel a bit like “zoning for sale.” At 390 Lytton, developer Jim Baer offered a whole laundry list of “public benefits” in order to get around the usual regulations. The list included replacing \nfour street trees, providing a 10-foot-wide public passageway to the west of the building, putting in a new bus stop bench, erecting a new sign, putting in a trash can, repairing a few tree wells, planting six street trees, and building a frieze above the building’s main entrance. In addition, the offer included 0,000 for a study of traffic in the area--- ironic to opponents who said the project would bring 50-75 new employee cars to Lytton Avenue everyday.\n\nMany residents were upset with the city’s PC trade. They said that a “3 story monolith would not outweigh \nthe traffic and parking problems the 18,921-square-foot development would create.”\n\nMore public criticism from Downtown resident Irv Brenner: “PC ‘benefits’ are frequently modest or \nmeaningless. Some are hilariously silly -- check out the toy cars framing the doorway at 390 Lytton Ave., \nofficial \"public benefits\" of that souped-up PC office development. Whatever would our town do without \nthem? It reminds me of the Manhattan Indians trading their island for a handful of beads.\"\n\nOn that toy car frieze, however... While the “history of the automobile” does not seem to have a whole lot to \ndo with the law firm inside (Townsend and Townsend and Crew), 25,000 did buy a rather interesting and \nfanciful piece of sculpture. It depicts the history of the “automobile” from the early days on foot to a futuristic \nkind of flying \"car-pod,\" with various stages of the car along the way. It’s kind of nice to be able to walk \ndown a street and find such a whimsical piece of public art on an otherwise completely nondescript building.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2she5xbnr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16164,37.44764]}},{"properties":{"name":"405 Kipling","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0002_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Photo taken circa 1985.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shg93q4c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.160646319,37.4484708691]}},{"properties":{"name":"410 Sherman","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/2/410sherman80.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/2/410sher1981.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The building at 410 Sherman Avenue as seen in 1980 and 1981.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh8wv8ze"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.144016623,37.4259213094]}},{"properties":{"name":"411 Kipling","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0001_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Photo taken circa 1985.

Inside, only a few square tables run along two walls of windows. A long display case anchors the room, adjacent to a pretty, stainless-fronted espresso bar. The rest of the contemporary interior, with its riveted sheet metal and open beamed ceiling, echoes the body of an aircraft and an airplane hangar.\n\nClearly the cafe has found an avid following beyond the would-be-aviator set.

They felt their store could not compete with larger markets in Menlo Park and \nMountain View. Originally, Lucky’s proposed restructuring their store at 50,000 square feet, but neighbors had major objections. Lucky’s later asked for 44,777 square feet and then just 37,489. By 1999, Lucky’s was no more, but the new store, Albertsons took up the reverse bidding at 29,000 square feet, plus an umbrella-covered outdoor gathering area to get around the size ban. The plan was approved by the Planning and Transportation Commission, and support from the public (77% in a Palo Alto Weekly poll), but just as it was about to become reality it was held up by traffic concerns. Albertsons, by then in dire financial shape,bailed out, closed the store and sold the property.\n\nToday the plaza looks like a ghost town, but will soon be renovated --- after a long and at times, bitter fight to decide what should replace it.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shfr4kr4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.12429,37.41912]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alma Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> Alma Street was named by landowner Timothy Hopkins for a friend of the family.

In 1878 it was sold to Edward Barron, the mining company executive.  He added a locally famed octagonal fourth-floor cupola, as well as an enormous two storied west wing.  The house also had two dining rooms, a billiards room, a two story back wing for servants and a wide central staircase that welcomed visitors into the interior of the Victorian mansion.  By 1936, the 26 room building \nhad begun a new life as the Interdale School for Boys.  \n\nBut in the late afternoon of November 29th, 1936, a fire began in one of the towers of the 80 year-old wooden house that would change Barron Park forever.  While the cause of the blaze has long remained a mystery, electrical wiring was the likely culprit.  Writer Joaquin Vienna first saw smoke pouring out of an upper-floor window while driving down El Camino Real, he turned into the estate, ran into the building and called the fire in to three local fire departments.  \n\nSoon, fire crews from Redwood City, Menlo Park, San Mateo, County headquarters, and Moffett Naval Air Station were all racing toward the burning house.  But it would be the reaction of the nearby Palo Alto Fire Department which would linger in the memories of Barron Park residents for decades.\n\nUpon strict orders from the City Council, Palo Alto firefighters were not allowed to cross into other cities to \nfight fires because they might not be covered by insurance.\n\nIn the end, despite the valiant efforts of various other fire departments, the mansion was totally lost.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shi0ludr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.13091,37.41592]}},{"properties":{"name":"Baskin Robbins","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0023_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0005.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0003_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Photo #1: In the 1920s, this was home to the Italian-American Grocery Company and Ambrosia and Nectar Sandwich Shop --- quite a fanciful name for a restaurant that  specified on their sign that their 10 cent hamburgers came \"on bun.\"\nPhoto #2: In this 1940s photo during a parade, this location was home to Barry\\'s. \nPhoto #3: In the 1980s, this address was home to Baskin-Robbins.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh3uoo75"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.161528766,37.446352079]}},{"properties":{"name":"Baskin-Robbins","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2615 Middlefield Rd, Palo Alto, CAThis is a Baskin-Robbins in 2009.

The roads had not been built to handle the hordes of cars that \nnow swarmed the roads, creating traffic and safety nightmares.  On the Peninsula, no road had the dismal \nsafety record as the highway that led to Palo Alto.  It was known as “Bloody Bayshore.”\n\nWhere the 101 Freeway now runs the length of the Peninsula, old Bayshore highway once connected San \nFrancisco and San Jose.

In their place, speculators were building castle-like mansions (called Taco Bells by some) for the nouveau rich. These new neighborhood additions --- dream homes for developers and their new stock-trading owners --- were more like oversized monstrosities to many of their new neighbors. While the battle for preservation was most contentious in the historic neighborhoods of North Palo Alto, the big fight would actually begin over an abandoned house in the College Terrace neighborhood.\n\nFor preservationists, it was the last straw and it came in 1996, when a 97 year-old College Terrace Victorian \nhouse, affectionately nicknamed Big Blue, was bulldozed by the new owner on the same morning that he signed the deed. The two-story, light blue house had been built in 1899 by Christopher Ducker, who operated Mayfield\\'s only brewery on California Avenue. But the once majestic house now had weeds, car batteries, paint cans and a big bus in its yard. It had also become a hangout for homeless.\n\nBut when it came down, outrage over the destruction of Big Blue was intense. Preservationists were especially \nincensed because a Palo Alto couple --- Katie and Tom Ritchey --- said they had a verbal agreement with the \nowner to buy and restore the house. The owner reneged on the deal, sold it for 100 grand more to speculator John Low, who then had the bulldozers in the front yard before the Ritcheys knew what was happening. They only learned of Big Blue’s destruction from the story appearing on the cover of the Palo Alto Weekly days after it came down.\n\nLow built two 4-bedroom houses on the property at a substantial financial gain (he did claim that he would have tried to move Big Blue if he had known that the Ritcheys were willing to pay for it). And as one Big Blue defender predicted, “The new houses will have little character, huge garages and no front porches just like all the others springing up in our neighborhoods: maximum square footage for minimum cost.” (See the picture to decide for yourself)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shd7dx26"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.150813341,37.4219550534]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bill's Auto Glass (1985)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0066_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Former location of Ideo.\n\nPhoto #1: Bill\\'s Auto Glass in 1985.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh7yk066"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.160512209,37.442009969]}},{"properties":{"name":"Birge Clark Houses","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/birgeclark3.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Clark designed all the housse on Coleridge Avenue between Webster and Cowper.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh4lpsd4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14499,37.44026]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bistro Elan Restaurant","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/1/IMG_0474.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Bistro Elan oat 448 California Avenue.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh4c4p20"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.145403326,37.4258808384]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bistro Maxine","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/cafe5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> Teeny-tiny Bistro Maxine which opened in the summer of 2006 has room for just 13 chairs and 5 tables and counts itself as the smallest place in Palo Alto to hold a liquor licence.

His \none-story house design is known for its clean lines, open floor plans, and glass walls that allow residents to \nlook out onto garden areas. Eichler homes were considered forward thinking in their design. They came to symbolize the promise of a better tomorrow to a burgeoning middle class. But today some critics now \nbelieve the Eichlers have the appearance of the future misjudged. Like the Jetsons\\' home, they represent a \nfuture that never came to be.\n\nThey are most certainly dated --- the question is whether they are dated/historic or dated/badly mistaken.\n\nIf the National Park Service is any judge, they are historic. In 2005, two Eichler-dominated Palo Alto \nneighborhoods, Greenmeadow and Green Gables were named to the National Register of Historic Places \nby the National Park Service. Indeed, Eichler homes are now beginning to be seen as pieces of history---\nsuburban tract history, yes.

It’s an amazing fact to consider. Today tree lovers can still walk into a small park and look up at this enormous redwood that was just a small sapling when Leif Ericson first set foot in the Americas. Indeed, El Palo Alto was past 500 years old when Christopher Columbus first arrived and it was nearing its 800th birthday in 1769 when most historians believe Don Gaspar de Portola and his band of explorers first “discovered” the tree while looking for Monterey Bay. \n\nThe tree originally had two trunks as seen in the 1875 photo. \nGood 360 degree panorama of the tree and surroundings in 1996:\nhttp://www.virtualparks.org/scenes/ZvKcxpycRCcyxExRqYVl-uw.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh6wos80"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16981411,37.4472230261]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eleanor Pardee Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/eleanorpardeepark.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/pardee.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/0/IMG0070a.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG00w37.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Eleanor Pardee Park  is a 9.6 acre neighborhood park with a large grassy area and shade trees.

For many years, Dixon\\'s house remained on the property in which four rooms were preserved with all their old-time furnishings and was open to the public.

The original location was at 222 University Avenue and its opening was a big event for a small town.  A musical orchestra greeted customers at a special dedication in which hundreds of customers turned out just to “look over” the merchandise before the store officially \nopened for business the following day.  In those early days, Woolworth’s sold many items recognizable \ntoday --- though at much cheaper prices.  A look back at old newspaper ads reveals that you could get three pencils for a nickel, a baseball for a dime and a mirror for just fifteen cents.

It seems \neveryone has a story of this grizzled movie house that stood in a converted office building from 1974 to 1985.  But the loyalty that people have to the Festival’s memory certainly wasn’t based on its appearance.  Reading descriptions of the old place, it clearly wasn’t much --- a glorified screening room really --- with an aging 16mm projector, a seating capacity of just 114 and a screen about the size of some modern-day home plasmas.  Plus without an angled floor, Festival-goers were always wise to look for a seat behind someone a little shorter in stature.  Despite such deficiencies, however, there was always something authentic, down-to-earth and certainly a bit funky about the Festival --- and it has allowed the theatre to remain large in the memories of a generation of Palo Altans.\n\nPhoto #1: A calendar of upcoming films.\nPhoto #2: Stanley Dudek, co-owner of the Festival beginning in 1982.\nPhoto #3: The Festival Cinema building is no longer on Hamilton.\nPhoto #4: Some Bogie at the Festival.\nPhoto #5: Brian Duckworth, a lawyer and cinema  owner.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh7wxfez"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.158538103,37.4472400617]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fields Before Stanford Industrial Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0030_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> This aerial shot shows just how undisturbed this area was before the Stanford Industrial Park moved in.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh7aklmg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.146918774,37.4203787172]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fife Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/africanamericansfife.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Fife Street was a largely African-American neighborhood in the 1950s before red-lining forced many black families to move elsewhere.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shdjtn18"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.148839235,37.4515499284]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fire Site at 1717 Middlefield Road (1984)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/1265.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/0/1717middle1died.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Palo Alto Fire Marshal, Bob Cleveland inspects the fire site at 1717 Middlefield Road on January 28th, 1984.

Both the profile of the landscape and the vegetation are to be kept in a state as close as possible to their natural condition.  The park features Las Trampas Valley and a few man-made additions such as the Interpretative Center, the 12 acre Boronda Lake and a system of roads and hiking trails.  \n\nDr. Russel V. Lee, founder of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, bought the property in 1941 and built a large A-frame barn which now houses the Interpretative Center. In 1958, he offered the park to the City of Palo Alto at a special price of 000 an acre so it could be preserved rather than subdivided.  A public vote was held in 1959 on the proposed purchase.  The vote was 6,542 for and 3,997 against.  The park is restricted to Palo Alto residents to prevent overuse. \nSource: PAHA\\'s Parks of Palo Alto<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh6o8sro"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.183074951,37.3589013107]}},{"properties":{"name":"Foothills Park Entrance","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0045_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0042.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Only Palo Alto residents and their guests are allowed into Foothills Park.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shfcwblw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.171994746,37.3630521105]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ford Aerospace (1976-1990)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0042_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0043.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0045_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> This description came from a Palo Alto Weekly from 6/25/2007:\n\"Walking through the Space Systems/Loral campus in Palo Alto feels a little like being an Oompa Loompa in Willy Wonka\\'s fictional chocolate factory. Claustrophobic corridors the length of two football fields suddenly open up to seven-story clean rooms with 60-foot doors, dwarfing the robed, hair-netted workers and the huge satellites they assemble.\n\nOpen another door and you\\'re face to face with a giant orb known as the \"blue pumpkin,\" where assembled satellites are alternately heated and cooled in a vacuum to simulate the temperature fluctuations of life in space. Employees call it the \"shake &amp; bake\" room, because it also houses test equipment designed to simulate the conditions of a rocket launch.\"\n\nPhotos #1-#3: President George Bush visits Ford Aerospace in April of 1989.  The remarks he made there can be found in the link above.\n\nThe company began life as the Western development laboratories of Philco in 1957 and launched its first satellite in 1960 -- a small repeater orb that barely resembles the huge communications satellites it builds today.

Known as “Foreign Friends” --- Fjareen Vanner in Swedish --- it was installed at \nthe grassy corner of Waverley and Embarcadero in September of 1989 as a tribute to the bond between the \ntwo cities.

It was La Cumbre \nnightclub, much maligned by nearby esidents. Police recorded 82 disturbances or calls for service at the address in little over a year. The club was eventually stripped of its permit and shut down by the City Council.\n\nLive music (gasp!) seemed to be the root of all evil according to residents. It led to parking, litter, drunken \nbehavior, urinating in public, noise and fighting. And in what must be considered a rather heavy exaggeration, Palo Alto Council member Gary Fazzino concluded that \"it\\'s practically like Dodge City out there on El Camino Real,and unfortunately Wyatt Earp isn\\'t available.\"\n\nDodge City also included the El Rancho Motel that once stood just behind the club on Ventura Street. Once a \nproud Highway 101 motel, the El Rancho took a turn for the worse in the 1980s and \\'90s.  Its shady clientele and \nrent by the hour policy did not make it a favorite in the neighborhood and earned it the nickname, \"El Rauncho.\"\n\nToday a crispy-clean Quality Inn has replaced the motel and a Hollywood Video has replaced the rowdy club.  It \nseems that when the address is in Palo Alto, Wyatt Earp usually prevails in the end.\n\nThe older drawing is circa 1955.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh9wr83l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.12949,37.41733]}},{"properties":{"name":"Formerly Bob's Donuts","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/almaplaza12.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shf81k0m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.12403,37.41973]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fosters Freeze","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> This is the former location of Foster\\'s Freeze which was one of the first of the franchise locations to open in the 1950s.

Meeting allowed the school to remain on their premises on the condition it provide scholarships for needy families.

It\\'s Meeting\\'s generosity that allows us to keep our fees within a reasonable range.\n\nFrom 1968-1974, a variety of configurations for morning and afternoon programs were tried. FNS became a cooperative, with parents working on the Board, in the programs, and on fundraising to support the scholarship fund.

Instead, they travel to other cities like Redwood City and Campbell, which both created newer skateboard parks in the past two years.\"\n-Palo Alto Weekly\n\nThe last photo, of course, shows why the city built the park in the first place.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shi0lriw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.11651,37.44083]}},{"properties":{"name":"Greg Brown Mural","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/14_Garbage_Man.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/dia_0032.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0001.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> At 136 Hamilton you can find a Greg Brown mural of a garbage man with an alien.  \nPhoto #1: Garbage man with alien\nPhoto #2: Pedestrian passing the mural.\nPhoto #3: The artist painting the mural with spectators about.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shb9ec1a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.162094712,37.4431961418]}},{"properties":{"name":"Greg Brown Mural: Ailing Polar Bear","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/1/brownbear.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> This Greg Brown mural can be found at the Health Library\nat the Stanford Shopping Center next to Bloomingdales.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shhaqz7c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16955,37.44339]}},{"properties":{"name":"Greg Brown Mural: Aliens Climbing Stairs to Milkman","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/4/brown.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/brownstairs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Another in local artist Greg Brown\\'s \"Palo Alto Pedestrians\" series.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh4g0hjl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16327,37.44528]}},{"properties":{"name":"Greg Brown Mural: Bank Robbers Mishap","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/12_Robbers.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/brownrobb2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/brown1.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> This Greg Brown mural was originally painted on University Avenue and the faces of the burglars were of he and his wife.

Calling the park “our secret weapon,” Terman begin to convince companies to come to Palo Alto and set up shop at what would be the first university-owned industrial park in the world.  First aboard was Varian Associates which obtained a park lease in 1951. Terman then convinced Hewlett-Packard to head out to Page Mill Road, where they remain to this day.  Soon, a flood of other corporations would make Stanford Industrial Park one of the most prestigious addresses on the West Coast --- and eventually give the \nPeninsula a collection of big name companies to rival any conglomeration back east.  General Electric, \nEastman Kodak, Lockheed Martin and hundreds of others joined Varian and HP, transforming the old \n“Garden of Heart’s Delight” into the ultra-modern Silicon Valley.\n\nPhotos: Fred Terman with Hewlett and Packard, the HP headquarters yesterday and today.

In 1966, he gambled big-time with “Caesar’s Palace,” an outrageously \nconceptualized hotel that paved the way for the “New Las Vegas”--- an eclectic collection of quasi-theme park \nreplica hotels that has made the desert city a kind fantastical ode to the rest of the world. Whether it’s San Marcos \nSquare, the Eiffel Tower, the Manhattan Skyline or Rome --- you can get them all in Vegas, at a smaller scale, yes, \nbut with quarter slots just one floor down.\n\nAnd it was Caesar’s Palace, a grandiose, almost garishly obscene monument to ancient Rome, done up Vegas-\nstyle, that started it all. Just in time, too. By the mid-60s, Vegas had become a tired collection of old Western-\nthemed gambling hotels centered in the increasingly adults-only Downtown area.\n\nStrangely, before Sarno took his miniature model vision to the Sin City, however, he did a kind of test run --- and \nin Palo Alto of all places. The Palo Alto Cabaña Hotel maybe wasn’t as full-frontal in its exhibitionism as Caesar’s \nwould be, but with statues of the Winged Victory and Michelangelo\\'s David out front, it wasn’t too far off the \npace, either. Palo Altans were a bit overcome by the El Camino Real hotel. With its Roman-themed Nero bar, \n0,000 in cypress trees imported direct from Italy, and waitresses dressed in togas, the Cabaña was something \nelse alright.\n\nOpening in 1962, the Cabaña was originally awarded a 5-star rating and was described by Life Magazine as one of \nthe best hotels on the West Coast. In the 1960s, it attracted such high-profile celebrities as Frank Sinatra, Sammy \nDavis, Jr., and the Beatles. Perhaps the most unforgettable night in the hotel\\'s history was August 31st, 1965, \nwhen the Beatles stayed at the Cabaña. Crowds of teenage girls held a two-night vigil outside the hotel, causing a \ntraffic jam on El Camino. Hundreds of fans were disappointed when the band snuck out in a 1.5 ton truck the next \nday (The Cabaña’s present owners have dedicated Room 810 to the group, decorating it with Beatles \nparaphernalia, books, and newspaper clippings from the Fab Four\\'s stay in Palo Alto).\n\nBut although The Cabaña managed to attract the celebrity crowd to Palo Alto, not all were so impressed by its \ndesign. Doris Day, unwitting part owner of the hotel, did not exactly sing its praises when she first saw it. \nActually, she burst into tears. And that was just upon seeing the outside. “Impossible as it may seem, the inside \nwas worse.\" Day said, recalling the Cabaña in her autobiography. \"I got physically ill just walking through the \nlobby.\" And Day wasn’t convinced of the location either. She told her husband, \"But it\\'s Palo Alto, Marty! Who\\'s \ngoing to stay at a hotel like that in Palo Alto --- and without gambling?\"\n\nDay proved to be correct. Over time, the Cabaña lost its stars---both celebrities and those in the ratings guides---\nand by 1992 the hotel was washed-up. Four years later, just as the City Council was getting ready to hear final approval to build 93 homes in its place, hotelier B. B. Patel purchased the Cabaña and overhauled the design. Today it operates as the more run-of-the-mill Crowne Plaza Cabaña, a hotel on a strip of hotels. Still although few know it --- like a retired Vegas showgirl --- the Cabaña had a little glitz and glamour in its day.\n\nThe postcards are circa 1965.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh8zqqzu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.12158,37.40581]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel California (1984-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/gomama9.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/1619.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0066_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> The Hotel California is located at Ash Street and California Avenue. \nPhoto #1: 2008\nPhoto #2: Taken in 1984 soon after opening.\nPhoto #3: Taken in 1983 as the hotel was under construction.

Arthur Okado’s family had been in America since 1909.  But two days after Pearl \nHarbor, the President of the Palo Alto Japanese-American Association released a statement printed in the Palo Alto Times, saying “We the members of the Japanese-American community having lived in Palo Alto \nand Menlo Park throughout 40 years…wish to make our stand clear.  Without reservation, we are loyal to \nthis, our country, the United States of America.”  \n\nThe article went on to say that the members of the association had purchased some ,700 in defense \nbonds and that seven of their men were serving in the Army (including Paly graduate Fred Yamamoto who \nwould posthumously win the Silver Star after dying in France).  Still, 10 weeks later, Mr. Okado was \narrested by FBI agents along with three other Palo Altans on suspicion of belonging to an “alien Japanese \norganization.”   It wasn’t until February 1945 that he would return home to Palo Alto after being cleared of \nall suspected wrong-doing.\n\nOn May 19th, 1942, all Japanese-Americans were ordered to leave Palo Alto and the West Coast by \nLieutenant General John L. DeWitt upon the authority of President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order \n9066.  Later, Dewitt defended his decision saying, “A Jap’s a Jap.  We must worry about the Japanese all \nthe time, until he is wiped off the map.”\n\nPalo Alto Japanese-Americans had less than a week to sell their homes, farms and businesses --- just a \nsmall portion of the 00 million nationwide (in 1942 dollars) that Japanese-Americans would lose because \nof the internment.  On May 26th, 144 local Japanese-Americans boarded busses leaving for the former \nracetrack that had become the euphemistically-named Santa Anita Reception Center.

Situated in what was then a small black section of town surrounding the AME Zion Church, Police Chief Howard Zink believed that the work was “done by an organization, not pranksters.”  The symbol’s unfortunate appearance seemed a possible harbinger of some of the troubles that swirled in the Midpeninsula region in the mid-forties.  The height of area Klan activity came later that year, when the Klan burned down the house of John Walker, a black man who had moved into an all-white Dumbarton Oaks neighborhood of Redwood City.  \n\nBut condemnation of the Klan in Palo Alto was swift and strong.  Local op-eds asked the police to “arrest \nand prosecute the Klansmen” and urged local citizens “not to rest until we have found the Klan members \nliving here and taken appropriate action.”  A third Times writer warned that “by shutting our eyes to the first \nventures of these un-American cowards at whatever level they operate, we leave the way open for activities \nthat undermine our democracy and stain the fine community reputation we are so smug about.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sheefhgc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.158452272,37.4429299466]}},{"properties":{"name":"L.

He wanted the entrance gates to the university to be situated on Stanford Avenue near Hanover Street.  One \ncatch though --- Stanford wanted the town to go “dry” --- no more alcohol (obviously universities did not have the same reputations as they do today). Mayfield, with its 13 saloons, voted no thanks. Rejected, Stanford turned his eyes north and convinced his friend, Timothy Hopkins of the Southern Pacific Railroad, to buy 700 acres of private property and sell lots.

Since that night, Palo Alto’s sense of security has never really been the same.\n\nOn the night of June 12th, 1997 all that would come to an end.  After putting their two-year old twins to \nbed, Meg dozed off and Bert set out from his apartment for his nightly “thinking walk.”  Meanwhile over in \nEast Palo Alto, six members of a Samoan gang called the True Blue Crips were drinking Mad Dog 20/20, a \ntype of potent wine, and making plans to “jack someone.”  They piled into the blue Isuzu Rodeo owned by 20 year old Christian Valdes and headed across the 101.  Circling downtown around 10:30pm, they spotted \nKay walking down Gilman Street, a typically serene setting that serves as the Saturday morning home for the Palo Alto Farmer’s Market.\n\nWhile Valdes remained in his car around the corner, his five friends snuck up on the unsuspecting scientist.  \nOne of the attackers brutally struck Kay in the head, knocking him to the ground.  Searching Kay’s pockets, \nthey only found a little girl’s ponytail holder (Kay had actually left his wallet at home).  Two of the other gang \nmembers then savagely beat Kay while he lay writhing in pain on the pavement.  Eventually they dragged \nKay behind the bench that stands behind the Laning Chateau Apartments and fled the scene.  The injuries to \nKay’s face, head and neck were so severe that by the time police arrived just minutes later, Bert Kay was \ndead.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh9vgml2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15887,37.44514]}},{"properties":{"name":"Location of Tree Planted to Honor Policeman Ted Brassinga","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/1/brassing2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/brassing.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Palo Alto reserve officer Ted Brassinga was shot and killed by a Mountain View police officer during a 1994 \ntraining exercise.

Indeed this historically tee-totaling town which served its first legal cocktail in 1971, is now perhaps the most popular nightlife mecca between San Jose and San Francisco.\n\nAt the Birge Clark-designed split level (and historically landmarked) building at 630 Ramona, the college-aged \ncrowd shoots pool on blue-felted tables, revel by the gas fireplace, and play darts and shuffleboard. Not that long ago this hot spot for nightlife was the London House English Tea Room (1969-1993), full of women drinking tea. Now the building is loud, extremely crowded and overcome by hip-hop music.\n\nIn the 1940s, this building was home to the Stanford Upholstering and Furniture Company.

She grew up in California, went to San Jose State University (then known as the San Jose Normal School) and then studied geology at Stanford University, where she met her husband.  She met Juliette Gordon Low, who founded the Girl Scouts of America, at the end of World War I. When her husband moved the family to Washington D.C., Hoover started her own troop of scouts, which included both white and African American girls — a rare occurence at that time.\n\nThe City of Palo Alto granted a piece of land for a Girl Scout House to be built within a corner of Rinconada Park adjacent to what is now the Junior Museum and Lucie Stern Center.  Lou Henry Hoover and two other members of the Palo Alto Girl Scout Board each donated 00 to build the meetinghouse.  Stonemasons built the fireplace from the sandstone of the fallen arch over Stanford’s Palm Drive that had been destroyed in the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake.  Building the house became a community affair where local builders, architects, painters, and many others gave their time and their money to complete the project.  June of 1926 saw the house dedicated to the Girl Scouts of Palo Alto by Lou Henry Hoover.  A display case in the entry hall contains memorabilia of Lou Henry Hoover, including some of her field notebooks and early photographs.  It was researched and donated as a Silver Award project by a Palo Alto troop.\"\n\n-Palo Alto Girl Scouts  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shdw010i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.144689,37.444438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Louis Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> The name Louis Road is actually a sign maker\\'s mistake.

Not to say that Palo Alto has not had its share of both peaceful and enlightened protests.  But especially between 1968 and 1972, Lytton Plaza became famous for a series of chaotic riots that symbolized the worst of the youth movement, not the best.\n\nThe former location of the monumental American Trust Building, the 8,500 square foot plaza was constructed in 1964 by Bart Lytton across the street from his Lytton Savings Bank at Emerson and University.  With its brick and cement foundation and modernist rounded concrete bench/plant holders, the plaza always had a somewhat severe appearance.  Still, at its inception in 1964, it was clean, well-groomed and a needed pedestrian oasis in an increasingly automobile-centered downtown.  \n\nBut while Lytton intended the plaza for the “use and enjoyment of the people of Palo Alto,” some people’s \nidea of “enjoyment” was not exactly what Lytton had in mind.  Within five years, the plaza had become the favored spot in Palo Alto for both protest and late-night rock concerts.  Because it was privately owned, it \nwas not subject to city park regulations, and because it was not fenced, anti-trespass laws did not apply.  As a sort of legal “no man’s land,” Lytton Plaza soon became the place to challenge the system in Palo Alto.\n\nNote: To be renamed in 2009 and re-landscaped.\nThe older photos are circa 1965 and 1971.

Manning. He and his wife Esther lived here until 1925 when they moved to 649 Alvarado Row on the Stanford campus. They had five children and clearly needed more room than a two-bedroom house, like 604 was at that time, could provide. Dr. Manning (1876-1972) lived to be 95.\n\nThe house was sold to Vern James, a student of Dr. Manning\\'s, who earned his doctorate in 1927. Dr. James taught mathematics for many years at San Jose State. (When they were young, the children of both professors Manning and James slept in an open sleeping porch located where the kitchen is today.)\n\nThe second story was added in the early 1930s by Dr. James, as was the gabled section to the left. The facade was changed from redwood shingle to clapboard at that time. The shape of the right hand gable, however, is the same. Note the chimney and the position of the front door. Dr. James did most of the work himself, including the digging of a full basement by hand! (See pictures again.)\n\nVern and Edna Chapman James lived here from 1925 until Dr. James\\'s death in 1967. There were four children. (Edna James died in 1965). The historic photo shows Edna James and her children at the front door. The James children sold the house to its third owners, John and Ann Palmer. Dr. Palmer was a Stanford urologist, and he put the house on the market after only two years, because he received an offer in 1969 from UC Davis.\"\n-PAST Heritage\n\nThere were some bright children who grew up in this house. Dr. Manning\\'s son (still living) is a retired professor of electrical engineering at Stanford, and two of Manning\\'s daughters became professional mathematicians in their own right. One of the James daughters was a professor of psychology at the University of Washington for many years. The current owner\\'s son holds a Ph.D. in ecology and now works for NOAA.\n\nThe current owner, who holds a Ph.D. degree himself, finds it interesting that, although realtors call this part of town \"Old Palo Alto,\" this house, along with 299 Tennyson Avenue, is practically the first home south of Embarcadero Road to reach 100 years of age, other than the Gamble House (1902). Almost all the other older homes are either on the Stanford campus or north of Embarcadero Road.

The station was moved in 1921 to the marsh just east of Palo Alto (the current \"antenna farm\"), and the San Francisco station was closed in 1927. Around this time the station was also sold to Mackay Cable &amp; Wireless. In July, 1943, a new 50KW transmitter was activated at KFS under the callsign KROJ and provided a relay service for the Voice of America. This service was terminated in 1945 at the end of World War II.\n\n\"The exact corporate history of the site after WWII is impossible to ascertain, but during the next 30 years it was owned by ITT World Communications (which eventually called the site Palo Alto Radio) and then KFS World Communications. The site still contains an old, unused mailbox with the ITT name on it at the front gate.\n\n\n\"ITT had transferred much of the Palo Alto site to the city in 1977 and held an easement for their continued operation. In January 1994, Palo Alto bought the easement from KFS for 70,000, thus securing one of the last remaining large pieces of the baylands not under the city\\'s control. There are currently no plans to renovate or demolish the site, although in 1994 there were some rumors about turning the large radio building into a youth hostel. Obviously this hasn\\'t happened yet.\n\n\"In 1995, the U.S. Coast Guard officially stopped listening for Morse Code distress calls. KFS sold the Half Moon Bay facility to Globe Wireless, a company specializing in maritime communications (including email and telefax) using satellite and HF communications. With the newly available communications technology, they decommissioned all Morse Code transmissions. The last commercial radiotelegraph transmission in North America was made from the Palo Alto site at 2359 UTC on July 12, 1999. The final words transmitted by KFS? \"What hath God wrought\".\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shiprj9k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.112264633,37.4452639133]}},{"properties":{"name":"Martha Washington Ice Cream","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0021.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Martha Washington Ice Cream and Candies next to the Ramona Hotel in 1940.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shcsr4jo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16175139,37.4454385319]}},{"properties":{"name":"Maskey Building (demolished 1937)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/0/lyttonhigh.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/0/lyttonhighmaskeybuilddemolish1937.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Maskey Building at the corner of Lytton and High.

Indeed, there had been so many old beat-up newsracks in front of the Downtown Post Office that some council members said it was safety hazard---it was hard to get up onto the sidewalk in an emergency. 33 newsracks had lined up in a row and there were no city ordinances to say that they couldn\\'t. \n\nBut what really had folks hot and bothered was the content of some of those newsracks. Adult weeklies with such...er..offbeat titles as Yank, often displayed partially naked women on the covers---in full view of children or anyone else on their way to mail a letter. \n\nIn 1996, the Council unanimously approved shields for the racks that covered the bottom two-thirds of the magazine. But they would only go so far down that constitutionally protected road---the Council voted down an amendment to also require shields for lewd material in store windows that could be viewed from the outside. Many council members believed that such an ordinance could be dragged into court on first amendment grounds. \n\nIn 1997, the council did some further housekeeping---regulating newsrack proliferation across the city. The city instituted new, modular racks to be located in specific spots throughout downtown. They also cut the total number of newspaper racks, thereby killing newsrack row.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shhem855"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15941,37.44591]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nixon Elementary School (1970-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/1862.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Lucile Nixon Elementary School opened in 1970 and was named after Lucille (“Luchi”) Nixon, who served as consultant for curriculum and instruction for the elementary grades of the Palo Alto Unified School District.

In 1990, the county health department cracked down on the abundance of rats, \ncockroaches, and electrical problems at Liddicoat\\'s. The owners cleaned things up and spent 50,000 on \nimprovements but, too little, too late---by then the property owners were already on the lookout for a new \ntenant.\n\nPhoto #1: The Liddicoat\\'s food court in the 1980s.\nPhoto #2: Z Gallerie closed its doors in 2009.\nPhoto #3: Old Nortree Hall\nPhoto #4: The Liddicoat\\'s food court from outside in 1983.\nPhoto #5: Mrs. Field\\'s Chocolate Chippery in 1977, the first store leading to a nationwide company.\nPhoto #6: Debbi Fields was a young mother with no business experience when she launched Mrs. Field\\'s Cookies in 1977.\nPhoto #7: Nortree Hall, unbounded on either side.

At the height of the depression, 15 original co-opters joined together and bought a case of corn --- a group that would makeup the early foundation of what would become the Palo Alto Co-op Market. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh6vyzen"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.162314653,37.4464649407]}},{"properties":{"name":"Original St. Michael's Alley (1959-1966)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/6_Nun_Airplane.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/cafe11peets.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0092_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0100_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0002_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Opening at 436 University Avenue on April 1st, 1959, owner and former political pollster Vernon Gates was looking to capture the spirit of the European cafes that he had known during his studies at the University of Innsbruck in Austria (St. Michael’s Alley is actually the London street where many of the first English cafes opened in the 17th Century).  Palo Alto’s Alley was a modest establishment, about 90 x 30 feet with a high ceiling and service bar in the back.  It had a dark, woodsy atmosphere, a piano painted speckled green against a side wall, and no bandstand. The atmosphere was cozy and informal.  As jazz musician Dick Fregulia \nremembers, “A piano player could literally play with one hand on the keys and the other hand reaching for a \ncoffee cup on one of the adjacent tables.”  \n\nThere were performances of all types --- folk singers, jazz bands, staged plays, poetry readings.  And while \nit wasn’t obvious at the time, the place was becoming a proving grounds for many rising stars.   Paly high \nschooler Joan Baez, members of Jefferson Airplane and Jerry Garcia and the members of the early \nincarnations of the Grateful Dead all played there.  Bob Hunter even washed dishes in the kitchen for a while.\n\nIt was a credit to Gates that such a creative atmosphere could thrive at St. Mike’s --- especially in a town as \nmainstream as Palo Alto in those days. From the beginning, the amateur watercolor artist and poetry writer pushed his employees to dance, paint and play music.  He saw St. Mike’s as a “bohemian establishment in a sea of Republicans.” And as such, it soon began attracting counterculture types from all over the Peninsula.\n\nPhoto #1: Greg Brown\\'s painting of a nun flying a paper airplane which is on the second floor outside.\nPhoto #2: 2009, Peet\\'s Coffee &amp; Tea\nPhoto #3, #5: Folklorico Importer, 1980s...going out of business.\nPhoto #4: Vernon Gates.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh5dfkoj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.159954309,37.4473507926]}},{"properties":{"name":"Original Varsity Theatre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/cafe8univ.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0011_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0086_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0030_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> Photo #1: Across the street from Starbucks is the ambient-rich University Café.

As long-time employee and associate Joseph Ehrlich tells the story, “The postmaster pushed them away and said, ‘Don’t you know what a U.S. post office looks like?  We expect a stately building with neo-Romanesque columns showing the power of the federal government.  I cannot approve this design.’…Birge responded, ‘Ok, but I don’t think the President and First Lady are going to be pleased with the design change.’”  After revealing that the Hoovers had already approved the plans while Clark was breakfasting with his old friends that morning, the postmaster had a sudden change of heart and approved \nevery blueprint in front of him.\"\n\nVideo of Gail Woolley discussing the Post Office\\'s history: http://blip.tv/file/2525923\n\nPhoto #1: The Post Office in 1985.

While the airport closed during World War II, it opened again in 1946 with two all-weather strips.  One strip was eventually moved to make way for the golf course and later the county line was adjusted to put the entire airport within Santa Clara County --- they now runs the airport.  Federal air controllers have operated its tower since 1967.  While the airport remains quite busy, noise problems have led to city officials opposition to a second runway.\n\nSource: Palo Alto: A Centennial History <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shbspvfl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.11274,37.45605]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Alto Airport (1928-1935)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0047_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0057_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0058_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0062_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0078_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> The Palo Alto School of Aviation opened in 1928 near the corner of Stanford Avenue and El Camino, complete with two hangars, a ground school and a strip of grass for a runway.

And the requisite small speakers could be hung inside the car (a \nPA announcement after the show urgently reminded viewers to put the speakers back in the receptacle box \nbefore driving off).

Standing at 4249 El Camino Real \nin South Palo Alto, the lonely and somewhat somber wood-paneled headquarters of the Palo Alto Elks is \nset back from the main street behind a two acre swath of empty asphalt parking lot.  There was a time when \nsuch a plethora of space was needed --- the Elks grew by leaps and bounds to a peak of about 3,700 \nmembers in the 1970s.  But in the last three decades, the Elks, like other fraternal organizations around the \nnation, have seen their membership shrink rapidly.  Now comprised of less than 800 members, the average \nElk is said to be over 70 years old.  Facing possible extinction, the Elks are now proposing a bold plan to \ntry to regain their stride.\n\nThe photos of the Elks lodge are from 1973 and 2007.  Included are also an artist\\'s rendering of the new Elks Lodge and a photo of some Elk Club members in 1942.

Merriman, which as legend has it, \nonce rode the Palo Alto streets whip in hand, ready to teach a lesson to any driver she saw mistreating his \nhorse.  The Society’s early membership roles included Stanford’s first president, David Starr Jordan and \nMrs. Jane Stanford herself, both of who helped push for the city’s first horse watering trough in the days \nbefore automobiles.   \n\nBut it wasn’t really until 1924 that the PAHS found its voice.  That year Police Chief C.F. Noble issued a \ncrackdown on dogs roaming the streets without licenses.  Playing the villain to a tee, Noble hired a man \nnamed “Dick the Dogcatcher” to enforce justice.  Soon the papers were full of letters from readers \ncomplaining about maimed dogs that had been swiped from their home yards and porches.  One man wrote \nin to the Palo Alto Times complaining that his dog had never been the same after it was impounded and that \nit had become a “wild-eyed creature with deep bites about the head and body.”  There was also some \nhistory of the local police operating with a “shoot on site” policy for strays.  \n\nClearly, there was a need for the Humane Society to help safeguard the city’s pets and strays from this \nrather overzealous police force.  But the PAHS had little money and no land on which to construct a shelter.  \nEnter, Mrs. Frank Thomas (as she was always referred to in the papers of the day), a Middlefield Road \nresident who was known for taking in as many stray pets as her home and husband would allow.  Before \nlong, the PAHS had set up kennels in her yard and acquired her services to take care of the animals being \nrounded up all over the city.  And although it was supposed to be just a temporary arrangement, Mrs. \nThomas wound up donating her home and time for more than two years before the city spent 000 to build \na makeshift pound.\n\nThis location is now home to the Sheraton Hotel and was formerly home to a Holiday Inn.\n\n\nPhoto #1:Former PAHS president Gerald Damadge inquires after a cat.\nPhoto #2: The cages inside.\nPhoto #3: Circa 1945\nPhoto #4: Feeding the dogs in their cages.\nPhoto #5: The Hyatt Palo Alto built in the same location, circa 1990.\nPhoto #6: The Palo Alto Sheraton in 2007.\nPhoto #7:The Humane Society building shortly before closing.\nPhoto #8: The animal shelter with Alma Street behind it.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh3h8lvg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.163591385,37.4415244206]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Alto Jazz Festival","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0082_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0081.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> The Palo Alto Jazz Festival was an annual event in the 1980s, beginning with the first festival in 1986.

Although these schools began independently, David Starr Jordan, the first president of Stanford University, inspired both.\n\nIn 1893 President Jordan, concerned for the University’s need for superior incoming students, encouraged Frank Cramer, a pioneer educator and civic leader, to begin Manzanita Hall, a college preparatory school for boys. The program was dedicated to the premise that the successful future citizen and student of higher education is one who has a broad foundation not only in his classroom pursuits, but also in nonacademic areas. The development of high moral character and leadership qualities was emphasized.\n\nCatherine Harker, a Vassar graduate and a professor of Greek and Latin at Mills College, recognized the need for a girls’ preparatory school near Stanford and founded Miss Harker’s School in 1902, which also emphasized superior scholarship, character, and leadership.\n\nIn 1919 Cramer’s original school, Manzanita Hall, became Palo Alto Military Academy, a school for boys of elementary age under the direction of Richard P. Kelly. Donald L. Nichols assumed leadership of the Academy in 1950 and the Harker Day School in 1956, merged the two schools under the name Harker Academy and moved to the present location in 1972.\"\nSource: Harker School Website\n\nPhoto #1: Members of the Military Academy.\nPhoto #2: Palo Alto Military Academy being demolished in 1972.\nPhoto #3: The PA Military Academy before the development of Rinconada Park.\nPhoto #4: Manzanita Hall\nPhoto #5: PAMA students.\nPhoto #6: The demolition of the school grounds in 1972.\nPhoto #7: Students with bikes.\nPhoto #8: A major with a dog.\nPhoto #9: During 1972 demolition, a Harker\\'s Day School for Boys and Girls sign has fallen upside down.\nPhoto #10: Manzanita Hall being taken apart in 1972,\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shi7wxo4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.144129276,37.4456301861]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Alto Office Center Courtyard (1965-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/0/5253.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> The courtyard of 525 University Avenue is rarely used.

It had snowed --- and \nnot just a few ice crystals on the grass --- it had really snowed.  While there had been dustings here and \nthere over the years, this was Palo Alto’s version of a blizzard --- an inch and a half was reported at \nRinconada Park and close to 9 inches up in the mountains on Skyline Drive.  \n\nAfter an extremely warm and dry winter that year, the storm was part of a cold spell caused by wayward \nCanadian winds that settled over the Western United States.  In Palo Alto that early Sunday morning, the \ntemperature dropped to 26 degrees and by 4AM, the falling rain began to turn to snow.  As it turned out, it \nwould keep on falling for the next three and a half  hours and by the time breakfast was on the table, most \nyoungsters were already outside having a once-in-a-childhood experience.\n\nSoon, the whole city was a giant white playground.  Snowmen were being built all over town, snowball fights broke out everywhere, the 10th hole fairway at Los Altos Country Club became a makeshift ski resort and Palo Alto stores ran out of film.  So many families took rides north to the mountains that Page Mill Road \nbecame bogged down in traffic.  Other cars never started at all.  One Palo Alto gas station owner reported \nthat he sold 150 gallons of antifreeze by noon, three times the usual amount for an entire year. And so many \nlocals were on the telephone giving amateur weather reports that the lines were completely jammed by 6:30 \nin the morning.  One thing no one seemed to be doing was going to church.  Local ministers reported that \nbetween 35-40% of their usual congregations were conspicuously absent --- evidentially out admiring God’s \nwork personally.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh6lnc0d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.139387131,37.4432706762]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Alto Sport Shop","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/paloaltosportsshop.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0046.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0014.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> One of the longest-running businesses in town. \n\nPhoto #1: 2008\nPhoto #2 Ca. 1950s\nPhoto #3: 1985<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh5m9bld"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15994,37.44665]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Alto Square (1972-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0039_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0035_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/4/IMG0002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> In 1968, developers William Alhouse and Thomas Ford announced their plan to build \"a one-stop financial shopping center\" on Stanford lands at Page Mill and El Camino, then a horse pasture.

The Aquarius Theatre downtown and Palo Alto Square tucked away since 1971 among office buildings on El Camino Real near Page Mill Road. Actually, the odd location might be part of the secret to their success---the theatre uses office parking at night for the films, making it easy to get in and out on a Saturday night.\n\nPalo Alto Square has narrowly avoided a couple of near-misses at extinction. In 1997, there were plans to turn the theatre (at that time run by Landmark who had all kinds of financial problems in those years) into more offices. Moving trucks were parked outside and seats had already begun to be ripped out, when Council Member Gary Fazzino and city staff persuaded landowner Equity Office Properties in Chicago to keep the theatre on a month to month lease.\n\nIn 2001, Landmark did lose its lease, but the support the community showed (both in terms of protest letters and \nticket receipts) allowed Cinearts, the artsy arm of Century Cinemas, to move in to the twin-screen miniplex. After some screen and seat renovations and additions at the snack bar that perhaps better match the films inside (frenchpastries and gourmet coffees, for instance), the theatre re-opened in 2002.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shern3lj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.141500711,37.4205065295]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Alto Times Building","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/cogswell4.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/cogswell1949_496x378.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/times.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/cogswell2008_495x378.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/cogswell3_2_.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/1/ti.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Palo Alto Times was Palo Alto\\'s paper of record for most of the 20th Century.

In some ways, it was a classic culture clash.   It featured two groups, the yachters and the \nenvironmentalists, each possessing vastly different worldviews, with little in common in how they saw the \ndestiny of Palo Alto Harbor.  What resulted was perhaps the most compelling political campaign in the city’s \nhistory.  Not only was it exciting, always in doubt and full of rhetorical sparks, but in the end, the campaign \nitself really mattered.  Because despite the close divide in public opinion, the environmentalists’ campaign \nwas so utterly victorious and the boaters’ campaign so profoundly defeated, that by 1985, the public had \ntwice backed what was once almost unthinkable --- the complete demolition of the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.\n\nPhotos: Photo #1 from 2008, #2 iis circa 1980.

Out of control fans crowds passed the Cabana’s outlandish replicas of the David and the Venus De Milo, swarmed across El Camino Real (backing up traffic) and into the Rickey’s lot across the street.  A few girls even slipped past the guards and actually began to climb up the outer grating of the hotel (presumably with the goal of reaching the Beatles on the 8th floor), before being coaxed down again.  \n\nPolice were everywhere.  In fact, it cost the San Mateo County sheriff’s office some 1,000 to provide 80 men \nand 30 patrol cars for the Beatles 25 hour stay.  Palo Alto itself shelled out some 00 in overtime in order to \nstation officers at the Cabana and the hotel’s own security bill was ,000 after hiring some 200 temporary \nsecurity guards, including many players from the University of Santa Clara football team.\n\nBut most of the action came as the Beatles came and went.  Upon arrival, the scene of pandemonium outside the Cabana resembled one of the frantic free-for-alls displayed the year before in “A Hard Day’s Night.”  Fans climbed onto the Beatles limousine, rocking the car and denting the roof.  Years later, one Beatle fan recalled that upon getting out, this most famous rock group in music history simply looked like “four scared kids.”  \n\nThe next morning, however, the Beatles made a slick getaway.  Plans were announced that the Beatles were to be whisked out of their Room 810 Suite, down the Northside elevator, past the Cabana kitchen and out through the service entrance.  Sure enough, two decoy limos and a truck were stationed out front, prompting many fans to wave goodbye to Beatles that they mistakenly thought were inside.  Instead, the boys were sent by police out the southside entrance.  “Where’s the car?” asked Paul, upon arriving --- only to be directed into a white and blue 1.5 ton delivery truck along with John and George.\n\nBut as the truck frantically made its way for the Cabana exit, the driver realized he had left Ringo behind --- not the last time the Beatle drummer would feel forgotten --- and had to slam on the brakes to let in the fourth band \nmember.   A photograph of two of Palo Alto female fans --- 14 year-old Rocky Keith and 13 year-old Sue Moore \n--- was printed in the Palo Alto Times the next day “sobbing with joy” because they happened to see the Beatles’ exit.  But most of the girls on the other side of the hotel were not so lucky --- and were forced to console themselves by later purchasing pieces of Beatle bedsheets sold in the Cabana parking lot.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh799pao"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.120912075,37.4058237323]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Alto-Menlo Park Connecting Bridge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/0/IMG0027_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The connecting bridge between Menlo Park and Palo Alto in El Palo Alto Park.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh57cux4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.170237899,37.4474391642]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palo Verde Elementary (1953-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/0/1887.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/0/1904.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Palo Verde Elementary School on Louis Road.

The Mothers\\' Cooperative Nursery School began on the Stanford campus the following January. Monthly tuition was .00, and each mother worked two mornings a week at the school. After six months, the school moved to Sunday school rooms at the First Methodist Church. The inconvenience of having to disassemble the classrooms every Friday and then reassemble them on Monday led parents to explore the idea of finding a building of their own. Dr. Esther Clarke, who saw this sort of nursery school as a model for the early education of children, encouraged parents in finding a school site. She appeared before the Palo Alto City Council to advocate for the idea of placing the school in a residential environment. In 1948, after several fund raising efforts, a group of parents was able to purchase a permanent site for the school: a turnip patch at the edge of the city. It was parents who raised the money for the school, and it is parents of currently enrolled children who have remained its co-owners.\" -PNS website<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shirof4p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.129731178,37.44108998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris Theatre (1961-1977)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0057_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/carolynkelsey.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/zIMG0084.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/paris2007_396x480.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> The Paris Theatre\nUniversity Avenue has changed a great deal over the past 30 years and perhaps nothing illustrates that \ntransformation as much as the one-time existence of the Paris Theatre.  The X-rated movie house operated during the 1970s at 124 University Avenue near Alma Street, giving Palo Alto a rather unseemly entry point to the Downtown area.  During its time as the city’s only adult theatre, the Paris would become engaged on a local basis in the national debate over obscenity.  While the nation’s high court grappled with what constituted “obscene” and what was protected under the First Amendment, Palo Altans struggled with what was permissible according to their own community’s standards.\nPhoto #1: Being remodeled in the 1980s.\nPhoto #2:Carolyn Kelsey in the 1940s.\nPhoto #3: W.D.

Today it is the office of Chabad Palo Alto.\n\n\"Few other institutions other than Stanford University itself have left as enduring a mark on the Palo Alto area as Piers Dairy and Piers Ranch\nThe Piers family operation that shaped or marked much of the 20th century in Palo Alto began with the immigration of Manuel Ignatius Piers -- known as \"M.I.\" -- from his native town of Pico, Azores, to the Palo Alto area in 1912.\n\nIn 1914 Piers bought a small dairy, the Home Dairy, and 20 acres along Willow Road in \"north Palo Alto,\" now Menlo Park. He began selling milk from a roadside stand, along with ice cream and butter -- expanding his business to horse-and-buggy deliveries to nearby homes. For many years, Piers and later his growing family lived in a home on the property.\n\nBy World War I Piers was delivering milk in bulk -- reportedly initially by horse and buggy -- to Stanford University\\'s student union and dormitories, while the U.S. government built the Veterans Hospital across Willow Road. By the 1920s, the Home Dairy was garnering statewide prizes for its rich, \"certified\" milk, which it delivered to Palo Alto schools -- one of the first certified dairies in the state based on stringent inspections and health tests of the cows.\n\nPiers developed a reputation as a leader in breeding techniques to improve his dairy herd, located on an 8-acre milking farm on Louis Road in what is now south Palo Alto. He and his wife, Eleanor, raised three sons and a daughter in their home on the Willow Road property and later on Center Avenue in Palo Alto: Byron, Roger, Edson and Elinor -- all of whom, plus years later Edson\\'s son, Gregory, were involved in the dairy operation at some point.\n\nSomewhere between World War I and the early 1920s, Piers leased a reported 1,750 acres of Stanford University foothill lands for grazing and breeding of his dairy herds -- a leasehold that reportedly grew to a maximum of about 2,500 acres for the \"Piers Ranch\" before Interstate 280 and other encroachments trimmed it back to less than half that...In 1937, Piers enlarged the dairy herd at the milking barn at 3070 Louis Road and founded Piers Dairy, drawing in virtually all his immediate family members.

On that day, 56 year-old investment company president Raymond McWard was \npursuing a rich man’s hobby --- flying his Fairchild 24 four-seater private plane.  A novice flier who had \nrecently undertaken his first solo flight, McWard was practicing landings when he became distracted for a \nmoment by a radio antenna network.  Upon approaching the runway, he didn’t see a set of utility power \nlines until it was too late.  Swerving violently upward, the undercarriage of the plane struck the top two lines \nof the 110,000 volt main feeder line for PG&amp;E.  The lines parted and McWard’s plane crashed to the \nground, flipped over and skidded 100 feet, stopping just yards away from where Embarcadero Road ends.  \nGasoline spilled out of the wing tanks and covered the ground around the plane.  The 110,000 volt wires fell \nto the wet ground and began to inflame a number of small fires.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh5foek7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.10994,37.45388]}},{"properties":{"name":"Playtown Amusement Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/townandcountryaccidents4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Site of the 1960 freak accident in which Harvard Professor Frank Freidel\\'s three year old son Phillip died.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shitic6d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15868,37.43795]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pole Field (at Byxbee Park)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0034.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0033_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0035_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0039_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/ByxPlSd.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> \"The Pole Field consists of telephone poles of varying height with their tops at a uniform plane.

After failing to stop the construction of the Oregon Expressway and having had \ntheir power reduced during the 1967 recall election, the residentialists were now clinging to just two \nremaining Council seats and were in need of a political victory.  They would stake their comeback on the \nrejection of two major development projects in 1970 and 1971:  the so-called Superblock project --- twin \n11 story towers that were proposed on a downtown site along University Avenue --- and the 18 story \nPatient Care Health Center to be erected on a two block square in quiet Professorville.\n\nDreaming of a city hospital to remedy the crowded conditions at Stanford University Hospital, The Palo Alto \nMedical Research Foundation (PAMRF), a non-profit corporation founded in 1930 by Dr. Russel V. Lee, \nproposed a “jet-age” hospital to open across from the Palo Alto medical clinic.  The hospital project was \nmassive in scope:  The original proposal called for a 1 million, 18 story hospital of 600,000 square feet, \n300 beds, and between 800 to 1,000 employees.\n\nBut the problem was not just the size, but the location.  Professorville is Palo Alto’s most historic \nneighborhood having acquired its name for the many Stanford professors who built their homes there in the \n1890s.  The PAMRF claimed (perhaps a bit cynically) that the location bordered by Waverley and Bryant \nStreets, Addison and Channing Avenues was the best of the many sites they considered for the hospital.  But \nhospital opponents noted that it \"is incredible that the PAMRF should conclude from their alleged site studies \nthat the best location for the new hospital just happens to be across the street from their present medical \nclinic.\"  Pointing to the small scale nature of the neighborhood and the old homes that would have to go, \nresidentialists argued that “The site’s not right.”\n\nPhoto #1: The tower would have risen in this photograph had the opposition forces won the battle.\nPhoto #2: A sketch of the proposed hospital.\nPhoto #3: A biker makes her opinion known.

No longer the quiet small town of years gone by, developers began to pitch projects that sought to attract big-name businesses to further economic development in Downtown Palo Alto.  But such projects also threatened the small-scale downtown environment that many cherished.  The debate over what type of city Palo Alto was to become reached its zenith in the late 1960s with the debate over a sizable downtown office complex nicknamed the Superblock.  Three years of political battle would ensue before the Superblock was finally rejected by the city’s voters in a 1971 referendum.  And when the dust had finally settled, a new political course was set that would lead Palo Alto to become the city that it is to this day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh4zfk6j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16219,37.44629]}},{"properties":{"name":"Protest at Police Station (1968)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/2/1968.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/2/IMG0098.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Students protest at the Palo Alto Police Station in 1968.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh82280v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.162057161,37.4461476499]}},{"properties":{"name":"Protests at Town &amp; Country","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/baez2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0013_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> The busy corner of El Camino and Embarcadero has long been a good place to stage a protest.\nPhoto #1: This remarkable photo is of the Peninsula \nYouth for Peace protesting H-bomb testing.

But neighbors and council members often worried it would attract the \"wrong sort of people\" NIMBYism seemed to arise with every potential location.\n\nIn 1994, the debate heated up again when neighbors of Johnson Park complained that basketball players were \nusing their stairwells for their baser needs. But when other neighbors protested the idea of park facilities, the city came up with a different plan---take out the basketball hoop.\n\nSo what is a small-bladdered Palo Altan to do? Ah, have no fear, the French to the rescue.\n\nDecaux public restrooms, which are operated by coin, self-clean for 55 seconds after each use, and are visited by maintenance workers twice a day have been installed in cities all over Europe. Perhaps that\\'s why the French are considered so refined?\n\nBut while the new toilets solved much of the problem, the bad news was that you get what you pay for. With a yearly tab of 1,500 per toilet, the city purchased just two restrooms and installed them at Lytton Plaza (later \nmoved to the Caltrans station) and at the corner of Hamilton and Waverly. The restrooms cost 50 cents to use, but tokens are distributed for free to the homeless.\n\nWhat a relief!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shhel4ca"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15938,37.44631]}},{"properties":{"name":"Purity Market","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0079.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/stanfordshoppingcenteroldmap_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0048.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> It is a little hard to believe these days but Stanford Shopping Center once had a Purity supermarket.

The park was originally known as \"Waterworks\" for the reservoir and well located on the site near the corner of Newell Road, but after Mrs. M.S. Alterton won a 5 naming prize in 1924, it has since been known as Rinconada Park (little corner in Spanish).  Over the years, the park has been developed through the construction of a community center (1932), children\\'s theatre (1936), swimming pool (1940) and children\\'s museum (1941).\nSource: Parks of Palo Alto\nPhoto #1: Rinconada Park\nPhoto #2: Picnic grounds\nPhoto #3: From above in the 1940s\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh6nw31i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.139926,37.443173]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rinconada Tennis Courts","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0009_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0099_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Photo #1: A man prepares to serve on the Rinconada Park tennis courts.\nPhoto #2: Women playing doubles in perhaps the 1960s. \n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh7mio7b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14181,37.44429]}},{"properties":{"name":"Robaii, Falafel &amp; Persian Bites (1998-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/4/menu_pics11_009_402x327.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/4/menu_pics11_010_390x326.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> The Iranian Restaurant is at the corner of Hamilton and Cowper is named after a technique in Persian poetry.

In 1976, the Palo Alto City Council approved an enormous expansion of the center that allowed McAndrews to go to town.  Policy was changed to force many stores into smaller quarters and some larger leases were bought out.  McAndrews then took to fashioning the old mall into a sort of European street fair.  Using photos of markets and shopping plazas she took while on trips to the Old World, McAndrews made what was once a good place to buy a new lawnmower or ladder into the place to purchase a trendy Italian sports coat or rare oriental fragrance.  The appearance changed dramatically, as well, with the addition of lush gardens, fanciful sculptures and a grand mural of a European market rather self-consciously referred to as the “Rue du chat qui peche.\"   By 1985, the Euro strategy had paid off, quite literally, as its 150 stores led the Peninsula with annual earnings of 50 million.\n\nPhoto #1: 1980s\nPhoto #2: 2008<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh8j6dp8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.172415853,37.442450793]}},{"properties":{"name":"Russian Orthodox Church Hall (1952-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/3/66.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/3/68.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/3/COVER.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/3/RUSSIAN_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_worship_verD.gif\"> Photo #1: The inside of the Russian Orthodox Church Hall on Ross Road as seen in the 1966.\nPhoto #2: Outside in 1968.\nPhoto #3: Polina Zapreyeva lights candles inside the Russian Orthodox Church on Ross Road in south Palo Alto just before the start of the Christmas Eve celebration.

The \nPalo Alto police sent a bus with 55 officers and other security personal to oppose them.  \n\nBy mid-morning there were nearly 400 demonstrators on hand and the police force opposing them had \ngrown to 130.  Things began to spiral out of control.   Some protesters began to throw rocks and break \nwindows in the SRI building.  Then in 2 places, the students set fire to the bus and the makeshift barricade.  \nAs the chaos grew, the police gave the crowd a warning to disperse or face arrest.  When they did not, all hell broke loose.  Police released eye-irritating choking tear gas and smoke bombs and began moving en \nmasse down Hanover Street.  Many protesters were forced to flee into an empty field, while others caught \nthe full effect of the teargas.  Some of the police, ducking rocks, chased protesters as far as 3/4 of a mile.

And in the mid-90s when Stanford put on a full-court press to get the city’s go-ahead on the project once and for all --- concerns over traffic congestion, open space development, relations with Menlo Park, the fate of native creek species and even the hidden artifacts of the Ohlone Muwekma Indians created a hailstorm of criticism and controversy. In the end Stanford got its way, but only after a pricey public relations war and a feisty political campaign.

From its beginning,it was the home to the local Sea Scouts, an off-shoot of the Boy Scouts, that taught boys and girls aged 14-20 how to excel in water activities such as sailing, sea customs, riggings, compass reading and knot-tying.   \n\nOn the weekend of May 30th, 1941, Palo Alto’s “fairy godmother” and greatest benefactor Lucie Stern --- \nwho had given 3,000 for the base’s construction --- christened the building by smashing a bottle of \nAtlantic Ocean seawater on the deck rail.  The three day extravaganza of dedication activities included a \nbonfire, jiu-jitsu, magic show, barbeque and formal dance; all emceed by radio performer Hal Burdick.  On \nSunday, the event concluded with the formal inspection of over 150 Palo Alto and visiting Sea Scouts in \ntheir dress uniforms.    \n\nThe building was abandoned after the Yacht Harbor closed, although it will soon be the home to the Environmental Volunteers.\n\nPhoto #1: In 2007\nPhoto #2: From the same angle in 1973.\nPhoto #3: At the Sea Scout weekend of opening activities in May 1941.

In the mid 60’s it garnered a bad reputation, making police watch lists and drawing the wrath of mainstream Palo Alto.  After closing down in 1966, St. Michael’s Alley reopened 7 years later as a full-menu restaurant with a new location and new credo to serve an upscale audience.

Built \nin the early days of American’s great suburban migration, the new shopping plaza north of Stanford and just west of El Camino Real immediately drew shoppers away from the traditional downtown Palo Alto \ncommercial district.  And yet Stanford Shopping Center has never been completely typical.  Founded as a \nspecial source of income for Stanford University, its beginnings certainly were unique.  Furthermore, as an \noutdoor center which has grown in stages and also undergone a dramatic upscale shift over the years, the \nStanford Shopping Center has never been easily classified.  These days it hardly resembles the typical multi-tiered, air conditioned “box with food court” that is the prototypical American mall.  As Palo Alto has \nbecome the capital of Silicon Valley’s success, the Stanford Shopping Center has grown to accommodate \nthe new wealth that has flooded the city.  Long gone are Palo Alto’s days as a sleepy small town --- and \nlong gone are the days of the Stanford Shopping Center as a sleepy small town mall.\n\nPhoto #1: Tiffany\\'s at the modern day Stanford Shopping Center.\nPhoto #2: Looking at Bloomingdale\\'s.\nPhoto #3: Tractors begin their work on the Stanford Shopping Center in 1953.\nPhoto #4: A map of the original shopping center.\nPhoto #5: The Emporium was one of the big San Francisco stores which opened locations in the original center.\nPhoto #6: The fields where the Stanford Shopping Center would be built.

As cable and color television, VCRs and year-round TV sports lured people to stay home on Friday and Saturday nights --- and big screen \nmultiplexes opened within a short freeway drive --- the Stanford began to sink ever further down the cinematic food chain, eventually showing second-run Hollywood action flicks while continuously poised on the verge of being eaten up by shops and restaurants.\n\nBut thanks to the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the zeal of the billionaire’s movie-buff son, David Woodley Packard, the story of the Stanford has a happy ending after all. It just goes to show what  million can do.\n\nBut no matter how high the price tag for the theatre’s restoration and operation, today the Stanford is one of \nPalo Alto’s treasures, sending lines of patrons around the block for “Casablanca,” “Citizen Kane” and the annual Christmas Eve showing of “It’s a Wonderful Life.”  Indeed, it’s the Stanford that gives Palo Alto the same kind of small-town charm that inspired George Bailey to run down Main Street calling out hellos to Bedford Falls.\n\nPhoto #1: 2008\nPhoto #2: 1925 on the night of the theatre\\'s opening\nPhoto #3: In 1985 showing Dance With Stranger\nPhoto #4: The interior in 1925\nPhoto #5: In the theatre in 2007\nPhoto #6: Savior David Woodley Packard\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh8n9td0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16255,37.44516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stapleton Florist","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0012_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0067.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/4115805385_4c6da49552_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Tiny, pink Stapleton Flowers nestled in between bigger buildings on Waverley was cherished by locals.

You can learn a lot about what this country has gone through by wandering through the narrow aisles of the Barbie Hall of Fame.\n\nIt\\'s all there. The Jackie Kennedy pillbox hats and bubble haircuts of the early 1960s, the hippie movement, the transition of women into the work force, the go-go 1980s, political correctness.

But in 1995, the City of Palo Alto tried to help its low-income residents by purchasing the hotel at a cost of 3 million dollars. The money spent was criticized by some, lauded by others. Years earlier, the hotel had been under the threat of becoming office space, which would have curtailed the amount of affordable housing in the city. After a 10 month renovation, the hotel reopened to the delight of its residents---who didn\\'t see their rent raised a penny.\n\nPhoto #1: The Barker Hotel in 2007 with Greg Brown\\'s mural on the side of the building.\nPhoto #2: The Barker Hotel in 1993 with Gelato Classico downstairs.\nPhoto #3: 1985.\nPhoto #4: Gelato Classico in the 1980s.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2she62gfn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16328,37.44513]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Barney Property","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/2/barneyprop645lyttca1915.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> The Barney Property circa 1915 before the construction of the Lytton School.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh80xgf3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.1580486,37.4511655853]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Bead shop (1982-2008)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/beead.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0072.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> The Bead Shop closed in 2008 although it still exists as an online outlet.

That would be Pericles (Perry to close friends), one of two donkeys who live at Bol Park and serve as would-be neighborhood mascots.\n\nDonkeys have lived in the 13 acre Bol Park since its farmland days in the Great Depression.  Originally full \nof apricot orchards and strawberry fields, the land also served as a donkey pasture.  It was then the \nproperty of Cornelius Bol, the long-time Stanford professor and inventor of the mercury vapor light who \nmoved to Palo Alto from his native Holland to escape the Nazis.  \n\nBol often allowed neighborhood kids to play with and even ride the seven donkeys that grazed the pasture in \nthose early days.  And if a group of donkeys would wander from the pasture and begin marching around the \nneighborhood in single file --- as they were apt to do --- local kids would round them up and lead them \nback to pasture.  It seems the donkeys have always been seen as community pets.\n\nPhoto #1: The donkeys are huge favorites with Barron Park children.\nPhoto #2: Mickey who became a Barron Park favorite even though he was known as the \"braying-est donkey this side of the Holy Land.\"  Mickey died in 1998.\nPhoto #3: Paul Wolff and Richard Placone posing with Negrita, the Gunn mascot in 1969.\nPhoto #4: The map\\'s author poses with Miner 49er.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shhhm7ip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.1386,37.40799]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Boy Scout Hall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/1_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> In the early part of the 20th Century, the Boy Scouts met here at Boy Scout Hall at 424 High Street.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh3xnkzp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.163956165,37.4443120214]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Boyce House (1883-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Although it has been modernized, this is one of Palo Alto\\'s earliest houses.

Louisa and Louis Jr. both died in infancy in \n1900 and 1901 and her second daughter Dorothea succumbed to pneumonia at the age of five in 1908.  \nHer third daughter Ruth was a bright and happy girl until she began suffering epileptic seizures at the age of \n12.  These retarded her mental development and left her as an invalid for the rest of her life.  Perhaps seeing \nher own children suffer helped inspire her to donate a place where the city’s children could discover the \nmagic of books.\n\nOf course, the city’s politicians very nearly blew it by looking the proverbial gift horse in the mouth.  One \ncity councilman said he liked Stern’s gift but that he expected her to also endow the Library for future \nstaffing costs as well.  Mrs. Stern was so taken aback, she withdrew the offer.  Soon, she would receive an \nanxious letter from the rest of the City Council apologizing and attempting to smooth Aunt Lucie’s rather \nruffled feathers.  Lesson Learned: When someone wants to give you a brand-new library for free, you don’t go asking if you could have a little more to man the circulation booth.\n\nEventually, amends were made and at a ceremony on September 14th, 1940, the library was officially \nbequeathed to the city on behalf of Mrs. Stern, by its designer --- famed local architect Birge Clark.\n\nNote: The library was renovated in 2007 and has recently opened in grand style.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh7sza17"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14517,37.44482]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Children's Theatre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/4/ctthenandnow.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/childrens1940.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/newadd5.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0061.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> In 1932, during those heady days of liberalism, The Children’s Theatre’s first play “The Perfect Gift” was \ncommissioned by the Mayor\\'s Committee for\nUnemployment Relief. By 1937, they had won their own \nvenue at 1305 Middlefield Road donated by generous Palo Alto benefactor Lucie Stern. A public theatre,  funded by government, had come to Palo Alto. Even today, funding for the Palo Alto Children\\'s Theatre comes from the city. The current budget is over a half a million dollars, plus use of the building, facilities and  utilities. Ticket prices are set by the City Council, and the money collected goes back to the city. Prices have \nbeen kept low ---  for adults and  for children --- making the Children\\'s Theatre an inexpensive  entertainment option for families.\n\nn the 1940’s, the Children’s Theatre became the pride of Palo Alto as none other than The New York Times published two articles on the organization. The Palo Alto Children\\'s Theatre was also featured in Life magazine that year --- it was supposed to be the cover story, but it was bumped by the bombing of Hiroshima and the end of World War II, an understandable editorial decision.  \n\nThe Children\\'s Theatre also had a half-hour weekly local radio show --- \"Under the Red Tile Roof\" --- in the 1940s, which drew national sponsorship. In the 1950s, the youth theater group performed \"Rumplestiltskin\" on KRON television in San Francisco.

The interior has the look and feel --- as well as hustle and bustle --- of a real fish market.  Its walls are adorned with fishing boat models, old photographs of fishermen standing proudly by their catch, and nautical ornaments of all shapes and sizes.  And with its open kitchen, oyster bar, cocktail bar and lounge area, a dinner at the Fish Market is as much of an experience as a way to fill an empty stomach.  However, the Fish Market is not just a concept restaurant --- it’s also the real deal.\n\nFounded in 1976, by an actual sport fisherman and a boat captain/gourmet cook, the Fish Market has always \nprided itself on its authenticity.  They own a federally-inspected seafood facility, Farallon Fisheries, an interest in an oyster farm in Puget Sound and even a couple of fishing boats, the Pilikia III and the Temptation.  And there is a real “market” in the restaurant where you can purchase raw fish to bring home to try your own hand in the seafood business.\n\nThis is the former location of Uncle John\\'s Pancake House.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh47v65e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.138945,37.421237]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Flint House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/for.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> An early photograph of the Flint family home at 1001 Forest Avenue (originally Forest Court), with the carriage house (1009 Forest Avenue) visible at the left.

During the Great Depression year of 1935, the church faced foreclosure, but white and Japanese neighbors help raise enough money to save it.  Palo Alto’s first historian, Guy Miller, called it “one of the city\\'s brightest brotherhood-in-action \nepisodes.”  The All Saint\\'s Episcopal Church --- which was predominately White --- sponsored numerous \nfund raising dinners to help retire the mortgage on the church.  The American Legion, Shriners, Kiwanis, and \nRotary Club also provided financial support and the media backed the effort in the form of Dallas E. Wood\\'s \n\"The Prowler\" column in the Times.  Eventually, accounts were established at all local banks for the AME \nZion so that contributions could be made.  On July 8, 1939 the mortgage was \"burned\" and the AME Zion \nwas saved.\n\nOf course, the church is also at the heart of two of Palo Alto’s less tolerant moments -- when the African-\nAmerican and Japanese-American residents were expelled from downtown Palo Alto.  During World War \nII, Japanese-Americans on Ramona Street lost their homes and were sent to internment camps.  During the \n1950s, African-Americans in the neighborhood were redlined into moving to East Palo Alto.  \nPhoto #1: Boarded up in 2006.\nPhoto #2: 1980s.\nPhoto #3: Up on stilts during renovation.\nPhoto #4: Ruth Anne Gray who fought \nto save the old church.\nPhoto #5: In the 1970s.\nVideo link: http://www.youtube.com/paweekly#p/u/42/dBKUYr8DCnc<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shdkbar6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15792,37.4428]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Free Reading Room  (1897-1904)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0080_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0021_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0002d.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0069_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Photo #1: At this location inside Simkins Stationary Store beginning in 1896, the first informal library began.

Beginning with 38 in start-up capital, the boys set to work in that one-car shed with a used Sears Craftsman drill press that Packard had lugged out from Schenectady in his car. Packard and his newly-wedded wife Lucile lived on the first floor of the house on Addison originally built for Palo Alto’s first mayor. The landlady (the mayor’s widow who charged just 45  bucks a months for rent) lived on the second floor and Bill in a little shack behind the house just big enough \nfor a cot and a sink.\n\nThe garage lit by a single, overhanging bare lightbulb, served as the research lab, development workshop and manufacturing plant for HP\\'s early products, including the Model 200A audio oscillator used to test sound quality in radio and TV.\n\nHewlett and Packard’s naming process show what an unseasoned enterprise it was. The boys flipped a coin to decide the name of the company and because Bill won, it was H-P that would one day be listed as a Blue \nChip stock on Wall Street, not P-H. For the name of the first oscillator, they chose the name Model 200A, rather than 100A, which might reveal the greenness of the company. And for the product’s original price, the boys chose 4.40, as in “54-40 or fight,” James Polk’s old presidential campaign slogan. These were truly the whims of business world newcomers.\n\nWhile some of their early clients were of the local variety---they helped invent a foot fault indicator for a San Mateo bowling alley---in 1939, HP gained a more prestigious client. They sold 8 of their audio oscillators to \nWalt Disney to test the state-of-the-art soundtrack for Fantasia. HP used those profits to move to a larger  space, at Page Mill Road, and hire a few employees. They were on the road to eventually establishing a 90 \nbillion dollar a year company with over 150,000 employees--- a company that is largely credited for laying the foundation for what would become Silicon Valley.\n\nPhoto #1: The HP Garage in early days.\nPhoto #2: The restored HP Garage.\nPhoto #3: Inside the restored house.\nPhoto #4: Packard with the oscillator. \nPhoto #5: Packard and Hewlett at their \ngarage before renovation.\nPhoto #6: The boys in earlier days.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shfiqxj0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.1548,37.44306]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Hotel President (1929-1968)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/hotelpres1930s1_451x365.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/hotelpres.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/hotelpreslobby.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0042_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> The Hotel President’s legacy dates back to 1929. Stanford’s Herbert Hoover was president and the brand \nnew hotel put up on University Avenue reflected the city’s pride in their local hero.  The Hotel President, \ndesigned by another local --- architect Birge Clark --- was six stories tall and contained 125 rooms.  Built in \nthat decade’s trendy Spanish Colonial Revival style, the Hotel President boasted a lush roof garden, a beautiful beamed ceiling lobby and a grand spiral staircase that climbed all the way to the top floor.  A brochure from the era, advertising the hotel’s “gracious living,” pointed to its “large, comfortably furnished guestrooms,” each of which had “outside exposure and a private bath.”  The hotel even featured in-room radio service, allowing guests to choose between channels as they showered, shaved, or relaxed in their suite.\n\nBut after decades as Palo Alto’s fashionable place to stay, the President began to falter in the 1950s as \nmore easily accessible competition began to sprout up along the edge of town.  And as downtown began to \nlose shoppers in the 1960s, Palo Alto’s leaders feared that University Avenue could suffer an economic \ncollapse.  Some of the policy changes they experimented with had a negative impact on the Hotel President.  For instance, the city’s brief experiment with making University Avenue a one way street hurt business at the hotel.  New signing restrictions were also detrimental, according to the owners at the time.  The Hotel President was forced to take down its enormous rooftop sign, making it more difficult for out-of-towners to find the hotel.\n\nAdditionally, the modernist mini-skyscraper built caddy-corner to the Hotel President at 525 University, demoted the hotel’s prominence on Palo Alto’s skyline.  It also suffered from the end of the Lark and the Daylight, Southern Pacific’s Los Angeles to San Francisco trains that once stopped the base of University Avenue --- and brought tourists to stay at the Hotel President.  \n\nAfter the hotel converted to studio apartments and became the “President Hotel Apartments,” a predictable \ndecline began.  Over the course of the next few decades, the building became a sad version of its former self.  As it aged, improvements were foregone and the rooms that were luxurious for 1930s guests, now seemed stiflingly confined and aged as modern-day apartments.  \n(PAHA Collection) <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shd4r0xf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.159235477,37.447895927]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Huttman House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/1026Webster597.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> The following is from the Centennial Buildings Tour:\n\"Identical to 1022 Webster, this home was possibly first occupied by D.C.

Paterson Ross for unofficial weatherman and official Stanford lecturer John Adams Squire, he a direct descendant of President John Adams.  The seven \nbedroom mansion was built for 6,000 (a whopping sum in 1904) and would survive the 1906 earthquake, \nnumerous termite invasions, and even the roller skating parties of the Squire girls.\n\nThe effort to save “the grand old lady” of University Avenue would mark the dawning of the preservation \nmovement in Palo Alto. 1969, Gail Woolley started her quest to save historic old homes in the city, \nauthoring a booklet called “Gone Tomorrow,” which told the stories of endangered Palo Alto houses. Her \ninvolvement soon broadened and she became a key player in the Palo Alto Historical Association’s fight to \nsave the Squire House from the wrecker’s ball.\n\nEventually Woolley (a future Palo Alto mayor herself) and the Association convinced the city to purchase the \nhouse for 0,000. There was a catch, however: they would have to raise the money to pay the city back \nwithin a year’s time. Woolley’s “Save the Squire House” committee went into fundraising overdrive.

But according to a Palo Alto Police report, “Intersections where panhandlers and \nsolicitors often stand have no higher rate of collisions” than any others. Furthermore, police found that of 88 \naccidents at these intersections, not one listed soliciting from medians as its cause. As opponent and \ncouncilmember Jim Burch argued, \"We\\'re singling out a dozen people in five locations and making a law \nagainst them. People who drive while talking on cell phones are a bigger hazard than the 12 to 14 people \nwho stand on medians.\"\n\nTime and time again, those in support of the bans argued that public safety was the issue.

In fact, original plans called for twin 15 story structures with a much larger central plaza featuring fountains, promenades and additional upper walkways.  But in the late 1960s and early ‘70s, anti-growth “residentialists” took control of the city and scuttled other proposed emblems of a growing downtown --- notably, an 18 story hospital project in 1970 and the twin-towered “Superblock” commercial project the following year.  By 1974, a residentialist-dominated Council had put a 50 foot height limit on all Palo Alto buildings.  Today the Palo Alto Office Center stands as a lonely, oversized monument to a path not taken, an alternate vision of what Palo Alto never became.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh9v28km"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15897,37.44878]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Pappas House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/141alma.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> The following is from the Historic Buildings Inventory as revised in 1985:\n\"This structure is important as an attractive remnant of a neighborhood now largely changed.

It signified a city at odds with itself over its attitude toward the homeless.\n\nPassed in March 1997 by a 7-2 vote after a long public debate in the media, opposition to the ban was \nheartfelt and angry. On the night Council finally took up the question, more than 50 people signed up to \nspeak against the ban and only 20 had finished before the meeting was adjourned due to the late hour.\n\nDefenders of the poor said the law was designed as an end-run around anti-panhandling laws, which have \nyet to be ruled constitutional---and to keep the homeless from tarnishing Palo Alto\\'s well-to-do image. The \nPolice and Chamber of Commerce said it was an issue of public safety. They argued that University Avenue \nhad become increasingly crowded, and teens and homeless sitting on the sidewalks were creating safety \nhazards, particularly for senior citizens. Homeless advocates countered frequently that the police could not \ncite a single documented incident of anyone tripping on another person downtown.\n\nFor the record, the law bans sitting or lying on a seven block stretch on University Avenue sidewalks \nbetween High and Cowper Streets from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. The sidewalk next to Lytton Plaza at University \nand Emerson Street was designated as an exception area to allow for any First Amendment speech activities \ninvolving sitting or lying.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shdr0umc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15921,37.4482]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Slonaker House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sh8vr5jy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15213,37.4408]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Sunbonnet House (1899-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0075.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/maybeck.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/Pro2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> \"Preeminent bohemian architect Bernard Maybeck, who also created the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, originally designed the cedar-shingled 1899 residence, located at 1061 Bryant St. The Sunbonnet House was one of Maybeck\\'s earliest works, and is believed to be the oldest still standing intact.\" -Palo Alto Weekly 8/4/04\n\nPhoto #1: The Sunbonnet House, date unknown.\nPhoto #2: Bernard Maybeck\nPhoto #3: 2006\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shg4nxru"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15475,37.44138]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Thoits Building","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/facebook.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/1292.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/1/IMG0031.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Thoits Building was one of Facebook\\'s Palo Alto locations until recently.

Buddy Rich, Van Morrison, jazz duo Tuck and Patti, and Count Basie all played there. The \ntheatre operated until July of 1994.\n\nThat year a \"Save the Varsity Committee\" was formed in an attempt to find a group willing to put up the -8 \nmillion dollars to save the theatre. At the first City Council meeting devoted to the subject, there were so many \nspeakers ready to speak for saving the Varsity that the meeting was essentially fillibustered. Many speakers aimed to have the city purchase the building to become a Perfoming Arts center, but neither the city nor a benefactor (such as David Packard who stepped forward to save The Stanford down the street) appeared on The Varsity\\'s behalf.\n\nWhile the committee lost the war, it was instrumental in winning the battle of saving the outward Mission Revival \nstyle courtyard and the Varsity marquee. Keenan did basically start anew inside the theatre, converting the theater into a 23,000-square-foot, two-story bookstore and espresso cafe.\n\nPhoto #1: In 1985 featuring the Uptones and Zusu Pitts.\nPhoto #2: The Varsity Theatre in 1970 with \"Love Story\" on the marquee.\nPhoto #3: Circa 1930.\nPhoto #4: In the 1970s featuring Timber Creek.\nPhoto #5: In 2008 as Borders Books &amp; Music.\nPhoto #6: Late in its life, the Varsity Theatre was turned into a restaurant, bar and theatre and re-named the \"New Varsity.\"\nPhoto #7: The New Varsity\\'s restaurant area was in the courtyard.

Thiele, the owner of a fallen building that stood in ruins just across the tracks from the University Avenue Southern Depot train station.  This disquieting visage led many out-of-town travelers to believe that Palo Alto had fared much worse than it had during the earthquake --- a perception problem that eventually prompted the city to take matters into their own hands.  On June 4th, with the building still in shambles, the city ordered workers to clear the debris on the street and throw it back onto the Thiele property at “the owner’s \nexpense.”  The Palo Alto Promotion Committee was even planning to erect a large signboard blocking the \nunsightly building from the view of commuters when the wreckage was finally cleared up by the owner.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shfgvjzw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.164583802,37.4440799028]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thoits Shoe Store (1891-ca. 1948)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/IMG0022_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/2/81.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/4/IMG0032_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/01/3/thoits1940est1889.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Thoits Shoe Store was a mainstay along Palo Alto\\'s University Avenue.

In 1959, Rev. Docia with the support of her visionary congregants began plans for the building of a church facility. Under her leadership, a church was built at 3391 Middlefield Rd., Palo Alto. This continues as our site to this day. \n\nAn interesting anecdote is that during the initial construction phase, the church was turned down by several financial institutions for a needed loan of 0,000. Rev. Docia secretly wrote a check for 0,000 to the church, signed it “God,” and put it in her desk where it lay forgotten. Some time later, a loan officer from a local Savings and Loan, reviewing the loan application, was very skeptical and said, “I don’t know how much money you anticipated but all we could loan you would be 0,000.” \n\nIn 1967, Dr. Raymond Lilley, a Religious Science minister, became the spiritual leader.

The Southern Pacific Railroad, then still going strong as a popular way to travel the country’s western coast, \ndecided to replace Palo Alto’s aging depot with a sleek, modern station worthy of the city’s hard-earned hub status.  The new station was constructed in the ultra-hip “Streamline Moderne” style, a look that raced with the energy of a new age and looked toward the machines of the future.  It turned out to be an ironic twist.  While the station’s architecture may have spoken to modernity, the transportation it served would soon nearly become a relic of the past.  \n\nPhoto #1: The train station in 2008.\nPhoto #2: The station soon after opening in 1941.\nPhoto #3: Third-party Presidential candidate John Anderson is speaking to a large crowd from the rear of a railroad car.\nPhoto #4: Commuters wait for the Southern Pacific.

Founded in 1966 by Aaron Manganiello, the originally Latino left-wing protest organization was named for Che Guevera’s battle cry, “We will prevail!”   \nBy 1970, Venceremos had evolved into a multicultural Maoist/Communist revolutionary brigade that was a \nmainstay at any mid-Peninsula protest in those years.  Under the leadership of Stanford Professor and \nMelville scholar H. Bruce Franklin (fired in 1972 for leading a student takeover of the university’s computer \nlab), Venceremos took an active role in community issues and demonstrations.  \n\nAnd these guys weren’t fooling around.  Venceremos believed that “an unarmed people are subject to \nslavery at any time” and held vast amounts of weaponry to back it up.  They had secret stashes of rifles, \ngrenades, pipe bombs, and other explosives and they urged members to stay armed at all times --- advice \nthat was apparently followed.  With their rifle logo and violent rhetoric, Venceremos startled the local \npopulation and caught the eye of federal law enforcement.  Many believed they were one of the largest revolutionary groups in the country and a 1972 House Internal Security Committee Report called the group “a potential threat to the United States.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shawu9zd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.152358294,37.4473678281]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ventura Avenue","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> This street was originally named San Buenaventura but the U.S. Post Office concluded that name was \"too long to write and too difficult to pronounce.\" \n\nSource: Streets of Palo Alto<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2shhmg0w8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.128400803,37.4188108688]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ventura Elementary School (1968)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2010/02/0/ventura68.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Ventura Elementary School as seen in 1968.

Lou Rapp attended night classes at Palo Alto High School and learned how to build lawn furniture, make wallpaper, and landscape the family\\'s back yard. \"He was a hard-working man,\" he said.\n\nWithin a year, Rapp left Walster\\'s and went into business under his own name, opening Rapp\\'s Shoes right next door. Striving for a child-friendly store, Rapp built a model railroad, bolted a playground giraffe to the floor, gave a half-dozen birds luxurious housing in a parakeet castle, and taught the store\\'s myna bird, Mike, to speak eight sentences, including \"I like Rapp\\'s.\"\n\nRapp made sure every child left the store with a balloon and let little girls choose from his selection of \"diamond\" rings. \"He\\'d bawl out a salesman for not giving a child a balloon or a diamond ring,\" recalled Roxy, \"but never for missing a sale.\" If customers couldn\\'t afford new shoes, Rapp often gave them shoes for free.\n\n\"He never took advantage of people,\" said Roxy, who lives in Portola Valley. \"It was very important to him to take care of customers. He knew what it was to be poor, to hurt and struggle, so he was always very generous--even when he couldn\\'t afford it.\"\n\nRapp\\'s constant, melodic whistling as he walked to work earned him the nickname \"the Whistler\" from neighborhood fans. Rapp was also known as \"Fabulous Lou\" and \"the Unofficial Mayor\" for his enthusiastic greeting of University Avenue patrons.\n\n\"He always had a full head of hair, a good tan and the wildest clothes--the brightest ties, the wildest shirts and suits,\" said Roxy.

As a young man \nduring World War II, he won the nation’s highest civilian honor for discoveries that saved thousands of \nlives.  In 1956, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of the transistor, a device that either \nmade possible or greatly improved nearly every modern gadget we use today.  He then moved west and \nstarted the company that became the catalyst for the rise of Silicon Valley.  He was even named one of the \n100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time Magazine in 1999.\n\nAnd yet despite this resume of accomplishment and his indisputable intelligence, William Shockley always \nseemed to find a way to allow his personality to spoil his own success.  Throughout his 79 years, Shockley \nthrew tantrums, fought petty disputes and turned his friends into enemies.  He divorced his first wife, severed relations with his children and forced his brightest employees to leave his company and outshine him elsewhere.  Finally, as an angry and bitter man in his retirement years, Shockley became the champion of an \nangry and bitter theory.  His association with it would bring him scorn, ridicule and deep contempt from the \nscientific community and the broader public.
