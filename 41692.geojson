One problematic feature of Platial seems to be entering something like &amp;quot;Cameron Parish, Louisiana&amp;quot; gives me nothing.\n\nThus, the report's typography of development is a little more tricky since I must ultimately &amp;quot;pin&amp;quot; one spot.  It is hard to specify regions.  Will this drastically affect the credibility of my mashup?  Ideally, I would like to color the pins depending on the state of recovery and then label the pin with the area that the pin is meant to refer to.   \n\nHere is the list of areas and their classifications:\n• Areas that are struggling—New Orleans and Cameron and St. Bernard parishes in Louisiana, Hancock (Waveland and Bay St. Louis) and Harrison (Biloxi and Gulfport) counties in Mississippi, and Bayou La Batre in Alabama\n• Areas that are rebounding—Lake Charles and Jefferson Parish in Louisiana, Jackson County (Pascagoula) in Mississippi, and Mobile in Alabama\n• Areas that are growing—East Baton Rouge and St. Tammany parishes in Louisiana, Jackson, Hattiesburg, and Laurel in Mississippi, and Gulf Shores in Alabama\n\nThe report can be accessed at www.rockinst.org/gulfgov.  The report was put out by group called GulfGov who is co-sponsored by the  Rockefeller Institute of Government and Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"growing -
