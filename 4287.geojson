This data is current as of September 2 2008, and is made available from NOAA. \n\nThe NHC official track forecast in shapefile format is an experimental products that the National Hurricane Center is testing during the 2008 hurricane season.  \nThis product will aid in the visualization of an NHC official track forecast, the forecast points are connected by black line segments.  The track line(s) are not a forecast \nproduct, however, and because there are an infinite number of ways to connect a set of forecast points, the lines should not be interpreted as representing a specific forecast \nfor the location of a tropical cyclone in between official forecast points.  It is also important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, \nand that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the center.\n\nThe NHC official track forecast in shapefile format is intended to aid in the visualization of an NHC official track forecast","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"STORMNUM":{"max":8.0,"mean":8.0,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":8.0,"median":8.0},"FCSTPRD":{"max":120.0,"mean":96.0,"variance":1152.0,"stdev":33.9411254969543,"min":72.0,"median":120.0}},"features":[{"properties":{"STORMNUM":8.0,"STORMNAME":"HANNA","STORMTYPE":"TS","BASIN":"al","TIMEZONE":"UTC","ADVDATE":"080902/1800","FCSTPRD":72.0,"id":"a66xa6zatuv0","ADVISNUM":"23A","ISSSTATUS":"O"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-72.9000015258789,20.6000003814697],[-73.6999969482422,21.3999996185303],[-74.1999969482422,22.2999992370605],[-75.3000030517578,23.6000003814697],[-76.8000030517578,25.1000003814697],[-80.5,29.5]]}},{"properties":{"STORMNUM":8.0,"STORMNAME":"HANNA","STORMTYPE":"TS","BASIN":"al","TIMEZONE":"UTC","ADVDATE":"080902/1800","FCSTPRD":120.0,"id":"a66xa72a9cl5","ADVISNUM":"23A","ISSSTATUS":"O"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-72.9000015258789,20.6000003814697],[-73.6999969482422,21.3999996185303],[-74.1999969482422,22.2999992370605],[-75.3000030517578,23.6000003814697],[-76.8000030517578,25.1000003814697],[-80.5,29.5],[-80.0,36.5],[-70.0,45.5]]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgisprods.shtml","metadata":"","contact_name":"National Hurricane Center","contact_address":"11691 SW 17th St.\nMiami, FL 33178\nUSA","source":"NOAA - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","contact_phone":"305-229-4400"},"source":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgisprods.shtml","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":2,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"hanna,hazard,hurricane,storm,weather","published":"2008-09-02T12:00:00Z","id":4287}
