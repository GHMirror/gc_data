The bodies were taken to the district hospital mortuary.\r\r\r\rHundreds of houses and other property valued at millions of shillings were destroyed by arsonists while hundreds of families were displaced in a five-day orgy of violence.\r\r\r\rThe violence targeting mainly one community was perpetrated by groups of youths armed with bows and arrows as well as other weapons.\r\r\r\rOn Friday, 47 bodies were lying at the Nakuru municipal council mortuary, while 30 others were at the Molo district hospital hospital mortuary.\r\r\r\rThe bodies of three other people who died while undergoing treatment were at the Rift Valley provincial general hospital morgue.

[Muyela is a lawyer in Nakuru who we met through Davis Weddi in Uganda] It was not an easy call. It was easier than some because I found him easier to understand than some, but at the time that I called, his deep discouragement and sense of hopelessness about the situation in Kenya was palpable. His first words were, \"We are fine.\" But then he let his guard down about his deep disappointment in the government and the systemmatic discouragement of dialogue. He says the government leadership is more interested in power than peace, and that it is not going to be sustainable. He wishes the government would acknowledge realities. He says this country is angry and he fears the international community will lose interest. He fears the government will lose the police. \"It's unnecessary,\" he says. \"It could be arrested... What are people going to do? ...They're rights have been ignored. ...People can't stay where their rights are being ignored... Police can't solve the problem... The police have been shooting people with live bullets...This country is angry.\" I asked how the international community can help? At that question, his mood became grim. He fumbled for an answer. \"We are confused...We were very hopeful that we were moving on a democratic path.\" The one thing that gives him hope is when the media comes. I sent my blessings and my love. He asked me if I was a Christian. I told him I was. He said firmly, \"Pray for us.\" I said I would and that I pray for everyone there everyday.

The area has been badly affected by the post election violence. Though again Kuresoi has been a no go zone even before the general elections during the campaigns leading to elections and historical Kuresoi has been associated with a lot of tribal fighting during the election in 1992, 1997 and 2002 affecting Molo town, and some parts of Nakuru town. \r\r\r\rPersonally I have been involved in youth peace rallies in the area by organizing youth forums and sporting events under the banner of youths for peaceful and democratic election just before the general elections the situation was tensed with homes being touched by the Kelenjin fighters.\r\rWhen I called Victor Achami one of the long term peace cruder in the area at night he hard to lock himself in the house before communicating through the phone, we talked for about 2hours on phone. Achami is a resident of Kuresoi for a long time with the experience of the place he was able to report the following shocking findings to me. \r\r\r\rOn phone Achami told me that confirmed deaths in Kuresoi is 26 people though most of the deaths have not been confirmed because the Kelenjin fighters do not leave their own behind even if one is dead or injured, so Achami says that there are more deaths that have not been reported. Some people have died because of injuries sustained during the fighting and buried without the knowledge of the government.  Another shocking report I got is that most of the Kelenjin fighter’s are children between the ages of 14 and 16 who are actually still in primary school. The oldest among the fighters is 25. This is bad news because it reflects the emergence of child solders in Kenya which is totally a new phenomenon to this country.  Involving children in such conflict may develop into long term conflict between them and other non Kalenjin community. \r\r\r\rAfter facilitating Achami with phone credit He was able to communicate to 10 Kelenjin fighters in the bush. The only problem he told me is that the fighters do not disclose information about what and why they are fighting yet they are saying that they are not willing to give up the fight until the non-Kelenjins leave Kuresoi. He has also been in talks with the provincial administration to hold community peace meetings with the elders because the elders play a major role of instructing and financing the young fighters, the District Commissioner has promised to speared head the talks thanks to the small money I got from Dennis. The situation can be salvaged through intensive outreach in the areas to all the affected areas.\r\r\r\r\r\rShocking enough is that the fighters get man power support and boost from the community members who offer to transport fighters from Bomet, Transmara, Kilgoris, and Kipkeleon.  Kalenjin fighters travel all the way from the above area to give support to their brothers in Kuresoi; this has made the situation difficult to manage because of the movement of the fighters traveling as far as Kericho to Kuresoi.     \r\r   \r\rAchami is very gratefully of the initiative being conducted by the Dennis and Friends which has enabled him to reach to 10 Kalenjin fighters effectively and he is welling to do more, though access to communication apart from the phone is difficult because of the situation on the ground. Achami has promised to reach out to more Kelenjin fighters in the region. He will be sending me phone numbers of the fighters so that I can also talk to then directly and if possible travel to Kuresoi and meet them personally.

Then they broke into rented off campus houses of students.\r\r \r\rA crowd of about 1,000 people surged to the university gate and wanted to storm the university. They demanded that all Kikuyus, Kambas, Meru, and Kisii people leave the university within two hours. That was the only way to save the university from being stormed. They remained at the gate until it would be seen done. About three armed policemen arrived and spent time negotiating with the crowd. Finally the police advised us to evacuate the named ethnic groups.

The local chose to remain anonymous for safety reasons. The video that was broadcast showed an innocent man in either Dandora/Huruma being hacked to death for no apparent reason other than his appearance or possible political leanings. The video included here has video of clashes with police as well as other victims of the violence who narrate their ordeal. The video of the murder showed faces of witnesses who saw the murder take place and potentially also could be used to identify the murderers involved. There is a great probability that despite the availability of this evidence and potentially more recorded evidence of similar murders, that this evidence could go unattended to. Neil Connery is still reporting from Nairobi and it is likely that he would be inclined to protect the anonymity of his source while also help solve this murder and possibly others than have taken place. If Neil leaves Kenya without sharing more information there is a possibility that this evidence could be lost and the opportunity to seek justice or involve the appropriate authorities also lost.

This is based on my personal conversations with a number of leaders and grassroots NGOs in Nairobi and working in rural areas, today - Friday Jan 12.\r\r\r\rHello all,\r\r\r\rI am in Nairobi for just 1.5 days, but had chance today to speak to some key people involved in responding to crisis in Kenya. Today the situation is calm, but there is obvious concern and great nervousness about today's announcement that the opposition will go forward with rallies across  the country next week. This is when students are back in school, and often the student protests are violent. So women's groups are asking a key question: How can they learn from past two weeks and try to mitigate/prevent further attacks on women and children/service gaps due to displacement, etc? \r\r\r\rFirst the women's leadership response: \r\rI spoke to women from Urgent Action Fund who were meeting at the hotel I am staying in. They included Ann Njogu, Vicky Karimi, many of the key human rights organizations. They have drafted and will issue (may have done so by now) a strong statement about peace-building and the response of women to the violence and the need of government to take actions to protect civilians.\r\r\r\rMany of the people I spoke to today seem to consider that police and militia (loose gangs affilicated with diff ethnic groups) are responsible for the violence.. in other words, it's targeted and much is caused by the police. This is an important thing I learned.\r\r\r\rI spoke to Millicent Obasa of CARE who formed Concerned Women for Kenya, a loose group that went around to intervene and find raped women and helped get them into groups and into care if needed. This new group remains very active around the sexual violence issue.\r\r\r\ri also spoke and met with Rebecca Owiti of WOFAK, the voluntary home-based care worker in Kayole estate, a slum area with many WOFAK members with HIV. I provided her with some supplies and got an update about WOFAK. She reports that most of the WOFAK members now can access ARVs, but food remains the critical challenge. As many of you know, Rebecca's husband was killed and she is left with three one-year old triplets. Her own personal needs are high, so please, if you can, reach out to support her.\r\r\r\rWe talked about the possibility of positive women in diff groups documenting this period, for a possible report at the Mexico AIDS conference. This will be discussed in coming weeks. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe ARV situation: The National AIDS Council members and key NGOs met yesterday and have done a situation assessment of HIV services, and put diff groups in place to try to respond. The main issue is not that ARVs are lacking at public health centers in Nairobi, but that people cannot access them or could not when the violence was ongoing. So there are people who have not gotten ARVs because they were due to return, but many people get a one-month supply so this issue - in Nairobi - may not be as serious re treatment interruption as some worried. \r\r\r\rThat said, many people were unable to access medicine, or were displaced during the recent violence, and many are in Internally Displaced Camps where they may not have easy access to ARVs for many reasons. They need their medical records re ARV tx, and provide evidence of their need, etc. so are challenges. But there are ARVs - it's just a question of how to get people to the clinics.\r\r\r\rMSF is active, and has been going into poorer communities, to try to assess the problem. I spoke with Monique Tondoi and Ian Van Engelgem, program coordinator for MSF in Kenya. They find that it's difficult to know how many or /why people have not come for ARV services, but this is an impt issue going foward: how to create better linkages in the slums, so people can keep accessing ARVs. Today I met the HIV coordinator for MSF and his main colleagues who are involved in treatment education. There is broad acknowledgement that the situation in rural Kenya is very different from Nairobi. Re how to improve access, we talked about one strategy: to more actively map which groups like WOFAK and KENWA are active in which areas,  and establish active contact or better direct linkages between MSF or doctors at the clinics providing ARVS and the NGO home-based care workers/ key social workers, especially home-based care outreach workers.\r\r\r\rRe PEP, there were very few requests for PEP, and to date MSF has offered ARV to 59 people. They do not know what is happening outside with other groups, but this is their figure. PEP is available, but the issue is: no women are demanding it. The reasons are outlined below. The issue of stigma of rape is a factor to consider.. going forward: where do women feel SAFE to receive emergency services. Some would suggest h aving the rape crisis counselors be in the NGOs where the women feel safe. They may continue to avoid rape centers or hospital due to stigma.\r\r\r\rScope of Rape/Sexual Assaults: The newspapers yesterday reported 1200 rape cases in recent post-election violence, but the general estimate I heard today from the HIV crowd and the women at Nairobi Women's Hospital is that  REPORTED cases  are 1600 women and children - and also men. But these are the reported cases. WOFAK, CARE, Urgent Action, MSF and officials at the Nairobi Women's Hospital acknowledged that typically women who showed up talked about how many women they had left behind in their areas who were raped and staying in their homes. \r\r\r\rThe majority of rapes are gun shots. But so far,there are few cases requiring fistula surgery in Nairobi hospital to date. \r\r\r\rThere is a high % of rape of younger girls/children. BEFORE this wave of violence, the Nairobi Women's Hospital had 45% of their rape cases involving young children. In recent weeks, they had somewhere around 70 people, but they know that this is not right. For this reason, they have opened four rape crisis centers in slum neighborhoods, and are working actively to get into houses to find where women and children are keeping refuge, and also looking at the IDP camps. The food and access to waterneeds at IDP camps are severe.\r\r\r\rI met Charlene Smith this afternoon, working with Urgent Action. She had prepared a small questionnaire- sort of a check list of questions related to sexual violence - for the IDP camp workers as there is no protocol /document in place to know what /where people who experienced sexual violence have gone for help etc. She hopes to refine this document.\r\r\r\rActions: I reviewed the protocol at Nairobi Women's Hospital for rapid reponse to sexual assault. I also shared the modules I had with me developed for Rwanda by WE-ACTx on Trauma, Managing PTSD reactions, and mental health , using base source materials from Hesperian foundation and other health educators. I also shared a new legal advocacy handbook based on telling people about their basic rights related to health care. We also talked about the need - and gap - of integrating a legal /human rights documentation aspect to the rapid response protocol so there is a body of evidence gathered when women show up at clinics to help them later.  These documents were strongly welcomed. \r\r\r\rWe talked about integrating a few questions related to the essentials that shou;ld be asked by doctors/staff at clinics/IDP camps. I suggested a possible template questionnaire that could be created now and widely dispersed, shared with NGO staff /communtiy outreach workers going into homes, in order to standardize/document the info being collected, so this can be of use in future possible legal advocacy. The key issue is providing the grassroots and home based care workers with tools, as these are the contact people for women/children in their homes.\r\r\r\rNEEDS: The Kenyan women are interested in anyone who has a protocol for rapid reponse that is for communty /local outreach workers use, and might include the few things one would want to ask/document to help provide an evidence base for the crime of rape. So if you have this, please contact me off the ITPC list, and I will pass on to the different contacts who are looking for other examples out there. \r\r\r\rIf any of you are in Botswana, where I know there is a multiservice rape center serving all NGOS in an area, we would like to learn from that model and share with Kenyans. \r\r\r\rThis picture above relates primarkly to urban Nairobi. In rural areas, the situation is very different, and quite bad. There are many people in IDP camps, and displacement and FOOD needs remain urgent. There is little info related to demand for or provision of PEP. In general, MSF and providers suggest that IF women come to report a rape, it is often after the 72 hour period. \r\r\r\rThe other NEED: modules for Trauma support for CHILDREN and FAMILIES. This includes any interventions aimed at the schools, in order to help the children who have been attacked reintegrate or be supported in school.\r\r\r\rIn Migori, Leah Okeyo, who joined me in Nairobi today, outlined a difficult situation where people are afraid to travel outside of certain areas. The issue of insecurity made it difficult  for people to seek medical services.\r\r\r\rThere, ARV access was disrupted at district hospitals. Staff were sent home and people in one HIV ward were sent home as there was no way to protect them. At St. Joseph's Mission hospital, services were open but people were not coming to get HIV drugs due to insecurity.\r\r\r\rLeah also suggested that medical providers give more than months supply of ARVS, to avoid the problem of interruption. But MSF staff felt that, as much as this might be a good step, it did not fit in with the Kenyan protocol of monitoring ARV use, so was unlikely to happen.\r\r\r\rNEEDS:\r\r\r\rThe Nairobi Women's Hospital needs the following things urgently. Some of them (non medicine) can be directed to the Red Cross, which is working with them. These items include antibiotics, blankets, clothes, and food - and of course, funding to meet the increase in service delivery.\r\r\r\rThe hospital and the rape crisis centers and IDP camps are also in urgent need of: women's sanitary  pads (Always brand is most popular), or if not available, tampons, and women's underwear. These can be directed to the women's hospital Sexual Violence Unit. They also need basins for water and cloths at the IDP camps.\r\r\r\rVolunteers: there are plenty of doctors who have responded to the crisis in Kenya, but there is an urgent need for trained trauma counselors, and those with rape crisis program implementation. \r\r\r\rI discussed the strategy of having a mobile corps of trained trauma counselors who could rapidly train outreach workers at community based NGOs like WOFAK to help them support the women and families where sexual assault has happened. This idea was welcomed and actively discussed. To date, there are some trauma counselors in Kenya, but at NWN and in other agencies, the general feeling is that there hasn't been this level of need and the sexual violence hasn't been related to political violence in the way it is now, creating different dimensions.\r\r\r\rThere is also a need for Child-based best practice initiatives to learn from that could help with the children who have suffered these physical attacks.\r\r\r\rThe other issue is that the FOLLOW UP of clients is not as clear. They work with NGOs, but there hasn't yet been a strategy of referring people into support groups or creating support groups for the children, families, parents - this is a next step. I shared what the groups in DRC and elsewhere have done that I know about, and the WE-ACTx model. Again, there is a desire to learn from what others out there have done in similar situations of war.\r\r\r\rGoing forward: there is a plea for the global HIV community, for groups and leaders to SPEAK OUT, loudly, and  to please do so IN SUPPORT of the Kenyan women.. but not just to issue statements from NY and do nothing more.\r\r\r\rThere is an urgent plea from some Kenyan women leaders for us to ACT by coming to Kenya: for world and women leaders with experience in peace-making to COME here and meet with political and civil society leaders, to provide support to women leaders and the NGOs, to bring resources and share field strategies  - in an effort to avert further violence. There has been criticism of politicians who have come in and flown out after failing to mediate, and a request for those with experience in peace-making, and disaster response, to help in Kenya.\r\r\r\rI will keep you posted on other developments.\r\r\r\rFinally, I suggested to some pf the women leaders /colleagues that they consider setting up a website or central list to centralize and share  updates, needs and strategies. I think this will happen, and be discussed tomorrow a.m., and I will keep this list informed. \r\r\r\rFYI: Leah Okeyo has started a discussion group on PulseWire to talk about how to help network and support Kenyan women. If you wish to join, go to www.beta.pulsewire.net and use the password: voices. After signing in, go to Community in the navigation bar, and you will find the Join a Group link. You will be notified of any new comment. Leah is actively inviting Athena, ICW, ITPC and PATAM members to provide their views to her, and suggestions for how to address future challenges around ARV access.\r\r\r\rFinally, I interviewed with Ann Njogu, a lawyer who ran for Parliament recently,  and a  well known human rights figure. She talked passionately about the need to promote the fact that Kenya has a Sexual Offences Act, has a Constitution, and that everyone must promote upholding of the rule of law in Kenya. There were other discussions, including the need to immediately mobilize more stakeholders in diff communities, including prominent male leaders, to speak out against the sexual violence which is being carried out a lot at the police, and  for this to possibly happen via PSAs on radio and television. \r\r\r\rWithin all of this, groups like CARE are active, hoping to fund any new activities and help map and assess the situation. AMPATH is also active and has mapped who is doing what, esp outside the capital and major cities.\r\r\r\rSo, having summed this up, my suggestion for those of you reading this is to take a small action this weekend: on behalf of your organization, let the GOR Kenya know that govt has a role to protect civiliians from sexual violence, that police must respect the law, that your groups support democratic rule in Kenya, and speak in solidarity with women's groups.\r\r\r\r-Anne-christine d’Adesky, co-Founder, WE-ACTx\r\rwww.we-actx.org\r\rweactx@gmail.com","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"included in report","incident_time_h":"2","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"YES","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Jan 12 - update on ARV  and rape services /needs","id":"a64aghwfmpio","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"NO","active":"YES","sender_name":"Anne-christine d'Adesky","image_5":null,"news_link":"personal reporting by AIDS NGO director visiting Nairobi","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"am","location":"country report"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"00","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"YES","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"1/11/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"NO","riots":"YES","incident_date":"12/30/07","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"In Burnt Forest - so named because its evergreen trees were felled and burned to create farms when Kikuyus settled there in the mid-1960s - Kalenjin youths came within minutes of the announcement that Kibaki was the winner on Dec. 30.\r\r\r\r\"They were just in the shopping centres around and within 10 minutes, they were running back with bows and arrows and pangas (machetes),\" said Steve Ndung'u, a Burnt Forest native who worked as an election official.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"Harun Njoya","incident_time_h":"6","verified":"NO","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":"Steve Ndung'u (ECK Official)","rape":"NO","looting":"YES","longitude":null,"column_1":"Commencement of Clashes in Burnt Forest","id":"a64aghkutlrk","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"YES","active":"YES","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":"africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnHUL081420.html","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"pm","location":"Burnt Forest"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":"Mwangi (deceased)","govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"18","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"YES","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"1/11/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"NO","riots":"YES","incident_date":"1/1/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"Daniel Kibigo said he was there, hiding in the burned cornfields nearby, as the mob gleefully stuffed mattresses in front of the church’s doors and set them on fire. \r\r\r\rHe watched women try to claw their way out of the church windows as if they were drowning as the building burned all the way down, with up to 50 people inside.\r\r\r\r“We couldn’t do anything; there were too many,” he said of the crowd that descended on the church in the paroxysm of ethnic violence that has gripped Kenya since its deeply flawed elections last week.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"John Njoroge","incident_time_h":"5","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":"Daniel Kibigo","rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Witnesses to Church Burning at Kiambaa Village","id":"a64aghmzklh9","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":"James Kimemia","deaths":"YES","active":"YES","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":"www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/world/africa/03kenya.html?ex=1357102800&amp;en=f01b9fec7d381631&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"pm","location":"Kiambaa Village"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"YES","incident_time_m":"00","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"YES","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"1/11/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"YES","riots":"YES","incident_date":"1/9/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"Mutula Kilonzo narrates in an interview the attack on his farm in Molo, his conversation with a Father in Eldoret on the church burning, the plight of 15000 displaced persons camped at Kapsabet Police Station while surrounded by armed raiders, the destruction of bridges near the Police Station and the eventual evacuation of the displaced persons by the Army, the actions of raiders at Baraton University.

The fuel is still expensive, making everything more difficult. Even the buses are too expensive. He traveled very far from his home in Homa Bay today all the way to Kisumu and Oyugis. He says things are coming back to normal, but some are still suffering. \r\r \r\rWhen I asked how we could best help him, he said his kids were suffering from malaria and needed drugs. The weather changes have been hard on them. They need some more air time as well. They are ok with food for just a few days. \r\r \r\rAlso, along with his personal needs, he has overwhelming concern for those who are at the police station with no food because they can't get out.

Its destination was Mombasa. But as it sits at a parking yard on Kirinyaga Road in Nairobi, it is obvious that it did not make it. \r\r-\r\rOn reaching Litein, however, he was again stopped and warned that Kaplong, a few kilometres ahead was also a no-go zone. He diverted again. But just a few kilometres from Litein, he came face-to-face with what he had been trying to avoid. A group of men armed with stones and pangas had placed a roadblock on the way.  \r\r\r\r“I was stopped and told to open the door while the passengers were ordered to alight with their identity cards raised. I knew so many of us would die then,” narrated the disturbed driver. \r\r\r\rBut as the commander of the rowdy group talked to Mr Karuri, other members of his gang were piling old tyres under the bus in preparation to set it on fire. \r\r-\r\rSix kilometres to Bomet Town, Mr Karuri and his passengers saw what they feared would be their end. Electricity poles, large metal tanks and boulders were spread across the road. Tens of men wielding pangas stood by the road, ready to attack. \r\r\r\r“I stopped the bus about 100 metres from the barrier. The passengers were screaming, some were praying. We could not run over it.” \r\r\r\rSuddenly, the gang ahead started approaching the bus. We were surrounded. I knew nothing but a miracle would save them. And indeed a miracle happened. Three Land Rovers with armed police men emerged from the opposite direction and started shooting in the air. \r\r\r\rThe policemen managed to temporarily disperse the attackers and clear the road for the bus, which at that point had been reduced to an ugly metal shell. Almost all its windows were shattered. \r\r- \r\r“Even with two police vehicles escorting us, we still suffered stone missiles hurled at us along the way,” Mr Karuri recalls.  \r\r\r\rAt Narok, those with injuries were taken to a hospital where they were treated and discharged.

All prayers and songs ought to be encouraging those who are acting within the law and civility to see to it that this happens. \r\r\r\rPrayer and music ought to be educating all those who are keen on breaking the law by destroying other people’s property to desist and instead refocus their energies on the public enemy of the time. \r\r\r\rKenyans do not need music reminding them of patriotism, they need music to urge on the fight against tyranny of the few against the majority.\r\r\r\rWe do not need to pray for peace, we need to pray for those who are genuinely fighting the dictatorship of a few elite against the will of the Kenyan people. \r\r\r\rEngaging in musical bands for peace is to seek cheap publicity at the expense of the lives and property of innocent civilians. \r\rWhat we need now are liberation songs. Songs such as Bob Marley’s “Stand up for your rights.” \r\r\r\rWe need songs to make those who might have misplaced anger to direct it against the actual public enemy…theft of people’s will. That is not similar to singing for peace while camouflaging and sugar coating tyranny. \r\r\r\rThe Kenyan song ought to be “don’t sit back and hope for the best, get rid of the individual tyrants… don’t allow them to hide behind tribal masks.”\r\r\r\rWill prayer restore the Kenyan republic? Not at the tenor it has assumed. \r\r\r\rIf Kenyans simply pray for peace and attain artificial normalcy, chances are that they will be giving more time for enemies of the republic to simply restock their powder keg reserves. \r\r\r\rKenyans prayed in 1988, 1990 – 92, and in 1997. The year 2002 offered an opportunity to help actualize the 14-year prayer wishes. It became clear that we were on a roller coaster to strife after six months.\r\r\r\r A leading anti corruption czar,  John Githongo fled the country; this was simply wished away. Kenyans held a government sanctioned prayer for peace after the referendum and buried under the carpet what the will of the people had stated by voting against a state sponsored constitution.\r\r\r\rAs middle class, we might retreat to our restaurants and sip cold drinks. We might even have passports to flee if the red ambers of public anger catch up with us. \r\r\r\rYes, we might even choose to simply engage in intellectual talk about the situation and position ourselves for jobs in either of the two warring factions. \r\rBut we must remember that our drivers, watchmen, cooks, house helps, are watching keenly the developments. \r\r\r\rFor religious leaders, we must remember that the displaced people and those whose property is being destroyed are our members. \r\r\r\rAs it was in the ancient times when faith was used to rally people to a just cause, so it should be today in Kenya if we are to succeed in our quest for peace. Kenyans should not bury their heads in the sand. \r\r\r\rShikwati  is director Inter Region Economic Network.

Two men were shot dead, witnesses said.

Initially her husband stayed but due to fear for his life he joined them in the camp.  They used their mobile phones to communicate.

The attacks, targeting mostly Kikuyu and Kisii people in and around the town of Eldoret, could continue unless the government and opposition act to stop the violence, Human Rights Watch said.\r\r\r\rHuman Rights Watch called on the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leadership to take immediate steps to stop its supporters from committing further attacks. At the same time, Human Rights Watch said the Kenyan police should urgently deploy extra officers to the region to protect displaced people and resident Kikuyu communities.  \r\r \r\r“Opposition leaders are right to challenge Kenya’s rigged presidential poll, but they can’t use it as an excuse for targeting ethnic groups,” said Georgette Gagnon, acting Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “We have evidence that ODM politicians and local leaders actively fomented some post-election violence, and the authorities should investigate and make sure it stops now.”  \r\r \r\rResearch by Human Rights Watch in and around the town of Eldoret, which has borne the brunt of the Rift Valley violence, indicates that attacks by several ethnic communities against others, especially local Kikuyu populations, were planned soon after the elections. In some cases, local elders and opposition politicians appear to have incited and organized the violence. Since December 27, 2007, clashes between members of the Kalenjin and Luya communities and their Kikuyu and Kisii neighbors in the Rift Valley have left more than 400 people dead and have displaced thousands more.  \r\r \r\rHuman Rights Watch interviewed members of several pro-ODM Kalenjin communities who described the ways in which local leaders and ODM party agents actively fomented violence against Kikuyu communities. A Kalenjin preacher in a village in Eldoret North constituency told Human Rights Watch that on the morning of December 29, 2007, a local ODM party mobilizer “called a meeting and said that war had broken in Eldoret town, so the elders organized the youth into groups of not less than 15, and they went to loot [Kikuyu] homes and burn them down.”  \r\r \r\rThe following day, the village held another meeting and the youth marched to the nearby town of Turbo. They were turned away by police. But they returned early the next morning, catching the police off guard, “and burnt almost half of the Kikuyu shops in town, including the petrol station,” according to the preacher. Human Rights Watch visited Turbo and found that most Kikuyu-owned buildings had been laid to ruin by the attackers. Displaced Kikuyu seeking shelter at the police station in Turbo confirmed to Human Rights Watch that their homes and businesses were destroyed by groups of Kalenjin youth.  \r\r \r\rHuman Rights Watch spoke to numerous members of Kalenjin commmunities around Eldoret who provided similar accounts. In many communities, local leaders and ODM mobilizers arranged frequent meetings following the election to organize, direct and facilitate the violence unleashed by gangs of local youth. In one case, an ODM councillor candidate is said to have provided a lorry to ferry youth to burn the homes of Kikuyu families in a neighboring community.  \r\r \r\rMany Kalenjin community leaders told Human Rights Watch that if the area’s ODM leadership or the local Kalenjin radio station KASS FM told people unequivically to stop attacks on Kikuyu homes, then they believe the violence would stop. “If the leaders say stop, it will stop immediately,” said one Kalenjin elder.  \r\r \r\rHuman Rights Watch also collected accounts from several Kalenjin men present at community meetings where local elders and ODM mobilizers urged Kalenjin residents to contribute money toward the purchase of automatic weapons. Some communities have reportedly managed to obtain such weapons already. The same sources confirmed that plans have already been made to attack camps of displaced Kikuyu and the two remaining neighborhoods in Eldoret town where many Kikuyu homes remain intact – Langas and Munyaka.  \r\r \r\rThe Kenyan police are already investigating responsibility for the violence in the Rift Valley, but its forces are overstretched by the nationwide electoral crisis. In the light of apparent plans by some groups to attack camps for internally displaced persons, Human Rights Watch called on the Kenyan police to ensure that all locations of displaced people are adequately protected against attack. Fourteen displaced Kikuyu and Kisii people sheltering in a monastery in Kipkelion were killed last week in an attack by Kalenjin warriors. The sprawling tent camp in Eldoret is now home to more than 10,000 displaced persons, with only a light police presence to protect them. Any attack on the camp would likely prove disastrous. Other equally vulnerable camps have been set up in other areas.  \r\r \r\r“The murder of people sheltering at a monastery in Kipkelion illustrates the need for better police protection of displaced people,” said Gagnon. “Protecting the thousands of vulnerable people chased from their homes across the Rift Valley from further attack should be a priority for the Kenyan police.”  \r\r \r\rBackground  \r\r \r\rKenyans voted peacefully and in record numbers in parliamentary and presidential elections on December 27, 2007. In the parliamentary elections, 99 of the 210 seats were won by the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Incumbent Vice-President Moody Awori and 14 of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki’s top ministers lost their seats.  \r\r \r\rAccording to independent observers, the presidential vote count appeared to be tampered with to such an extent as to make it impossible to determine who won the vote. Even the chairman of the Electoral Commission of Kenya admitted that he did “not know whether Mr. Kibaki won the elections.” The European Union Electoral Mission expressed grave doubts about the legitimacy of the presidential results. The most significant fraud appears to have been committed by the government camp in the final stages of tallying the votes.  \r\r \r\rThe sudden announcement that Kibaki had won the vote triggered protests throughout the country. The protests, along with widespread post-election violence and the brutal police suppression of opposition protests, has plunged the country into crisis. Talks between the opposition ODM and the Kibaki government are proceeding under the auspices of a panel of eminent African personalities led by Kofi Annan, former United Nations secretary- general.  \r\r \r\rViolence erupted in the wake of the disputed elections throughout the Rift Valley and the west of the country as angry citizens burned and looted factories, shops and homes, and chased those perceived to be supporters of Kibaki (mostly, but not exclusively, members of his Kikuyu tribe) away. Kikuyu homes in the Rift Valley have been selectively burned and Kikuyu residents killed. Thirty people were burned to death in a church near Eldoret where they had been seeking shelter.  \r\r \r\rThe police confirmed the deaths of 526 people nationwide, including 81 shot by police officers, but independent estimates suggest that the total figure could be much higher. Thousands of Kikuyu and members of other tribes have been displaced and are in the process of leaving the region if they can.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"ODM OFFICIALS","incident_time_h":"12","verified":"NO","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"YES","longitude":null,"column_1":"Opposition Officials Helped Plan Rift Valley Viole","id":"a64aghuev3h1","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"YES","active":"YES","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":"httP://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/01/23/kenya17859.htm","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"am","location":"Many"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"00","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":"Nakuru","image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"YES","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"1/25/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"NO","riots":"YES","incident_date":"1/25/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"Violence Outbreak occurs in Nakuru Town in the areas, The violence is tribal linked. reports of People being burnt in there homesteads, and Bows and Arrows being shipped into the areas to fuel the violence.\r\r\r\rThe outbreak of violence begun last night and does not seem to cease as per today 25/01/2008.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":null,"incident_time_h":"06","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Violence outbreak in Nakuru Areas","id":"a64aghokd69m","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"YES","active":"YES","sender_name":"James Wahome","image_5":null,"news_link":null,"idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"am","location":"Kaptembwa, Githiima, Mwariki"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"00","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"YES","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"1/25/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"NO","riots":"NO","incident_date":"1/17/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"Chronicles of the Kenyan Genocide \r\rA genocide is going on in Kenya yet the world is dismissing it as 'ordinary' post election violence.\r\rThursday, January 17, 2008Raila Odinga defends the Eldoret Massacre \r\rIn an interview on the BBC's Hardtalk, Raila Odinga said, \"the father … the catholic father who is in charge has given an explanation and the explanation is that these people who were attacking people from another community were being chased and when they were being chased they went to take refuge in a church and the pursuers then pursued them to the church … they did not know that in the church were children which were being kept there as refugees so in the process of cause they set the church on fire…\"\r\rRaila goes on to say that his is not a defense of the massacre but his statement is doing just that. His statement that, \"they (the Kalenjin militia) did not know that in the church were children which were being kept there as refugees so in the process of cause they set the church on fire\" shows how hard Raila is working to take blame from the militia and allocate it to the victims. \r\rRaila Odinga did not offer us the name of the 'CATHOLIC FATHER' who gave him that story. The facts are that the massacre was executed in an Assemblies of God church and there was not catholic father in charge of the church. Raila's lies show how far he can go to fabricate a story to justify the massacre of innocent women, children and disabled citizens who were taking refuge in the church.\r\rThe murderers who spoke to the press said, \r\r\"The men and women had babies and small children, but they carried pangas to defend themselves. Is someone with a panga innocent? It is not our custom to kill women and children. We told them to come out of the church, but they locked the door and refused to come out. So we burned them.\" \r\r\r\rA third youth spoke. \"They were not worshipping in the church. They were hiding. That makes it a cave not a church. Let Kibaki send a plane for the Kikuyus. They can go ... or they will be killed.\" \r\rSeveral more men confirmed that youths from this village had helped carry out the attack.\r\rSource: The Guardian, Jan 2, 2008\r\rSimilar reports as above have been filed by several media houses.

Gangs of youths from rival communities clashed with each other and engaged in running battles with police and the military. \r\r\r\r- Molo District, the new epicenter of violence, is the area where humanitarian needs are the greatest. \r\r\r\rI.- General Overview \r\r\r\rAcute humanitarian needs of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) are being met to a large extent. However, many of the nearly 290,000 IDPs – latest number reported by the KRCS – are continuously moving from one area to another as the security situation is constantly shifting, with violence erupting in areas previously thought to be safe. Fear, constant rumours, and reports of events evolving on the political scene are responsible for these recent movements. \r\r\r\rWith new IDP-sites springing up almost daily in various parts of the country, humanitarian action is constrained to keeping track of IDPs and their needs. Recent camp closures only add to the pertaining volatility. In fact, some of the IDP profiles that emerge in the camps show that there are some displaced who remain without shelter. Aid agencies are working with the KRCS and the GoK to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable are met and that other solutions, including smaller camps inside the settlement areas, are being implemented to assist the homeless. Hundreds of IDPs from many urban areas are simply re-grouping in church compounds or other safe havens. The groups are as small as 10 persons but often as large as 100-200 persons. \r\r\r\rThe humanitarian situation in Molo District is the top priority for aid actors. The violence in Molo is escalating and there are now more than 40,000 IDPs living in congested urban sites or insecure, poorly provisioned rural camps. The KRCS is trying to set up two camps to which the IDPs could be relocated and which would grant more conducive surroundings for delivery of aid and for overall security of individuals. Recent violence and killings in Cherangani, Nakuru and Naivasha have also prompted more displacement, making delivery of aid even more difficult. Similarly the situation in the urban settlement areas of Nairobi and Kisumu remains very volatile, despite attempts to deliver assistance. Food and non-food items distributions in urban areas are very challenging. At least two distributions ended in chaos as crowds of hungry slum-dwellers ran away with food or relief goods. There are concerns that a wave of retaliatory killings has been unleashed with further humanitarian consequences. \r\r\r\rThe incidents of rape and sexual violence are on the increase, with victims being taunted and openly threatened in front of aid workers to not to report the rapes. The reported cases of rape have more than doubled since the crisis began. The Nairobi Women’s Hospital alone, which serves as one of several referral centres, has recorded some 167 cases. However, given that most hospitals outside of Nairobi have very limited capacities when it comes to receiving, recording and treating rape cases, aid workers feel that number of cases reported is only a fraction of the actual caseload. \r\r\r\rShelter needs are also changing as many parts of Kenya experience cooler rainy weather which renders the plastic sheeting and emergency shelter less adequate. There are concerns that the onset of the long rains, in less than two months, will have a severe effect on displaced populations in less robust shelters. \r\r\r\rFood security is also of concern, as the impact of violence and displacement on Kenya’s granaries began to emerge. The next two months are usually a critical period for land preparation and planting, however with the prospects for return and resettlement being rather dim, many, if not for most, of the farmers will not be able to carry out these tasks. Rising prices are also affecting farm inputs and availability of basic commodities in the markets throughout the country. Displacement of technicians, civil servants and other professional staff is also taking a toll in certain regions. These factors highlight the need for a thorough impact assessment that would determine the extent to which communities and individuals have been affected by the crisis. Analyses of the extent of humanitarian needs over and above internal displacement are also needed. \r\r\r\rFormer U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in the country on Tuesday. Mr. Annan joined other members of the African Union Panel of Eminent Personalities in facilitating negotiations to end the crisis over the nation's disputed election. Mr. Annan succeeded in securing the first face-to-face meeting between President Mwai Kibaki and the leader of the Orange Democratic Movement, Raila Odinga. This new development on the political scene has raised hopes that a political solution might be within reach. However, concerns remain over the fact that the political solution may not fully resolve deep tribal divisions, which are prompting much of the violence. In fact, it is necessary to understand the underlying political, historical and socio-economic factors that influence today’s humanitarian situation in order to analyse the response thus far, to ensure that humanitarian assistance and protection do not worsen tensions, and to comprehend all the available options for finding durable solutions to internal displacement. Concerns remain over the fact that the response to the current crisis follows the patterns of efforts in previous crises, with little attention being paid to the underlying problems usually not addressed when political resolutions are found.","deleted":"YES","image_2":null,"name_1":null,"incident_time_h":"6","verified":"NO","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"YES","looting":"YES","longitude":null,"column_1":"OCHA Summary Report issued Jan 28","id":"a64aghum70g8","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"YES","active":"NO","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":"UN relief web","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"pm","location":"all country"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"00","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"NO","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"1/30/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"YES","riots":"YES","incident_date":"1/29/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"Hundreds of persons have been displaced form the Kibera - Laini saba area.

The morning was tense, but all went well in Naivasha. Their local contacts told the women not to wear their jeans, but rather to buy some scarfs and kangas (dresses), which they did. This is so that they would not be confused with men from a distance, and not be perceived as a threat. Soon they were talking with the local youth, and afterwards with the real Mungikis, a clique known for their violentness. They had a very productive conversation as I described above. They spoke with more than thirty people, many of whom were key Mungiki leaders, and received excellent cooperation. They agreed that they would each speak further with five or ten people and invite them all for the great public meeting they will organize in the next two days along with Rachel and her team. They do not want to deal yet with the police in the area because they accuse them of much harm to their people, including their women, but at the meeting they will invite the local head of the police. They have confirmed their intent by providing their names and numbers to post publicly in our Pyramid of Peace.\r\r\r\rShould the seven day calm hold, they are very keen to work for peace. They want education on how the youth of different tribes can live together. They will engage those who have been displaced and give them hope that they may come back and live in harmony. They ask for counseling for their trauma. They wish for economic development so they might start their own businesses, for unemployed they are vulnerable to recruitment as thugs.\r\r\r\rDonations are very helpful now because Rachel's team and others in our Pyramid of Peace can buy airtime which the Naivasha Mungikis agree is not to call their friends, but rather to engage the violent Mungikis who have moved on to Nairobi. Certainly, they can be that much more effective if they have their own cell phones ($100 each) rather than using their mother's. Likewise, Rachel needs a laptop (new $800 or used $500) so that she can write reports. A newspaper advertisement declaring the agreement would have national impact for a few hundred dollars. Our giving hearts will bind us together in ways that can't be undone.\r\r\r\rDennis Kimambo +254 722 388 275 and I spoke today about his work in Nakuru. He organized police escort for a large group of residents (I think Lou) to leave for other parts of the country, which at this time gives hope and diminishes tensions.\r\r\r\rOur priority now is to cement a great victory by Rachel and her time (which I think included Kennedy Owino +254 723 568 251 and David Mutua +254 720 462 559). We can call, we can talk, we can give, we can donate. We can accept the challenge to encourage the Kalenjins and Lous and others to free the roads as well and celebrate the calm. We can reestablish Nakuru as a haven for dialogue. We might also verify the respect for travelers by sending travelers. Rachel told how they made great progress by riding motorbikes, which made it easy for them to speak to the road blockers, as opposed to driving in cars. What a telling illustration of the maxim \"Be vulnerable\". By allowing for a little hurt, we can know who is truly hurtful.\r\r\r\rLooking ahead, I think the root cause of the violence is coming to light. We have seen the Kikuyu brutality move, as if it had no roots, first to Nakuru, then to Naivasha, and now to Nairobi. It is as if they and, I think, their fellow killers from other tribes are hunting for the sorest spot where their fight might fuel a national conflagaration. They have caused much grief, yet the outrage is restrained. The fight is winding down rather than flaring up. The violent Mungiki are now upon Nairobi, where they are feared, but they have no real support, and they will prove themselves weak. I suspect a second reason for why they come to Nairobi is that they are going to their protectors, I can imagine in parts of the government (not all but parts of the police are rotten, as was clear in Naivasha), but also in the ruling party (in which I can imagine there are links to the attack on Nakuru) and the opposition party (in which I can imagine there are links to the massacre at Eldoret). The violence has proved itself absent as it has danced around the country, and there is one place left to look, where I would not be surprised to find it, and that is among the powers, those leaders who play with tribal militias. My charges are grave, and I hope unfounded, but I think that with our love for the Mungiki in Nairobi we can win their help to engage even the powerful, the sinister and the wicked with our Pyramid of Peace. I ask for our reflections. I will listen to our leaders in Kenya. I embolden us. We can love our enemy to clear our past and free our future.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"Pyramid of Peace","incident_time_h":"11","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Reaching out to the Mungiki","id":"a64aghm28so7","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"NO","active":"YES","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":null,"idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"am","location":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"30","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"YES","property":"YES","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"2/1/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"NO","riots":"YES","incident_date":"1/29/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"We tried negotiating with the leaders not to burn the house citing the issue of peace that is being negotiated by the political leaders. i was able to also show them some peace tile messages that I had made by some kids and they seemed to have softened their stand on burning the house. we chatted still but with the leaders only trying not to mention ethnicity but that emerged as the main factor why they were displacing us and wanting to burn the house. we negotiated also for them not to kill, burn and harm other individuals in the estate who were not of their ethnic background.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"Ron Odhiambo","incident_time_h":"9","verified":"NO","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Peace efforts in Nakuru and burning of homes","id":"a64aghusm78r","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"NO","active":"YES","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":"groups.yahoo.com/group/holistichelping/message/2022","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"pm","location":"Nakuru"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"00","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":"Nairobi","image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"YES","property":"NO","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"2/1/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"YES","riots":"NO","incident_date":"2/1/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"William Kimosop is the KWS Warden for Bogoria and all the surrounding areas.

We embarked on the journey knowing too well that the task of persuading the youth was tough and time consuming. We also knew that we would encounter a lot of resistance especially considering that the youth from this region have given one condition for peace; that unless justice prevails in the presidential tussle in Kenya, then they will not down their tools of violence.\r\r\r\rSo we started with Kuinet and Marura. We found the youth there taking turns in the road blocks. We introduced ourselves and thereafter began to discuss with their leaders. In Marura, we spoke to two leaders who were very adamant about clearing the road blocks. They said they could not afford to close down these barricades because of the constant rumors they receive on a daily basis. Most of the rumors were about the prospect of Mungiki being dropped by the Nation newspaper vans to some parts of Eldoret and western Kenya to rein terror on unsuspecting Kenyans. We requested to be shown the test messages and we actually confirmed more than 20 SMS containing such messages of impending attack on the people of western Kenya. We asked them to explain why they were extorting money from motorists and they said they were not getting any support from the community despite being there day in day out. They said they were volunteering their time and bravery and expected the people themselves to reciprocate by donating money, which they were not getting.\r\r\r\rWe informed them of our desire to engage in non violent means of resolving this conflict. Further we informed them of our intention to track down the origin of the SMS messages and really establish their authenticity. They agreed and indeed some of them alluded to only one incident when such a rumour has been proved correct. All the rest have been rumors only.\r\r\r\rFinally we gave air time to 12 of them. I gave out two balls to them with the instructions that the should form a football team, where all youth from their neighborhood should be enlisted to play. THEY WERE VERY HAPPY.\r\r\r\rBut the following day, things turned out to be the worst. The MP for Ainamoi was killed by a trigger happy policeman in Eldoret town. Immediately the news went out on radio that he had been killed, hell broke loose in Eldoret. Shops were closed. The busy streets were suddenly secured by the police.\r\r\r\rMeanwhile, the area around Eldoret including the two areas we had visited to dissuade the youth were immediately barricaded yet again. We have not even thought of going back because the tension is still high. No vehicles were allowed to move out of town and neither vehicle was allowed to move into town. Elsewhere in western province barricade were erected everywhere. Vehicles were burned and 6 people killed.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"Wesley Chirchir","incident_time_h":"7","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Peace efforts in Eldoret, and the situation","id":"a64aghv3wy7b","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"NO","active":"YES","sender_name":"Wesley Chirchir","image_5":null,"news_link":"groups.yahoo.com/group/fightingpeacefully/message/712","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"am","location":"Eldoret-Ziwa and Eldoret-Iten Road"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"00","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"NO","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"2/5/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"NO","riots":"NO","incident_date":"2/5/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"Residents' distress cry lost in caves \r\r\r\rStory by KEN OPALA \r\rPublication Date: 2/5/2008  \r\rShe grasps the rosary tightly, exhibiting defiance, not grief. Her two toddlers edge closer but she dismisses them tersely: “Go away, please.” \r\r\r\rThey come back. “I said go away.” They freeze. “Why mum, we want to be with you?” “No,” she replies. \r\r\r\rNeighbours hastily keep the toddlers away from their mother, journalists, friends, relatives and curious people, for they don’t want the young ones to hear how she escaped from the jaws of death. They did not want them to hear how the mother was assaulted as her relatives were being killed.  \r\r\r\rDepression and paranoia \r\r\r\rMs Rita Nasipwondi, 40, a mother of eight, is hardly conscious of the way she is treating her children. Hers is a life of depression and paranoia. \r\r\r\r“I saw my people being chopped like dogs. It was ghastly, horrifying,” she says in her Kibukhusu mother tongue. \r\r\r\rShe was next in the line awaiting her turn to be killed.  \r\r\r\rHer eleven relatives were hacked to death at an open field on the hills of Mt Elgon as she watched – and waited for her turn. Her father-in-law and mother-in-law, wife, his brother and the wife, brother-in-law and his wife were all killed at the same filed.  \r\r\r\rShe is now accommodated outside Kimabole trading centre by a good Samaritan. \r\r\r\rNasipwondi is among the latest victims the raging conflict in Mt Elgon instigated by the Sabaot Land Defence Force. \r\r\r\rIt has targeted specific communities in a veiled plan to evict them from the district. Kirui Komon Matakwei, a 24-year-old Form One dropout is believed to be the commander of the rag-tag force that has claimed lives even in the neighbouring Bungoma and Trans Nzoia.  \r\r\r\rAccording to sources, the first week of  January was the bloodiest – in the calendar of the militia that has terrorised Kopsiro and Cheptais divisions on the mountain side.  \r\r\r\rAt least 50 people, 22 of them members of the Soy and Dhorobo clans have been  killed between December 31, 2007 and January 7, according to survivors.  \r\r\r\rLocal district officer Phillip Tirop and the Kimama location chief Jamin Chemos told the Nation that 22 people were killed on New Year’s Eve.  \r\r\r\rHowever, the they said the victims were killed in cattle raids. \r\r\r\rAt a peace meeting last week convened by the district officer, Mr Chemos local residents ejected Mr Chebos accusing him of bias. \r\r\r\rMt Elgon is tense. The Western Kenya Human Rights Watch, says it has documented 398 deaths at the hands of the militia since August 2006. Another 80,000–more than a third of the district’s population– have been displaced by the attackers who operate from caves and forests in the mountain.  \r\r\r\r“But there are many people who have been killed and not documented,” says Job Bwonya, the executive director of the human rights lobby. \r\r\r\rThey include politicians, teachers, students and police officers. Bwonya claims over a dozen police officers were killed last year although he has documented only seven. \r\r\r\rThe militia overran Nasipwondi’s Kimama Village on December 31, 2007 as the rest of country descended into violence following the disputed elections. \r\r\r\rIt appears the gang exploited the confusion in the countrywide protests to kill members of a perceived rival community. Many people have been killed in the village yet the story is lost in the caves and thick forests that have been turned into graveyards, according to survivors and human rights activists. \r\r\r\rNearly all residents of Kimama lived as a close-knit family.  \r\rMzee Mafura, the 73-year-old elder killed together with his 12 relatives, settled with his family in Kimama in 1930.  His father, Mzee Katila, joined two elders, a Mr Psongoywo and a Mr Sambruma, all Sabaots in 1930. Their families have co-existed since then. Because of its fertile soils, Kimama is notable for its high grade coffee and horticultural produce. \r\r\r\rToday, Kimama is an enclave of the militia, thanks to the conflict. \r\r\r\rFarms left behind by the deceased and those who fled have been taken over by sympathisers and members of the SLDF.   \r\r\r\r“They want to create an exclusive enclave for their community, hoping to expand it by overwhelming other communities,” says Taiga Machanja, the coordinator of Mwatikho Centre, another Bungoma-based human rights lobby involved in rehabilitation of torture victims.  \r\r\r\rStart training \r\r\r\rAccording to witnesses, the boys were trained starting last November in camps up the Chebyuk hill.  \r\r  \r\rThey claim that police were aware of the training by had not taken action. \r\r\r\r“We used to see them disappear into the forests but it never occurred to us they were planning a massacre,” says Nasipwondi. \r\r\r\rFor two weeks, this writer scoured Mt Elgon tracing the survivors, relatives and families of those massacred on December 31, 2008.  \r\r\r\rThe story that emerges is a well planned attack on members of a certain community by the terror gang to create an exclusive region for their clan, and hopefully expand it to neighbouring Trans Nzoia and Bungoma District. \r\r\r\rOn December 31, 2007 the SLDF members moved from one homestead to another isolating members of a particular community.  They huddled them together and spirited them to the hills where they killed them. The bodies were later transferred to mass graves at Kamachai Village of Kopsiro Division.  \r\r\r\rThe area is littered with human bodies and skeletons. Nasipwondi was among those isolated at 1pm.  \r\r\r\rA group of 20 men well known to the mother of four rushed into her compound pelting circumcision songs as they wielded guns and machetes.  \r\r\r\rAn alarmed Nasipwondi rushed to hide her son in the nearby thicket. \r\r\r\rThe raiders were looking for her, they made it clear as they hit her. “Why are you killing me” she cried out. “(John) Serut (former area MP) has taken away our land and you people are busy tilling your plots, as if you don’t care,” one of the youths replied. (SLDF claims that Mr Serut bungled land allocation in Chebyuk settlement scheme from where people were evicted in 2006) “Give us money, mobile phone and everything,” demanded one of the assailants who attends a local school and had visited Nasipwondi in search of water three days earlier. \r\r\r\rIn her possession was a bicycle belonging to her husband who was out in the field tending to livestock, and a hose-pipe.   \r\r\r\rThey told her that she was “a prisoner” and frog-marched her to what they called “makaburini” (cemetery). \r\r\r\rThick forest \r\r\r\rAll along, they bludgeoned and gun-butted her until they reached an open field, next to the banks of River Malakisi. The thick forest disappeared into an open ground.  \r\r\r\r“This is machinjoni (slaughter ground),” one of the boys told her.  \r\rSuddenly she wasn’t the lone prisoner. Her neighbours were there too, so were her relatives, among them Mzee Mafura and his wife Emma, Mzee Nambobi (Mafura’s brother) and his wife Linnet. They were dead.  \r\r\r\rSix of them were killed as Nasipwondi watched, waiting for her turn.  The field was full of bodies, strewn on the thin grass. Some were rotting away, others had been fed on by dogs. The stench of death hung heavily in the air.  \r\r\r\rMr Bwonya  claimed that the SDLF runs a Kangaroo court at Ng’atip Kong, about three kilometres north of Kaptoboi Primary School, and the many people it “sentences “to death” are slaughtered  at this open field.  \r\r\r\rAs the killings continued, Nasipwondi lost consciousness at some point. When she came to her senses, a number of attackers had left and gone back to Kimama Village, to hunt down more victims on farms, in forests and homes.  \r\r\r\rThey zeroed in on Kimama Village, isolating people by the ethnic affiliation. (A man named Jackson was killed but his wife who comes from the militia’s community was spared) \r\r\r\rPrevious week \r\r\r\rThey caught up with Rita’s Std Eight son (the one who hid when they had raided earlier) and a relative, 22-year old Dickson Wanyonyi. The school boy tricked them with the Sh300 her mother had given him to purchase household effects. But Dickson, who had just married the previous week, was unlucky. They led him to the slaughter field. \r\r\r\r“Get up, come, it’s your time now,” one of the assailants shouted and pulled Nasipwondi from the ground. As she was being stripped (all victims are stripped bare before being killed) a mobile phone rung. The man on the side must have asked how many had been killed because she heard the killers leader answer:  “Kumi na mbili boss. Bado kuna wawili wamebaki hapa (Twelve already, boss. Two are remaining.” \r\r\r\rHe must have been ordered to stop the killing.  The raiders escorted Nasipwondi and another young woman back to the homestead in Kimama. Not far away, another group of assailants were rushing Dickson to the butchering field, to finish the job away before sunset.\r\r \r\r  \r\rWrite to the author","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":null,"incident_time_h":"12","verified":"NO","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Residents' distress cry lost in caves","id":"a64aghqzn3wq","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"YES","active":"YES","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":"www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=39&amp;newsid=116131","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"am","location":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"30","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":"nairobi","image_1_t":"196_Jamii_Notic_board_2__JPG_t.JPG","image_2_t":null,"peace":"YES","property":"NO","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"2/6/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"NO","riots":"NO","incident_date":"2/6/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":"196_Jamii_Notic_board_2__JPG.JPG","description":"hallo please read through my draft along with pic \r\r\r\r\r\rINTRODUCTION \r\r\r\r\r\r  \r\r\r\rUntil one is fully committed there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always infectiveness concerning all acts of initiative (and creation) there’s one elementary truth, the ignorance of which skills defiantly commits oneself then providence moves too. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rAll sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred, a whole stream of events issues from the decision, rising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamt would have come his way. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWhatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius, magic and power in it begin it now. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rDear friends, \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWelcome to the Jamii notice board wiki and face book page.

Ten to twelve notice boards will cover a division and over forty for a constituency. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rEvery division will be managed by an administrator who is also in charge of other components of the Jamii farmers notice board this being a laptop, a wireless internet modem, a colour printer, a projector, speakers, DVD player, digital cameras and Simu ya jamii. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHe will also update the Jamii notice boards on a regular basis that will contain pictures, classified advertisements, Local news, Educational Material, S.M.S and Email communication. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe target users of the Jamii notice board will be farmers group, church groups, investment groups, women groups, investment groups, women groups, youth groups, and school clubs. \r\r\r\r  \r\r\r\rTwinning constituencies \r\r\r\r  \r\r\r\rThis is a project by jamii board limited where we intend to link constituencies under the banner of ‘Kenya wakulima hapa haribiki jambo’. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTo maximize on publicity and interest we aim to connect farmers from Othaya to farmers in Bondo, farmers from Eldoret North to farmers in Gichungu and farmers in Naivasha to farmers in Eldoret South. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA simple example. \r\r\r\rFarmers in Bondo have a successful mushroom, vegetable framing and duck rearing enterprise.

Mr. Annan reported on the substance of the agreement at a press conference in Nairobi the following day.  In responding to questions, he said that he would stay in Kenya as long as it takes to get the job done.\r\r\r\rHere is the text of his remarks (as reported by the Nation).  It is virtually the same as the agreement signed at Kilaguni on Valentine's Day by all eight members of the negotiating teams:\r\r\r\r    We have just returned from 48 hours of intense and fruitful negotiations at a secret location outside of Nairobi, which all of you now know was the Kilaguni Lodge in the Tsavo West Game Reserve.\r\r\r\r    I want to thank you for letting us work there in peace, even after you discovered where we were.\r\r\r\r    The parties worked well together during their two days at Kilaguni — often in mixed groups and by themselves — showing their strong commitment to peace and reconciliation in Kenya.\r\r\r\r    They reached agreement on a range of issues, and narrowed considerably the options for a governance structure.\r\r\r\r    Some of the points of agreement are:\r\r\r\r        * The creation of an Independent Review Committee.\r\r        * This Committee would be mandated to investigate all aspects of the 2007 Presidential Election and make findings and recommendations to improve the electoral process.\r\r        * The Committee will be a non-judicial body made up of Kenyan and non-Kenyan recognised electoral experts of the highest professional standing and personal integrity.\r\r        * The Committee will submit its report within three-six months and it should be published within 14 days of submission. It should start its work not later than 15 March, 2008.\r\r        * The findings of the Independent Review Committee must be factored into the comprehensive electoral reforms that are envisaged.\r\r\r\r    Through the discussion, it became apparent that there is no viable way, either by re-count, re-tally or any other measure, to determine the outcome of the 2007 election in a way that would be expeditious and that would not further divide Kenyan society.\r\r\r\r    However, the facts have to come out and Kenyans have to know what happened. We agreed that the system must be reformed so that such a crisis never happens again.\r\r\r\r    The Independent Review Committee will allow for this to take place in an environment of tranquillity and transparency, thus contributing to further healing and reconciliation of the country.\r\r\r\r    We did consider the options of a re-count or re-tally and concluded that:\r\r\r\r        * A delay of the several months needed for a recount could significantly increase existing tensions and delay resolution of the current crisis, and we recognise that the result of a re-count might not further Kenyan unity.\r\r        * A re-tally could not determine the correct result in stations or constituencies where problems or irregularities were identified.\r\r\r\r    On the need for a political settlement to resolve the current crisis, we agreed on the following:\r\r\r\r        * Recognising that there is a serious crisis in the country we concluded that a political settlement is a necessary and effective way to promote national reconciliation and unity.\r\r        * We also agree that such a political settlement must be one that reconciles and heals the nation and reflects the best interests of all Kenyans. A political settlement is necessary to manage and implement expeditiously a broad reform agenda and other mechanisms that will address the root causes of the crisis and deepen and broaden Kenyan democratic foundations.\r\r\r\r    Such reforms and mechanisms will comprise, but are not limited to, the following:\r\r\r\r        * Comprehensive Constitutional reforms;\r\r        * Comprehensive electoral reform — including the electoral laws, the electoral commission and dispute resolution mechanisms;\r\r        * A truth, justice and reconciliation commission;\r\r        * Identification and prosecution of perpetrators of violence;\r\r        * Respect for human rights;\r\r        * Parliamentary reform;\r\r        * Police reform;\r\r        * Legal and Judicial reforms;\r\r        * Commitment to a shared national agenda in Parliament for these reforms;\r\r        * Other legislative, structural, political and economic reforms as needed.\r\r\r\r    On the issue of governance arrangements, the parties discussed the matter intensively and have developed a number of options, on which they have agreed to consult their principals and leadership and come back to continue negotiations on Monday, with the hope that a final conclusion will be reached shortly after that.\r\r\r\r    This is the only outstanding issue on Agenda Item 3 — How to Resolve the Political Crisis.\r\r\r\r    In summary, we have defined the reform agenda for a new government and are now discussing the “how” and the mechanisms required for implementation.\r\r\r\r    While we are making considerable progress on Agenda Item 3, we have also agreed that settlement of the issues in Agenda Item 4 — Long-Term Issues and Solutions — are fundamental to a viable long-term solution of the crisis.\r\r\r\r    The implementation of the following reforms should commence urgently in concert with reforms of Agenda Item 3.\r\r\r\r        * Consolidating national cohesion and unity;\r\r        * Land reform;\r\r        * Tackling poverty and inequity, as well as combating regional development imbalances, particularly promoting equal access to opportunity;\r\r        * Tackling unemployment, particularly among the youth;\r\r        * Reform of the Public Service;\r\r        * Strengthening of anti-corruption laws and public accountability mechanisms;\r\r        * Reform of Public Finance and Revenue Management Systems and Institutions;\r\r        * Addressing issues of accountability and transparency.\r\r\r\r    The parties agreed that this settlement is not about the sharing of political positions but about addressing the fundamental root causes of recurrent conflict. Therefore, the parties have reaffirmed their commitment to address the issues within Agenda Item 4 quickly and comprehensively.\r\r\r\r    Milestones and benchmarks for the implementation of the reform agenda will be defined in our continuing discussions.\r\r\r\r    I know that many of you have been eager to write the headline, “We have a deal” on all the political issues. But I again advise patience. The issues are complex; reaching compromise is difficult. But let me assure you that there is real momentum. We are at the water’s edge and the last difficult and frightening step will be taken. I am confident that, in the interests of Kenya and its people, the parties will show the wisdom, flexibility and foresight to conclude an agreement.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"Kofi Annan","incident_time_h":"16","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation Retreat","id":"a64aghvsjirk","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"NO","active":"YES","sender_name":"Harvey Croze","image_5":null,"news_link":"www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=116958","idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"pm","location":"Kilaguni"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"NO","incident_time_m":"20","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":null,"image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"YES","property":"NO","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"2/18/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"YES","riots":"NO","incident_date":"2/15/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"The Eldoret Pyramid of Peace is now mounted strategically in front of the\r\rEldoret Municipal Council Town Hall to serve as a monument to mark the\r\rstart of peace initiative in the region - thanks to a successful event\r\rheld to day.

Once again as is synonymous with other opposition strongholds, Police violently arrested residents of Mathare North indiscriminately. Men women and Children were not spared in the raid that was characterized by rapid gun shots equaling the “commando” movie by Arnold Swaz to drive away residents from watching the on goings. We decry the barbaric, insensitivity and the careless handling of a pregnant woman who latter in the day gave birth at Kasarani Police Station. As is common with the dreaded fugitives, the woman was ferried to the hospital as if Osama Bin Laden had just been arrested by Mr. Bush. With the sirens all over the air, and potholes of Nairobi, the baby was thrown up and down in a rough ride to death.\r\r\r\rThe rogue Police platoon was presided over by Kasarani Officer Commanding Police Division (OCPD) Mr. Jasper Ombati who resurfaced from the Kenya Police College to become a debt collector per excellence. Other similar raids were carried out in Gomongo and Huruma in the past two days respectively in the same manner leading to deaths and damage to property.\r\r\r\rIn Mathare, the locals found an avenue to vent out their anger on a minibus that had strayed the estate in the morning. They pelted the bus with stones which forced the driver to stop and opted not to die in the hail of stones but to die from mob beating. After receiving a generous beating by the mob He was left to go.\r\r\r\rI am a strong believer in peace and acknowledge that the situation in the country at the moment requires not the police because they don’t have the capacity to provide security but to allow people to heal as they wait for the political settlement to be reached. The police raid has completely shattered the efforts of bringing peace between the landlords and the tenants had started. \r\r\r\rThis Kind of raids are just extortion curtails. People who produced ten thousand shilling at the police station were left free but the few who were taken to court have been accused falsely because there is no complainant in the case.","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":"Odhiambo Kennedy","incident_time_h":"3","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Arbitrary Arrests Sparks Protests","id":"a64aghuawml0","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"YES","active":"YES","sender_name":"K.

It is in these areas that the most killing, rape, burning, looting and eviction was seen at its worst in Nairobi. However, following the peace deal and subsequent power sharing pact entered into between the two main protagonists over whom the slum dwellers were so passionately divided, these people have not been included in the search for the way forward and in reaching sustainable solutions to the core causes of the conflict.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\rAs part of its ongoing Let Us Talk initiative, Bunge La Mwananchi held a forum at Johphen Primary School, Mathare- Nairobi on 31st March, 2008. Let Us Talk initiative is aimed at facilitating a platform for mwananchi to come together so as to discuss the post poll crisis and the way forward as they see it and feel it as well as propose their views for future.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\rThe forum which was funded by the National Civil Society Congress (NCSC) and facilitated by Bunge La Mwananchi was attended by an average of 1300 people. The forum sort to find out:\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r1.             Residents’ views on ongoing recovery efforts after the post poll violence that recently rocked the area; and\r\r\r\r2.             Residents’ reactions and expectations of the power sharing pact and grand coalition Government.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\rThe forum’s main objective was to urgently create a platform where grass root Kenyans can engage each other in open, democratic and inclusive debates so as to identify common issues affecting them that they can unite on. These views would consolidate the voice of grass root Kenyans so as to enable them make their priority issues known to the political class and the recently proposed coalition government.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\rKey issues arising from the forum include:-\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r1.             In Mathare there are distinct demarcations along tribal lines. For example areas known as Mathare 4A and 4B are occupied by one community while in Bondeni there is a semblance of mixture of communities.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r2.             Speakers complained of appalling living conditions, lack of sanitation facilities, running water and increased food prices in the slums. Families are no longer having one meal a day but eating when they get something.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r3.             Some of the forum participants were IDPs from the nearby Police Depot Camp, Soul Winning Church, PCEA grounds and Huruma chief’s camp. Their most pressing issues were lack of food, poor security within the camps and uncertainty over their security should they attempt to return to their previous homes. They also complained of poor sanitation within the IDP camps prompting communicable diseases such as pneumonia, cholera, malaria, and TB.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r4.             Majority of the IDPs would prefer to be relocated to a place called Ruai area where they can be allocated land and be assisted with building materials instead of being forced to return to areas from which they were evicted in the post poll aftermath.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r5.             The residents would like the Government, Civil Society and NGOs to assist them in regaining their livelihoods by providing them with seed capital to facilitate the re-establishment of their burnt/looted businesses.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r6.             One participant raised issue with mystery of Safaricom shareholding and urged the Civil Society and NGOs to keep vigil on the secret shareholders in Safaricom as they wananchi were investing their hard earned cash in the company hoping for some returns and they did not wish it to become another avenue to enrich the already rich.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r7.             In the community, there are running disputes between landlords and tenants in the area. Participants opined for an urgent need for rent scale harmonization in the area, as it is currently arbitrary and at the landlords’ discretion.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r8.             Kenyans were concerned that the members of parliament have not resolved how to share the cabinet while there are many issues affecting Kenyans that need urgent redress. There are issues of resettling the IDPs, compensation of individuals and families that were affected by post polls violence; but the political elite are only worried who will fly the official flag on their car.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r9.             The community still has rampant cases of tribal executions especially mob justice of suspected criminals found in the “wrong” part of the slum area ( consider point 1).\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r10.         The fish processing plant has dumped waste material in the area and the decomposing agent used has caused scavenger birds to die in large numbers. There is however no action being taken to mitigate this environmental and health hazard.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r11.         The residents complained that following the election results they fought each other and now have to live with the resulting animosity. They said they were fighting for issues such as employment and poverty reduction. However, they now see Raila and Kibaki engaged in friendly banter and jostling for power, while their issues remain a non-priority.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r12.         Participants outlined their desire to see a people-led constitution review process take off. They explained that when they were fighting for power sharing they did not mean power to be shared between Raila and Kibaki, but they wanted to see their own involvement in the country’s decision-making beyond the ballot. They want power at the grass root. Therefore, they want the process of giving Kenyans a good constitution that will ensure power is taken to the grass root started, with all Kenyans involved and concluded within the one year of the formation of the Kibaki-Raila Grand Coalition.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r13.         There were suggestions on restructuring the Government’s decision-making framework to involve the voice of ordinary Kenyans made at forums such as Bunge La Mwananchi. Participants complained that in a representative democracy like Kenya, after elections their Members of Parliament move to the leafy suburbs in Muthaiga, Runda and Lavington and remain unreachable, yet claim to be representing the mwananchi who lives in Huruma, Mathare and Mkuru kwa Njenga whose problems they do not even know.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r14.         Wananchi complained over the delay in the naming of the new cabinet. They wondered why PNU were hell bent to have a cabinet of 44 members and pointed out that the country’s economy is struggling from the recent post polls crisis and could not afford luxury of purchasing those many mercedes benzes for the ministers. They also wondered why a developed country like Britain or even United States with a population of 250 million had only 15 Secretaries. What is this that these 44 cabinet ministers will be doing for 30 million people?  \r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r15.         The participants recommended that the Government should not force the IDPs to go back to their homes where they were evicted, especially Rift Valley. However, the government should engage in consultation, initiate renegotiations on land and seek reintegration of communities as this will ensure long lasting peace. They added that no number of Police Stations can force neighbors to live peaceful together. They also said that some rich families that have a lot of land they acquired through corrupt means like the Kenyatta family should give back land to Kenyans for resettlement.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r16.         Wananchi also complained of the price increase on basic commodities such as paraffin, sugar, bread and milk and yet their minimum wages remain the same while the Members of Parliament are always talking of increasing their perks. Some wondered with the kind of salaries MPs earn how can they be shopping in the same Uchumi and Nakumatt?\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r17.         Wananchi also committed themselves to become active in holding the Government accountable, their Members of Parliament and civic leaders. They wondered if there is anyway they can be accessing information on what the government is doing…\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\rThe recommendations arising from the forum are:\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\r1.             There should be a peace initiative to foster reconciliation and harmony between landlords and tenants in the area.\r\r\r\r2.             There is a need to organize more forums where wananchi can come together to express themselves on a democratic platform.\r\r\r\r \r\r\r\rPrepared by:\r\r\r\rGeorge Nyongesa, Bunge La Mwananchi, +254 720 451 235","deleted":"NO","image_2":null,"name_1":null,"incident_time_h":"2","verified":"YES","image_3":null,"video_link":null,"name_2":null,"rape":"NO","looting":"NO","longitude":null,"column_1":"Bunge La Mwananchi Forum","id":"a64aghua08ny","video":null,"image_4":null,"name_3":null,"deaths":"NO","active":"YES","sender_name":null,"image_5":null,"news_link":null,"idp":"NO","incident_time_am":"pm","location":"Mathare"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"name_4":null,"govt_forces":"YES","incident_time_m":"30","nearest_city":null,"latitude":null,"sender_location":"Molo","image_1_t":null,"image_2_t":null,"peace":"NO","property":"NO","image_3_t":null,"date_add":"5/3/08","image_4_t":null,"civilians":"YES","riots":"NO","incident_date":"1/5/08","image_5_t":null,"image_1":null,"description":"Army men beat up wananchi in molo town after one of their men with alot of ego was beaten by wananchi..
