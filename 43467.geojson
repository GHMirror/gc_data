One is two full courts, four hoops total. The other is one full court. All are regulation and have cotton nets. The courts are usually active. Very easy to find a game of 21 or 2-on-2. Often there is a full court game going as well with very little wait time. Saturday 12:00-6:00 seems to be a good time, but also weekdays after 4:00 p.m. The park is near SCROC (Southern California Regional Occupational Center) so there always seem to be college age chuckers milling about or futzing around on the courts. There is a water fountain, ample free parking, and a bathroom nearby. Courts get standing water on them even after a moderate rain. The courts are not lit though the ambient light is sufficient to shoot after dark.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vhtu8mkhu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.3249,33.826416]}},{"properties":{"name":"Clark Park","description":"Posted by Granthardwoodmd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Clark ParkTwo full courts, four regulation hoops with cotton nets.

From the street the signage leads one to believe it\\'s a private tennis club or something. Actually, it\\'s a beautiful park with baseball diamond, horse track, tennis courts, playground, and basketball court. The court is a lovely full court with two regulation hoops and freshly laundered cotton nets which no doubt smell like lilac and a hint of peppermint. The court is next to a volleyball sandpit so sometimes the sand on the concrete surface can make for treacherous conditions. The traffic on this court tends to run to middle schoolers, toddlers, and soccer moms. You won\\'t find any game here. Almost always abandoned. However, the setting is tranquil and lousy with trees and other greenery. Restrooms, water fountain, and free parking are available. The court is not lit.\n\nSometimes this place smells like horse doody.

Apparently, there is a secret Hardwood place in Nova Scotia. I can only assume this is where my parents (my REAL parents, not of this planet) have hidden all relevant data on my powers, my family, and my homeworld on convenient 35 MB Bernoulli disks and/or PSP compatible UMDs. I\\'ve never been to Nova Scotia, but as I approach adolescence (men from my planet apparently reach adolescence in their late 30\\'s) and strange \"powers\" continue to inconveniently manifest themselves during nocturnal hours, it seems like an appropriate time to book a flight.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vhts3us83"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-64.6875,44.245199]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grandview Park","description":"Posted by Granthardwoodmd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Grandview Park is a park in that it is open to the public... technically, but is completely undeveloped since the locals don\\'t want \"riff-raff\" parking, throwing frisbees, walking, and just generally encroaching on \"their\" turf. Therefore, it isn\\'t marked; there is no convenient parking; there are no restrooms; the park is overgrown and unmaintained; and the wealthiest are bribing local city and state officials to carve pieces of the park off to the highest bidder for development (the best area of the park has just been cordoned off and is being turned into a multi-million dollar private estate as I write this). Despite all of this, the park does indeed offer the grandest view. You can park either at the end of Ironwood St. or at the end of Via La Cuesta. Though the locals may regard you with suspicion and look daggers in your direction, give them the \"too falking bad\" return glare and walk into your park. Basically, you get an impressive view of South Bay over to San Pedro and across to the Hollywood sign and Malibu. You can\\'t really spend much time up here (it takes about two minutes to walk from one end of the park to the other), but it\\'s worth a look if you\\'re in the area and want to see what you can see.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vhu1t64dn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.382964,33.792915]}},{"properties":{"name":"Live Oak Park","description":"Posted by Granthardwoodmd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Live Oak ParkOne very nice full court and four half courts with cotton nets. Lights stay on until 9:00 p.m. Monday-Friday and until 7:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday (although the park staff always try to weasel in 15-30 minutes early to shut the courts down if they want to get home to catch \"Everwood\" or some fucking thing). They actually lock all of the hoops with \"the club,\" so you can\\'t shoot after the lights go out. They\\'ll also lock down at the first drop of rain (WTF?!). You can do what I do and harass them into allowing you to shoot until the actual closing time if you don\\'t mind them standing around making surly remarks (I don\\'t). I\\'ve never menaced them with my Ace in the Hole, namely that my cousin works for the city of Manhattan Beach and I could have their asses with just a single phone call. A SINGLE CALL! I\\'m a mover and a shaker. I\\'m also sort of a Quaker. With an ankle-breaking crossover. Kids, finish your oatmeal!

The two courts are full court in as much as the baskets face opposite each other, but the length and width of the courts are rather tiny. Basically, you get a rebound, turn around and you\\'re at the other end of the court. Very cramped. Tends to encourage a single end-to-end pass, lazy defense, and mid-range jumpshots. The courts don\\'t really support 5-on-5, but people insist on playing it anyway. Lights stay on until 9 p.m. Best time for games are weeknights.

It\\'s an old school bakery, coffee shop. Coffee shop in that you can get coffee. Not all fancified, just coffee. There are all kinds of sugar cookies, danishes, cakes. You name it. Layer cakes go for around 0-35 and they have an elaborate, highly regarded wedding cake area that seems capable of recreating any sort of confectionary masterwork. This place has all kinds of processed white flour, sugar, and shortening type of cookies. Personally, I like some fiber in my baked goods, roots, twigs, gravel. Nuts and seeds and just gnarly shit that makes me work for my sugar fix. This ain\\'t that kind of place.\n\nI\\'m also a tiramisu and chocolate chip cookie man. I figure you have to get those right if you want a chit in the baked goods game. A few words on tiramisu. I want a tiramisu that kicks me in the dick wtih espresso. And also chocolate. Sure, it has to be creamy (with marscapone, of course), but it shouldn\\'t taste like a dollar store swiss roll. The tiramisu at Mayer\\'s is weak-ass cheese, brother. It has a great consistency, but the coffee and chocolate flavor just were not there.\n\nThe chocolate chip cookies are fine. They\\'re not dry, over-buttered, but are just... fine. I wouldn\\'t make a trip up top of the hill for any of their stuff specifically. I haven\\'t tried the cakes, but I\\'m guessing that\\'s probably their go-to snack.\n\nThe venue itself is pretty nice.

There are three full courts in the upper area. Many of the hoops are not regulation. Some of them don\\'t have rims at all. And only a couple have functioning cotton nets. That being said, you will never have trouble finding an open hoop. That\\'s because you will NEVER find a game here. Maybe the occasional 1-on-1, but that\\'s it. The primary reason to shoot here is solitude and a world class view of the ocean and the verdant environs of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. School is in session Monday-Friday, so you can\\'t shoot here until after about 4:00 p.m. or 3:45 at the earliest. The area is typically lousy with soccer and baseball dads and their progeny. Occasional geriatric dog walkers. Ample free parking. A water fountain down inside the school courtyard. The courts here are not lit and there is not even sufficient ambient light to shoot in semidarkness, so when the sun sets, you\\'re done.
