In reality, to become a member of Best Doctors, you have to be nominated by a colleague and then letters of review are sent to many physicians in your area.  Many questions are asked of the doctors but the most important one is “if you as a physician or a member of your family had a medical problem in the area of expertise of this doctor, would you go to this doctor yourself?”\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4r5zo6lb1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.406477,34.090107]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dr. Talia Malka, Acupuncturist","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jbni.us\" href=\"http://www.jbni.us\">Jbni</a><img src=\"http://taliamalka.com/talia.jpg\"><img src=\"http://taliamalka.com/talia.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> Lafayette Hill, PA, 19444-1618Talia Malka is among the first JBNI certfied physicians and has been working with JBNI for over a decade.

Clinical Professor of Medicine at the Weill-Medical College of Cornell University. He is the former medical director and director of medical oncology at the Weill-Cornell Center for Integrative Medicine. \n\nDr. Gaynor is a leading oncologist who has pioneered new strategies for both the treatment and prevention of cancer. He is the author of numerous scientific papers and three books: Healing Essence (Kensington Health 2000), Dr. Gaynor\"s Cancer Prevention Program (Kensington Health 1999), and The Healing Power of Sound (Shambhala 2002). His work has been featured in Newsweek, USA Today, The New York Times, Healthy Living, Vegetarian Times, and many other publications.

The phone number is 212-472-2828. The practice coordinates care between Dr. Gaynor and nutritionists, physical therapists, and other health professionals to develop the best treatment plan for each patient and to help patients restore their physical, spiritual and emotional well-being. Gaynor Integrative Oncology is unique in that unlike many centers and practices, instead of simply offering a smorgasbord of integrative services to patients, Dr. Gaynor tailors the use of treatments to individual patient needs.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4r60o773m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.777176,40.675273]}},{"properties":{"name":"JBNI Headquarters","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jbni.us\" href=\"http://www.jbni.us\">Jbni</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/0/products_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> Bothell, WA 98021JBNI World Headquarters<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4r5si9xsl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.205166,47.796363]}},{"properties":{"name":"Natural Rearing Pet Health Care","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jbni.us\" href=\"http://www.jbni.us\">Jbni</a><img src=\"http://www.naturalrearing.com/clib/supplemental/home.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> This site exists to provide information on Natural Rearing and alternative, holistic, complementary health care for pets.
