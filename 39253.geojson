Though primarily a market whose meat consists of Tenderloin sex workers, it’s also a popular and safe hangout for all manner of non-professional cross-dressers and transvestites, as well as transsexuals such as myself. \n\nI was at Divas one slow Tuesday night in early May. The upper floors were closed, and there were seldom more than half a dozen patrons in the room. My improbable mission was to hook up with an attractive stranger. The improbability stems from the fact that I like girls, not boys, but boys go cruising for trannies at Divas; (genetic) girls, as general rule, do not. Where can genetic girls and tranny girls go to hook up? It’s a question that nobody else seems to be asking. At a dyke bar like the Lexington Club, I’d be tolerated but ignored. At least the male patrons of Divas would objectify me. While I didn’t want them to touch or really interact with me, knowing that I was turning them on did my ego good, even if I’d surely be sleeping alone that night.\n\nA narrow, multifloor letterbox, the ground floor features the main bar and a small stage.  A dance floor and lounge collectively known as “Dragon” occupy the third and fourth floors.\n\nMy favorite bit of décor is the purple neon Motherlode sign hanging behind the bar. It’s a remnant from different, if not necessarily simpler, times.  Divas grew from a much smaller establishment at the corner of Post and Larkin called – you may have guessed – The Motherlode. The ever-crowded bar moved to its current, more spacious digs in ‘98 after five years of neighborhood protests, legal challenges and far more obstacles and roadblocks than one might otherwise expect in an ostensibly queer-friendly town, let alone in as dicey a neighborhood as the Tenderloin. Though the prostitution issue was frequently cited by opponents, it’s probably not altogether inaccurate to say that the sex workers were not so much the issue as the tranny clientele in general. \n\nFor some reason, writing at Divas can be like hanging a “Please Disturb” sign.  Presently, a man approached and said, “You seem nervous.  Are you German?”  As I processed that, he followed up with “Are you a transvestite or a transsexual?”  That stung.  I may not have the silicon hips and tits or surgically-reconstructed face of the average working girl, but after eight years of estrogen, with my own head of blonde hair and nary a follicle of facial hair to be found, I’d like to think I’m obviously not simply a man who dresses as a woman, especially to a Divas patron. \n\nI was about to leave when a genetic girl entered, an event akin to a streak of lightning in a clear sky.  She was on a mission as improbable as mine, and neither of us slept alone that night.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yv6y082"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.419451,37.786815]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jonell's Cocktail Lounge","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/images.jpeg\">401 Ellis Street, San Francisco, CA, 94102<b> by Broke Ass Stuart</b>\n\nIt took about three seconds after walking in the door at Jonell’s to realize that this was exactly the spot we were looking for.  Named so because it sits on the corner of Jones and Ellis, Jonell’s is the type of fine establishment where sitting with your back to the door might be the last bad decision you ever make.  The patrons are generally drunk and leery old men who piss away all their money on booze and hookers, but the vibe is actually far from inhospitable.  In fact, if you sit down at the bar, expect to get an earful of some the most fucked-up stories you’ve ever heard.\n\nThis place has been serving drinks for at least 50 to 70 years and used to go by the name of the Horseshoe because of the shape of the bar (real original). It has loads of horse memorabilia from its supposed golden age and not much else. There are two non-functioning bar-sinks however.\n\nA friendly but worn-looking Samoan face approached us smiling and asked, “What’ll it be guys?”\n\n“Hi,” I smiled back, “can we get a couple of Budweisers please?”\n\n“Sure honey, I’ll be right back.”  As she walked away a man pushed through the door with the force of a house ripped from the ground and blown to Oz. The bar was pretty empty, but I knew he’d land right next to me. They always do. This one’s name was Mike.\n\nThe man said a round of hellos.  “Hey Suzy, hey Ricky,” he greeted the couple who ran the bar.  Then he greeted the only other people in the bar besides me and Kenny, a fat white guy who appeared to be completely catatonic, and an old black guy in a straw fedora. “Hey Fred, hey Willis. Oh man I just came from this huge fucking party where there was all this free food and free booze, and Jesus, shit man, you shoulda seen all the pussy in this place. This guy I know jus’ opened this Cuban restaurant and tonight was the opening party.  It was beautiful, my buddy really went all out, and the food, oh the food!” Then, glancing over at us, “Ha! Shit, man, the women in there were so hot they wouldn’ta even fucked me when I was you’re age. How old are ya, 21, 22?  What are young bloods like you doing in here anyways?”\n\nSuzy the bartender dropped off two Buds for Kenny and I, and a glass of whiskey for Mike. “Thanks, Suzy. How’d ya know what I wanted?”\n\n“Cuz you get the same damn drink every night,” Suzy answered smilingly. Mike looked like his 50 or 60 years on this Earth had been rough; you could tell he’d definitely been around the block a few times. But he was jolly in his roughness, and he was energetic and also pretty tubby. He kinda reminded me of a grown-up, bearded version of Chunk from The Goonies. I got the feeling that Mike was a good guy, just a little overzealous.\n\n“The best bar in the world is just a few blocks from here,” he told us. “You ever heard of the Brown Jug over on Eddy and Hyde?  Best bar in the world.  My old lady’s been working there for 22 years.  Beautiful American Indian broad; we been married 30 years, can you believe that? Man, they got some nice atmosphere in there and a great jukebox and boy, my old lady can really pour a drink. Take my advice. Go in there and ask for Shelley.  Tell her I sent you and tell her that I send my love.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yr9s5b2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.412797,37.784926]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mason &amp; Union Streets Cable Car Stop","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1ysl3imv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.412468,37.799968]}},{"properties":{"name":"My Place","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus1225 Folsom St., San Francisco, CA<b>by Robert McLaughlin</b> \nThis was in 1999, way before the health department began cracking down on all the groping, moaning, and squirting going on in the bathroom. You’d peer into that dim bathroom and see men with potbellies and last season’s Calvin Klein jeans all tangled together in a sticky pile-up. You’d think to yourself, are they all clamoring for the same dot on a Twister mat? It was always so shadowy in the front room of the bar—all it was really lit by was the white Christmas lights along the walls and the glow coming from the TV showing low-rent porno (porno so amateurish you’d see rashes and pimples in places you didn’t want to see rashes and pimples). The bouncer, who was 6’5 and hulking and very Harley Davidson, what with his frizzy gray beard and constipated scowl (I imagined he ate kidnapped children as midnight snacks) was always the first person you’d see when you walked in. Imagine seeing this guy in the ugly light coming down from a bad porno. God knows what I was looking for that night. It wasn’t sex; most of the men who went there were either homely in a buck-toothed, backwoods, Kmart kind of way, or amped on speed with the gnarly complexions and dilated pupils to act as stop signs for your convenience. I get a vodka and lurk in the dark against the chain link fence that was arranged in the back for maximum prison yard effect sexiness. I grow tired quickly with all the cruising, watching all those sets of eyes slink by that appeared as if they could detach and gobble you up. Back and forth, back and forth—following all the action in that bar was like being at Wimbledon. I decide to go smoke because cigarettes help me focus. You’d have to walk down this hallway that had Day-Glo-painted walls to get to the back patio, and this hallway was lit by black light. People like me with pale skin and freckles would look like pasty raver zombies flecked with specks of mud in this hallway—so attractive. I light up as I step down and join the smokers and soon enough this cute skateboarder (he had the body of a swimmer and Mark Hamill’s 1977 face) was hitting on me. Wow, someone hot. A friend of his joins us. I can’t remember what this guy looked like—I wasn’t paying attention. All I can remember is that he kept smoking pot at a furious clip from a tin foil pipe. Laughs, MORE DRINKS, bullshit chat, closing time, I’m slurring…the situation changes. The three of us stumble back to Hamill’s apartment down by the End-Up and get REAL comfortable in about 15 minutes. A key turns in the front door and oh shit Hamill’s boyfriend is home and no-face and me get shoved out the back door carrying our jeans and shoes and erections. We lose it and wobble to his SRO in the Tenderknob and he throws me down on his bed that smells like bleach and tells me the only way he’ll be able to cum is if I fuck him. He drags on his pipe and flicks on the TV and an evangelical Sunday morning service was on. Oh, you’re smoking crystal, I realize while watching the minister thump his hand on the podium (I can be SLOW). I zip up and wiped his kisses off and leave. I walk home as the sun rises and watch the seagulls swoop down on O’Farrell Street while thinking about my upcoming 27th birthday.

Unfortunately, one of my passengers, a 6’4 rock star-type, was sitting on the back seat battery of my 69 VW bug, which quickly ignited. I found myself pleading with my entourage to help me “put out the fire, dammit!!!”  Somewhere between Interstate 280 and the Embarcadero exit that no longer exists, my guests convinced me to pull over. They then proceeded to pee on the fire raging in the backseat of my car. I remember people going by at Broadway and Columbus, shaking their heads – as if this had never happened to them.  \n\nAfter the ordeal, we slid into a seat at Specs, although one of my passengers, whose ass was almost fried in a moment of bad luck, spent most of the evening, eyes glazed over, watching the cockroach races on the wall.\n \nRight next to Tosca, across the street from Vesuvio, in small Saroyan Alley sits Specs, identified by a marquee consisting of eyeballs framed by, you guessed it, a pair of specs. The bar’s second name is the 12 Adler Museum and it was the premiere North Beach beatnik hangout before the action moved to Vesuvio. It was also the City’s first Union bar and one of the first lesbian bars. \n\nSpecs was founded by a well-traveled merchant marine who stocked the place full of knick- knacks from around the world. These have long provided talking points for patrons and the official name for the tavern. There are old nautical charts, scrim shaw (illustration on whale bone done by Eskimos), Polynesian tribal masks, art by North Beach punk icon Winston Smith, photos of Sophia Loren and a general salty ambience. Specs Simmons, the owner, can often be seen in his trademark black leather Beatles cap and black leather jacket.  At first glance, he looks like a gregarious hairless Santa – only, instead of kiddies, there’s usually a good-looking girl or two sitting in his lap. On the back wall of the bar there’s a newspaper article about him and his fishing buddies being rescued from the high seas, sometime in the early 60’s.\n \nWhen I used to wander in here on Sundays, they had a nude drawing workshop that anyone could participate in. Specs has always been a big supporter of high art.  I remember that through the years there have also been woodcut classes, lectures, writing workshops, acting, poetry, art openings – you name it – these walls of dark wood and sea faring bric-a-brac have hosted just about everything you can think of, as well as the infamous “Wheel of Cheese.”\n \nI was sad to learn that my favorite bartender, Sean, has finally retired.I will miss his familiar “Anooother pint, fer ya, then?” No matter. The Guinness still flows freely, and Specs still maintains its surliness and rough and ready feel, like the captains quarters of some long-ago pirate ship.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1z1hxcy6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.406538,37.797579]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stumbling North Beach","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 255 COLUMBUS AVE, San Francisco, CA 94123<b>by Michael Phipps </b>\n\n\nGold Rush miners wrote back home of “seeing the elephant,” and\nthis applied to a jaunt on San Francisco’s saloon circuit from its earliest\ndays.  Writing about the pursuit of John Barleycorn in the City is no problem\nfor a fourth generation San Franciscan; deciding how to cut it down to a short\nreflection however is a more monumental task. The solution is somewhat akin to\nthat of the casual traveler who tosses a dart into a globe to decide where he\nshould journey next.  So here it goes.\n\nMy metaphysical dart landed in North Beach, a well-known Mecca of food as\nwell as drink.  My family had lived in the neighborhood since the 19th\ncentury, and I was well acquainted with it long before I could legally order a\ndrink.  It was in college days during the 70’s, however, that I really began\nto travel the circuit with my friends, starting at the lower end of Columbus\nnear Montgomery and progressing as the day itself did, up through the Latin\nQuarter towards the northern waterfront.  Mornings typically began at\nVesuvio’s Café, and typically with coffee.  It was no ordinary coffee\nhowever, being strongly laced with amaretto.  Mornings in the old Beat icon\nwere quiet, and soft jazz usually made up the only sound to be heard.  The\nwalls were decorated with avant-garde paintings and graffiti, and of course\npeople still smoked, cigarettes mostly, but occasionally even one of the\ngnarled, noxious cigars known as Toscana.\n\nFrom there we made our way up Columbus Avenue, past the just opening\ndelicatessens, markets, and still closed restaurants.  Next stop:  Gino and\nCarlos on Green Street.  Like other plain little bars like Tony Nik’s and\nthe Columbus Café, Gino and Carlos prided themselves on a lack of frills. \nGood honest drinks for people who liked to drink would sum up their credo, and\nhere you could find the denizens of old North Beach, long retired, working\nclass, and often even Italian.   Firemen mixed with butchers at the bar, and\neveryone minded his own business.  At this point, we might have progressed\nfrom coffee to something more substantial, like a highball.  Lunch was not far\noff on the horizon.\n\nFor lunch, we occasionally ate something with our drinks, and so we could end\nup at Dante Benedetti’s New Pisa, or Joe Caporale’s Capp’s Corner, where\ngenerous family style meals were served up in the traditional fashion.  The\ncenterpiece of both places however was the bar, old mahogany giants surrounded by photos of local sports heroes and politicians.  Benedetti gave away most of\nwhat he had earned in his life and that included the most generous drink in\nthe neighborhood—the bartender being the only employee on a set wage, as the\nrest of the staff was family.  Joe Capp was a man who would bet on two snails\nracing down the sidewalk and make book for others in the process.  These\ncharacters gave life and style to their bars, where you were likely to meet\nanyone from Joe Alioto to the All-City High School Running Back of 1938. Lunch\nwas never hurried, and might include something in the way of a digestivo taken\nafter the meal, just to be sociable. \n\nAfternoon tea was taken at Portofino’s and included neither tea nor\nEnglishmen.  It was a drab sort of room inside, extending from Columbus to\nStockton Street, providing two exits, a handy feature in case of need. \nCinzano or some other aperitif was the usual choice, and if you could avoid\nthe shady types frequenting the corners of the saloon—there were always\nrumors of drug dealing floating about—the huge wall pictures of the Amalfi\nCoast took one far away, mentally speaking.  A short stay, one or two drinks\nperhaps, and then it was off to a real cocktail hour.  This was usually a\nreplay of lunch, with Capp’s Corner or New Pisa the venue of choice, or\nmaybe over to the Washington Square Bar and Grill, where Ed Moose and Sam\nDeutsch held forth at the old bar, where sports figures, politicians, and\nother “power players” were likely to be found on any given evening. \nDinner might be elsewhere, a smaller place with wine and a cheap meal. \nSometimes we went to the fabled Old Spaghetti Factory, where the bar served\ndraft Anchor Steam (which was rather hard to get in those days) in an old\nstyle milkshake glass for a buck.  Dinner might be another two bucks, but that\nincluded red wine—no label.   \n\nBy 10 pm we were sure to make our way back down Columbus to end up again\nat Vesuvio’s for brandy-laced coffees, or perhaps over to Tosca’s for a\nhouse cappuccino, which of course contained no coffee, but a shot of chocolate\nand lots of brandy.  By this time, Vesuvio’s would be packed and loud\nconversation flowed out the windows opening onto Columbus, letting some fresh\nair into the building, while the magic lantern played vintage slides onto the\nwall.  At Tosca’s you could nestle among the red leather booths of another\nera and listen to opera on the vintage jukebox, that is unless the Mabuhay\nGardens was open behind us on Broadway, in which case you couldn’t hear a\nnote of music or conversation, and the building rumbled in a nightly replay of\n’06.\n\nOf course we didn’t always follow this same course; North Beach has no\nshortage of bars and that doesn’t even include adjacent areas like Jackson\nSquare, Chinatown, and the Wharf, all with their own bibulous attractions for\nthe serious tippler.

The 222 is all that’s left of the famous modern jazz club The Black Hawk. In its day, the Black Hawk  was the most important modern jazz club in the Bay Area. Charlie Parker used to play hookie from paying gigs just to jam at the Hawk because he liked it better. Dave Brubeck, one of the spiritual founders of the West Coast Cool style of jazz, played there. Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk recorded critically distinguished records in the Black Hawk’s recording studio annex – now the 222 Club. Co-owner and cashier Helen Noga discovered the singer Johnny Mathis there and went on to manage him to become a household name in the early ‘60s. Vince Guaraldi, who scored most of the original soundtracks for the television treatments of Charles M. Schultz’s “Peanuts” comic strip started out working as an intermission Black Hawk pianist, subbing in for Art Tatum. Vernon Alley, an African American jazz bassist, who is credited with doing much to desegregate Bay Area music clubs and the music unions, booked shows at the Hawk for years.\n\nWhat was probably most impressive about this jazz nerve center, however, was its funky lived-in atmosphere . The drapes were black and moth-eaten. There was no air conditioning and no heat. During the rainy season, water from leaks in the roof collected in strategically-placed saucers around the club, creating a counter-tempo to the performing rhythm sections. The phone could ring at any time during a show, and the musicians just had to tolerate it. Said co-owner Guido Caccienti, “I work and slave hard to keep this place a sewer.” \n\nThe Black Hawk’s heyday was from about 1949 to 1963, after which it was closed and demolished except for the remaining 222 space. What used to be the club’s main section is now a vast parking lot. People hustle paperbacks and pirated DVDs against the cyclone fence surrounding the space. Although it was an important part of the cultural legacy of the city there isn’t even a plaque to commemorate the club, but the locals remember it. \n\nAfter the closure in the late sixties, 222 Hyde became one of the city’s first tranny bars, according to current co-owner Joe Kaplan. Then it was eventually abandoned. For a number of years it was a burned out shell of a space frequently occupied by street squatters until Kaplan and his wife Bianca acquired it around 2000. They completely rebuilt the inside and reopened in 2004. Now a long narrow bar area gives way to a sub-level where live music, experimental hip hop, and acid jazz is spun and performed, keeping up with innovations in improvisational sound. Vintage Black Hawk posters are framed on the bare brick walls and the club has the agreeable vibe of a Lower East Side performance lounge transplanted to San Francisco. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yvd6oht"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.415726,37.782829]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Brown Jug","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/images_1.jpeg\">496 Eddy street, san francsico, ca<b>by Broke Ass Stuart</b>\n\nHow could I say no to that?  If this guy Mike said the Brown Jug was the “Best Bar in the World” it had to be a pretty fucking strange place.  I almost felt like it was my civic duty to go check it out.\n\nNo one is quite sure exactly how old The Brown Jug is; they only know for sure that it’s been there since at least 1941.  They know this because recently someone found a raffle ticket from that date.  It’s said that back then the Tenderloin had at least four bars on every block. My first impression of the Brown Jug was that it looked the way that Redneck biker bars always look in movies.  There were framed posters of motorcycles on the wall, and a neon Budweiser light that kept trying to end its miserable life and finally flicker out for good. Instead of playing the expected music, like Lynyrd Skynyrd or David Allen Coe, the jukebox was blaring mid 80’s adult contemporary light rock, like Level 42 and Hiroshima. A bit confused and caught off-guard, we sat down at the bar and prepared to order some drinks.\n\nI addressed the bartender who was drying some glasses behind the bar, “Hi, are you Shelley?”\n\nShe eyed me suspiciously and said, hesitantly, “Ya.”\n\n“We just came from Jonell’s where we met Mike,” I said. “He told me to tell you ‘hi’ and that he sends his love.” She shook her head, chortled a bit and walked away to grab some more glasses. Shelley put down the glass she was working on and spit out her reply, “I don’t talk to that motherfucker when he’s been drinking.  Shit, I don’t even talk to that motherfucker when he’s been thinking about drinking, that rotten piece of shit.” Shelly then picked up the glass again, took a breath and said, “Now what the fuck can I get you?”\n\n“Two Budweisers,” Kenny answered.\n\nShe brought over the beers and Kenny paid her while I was doing my best not to look him in the eye for fear of losing my shit and cracking up. So I turned to my right and saw at the end of the bar a lady looking like a washed up, drunk Diana Ross making weird scrunched up faces at her drink.  She and I made eye contact so I waved to her and said, “Hello.”  She replied by giving me the finger.  She continued to do so every time I looked over there for the rest of the night.\n\n“Fuck it,” I thought, and turned to my left where I saw a crumpled up old man who looked like he’d been sitting on the same barstool every night since 1948.  I smiled at him and nodded, but got no response. Just as I was about to return to my notebook, though, some cheesy song that only gets airplay on your mom’s love-song stations, like “I Go Crazy (Each Time that I Look in Your Eyes)” came on. The old guy next to me suddenly got all animated and started silently waving his cigarette around in the air and grinning like someone who just had their first taste of flesh and realized that they loved it. This was the point when I realized that the Brown Jug probably was the best bar in the world, but that it was far too much for my fragile soul to handle.  It was like having your mind opened up to all the secrets of the universe and realizing that maybe you didn’t want to know those secrets after all.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yxrvmic"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.415756,37.78368]}},{"properties":{"name":"The End Up","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus401 6th Street, San Francisco, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yn026gh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.404031,37.777246]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Riptide (aka Sandbar)","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/Watching_200.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 3639 Taraval St., San Francisco, CA<i>by Joe Donohoe</i>\n\nI remember the Sandbar because one night I somehow ended up there, very drunk, after an evening of exploratory chaos that somehow brought me almost to the edge of the ocean. The place smelled like beer and puke and the floors were sopping wet with what seemed like the sweat of the patrons. The Sandbar was right “where the debris meets the sea,” at the edge of the city. \n\nThe Sandbar first materialized in 1941 as the Oar House at 47th and Taraval in the Outer Sunset. Half of the present building was divided off and served as a bait shop for Ocean Beach fishermen, known as The Master Bait Shop. The Oar House acquired a rough reputation. In the 60’s and 70’s it became a biker bar and extremely violent fights were not unknown. One well-told story recalls the loser of a fight retreating into the reasonable sanctuary of the night after being stabbed, and returning again later in the evening with a shotgun to shoot off the arm of the man who’d stabbed him. As the gunman fled, the other patrons took the severed arm and put it on ice in the hope that if they kept it fresh, the good surgeons of UCSF might be able to sew it back on. Unfortunately, this didn’t work. And fortunately everyone was drunk or somebody might have gotten hurt. \n\nIn 2003, the Sandbar was acquired by Dave Quinby and Les James from the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department. Inside, among other things, they found the vents in the men’s bathroom had caved-in. The smell of the sea and years of shit had seeped into the sand below and now hovered in the air, rather than being pumped out into the atmosphere. The drainpipes from the bar had corroded and anything that had ever been poured down the bar sink had collected and fomented in the sandy soil beneath.\n\n“You know you got a problem when even your plumber says it smells bad,” said James. Thousands of metric tons of Rose’s Lime Juice will take their toll. \n\nHaunted by the thought of the bad karma of decades worth of drunken amputation and other debaucheries, Quinby hired a practitioner of Haitian voodou to come in and exorcise the place with doves and sage. \n\nReborn as the Riptide, the pipes are fixed now. The ambience feels like that of a proper neighborhood bar. The staff is solid and there’s a roaring fire in a stone fireplace to keep out the Pacific chill. The two TVs are always playing surf films and the walls of knotty pine create great acoustics for live music nights (bluegrass and blues feature heavily). The walls bare signed promotional photos of musicians Quinby or James have met (James was the drummer for one of the Bay Area’s premiere country bands: Red Meat) including Johnny Cash and Ralph Stanley. For solid working class ambience and low pretension it’s the best night-spot west of 9th Avenue.\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yui6bdo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.505145,37.741797]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Saloon","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus1232 Grant Ave, San Francisco, CAThe Saloon – at the intersection of Fresno and Grant, between Vallejo and Broadway – is the oldest continuous bar in North Beach by default. That is to say the same building that was a saloon there in 1861 houses the present-day Saloon bar. There are establishments in San Francisco that date back further, but none with its original timbers. This is because The Saloon also served as a whorehouse in 1906, and was favored by firemen. One of the main reasons two-thirds of San Francisco went up in smoke in the aftermath of the earthquake was the lack of adequate water pressure for fire hoses, but the valiant turn-of-the-century firemen weren’t going to let the residence of their favorite floozies go up in smoke. They ran a hose down to the shoreline, then at Front Street, and were able to keep the flames surrounding The Saloon at bay. \n\nThe Saloon was founded by Ferdinand Wagner, a Deutch from the Alsace Lorraine who came to California in 1854 and made his money selling fruit (a lot more money than fools who went to pan for gold in the Sierras). After bringing his family to the States, he built what is now The Saloon on the site of his fruit stand during the Civil War era.\n\nR.E.B.E.L. was the daytime bartender the last time I was there. “I’ve earned every initial!” she stated. She added she was from Florida and indicated the soft toy stuffed pink flamingo that hangs from the front door frame whenever tends she bar there. Rebel filled me in on the cinematic highlights of the bar’s recent history. The owner once appeared in his own bar on an episode of The Streets of San Francisco playing the role of a passed out drunk. Kirk and Spock walk past The Saloon in Star Trek IV where they go back in time to 20th century San Francisco to save the whales. Actress Reese Witherspoon carved her name in the men’s bathroom. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1z10zbg7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.407205,37.798621]}},{"properties":{"name":"Title or search term","description":"Posted by ZassenhausNorth Beach<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1z11anfn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.41111,37.80583]}},{"properties":{"name":"Treat Street Cocktails","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3050 24th St (Cross Street: Treat Avenue)\nSan Francisco, CA 94110-4130View Map\n(415) 824-5954 \n\nThis lodge serves a roguish gallery of amiable barflies, working-class types and rock and rollers who take the edge off with a few pints.

Like the bent, 100 year-old Victorians shoring up Market Street as it recovers from its harrowing 17th Street drop, Twin Peaks remains, ornery and defiant.\n\nI half expect to see long-gone Dan in the bar, talc-colored skin now glowing from several Irish coffees and the impending prospect of fat wallets, cheap drinks, and sex with anonymous strangers.  \"We\\'re going to pick up some old queens,\" he\\'d say, and in 1981 that meant anyone over 25. Dan, who never wanted to grow old, never lived long enough to have to. \n\nThe bar outlasted a lot of us.\n\nTwin Peaks was built over 100 years ago and was one of the few buildings in what was known as Eureka Valley to have made it through the 1906 quake. The original carved woodwork in the bar was resurrected from an old demolished hotel in the Mission, and the windows were blacked out to prevent outsiders from seeing inside and witnessing the debauchery of drink.  (Little did they know what was to come!) The original bar was frequented by the predominantly Irish and Italian blue-collar workers who lived around it. Later, as the neighborhood grew and prospered, it became a popular watering hole for a mix of people moving in from all over the country when the area was affordable to working class families. \n\nAs the hippies filtered through the Haight Ashbury in the 60’s, Eureka Valley residents over the hill got wary, suspecting their backyards would be trampled by tripping, naked young people. They moved out to the suburbs in droves. Twin Peaks Tavern fell for a time into obscurity– but the influx of gays seeking sanctuary in San Francisco changed that in the late 60’s and early 70\\'s.\n\nA Lesbian couple bought the bar in 1972 and Twin Peaks Tavern became Twin Peaks, the first openly gay bar and haven for a defiantly “out” generation. In 1972, bucking the trend, Twin Peaks became instrumental in the gay rights movement, becoming the first street level bar to feature ceiling-to-floor windows that let the casual voyeur, cruiser, or gawker peer in. It set the trend for the later \"fern bars\" of the late 70\\'s and early 80\\'s. Along with other budding establishments in the neighborhood, such as the Elephant Walk at 18th and Castro (now Harvey’s), it became a symbol of gay pride and tolerance.  \n\nThe deaths of Harvey Milk and the coming of AIDS may have sobered the community, but Twin Peaks Tavern is still \"kicking it\", as they say.  When I finally made my way in I found Dennis pouring the same generous Irish Coffees, the same guys rousting each other, the same banter about what a \"straight girl like me\" was doing in a place like this (without a date for them).\n\nTwin Peaks, with its Tiffany-esque lamps, dusty oak tables and crusty cobwebs flung across unwilling crevices – much like some of the patrons – is a survivor, plain and simple. \n\nDinged up myself after my 3rd \"pop,\" I\\'m feeling a little more rambunctious, too, and as I steady myself with the help of a good samaritan who appears as inebriated as me, the words of Abba mixed with Al Green come wafting out of the bar\\'s speakers and everyone joins in with the lyrics in a bizarre cacophony straight out of Fellini.  \n\nTattered foolhardy and stubborn, Twin Peaks lurches on.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yon7rde"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.435187,37.762496]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vesuvio Cafe","description":"Posted by Zassenhaus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 255 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1yvoox46"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.406097,37.797388]}},{"properties":{"name":"the phone booth","description":"Posted by Zassenhaussouth van ness and 25th streets, san francisco, ca<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7ab1ytanvxp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.41614,37.7508]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237820","metadata":null,"contact_name":"zassenhaus","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:zassenhaus","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237820","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":24,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237820,platial:user=zassenhaus","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":39253}
