I was wandering around Ueno Park, leaving the crowd of people and Hanami parties behind, when you tapped my shoulder and asked me to take a photo of you standing in front of a temple, on top of the hill. You spoke charmingly with a British accent, Chinese-born and living in London. You were amazingly backpacking through Japan on your own for a month. We shared stories of our trips, and then you showed a map of your adventure plans. We swapped emails and addresses. We took pictures of ourselves. When I got back home I received a postcard from you in Nagoya - and later, stories of a dodgy hotel in Osaka, the peril of riding bikes in Kyoto, among other life\\'s off-kilter experiences. I sent winded emails of little things about me, hoping you\\'ll get in touch with me when you get home, but somehow you didn\\'t. Now it\\'s springtime again and I\\'m thinking of going to London. I want to give you a call when I do make it to the swanky shopping district of London - and hopefully, you\\'ll remember me, still, after the long-distance spell.

You drove like a demon, cutting corners at 50 miles an hour, and wildly swerving around old grandmothers walking slowly across  streets in front of the car. You were my only companion for the two months I lived in Portugal. We met each night but never once spoke on the phone. I hated your driving, hated the way you drove fast and furious  making me cry and hide in my seat. You loved to scare me. Laughing good naturedly at my terror until I cried and then pulling the car over. You would mumble a thousand apologies, kiss my hands and face and repeat the word for \"Joke\" over and over while stifling giggles.\nIt was a nightly ritual, I would sit all day reading by myself and wait for you to get off of work and then we would drive aimlessly. There was nowhere to be and no one to care what we did. I couldn\\'t speak a lick of Portuguese and you spoke no English at all.

It was the end of a long hot summer.  I convinced a friend to drive me down to Des Moines (without telling his parents) ostensibly to see Henry Rollins and the Rollins band play.  He loved Henry Rollins, I loved a songwriter and editor of a local punk \\'zine.  He saw the show, I walked off into the night with my love and found this spot next to the river behind some bushes off of a little walkway.  It was liberating, intense and passionate.  Lots of hot sweaty leather moments.  I can still remember the lovely smells of that night.  We made love for so long that when we returned to the botanical center, my friend was terribly upset with me--he was really late getting home which blew his cover and he was grounded for a month.  On the long drive home, he angrily berated me while I strummed on a guitar dreamily and sung her songs.  By the end of the drive he was singing along too, and the romance had even rubbed off a little on him too.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634e6rlrzdw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.616691,41.594584]}},{"properties":{"name":"Me + You = UTTER DISASTER","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a>I spent the night on a friend\\'s couch.
