Even the most been-there-ate-that gourmand will savor the simple, yet sublime, starters--from the paper-thin pizzas  to the steamed mussels and clams bathing in a garlic-infused broth. Nonna Elvira\\'s green lasagna is a dozen layers of bliss with blankets of pasta enveloping a mild cheese. Continue with a deliciously soft, moist branzino (salt-encrusted sea bass), or a pork chop sided with braised red cabbage. Desserts deserve special attention, such as a buttery mascarpone, or a scoop of vanilla gelato with a shot of steaming espresso. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63j1ss9if4e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.349095,34.076337]}},{"properties":{"name":"Griffith Park","description":"Posted by Puckbunny<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 4730 Crystal Springs Dr, Los Angeles, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63j1sxnypo0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.282873,34.137882]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hide Sushi","description":"Posted by Sleepyfroggie2040 Sawtelle Blvd., Los Angeles, CANo fuss, just fish at this neighborhood favorite get-it-to-go sushi  spot. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63j1suy22k8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.443082,34.040486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lawry's the Prime Rib","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 100 North La Cienega Boulevard, Beverly Hills, CA, 90211Lawry\\'s the Prime Rib<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63j1sygmrc5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.376151,34.066934]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mishima","description":"Posted by Puckbunny8474 West Third St., los angeles, ca Japanese cafe food -- love the soba.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63j1sugt806"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.375674,34.073088]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santa Monica Pier","description":"Posted by Puckbunny200 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica, Ca<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63j1t3rqn8i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.4965,34.0098]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sprinkles Cupcakes","description":"Posted by Puckbunny9635 s santa monica blvd, beverly hills, caTasty, tasty cupcakes.
