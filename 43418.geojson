I had been going there annually every summer ever since I was a young camper of eight years; therefore, I know it like I know the back of my hand.  I can very easily tell you where every single ride and food stand is located, and where to buy souvenirs, more specifically clothing, candy, and fudge, at the end of a most rewarding visit. The theme park is sectioned off into water rides, and regular rollercoasters and amusements.  Personally, I like the normal rides best.  My favorite is Superman, a world-renowned coaster that is twenty stories high and travels at a speed of seventy-seven miles per hour.  Saying that you’ve been on it is quite the accomplishment.\nHowever, this particular trip to Six Flags was different.  Instead of being an innocent, young camper, I was now a mature, teenage counselor solely responsible for looking after six wild, irresponsible nine-year old girls.  They reminded me very much of myself when I was that age.  Like all of my other trips to the park, I arrived on a warm, summer day that was full of promise and adventure. My girls were very excited to be at the park, and had me running around all day like a lunatic, but I didn’t mind at all because it was all in good fun. \nAfter we ate lunch, we decided to ride the carousel and slow down our pace a little bit in order to digest our food. This is where my personal essay takes place: on line for the carousel at Six Flags.  I had ridden it so many times before in my life, yet never in my wildest dreams did I think that it could have the potential to leave such a lasting, powerful impression on me.  I remember the bright flashing lights of the games and other rides surrounding me. The numerous shrieks and giggles of the many children running around still reverberate loudly in both of my ears. I can still vividly see the pastel-colored horses moving up and down continuously on their stationary posts.  The smell of greasy food and ice cream is one that will never escape me, no matter how hard I try.\nThat day is one that I will remember for an extremely long time.  The carousel at Six Flags is a backdrop that will forever occupy both my mind and thoughts.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkaduuumv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.62565,42.08875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ann Arbor, MI (Sarah)","description":"Posted by SensorThis is where I will write my narrative about Ann Arbor.

The people were new. The language was different but understandable. The land was new. It was immaculately clean. The air wasn’t musty and filled with dirt. The roads were flat. As the taxi driver drove to the house, the air was cool and breezy. The ride was unbelievably smooth. Everywhere I looked I saw color; the vivid details of the green leaf on the tree I had never seen before, the pink soft flower that nestled over the piney looking shrub, the old apple tree that was still holding on. I was in a new place. I had never seen these places and things before but it was comfortable and scary at the same time.\n Without a moment’s notice, it all disappeared and I saw a new scene, the beach. Tourists consumed the sandy white beach. The water was noisy with all of the scuba divers, the swimmers, the jet skiers, and the people who just wanted to literally soak up the sun. And then there were the sun bathers who lay on their hammocks that were tied from tree to tree, the coconut trees, tall and slender. Just as fast as the beach came, it disappeared at the same rate. We were now going up a hill. The air because much more cool. And everything was green. As I gazed out the window, I saw that we were now going over a bridge and the driver reduced the speed drastically. I looked down and I saw water again but not the crisp blue water of the beach but the clean clear water of the waterfall. It flowed with great momentum down to the bottom of the ground where it stopped with a great big thud and paused but never failed to continue moving again. It was alluring. We crossed the bridge and again, all I saw was green. \nSoon, the green started disappearing. I saw a community, a church to the left, a grandmother walking her grandson to the store to buy him candy. The road was flat again. After a couple of turns, the car unexpectedly went downhill. There was construction. The air was musty now, but not for long. We turned left and went up the steep hill. To the right was a magnificent garden with roses, lilies, mums and much much more. The old lady stood near the patio watering her precious red roses. Then, finally, the car stopped a few feet in front of the garden. We were finally there. In front of us, a new life, a new beginning. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkad3mpun"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-59.4580078125,13.1971645233]}},{"properties":{"name":"Centerville, NY (Alison V.)","description":"Posted by Sensorcenterville, nyThe place where it happened is beautiful.  When told what it is, beautiful\nis not the word that would come to mind for most, but beautiful it is. \nIt’s just a farm, a dairy farm to be exact, the place where I grew up,\nwhere I am most happy.  The house that I live in is a quiet old farm\nhouse, tan siding with red shutters.  The porch is gorgeous, a big porch\nthat spans the front of the house.  The set up of the house is wonderful,\nspread out and rambling.  Kitty-corner from the house is the barn.  The\nbarn looks old.  When looking at it, one would think that it was about 150\nyears old and indeed it is.  Personally, I believe that it is on its last\nlegs.  It will fall apart soon, and hopefully when it does, the cows are\nnot in the barn.  That would be disastrous.\n\tRight beside the barn is the silo that I got in trouble for climbing when\nI was twelve years old.  Sixty feet seems like such an astonishing height\nto a child.  I wasn’t even scared.  I could never figure out why Dad got\nso mad at me for climbing it.  Now he asks me to climb it all the time to\ncheck the level of silage inside.   I sometimes think that he is bipolar,\nbut not really.\n\tBehind the barn and to the left is my heifer barn where I spend most of\nmy time.  All of my calves and pigs gladly say hello as soon as someone\nsets foot inside.  My cats all meow loudly in hope of my feeling sorry\nfor them and giving them a bowl of milk.  They are a bunch of moochers,\nthey should be out hunting the mice and rats that overrun our barn, but\nI’m a pushover and they know it.  Spanning in front of the farm house and\nbarns for about twenty-five acres is the pasture land.  That’s where it\nhappened.\n\tOn a good day, when the sun is shining, the pasture looks beautiful.  The\ncows have trodden paths all throughout the pastures, so you can see the\nmeandering paths they take when going out to graze.  As I follow the lane\non the four-wheeler that afternoon, I have no idea what I am in store\nfor.  When reaching the end of the pasture, I shut the four-wheeler off\nso that I can look and listen for the sounds of nature.  They are always\nthere.  To my left is the buzzing of a bee and mosquitoes flying around\nand around my head, to my right the lowing of contented cows as they\nmunch the green grass.  Thick brush surrounds the fence where beyond is\nthe pond that my brother dropped a wrapped round bale in about five years\nago.  It is still there.  The stream that runs through the pasture is\novergrown with cattails and weeds.  I do believe I’ve told Dad that he\nneeds to clean it out.  I absorb the scents that attack my nostrils, cows\nand grass, flowers and water.  And wind.  It’s always said that wind\ndoesn’t have a scent, but I believe it does, an indescribable scent that\nbrings a feeling of pleasure to a hot and sunny day.  This place is home\nto me, and I still love everything about it.  It brings a feeling of\nhappiness to my gut whenever I’m away and I think about going back.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkalrjqmt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.24952,42.47827]}},{"properties":{"name":"Charlottesville, VA (Robbie)","description":"Posted by SensorA sea of woodchips. I had tried to play, to go from monkey bar to monkey bar. I fell into the sea instead.\nMy arm hurt. I did not know why. Woodchips surrounded me- they were all over me, engulfing me. Within the threads of my favorite Barney t-shirt, between my socks, between the inside-fuzziness of my Stride Rites, trapped underneath the elastic waistband of my dark navy shorts.\nMy arm hurt. I did not want to move. I could not move. I cried.\nThe hill behind my house was a gathering spot for all of the children in my neighborhood. It was steep, sloping slowly toward a stream. My brother always tried to block the stream, to divert it. He built dams out of mud, sticks, stones, whatever he could get his hands on. I always found it fascinating to watch. I tried to help him, but his hands were much larger than mine; I could not carry as many stones, as many sticks. I felt helpless. I could not help him block the stream.\nLying, I could feel myself sink into the woodchips. I remember one time in the front of my house, my brother built a snow cave of sorts. To this day, I do not know how he did it; he kept the snow from falling down on his head. He could keep it from moving. He kept it in an unnatural state. Like ice, the snow stood still. I tried to build a snow cave. I soon gave in and crawled into my brother’s.\nOn the first day of school, the yellow bus pulled in front of my house. The pavement of the street was a dark black, perfectly paved. Across the street was a small bi-level home; no children lived there. I rode my bicycle around the neighborhood once. Up and down. Up and down. Each hill seemed more exhausting to ride up than the one before. Wooden fences separated me from the homes along the street. Each house was big, and brick. Imposing. I did not make much of it at the time. I just continued to ride between the pines, up the dark path. \nI eventually could not do it. I could not ride my bike up the hill. I got off of my bike and walked, holding onto the handle bars for support. A Jeep Grand Wagoneer passes to my left. My mother said that everyone in our neighborhood had that type of car. Her Taurus was the gossip of all of the neighbors.\nOn Fridays after school, my mother would pick me up. She would always be an hour late or so. I was left to play. The playground became a small world to me. Behind the school was this world. Woodchips formed the base and on top of the woodchips were many playthings. A wooden castle, a spinning wheel, a wire cage. Beyond the playthings lie the woods. Everything in my town stopped at the woods. Behind my house there were fir trees and pine trees. Behind the school there were honeysuckle plants and pine trees.\nPine trees and Fir trees shared the forest. Through the forest, up and down its hills, my town built roads. The roads seemed to not belong. They went through the forest- nothing was to built to either side. It seemed like the fir trees would take one step closer to the road that connected my school to the highway. They would get closer and closer, step by step, until they towered over the road. The forest wanted the road to leave. The Grand Wagoneers kept on coming.\nHills. You do not know what is ahead of you when you go up a hill. All you can see is its peak and what is to your left and right. There is no horizon line; there is nothing in the distance. There is just some things to your left and right. Very few people get to see what is beyond the crest. Everything is beyond it. From the peak of the hill I could see the barber shop downtown, the garden store, the place where the big kids went to school, the railroad, the horse farms, the ranches, the golf courses, the arcade with putt putt golf where I had my last birthday party before I moved. I didn’t realize why I always wanted to return to this place. The place where I broke my arm, where my mother received nasty stares from the Grand Wagoneer driving soccer moms, where I could never make it above every hill. However, now I knew. Now I knew why I always wanted to return.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkaodcvvv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.4870147705,38.0388980969]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gainesville, FL (Walker)","description":"Posted by Sensor2927 nw 9th pl gainesville, fl2927 NW 9th Place, the first address that I can recall as my own. There were other houses before this one that I remember but only through uncertain memory probably created in stories and photos. I remember 2927 in many ways. I remember it before there was anything there, when it was all forest and slope. I remember climbing through it. It was a patch of wild between two well-groomed lawns with traditional houses. Most of the neighborhood at that time had already been built and 2927 was the last lot to be sold there and the last lot to ever be built on. It really was wild. Typical Florida plants, huge oak trees, lots of palm trees, palm fronds, sandy soil above deposits of clay twenty to thirty feet below the surface. I remember climbing over dead trees and through spider webs and deep into the woods and not really realizing that we, my family, were going to build a house there. I remember that it felt important but I don’t think I really knew why. \n Next I remember drawings. I remember that my dad was always drawing a house for us. I remember thinking that he had been working on it for years, I don’t know if he really had or not but that is what I remember. I remember how proud I felt that my dad had designed what I assumed was his dream house. After that I remember construction. Huge mounds of dirt and sand which provided hours of mess and fun especially when it rained. I remember the temporary tool shed that my dad and friends built to hold tools and materials. I remember when someone came to drill hundred foot deep holes (which were later filled with concrete) into the foundation and I remember looking down them with my dad holding my hand and thinking about what it would be like to fall into a hundred foot by one foot hole, how claustrophobic that would make you feel. Those holes filled with concrete made strong pillars that punctured through the clay in the foundation so that our house would be stable and never shift or slide with the land. I remember framing stages of the construction and I remember above all a lot of cinder blocks and a lot of concrete. I also remember when I discovered a small room under the house and how when I asked what it was my dad’s friend Fro told me that it was the “Barbie room.” Even though I had little to no interest in Barbies I did have an interest in toys and playing and secret spaces and this later became a great hide out (it’s purpose for my dad and for the house was as a utility room).\n\t2927 is the only modern house in its neighborhood. If I was to compare 2927 with the other houses on 9th and 10th places the other houses would sound quite similar to each other while 2927 would have little in common with any other house. Despite how different it is, somehow it fits and somehow it blends into its landscape. Maybe blending comes from the intense slope that sets the house back slightly from the road, maybe it’s common vegetation between sites, maybe I just think it blends in because I am used to it. Inside the house is full of wide-open spaces and large windows facing the forest behind. To me that house is a person, a member of my family, a part of who I am. I grew up with it as a place that I lived in, a place where I became who I am, a place where I took refuge, a place I will go back to and will always love. It is the perfect house for my family. There has always been something about it for me that made it seem nothing like other houses, it never felt like walls and rooms and hinges, but more like a specific space, a place to be a place to exist as a person and as a family and as a community. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkag1z9fm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.366161,29.662374]}},{"properties":{"name":"Granada Hills, CA (Willis)","description":"Posted by Sensorgranada hills, caVan Gogh Elementary School on Van Gogh Street. Granada Hills, California. The terms that are associated with the place “Van Gogh Street School” are often Vincent Van Gogh, artwork, paintings, or portraits. As a successful graduate of Van Gogh Street School, it is upsetting and discouraging to know that the place is not known for itself, its landscape, its history, its diversity, or its stories, but rather as a small school on a street that may or may not be named after the renowned artist. Being a kid who will always be from Van Gogh Street School, I can taste its sweetness and bitterness, feel its warmth and coldness, and touch its existence and emptiness. Van Gogh Street School and I have a deep relationship and a meaningful history. Van Gogh Street School, after all, is a place where I have failed, but also a place where I began to find my path of character and success.\n\tRoom forty-four had always belonged to Mrs. Trische Diaz until she retired after teaching my third grade class. The room was decorated very nicely with artworks, maps, fingerprints, poems, and autobiographies. Each of us had our own box with our name tag that we could put our crayons, pencils, and markers in. More specifically, I remembered the map of the United States on the back wall of the room. Room forty-four was a very nice room and Mrs. Diaz was an incredible teacher. On the day that ultimately established the relationship between Van Gogh Street School and me, however, Mrs. Diaz was absent. The substitute (I can not remember her name) conducted an hour lesson on the states. When she asked, “Class, tell me the largest second state of our country?” As a fierce competitor, I eagerly raised my right arm and replied, “Taxi”. However, I meant “Texas”. I was smart. I knew the answer, but I struggled with language barrier. While laughter burst out in the entire room, room forty-four became the place of darkness and pain in my eight-year-old mind. I hated my classmates; I hated the U.S. map on the back of the room; I hated room forty-four; I hated the substitute for asking the question; I hate Mrs. Diaz simply because she developed the lesson plans; I hated Van Gogh Street School. Despite the artificial decorations on the walls, the place was ugly. \n\tVan Gogh Street School is a place that I have come to known very well as it has served as a catalyst for my drive to succeed in the past ten years of my life. I can still taste the sweetness and feel the warmth for the strong friendships I have made, yet I can also taste the bitterness and feel the coldness for the ridicules I have faced. Despite the tears and embarrassments, I have learned to appreciate the place as it has assisted me in developing determination and will. Ten years later, I can still feel its existence as the memory is engraved in my soul, but I can also feel its emptiness as the place has once been filled with cruelty. Van Gogh Street School in Granada Hills is more than a simple school on Van Gogh Street; it is a place where a heart has been crushed but a dream has began. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkaozwwmq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.522222,34.264722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ithaca, NY","description":"Posted by SensorHere is where our stories meet....<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkadlj7rr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.4978027344,42.4376472001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ji Sun","description":"Posted by SensorThis place is a mortuary room of the hospital where my grandma passed away about 5 years ago. I tried my best to give the description of the room and how the room affected me. \n\nFifteen or so mortuary rooms were linearly arranged throughout the hallway. Middle of the Innermost of the room, the brown, well-polished coffin was laid covered with white chrysanthemum. The white chrysanthemum over the coffin reminds me of the shape of the tomb where the coffin would be buried under the cold ground. The portraits were surrounded by the white chrysanthemum. Around the corner, passing by this cold wall, there was a common lounge furnitured with comfy chairs with a little standing café where sells some coffees and snacks for emotionally exhausted. Some people were sinking into the comfy sofas and tried to let go their emotions by having a trivial conversation with each other. Perhaps, they did find some comfort in this area even though I did not find such a thing there. \nI, my mother, and other family members were sitting on the floor in the mortuary room. The floor was warm; it was like my grandma’s warmth when she was alive. We all felt the warmth. However, we were surrounded the dreary, desolate atmosphere. Then when I got up and touched a wall for a little support, I felt icy emptiness through the wall – the coldness that would take away the warmth of the floor I was touching. As I got out of the room, the hollowness overcame on me, and I recognized that the eye of the cold wall was looking at me and others. The cement cold gray wall was everywhere – in the hallways, around the corner, even in the mortuary room. The wall watches everything – people sobbing, workers, and cold corps in the coffins. It does not say anything, does not make any noises, but just watches every move of everything. Suddenly, it looked at me and made me realized that I had not known how to react on death of my grandma. I knew how I was supposed to feel and react, like others did - grieving, bursting into tears, or sobbing – ways to express emotions. But I did not. The sharp of eye penetrated me as I felt like naked with the wall’s presence. I was embarrassed and still did not know what to do. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkagg4izx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[128.49609375,36.0313317763]}},{"properties":{"name":"Maple Glen, PA (Christine)","description":"Posted by Sensormaple glen, paI push the crossing button and wait for the lighted man to appear and tell me to cross the road.

The grass is unrealistically bright green, and there is one tree that looks like it does not belong.  It looks like it belongs in an African desert, in some wild jungle— but not here, not in suburban Pennsylvania.  The breeze blows lazily and starts to play around the willow branches of the tree and around the strands of my dark, shiny hair.  The lot is empty, because it is a Sunday.  The tar of the parking lot is hot.  I can tell without touching it, because the sun beats down mercilessly on the ground and waves of heat rising from the hot ground start to blur the landscape.  Meanwhile, I can hear the small children playing on the new playground, and I glance over to see them swinging on the swing and climbing the monkey bars.  The playground, with it’s metal, cold parts becomes a friendly, colorful, playful place for the children.

I would never know the names of any of these rocks, but classification did not matter to me. I was young—there were vibrant, colorful rocks, such as the bright oranges and red, flashy, glittery rocks, such as the jagged, medium-sized, beautiful yellow stone I returned to on an almost daily basis, and, of course, the most memorable rock of all: a mostly transparent gem with an entire fossilized outline of an insect clearly formed inside of it.\nI had finally come out of my shell that year; I was no longer the shy, know-it-all who kept to myself. The smooth, fossilized rock I adored was the person I was further into the past—trapped, unheard, and unseen—and my enrollment in eighth grade earth science marked a change in me that removed that label of introversion from my life. Unfortunately this transformation was unfavorable to my teacher, Mr. Maliwacki, who had to put up with my constant and consistent disruptive behavior. I was still very intelligent and I still worked hard (I had straight A’s throughout the course), but I was immature. When the lecture bored me for the slightest moment, that was it—I was off in my own world, thinking about where I was going to go after school (earth science was the last class of the day), or what I wanted for dinner that night, or what I was going do in the upcoming weekend; I was in my own world. During this time, Mr. Maliwacki spoke, but that was all I knew. It was not a priority for me to comprehend his words while I spoke to my classmates nearby about the weekend. He found my constant initiation of conversation rude and disrespectful, as if every time I spoke it was in mockery of him. He would tell me to stand in the corner like a kindergartener, or sentence me to sit in his lab room (the smell of the lab room was punishment enough) for a period of time, and somehow I was the only one to ever receive such punishments. I remember the row of rocks that started with the letter “C” on his shelf, and relocating my favorite rocks each time I reentered the laboratory room. Suddenly my consequential relocation into the lab room was becoming less of a punishment and more of a treat. “Do not touch or move any rocks,” the sign read, which I always found overly wordy and unnecessary, and simply writing “do not touch” would suffice and imply the second part of the command. They were too beautiful, though—too soft and too smooth to take the sign seriously. The first time I was ever made to spend the class in there (before I had become used to spending most of my time in there), I discovered that perfectly preserved fossilized rock, and  memorized where I would be able to find it again next time I spoke too much during class. The penalty had become a blessing (I quickly grew accustomed to the smell as well). Standing in the corner was a tiring, humiliating punishment that I grew to hate, but being sent into the lab room simply became a consequence that I did not mind, and to the ironic reversal of effect for my teacher, I became unafraid to disrupt class. \nI could have just approached Mr. Maliwacki politely after class one day and informed him of my interest in his collection, but I did not. I instead chose a path of immaturity and recognition for such childishness to return to the laboratory room. I was finally no longer an unheard body, and I was able to reunite with the impressive collection, but I was gaining attention in all the wrong ways. It is not until later that I realized my friends did not find my consistent disruptions and sentences to individualized punishments as humorous and I had. I was still just as immature as I was—I just exposed it to everyone that year. Maybe I was not so different from fossilized insect entrapped in the smooth, ancient rock. I had become stuck in a barrier as well, and if I did not make a transformation to my recent behaviors, I, too, would be “fossilized” in a state of immaturity and naiveté. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkale48lq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.1956787109,42.2081764593]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mike Z.

I must’ve looked like either an idiot who didn’t know how to use a camera or a stalker camping out for Angelina Jolie.\n            We used to call that ledge the “Wall” and it was where all sorts of shady underworld deals went place. Swingers and potheads gathered before and after school to exchange stories and whatever else they enjoyed exchanging. I was never part of that crowd, but I did have the biggest crush on this one girl who was. She had green highlights in her hair, three earrings on each ear, a cigarette on her lips and the hottest nonchalant attitude. I had dorky Harry Potter glasses, a Calculus textbook and the pervading smell of Ramin noodles. I didn’t have to take any derivatives to figure out that she was way out of my league.\n            It’s not the trip up those stairs that’s painful, but the trip down. It’s hopping down the wet steps on a rainy day, ecstatic while holding my girlfriend’s hand, tripping, and falling on my butt. It’s not only falling on my butt, but sliding on my butt down four steps, plop, plop, plop, plop, ouch. It’s having a sore butt for weeks, and it’s realizing that my girlfriend was smart to have let go of my hand at the slightest sign of trouble.\n            A bridge just connects two points. Tribeca Bridge was a portal, funneling all us students into the second floor entrance of the school. Its lines ran in linear perspective across the bustling King’s Highway as I sauntered down, clad in my leather jacket, drinking my coffee and smoking a cigarette that was my breakfast of legal stimulants. Except this time, one of my teachers walked up behind me and said, “Mike, are you going for a Jimmy Dean look or something?” I had never felt so silly in my life.\nStuyvesant High School isn’t much. It’s a pale orange, ten-story building of stone, metal and glass, and a mere addition to the city’s jagged skyline. It’s an assembly line that churns out students to various institutions of higher education. It’s cold, it’s bare, and it’s ruthless. But I haven’t left it, at least not yet. I haven’t been able to say goodbye to it even though I’m here. Its five minute warning bell and period ending bells form the soundtrack of academia. It was an enclave in a busy city, a snow globe isolated from this ridiculous notion of the “real world.” It was a place some earlier version of Michael Zhang lived fabulous memories, and as long as I can help it, he’s there right now, walking down Chambers Street, up those stairs, across the bridge, and into a life I’ve never left.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkame3cw4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.0139,40.717654]}},{"properties":{"name":"Qingdao, China (Feifei)","description":"Posted by Sensor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/Qingdao_title.jpg\">qingdao, chinaQingdao is a city of ambivalence. The oldest part of the city is filled\nwith both European and oriental influences; although the juxtaposition of\nwestern churches and Chinese temple is what adds to Qingdao’s unique\ncharm, it also remind everyone underneath the city’s beauty the shame of\nwestern occupation during the latter part of Qing Dynesty. As a child\nliving in the oldest part of Qingdao, I was completely unaware of the\ncity’s complex history. All I became conscious of is the comfortable\ncolors of yellow walls, red roofs, green trees, and blue sea. I am so\nfamiliar and at ease with these colors that any place that looks otherwise\nseem strange to me, and therefore, I know it can never be my home. My\nchildhood home is situated at the center of old Qingdao. It was 5 minutes\nfrom the hospital that I was born, 8 minutes from my favorite playground,\n10 minutes from my elementary school, and 15 minutes from the sea shore.\nThe memory of me and my grandparents climbing up the breezy hill of the\nLutheran Church on a hot summer night, and going to the shoreline after\nthe sea receded to catch crab and little fish is something that I always\nhold on to no matter where I was living in the world. For 9 years, that\narea of Qingdao was the center of my life. Consequently, my first\nrecognition of the meaning of “growing up” was not from the increase of\npersonal responsibilities, but from the moving away of my childhood home\nand integrating into a bigger world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkah55s7y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[120.34417,36.08139]}},{"properties":{"name":"Temple City, CA (Christine)","description":"Posted by Sensortemple city, caThe Temple City Library is buried among the midst of the bridal shops, located next to the fire department and connected to a park that is more like a green, mossy lawn.  The library has only one floor with only two sections which are labeled “adult” and “children” in the bold green writing; there is no in between.  In the center of this great divide is a checkout center, and behind it is the staff office.  The library has remained the same over the past years.  With the exception of the automatic clear glass doors that are awkwardly placed and the DVD section, the library has stayed the same.  Next to the shelves of DVDs are old books, copies of Reader’s Digest, and a newsletter called the Temple City Voice.  Time slows down as I enter.  The smell of postage stamps (I don’t know why) permeates the room, and the floor is immaculately clean.  The adult section is an ugly beige, with an empty help desk and rows and rows of books that are organized by subject: “Psychology 171.05- Physiology 210” one of the book shelf headings reads.  I deliberately ignore the headings, and move from row to row, pretending to explore, but am simply bored by the uniformity of everything.  Impulsively, I turn to the children’s section with it small shelves, and scattered chairs. Some books litter the floor and round tables.  I pass an entire collection of the Babysitter’s Club, The Boxcar Children, and then enter the mystery books section.  I see the yellow binding of a Nancy Drew book and see a Hardy Boys book not too far off in the distance. Feeling self-conscious I head for the checkout desk with a book I simply just picked up without really thinking.\n In front of the library is a huge white, gazebo that is in the middle of the grass. Sometimes there is a couple posing for wedding pictures or an old jazz group performing.  The gazebo is so different in its stark white, complexity, and struggles to fit in with the age old library, city council, and neighboring homes.  Yet this monstrous, white building miraculously graces dozens of brochures and is considered the center of everything.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkamnz9a7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.053652,34.101586]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zhengzhou, China (Brian)","description":"Posted by Sensor“Where is that?”\n\nI anticipate that question whenever I tell others that I went to Zhengzhou, China over the summer. I also anticipate the blank, polite nods I get when I answer their question. Few have heard of it; it’s one of those places that need that attached description. Even fewer actually understand.\n\nZhengzhou is a city of three million lost in a sea of one billion. The capital of the Henan province, it is located in inland China about three hundred miles southeast of Beijing. But those are just merely facts; trivialities that eventually draw blank stares and meaningless “Oh, I see” s.\n\nZhengzhou had many things: It had a daily morning rush hour; save for the face that the streets were instead filled with hundreds of bicycles, weaving through the few cars that did congest the narrow roads. It had a sky, but a gray sky instead of our blue – the smog from nearby factories formed a thick blanket of dull grey. It was also home to an agricultural university which was home to nine outdoor basketball courts and the smell of manure. Across from the university was the All Nations Language School where we stayed for two weeks on a short-term mission under the guise of an English summer camp.\n\nThe ANLS was located on the fourth floor of an old office building. There was a front area with two hallways; one led to the classrooms and dining area and the other led to the dorm rooms. Various distinct images of the school still linger in my mind: the hot corridor where we would hang our laundry, the kink in one of the laundry lines that caused it to get stuck, the broken urinals, the toilets which required us to squat, the window above the bathroom sink where we were used to seeing mirrors, the second classroom down the main hallway that had the keyboard and guitar that we loved to play, the “cold” water dispensers from which only lukewarm water would come out, the office that had the only computers with working internet, and the three-inch thin “mattresses” we slept on. The strongest memory that I have of that place, however, is the bond that we developed with our students there. A bond of love, which transcended barriers of culture and language…\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fqkai7vwh4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[113.659572601,34.8043953022]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/270750","metadata":null,"contact_name":"sensor","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:sensor","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/270750","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":15,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=270750,platial:user=sensor","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":43418}
