Their description was enticing: a sleepy, friendly little fishing town near some of the most amazing natural wonders Belize has to offer. A bonus was that many people speak English. We took the bait.\r\n\r\nGetting there was an adventure. We took a small airplane from Belize City to Dangriga, where our host picked us up. Tricia drove us the rest of the way, expertly avoiding potholes and keeping our momentum up through rim-deep muck, casually pointing out a spot on the road where several months ago a large reptile had planted itself on the roadbed for several days.\r\nHopkins is several narrow dirt and sand streets, lined with palm trees and brightly-coloured houses on stilts. Children in immaculately clean uniforms line up for school buses as mothers and fathers keep a watchful eye on them. Several small tourist businesses are run by people who seem to be as happy to chat as they are to make a sale. Glad you made it, good to see you. The high-pressure tourist sales pitch isn’t part of the “Hopkins Experience.”\r\nThe people of Hopkins are resilient. Primarily Garifuna they descended from Africans who escaped slave ships wrecked off St. Vincent, a nearby island, and from the Island Carib Indians. They rebuilt their lives in the lush coastal region, most fishing in the warm Caribbean waters to get by. Then, in the late eighteenth century, the British attempted to round up many of the Garifuna and deport them to an island off the coast of Honduras. \r\n\r\nIt didn’t go exactly to plan. Some Garifuna escaped and made it back. Now, every year villagers celebrate “Garifuna Settlement Day” each November 19th. It’s a huge party, filled with drumbeats and voices celebrating their return to the area. Their excitement is understandable.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bonp6n14"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.45093,17.13029]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kathmandu, Nepal","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/Naldum_Nepal.jpg\">Kathmandu city is the capital of Nepal with a population of 1.5 million inhabitants counting the suburban area. The city is a fascinating melange of old heritage and modern buildings mixing an astonishing beauty of some sites with an appalling poverty.\r\nNow Kathmandu is grid locked with cars, Tata trucks, buses, motorcycles, three wheelers and rickshaws blowing dust all over you. \r\nKathmandu is full of colour, smell and noise. It is an exciting and vibrant city. W. Kirkpatrick wrote in 1811 “There are nearly as many temples as houses, and as many idols as inhabitants” . The people follow two main religions: Buddhism and Hinduism. The two main sights for Buddhists are Boudhanath and Swayambhunath. The main temples for Hindus are Pashupatinath (cremation site) in Kathmandu and Changu Nayaran near Bhaktapur which I will later describe in another report. I love this mixture of religions, everybody lives in harmony and peace. The city is also full of small temples dedicated to many Hindu Gods as well as smaller Buddhist stupas with all kind of architecture. \r\n\r\nYou can walk virtually pretty much everywhere in the city, but if you do not feel like walking you can always get a rickshaw or taxi. If you are going a long way there are buses going to many directions from the city bus park. Comparing to western cities taxis are cheap, especially if you share. \r\n\r\nMy favourite spot is the GREAT STUPA OF BOUDHANATH. \r\nThis ancient reliquary, on the northeast of Kathmandu is the spiritual nerve centre of Nepal’s Tibetan and Sherpa community. The stupa is the symbol of enlightenment. Each different shape represent one of the five elements: earth, water, air, fire and sphere. Brought together in the form of a stupa, their unity reflect the structure of the universe itself. An irregular 16-sided wall enclosure surrounds the stupa. The stupa consist of three platforms, decreasing in size, symbolising EARTH; two circular plinths supporting the hemisphere of the Stupa symbolising WATER and the tower, with the four faces bearing the eyes of the omnipresent God. Between each pair of eyes is the “third eye”, symbol of wisdom. The 13 steps of the pyramid represent the ladder to enlightenment, the triangular shape being the abstract form of the FIRE. At the top of the tower is a gilded canopy, the embodiment of AIR. The spire is the sumbol of SHERE.  \r\nnot to miss is SWAYAMBHUNATH (also known as the Monkey temple) is situated on a hill top 2Km west of Kathmandu. It is the second largest Buddhist shrine in the valley after Boudhanath. It means \"self - arisen”. \r\nAlso painted with the eyes of the omnipresent God, the stupa is the centre piece of the complex. Both Hindus and Buddhists climb the seemlessly endless stairs (365) to pray and throw grain to the monkeys and pigeons that have claimed the temple as their own. From the top of the temple you can have a great view over the city and the Kathmandu valley.\r\nThere is also the Hindu temple of Hariti Mandir dedicated to Harati, the goddess of smallpox. Many families come here to pray that their young child will not catch the illness. Behind the stupa on a smaller hill a temple is dedicated to Saraswati the goddess of learning.\r\nThe temple was first created in the 14th century and has remained unchanged since, apart from a few alterations.\r\nThe entrance cost 100NPR, paid at the top of the stairs.\r\n \r\nDURBAR SQUARE is a must. The cost is 200Npr, the ticket is valid for one day, but if you go to the offices they can make you a visitor pass and extent it for a month for the same price. The square contains more than 50 important monuments, shrines and temples. The mains buildings are the house of the Kumari (the living goddess), Nepalis worship young girls known as Kumaris. The Kumari is a prepubescent girl worshiped as a living incarnation of the goddess Taleju. The huge former Royal Palace called Hanuman Doka. (Entrance of 250 NPR on the top of Durbar Square ticket). This temple is full of wood carvings and other religious symbols.\r\n\r\nAccomodation in the city:\r\nThe most convenient place to stay is Thamel in the heart of the city, It ranges from the simple guest house (over 100) to some posh hotels. You can get a bed from 3$ a night in Budget guest houses such as Hotel California, in the medium range you will find the Kathmandu Guest House, which is the best know in town (see www.kathmanduguesthouse.com for more info), prices range from 6$ to 15$ a night, advance bookings are essentials! Also you can stay in the Pilgrim’s guesthouse, in peaceful environment . Then you have the three stars hotels, I stayed in the hotel Marshyandi in the north of Thamel, very comfy hotel with cable TV, having booked it via a travel agent in the UK, my room only cost me 15$ breakfast included! Laundry services offered as well.\r\nThen you have the top 5* hotels such as The Yak and Yeti and hotel de L Annapurna.    \r\nThere are many small eateries in the city, where you sample traditional Nepalese dishes such as dal bhaat (lentils and rice) and momo (dumplings with veg. or meat). But after spending a few weeks in the mountains, you feel like having a treat! You can find nice restaurants.\r\n\r\nOther sites:\r\nBUDDHA NILKANTHA (meaning Old Blue Neck) is dedicated to Vishnu. It was consecrated in 642. This huge 6 meters long sculpture is carved from a black stone. Vishnu reclines on the coils of the snake Ananta whose 11 hoods form a garland around his his head.\r\n\r\nDHARAHARA TOWER, is a tall minaret like structure situated near the post office. It was erected in 1832 by the Prime Minister Bhishem Thapa for use as a military observation point. The view from the top is excellent but it will cost you 299 NPR to get in, you will need to leave your rucksack in the lockers at the entrance.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bot33azg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[85.38849,27.6811]}},{"properties":{"name":"L'ile Maurice","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/Maurice27.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/fond_ecran_0002_1024_768.jpg\">The Key to the Indian Ocean - Mauritius!!\r\n\r\nThis cosmopolitain country has a vast array of cultures, traditions and cuisine. \r\n\r\nA must for all travellers looking for paradise - so it\\'s paradise found not lost!!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bonrc30g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[57.39258,-20.38583]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ladispoli, Italy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/ladispoli.jpg\">LadispoliLadispoli is a tiny city, not far from Rome.

Lukla is a small village situated at 2860m in the Khumbu region of the Himalayas. The town developed as a township of lodges since the construction of the airstrip by Sir Edmond Hillary in 1964. It is also here that a few years later Hillary will loose his wife and children in a terrible plane crash. Most trekkers will fly to Lukla from Kathmandu to start their treks in the Everest area. At the airport lots of porters and guides will offer their services to the visitors. Lukla is also full of mountain climbing and trekking equipment shops, so trekkers can also do last minute shopping, if they can\\'t find find what they want here, they have another chance in Namche Baazar further up.\r\nThe airport is surrounded by army barracks to protect it from the Maoist rebels.\r\nLukla businesses are very dependant of the weather, if the weather is bad planes can\\'t land, hundreds of people can them crowd in the lodges waiting to leave back to Kathmandu.\r\nI have to admit that Lukla is not the most pretty village in the area, as it does not truly represent the sherpa culture<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bow9pygx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[86.74805,27.44979]}},{"properties":{"name":"Malaga, Spain","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/malaga_city_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/SPA_Malaga_webshotslabrcajun1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/48_parador_malaga_gibralfaro01.jpg\">Two friends of mine own a flat in a lovely place in Calahonda.

And just one or two \"Dodgy Daves\", with broad noses! Fab night at \"Bunny\\'s\", a drag cabaret club. Of course most of the audience was British, so we all had a good old knees up. I also love foraging around in the local supermarkets. Everything seems so much better than our stuff. It\\'s just psychological, really.

Bhutan is about the size of Switzerland (33 395 sq.km) but only have 690 000 inhabitants. Thimphu is the capital, with Paro being the second town of the country. Bhutan restrict the numbers of tourists allowed into the country. Tourists must arrive with a pre-booked tour. Bhutan policy of restricting tourism has three purposes, 1) it preserves the natural environment and the lifestyle of the locals, 2) it recognises the lack of infrastructure, and the rugged terrain, and 3) by charging all travellers a daily package fee for tourist services (hotels, transport, meals..) Bhutan is able to earn the foreign currency it needs for vital expenditure in other areas of development, (hospitals, schools...). When you arrive in Bhutan by plane, you will land in Paro which is situated in the west of the country. Just before I landed, I noticed the golden roof of the local Dzong. I knew straight away that I would love this area and that it was somewhere special. The town of Paro is at 2280m and was constructed in 1985, but all houses are built according to the strict Bhutanese architectural style. \r\nThe local currency is the Ngultrum (NU) and has the same value as the Indian rupee, 1 is worth around 45NU. \r\nPARO DZONG, also nicknamed the “Heap of Jewels“, is next to the river. You could almost see its image reflecting on the water. The Dzong is one of the finest example of Bhutanese architecture. It was built in 1644 and it was one of Bhutan’s strongest fortress to defend the valley from invasions from Tibet. Today it is an administrative building for the district of Paro but also counts a monastic community of 200 monks. I enjoyed spinning the prayer wheels in the courtyard, thinking of my coming trip to the Everest Base Camp trek and praying to myself for a safe journey. This monastery set the tone for our trip to Bhutan as it was the first monastery that we saw, that was really amazing! \r\nThe TAKTSHANG LHAKHANG MONASTERY is really awesome. It is also known as the Tiger’s Nest and it is Bhutan most recognisable image. It gets its name due to the story that Guru Rimpoche came to Taktshang, flying on the back of a tigress. He meditated for 3 months in a cave and converted the Paro valley to Buddhism. The monastery is built over the cave where Guru Rimpoche meditated. It is perched on the side of a 900m cliff. Taktshang is one of the most venerated pilgrim sites in the Himalayas and contains 13 holy places. In April 1998, the monastery was burned down, it was a national catastrophe but was rebuilt by 2002. The monastery is accessible after a short drive from Paro, and then it is about a gentle hour trail through a pine forest that goes up to a viewing platform. Here there is a tea-house where you can purchase refreshments and souvenirs. On the way up you will be able to see views over the valley of Paro, prayers flags and Chortens.  \r\nAnother site is Drukgyel Dzong it is situated not far from Paro. Situated at the foot of Mt Jomolhari (7314m), this peak has never been climbed as it is a protected peak.\r\nThe village of Drukgyel is very pretty with old Bhutanese farmhouses. The Dzong was built in 1647 to commemorate the victory over Tibetans. Today the fortress is in ruins following a terrible fire in 1951.\r\nA unique sight are the locals. Bhutanese are very friendly and hospitable. They are very happy, innocent and they are proud of their culture. The girls at the hotel were helping me to put on my Kira, (the National Dress), as it was difficult. All Bhutanese wear the National Dress while in public. The men wear a Gho to knee length with long socks, which is in one piece like a bath robe. Patterns are different but some look like Scottish tartans! The women wear the Kira, in two pieces; a long floor-length dress that wraps around the body and the top is like a jacket called a toego.The National Museum of Bhutan. It was previously Ta-Dzong, a former watch tower with 356 years of history behind it. It is an unusually round 7-storey building with 2,5 meters thick walls. The museum was established in 1968. The Museum has in its possession over 3000 works of arts, covering 1500 years of Bhutanese cultural heritage. In the museum you will find old armours, arms, Buddhist ritual objects, stuffed animals, traditional costumes, old Thangkas as well as Neolithic tools, without mentioning a superb collection of stamps.\r\nMay I recommend The Red Panda beer. This Bhutanese unfiltered brew is really nice. I have to admit that I was first sceptical about drinking it, but it was really nice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4boqg74ji"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[89.42184,27.43029]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salvador, Bahia, Brazil","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/1_105.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/1_198.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/0/1_196.jpg\">Do not miss Olodum on Sundays at Pelourinho (typical brazilian music with drums), Baravento at Farol da Barra (bar-restaurant by the beach), Restaurante da Dada (typical food from Bahia - very hot!), Jeep tour in the Dunes, Projeto Tamar at Praia do Forte (eco-tourism: \"save the turtles\"), Farol da Barra (fort built 16th century), Panoramic visite (view of the port), Ilha Itapiraca (paradise island - don\\'t miss the dish called: \"Moqueca de Camarao\"... wow !!!)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bos1jtb9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-38.496094,-12.993853]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thimphu, Bhutan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/bhutan_2_.jpg\">Thimphu is the capital of the Kingdom of Bhutan. The population is of 50000 habitants. Most of them are monks, members of the Royal family and civil servants with a growing middle class.\r\nWhen we entered the city it was really quiet, it was like the town was deserted. There were no other cars to be seen, it was so strange for a capital city. There are no traffic jam compared to other cities (a complete change from what I have seen in Kathmandu!)Thimphu does not have any traffic lights, only have a policeman directing traffic from a booth at a roundabout. Thimphu used to have a set of traffic lights but residents complained that they were ugly, so the local council took them down within weeks. We stopped at a petrol station, which was built in the traditional style. By a Royal decree, all buildings in Bhutan must be built in a traditional style. Thimphu only emerged as the capital city in 1953, but at the time it was only a dzong (Tashichoedzong), surrounded by small farms scattered through the valley. It is only since the 1970’s that the town started to develop and be as it is now. Thimphu is crossed by the Wang Chhu river. Thimphu also has got the highest golf course in the world.\r\nThe majors sites are: Tashichoedzong (\"fortress of the auspicious religion\"):\r\nThe Dzong is closed during business hours, you can only visit it during “off hours”, that’s means after five o’clock in the afternoon. The Dzong dates back from 1216. It was reconstructed many times after destructions and fires. The current Dzong dates from 1969. It was refurbished because the Dzong became the seat of the government. The entrance of the Dzong is located on the eastern side, paintings of Guardians of the Four Directions welcome the visitors after climbing a staircase. The first courtyard is the courtyard of the central administration, around it are all the ministries and the Royal Chamber. Then through a small door you arrive in the second courtyard, which is the Monastic quarters. It is where the central tower is located. Most buildings are beautifully decorated with mantras and mandalas representing the universe. Thimphu mini zoo: Situated near the “telecom tower hill”, here you can see the takin, the national animal of Bhutan. The takin with its bovine type body is covered with long yellow brown hairs. Its average weigh is 350 Kg.\r\nNational Memorial Chorten: Built in 1974, it is one of the most visible religious structure in Thimphu. It was built to honour the memory of the third king Jigme Dorji Wandchuck.\r\nChangangka Dzong: This is one of the oldest temple in the Thimphu valley. It dates from the 15th century and was restored in 1998. National Institute of Traditional Medicine: This institute prepares traditional medicinal herbal treatments for different illnesses. The museum comprises of a large collection of plants and roots used in medicine. The centre also has a shop where you can buy herbal teas. \r\nThe Post office: A heaven for all stamps collectors! (But not for my wallet!). Bhutan is well known for its philatelic pride. Stamps depict Bhutan\\'s unique culture. \r\nI went to watch a competition on the archery field.\r\nArchery is Bhutan\\'s national sport and is played all year round. 2 painted targets 30cm large and 120cm high are placed at each end. The bows and arrows are made of special kind of bamboo, the target is 120 metre away. Team members encourage (like cheerleaders) their archer on the other side of the field. They stand really close from the target. Each team usually consist of 11 members. The first team to reach 33 points wins the match. The method of scoring is complicated as if an arrow lands within an arrow\\'s lengh of the target even without hitting it, it also counts. Every time an archer hits the target his team members will perform a kind of victory dance on the field. It was very entertaining as all players were wearing the Gho, the national costume. \r\nAnother major site outse Thimphu is Punaka: About 2 hours drive from Thimphu is the Dzong of Punaka.\r\nThe Dzong is 1350m high. It stands at the confluence of the Mo Chhu and Po Chhu rivers. At first sight the Dzong looks like a giant ship floating on the river.\r\nThe Dzong was built in 1637. It really represent Bhutanese rich art and architecture of the country. This Dzong contains 21 temples. Punakha Dzong is one of the most historic dzongs in the whole country. According to one legend, the head Lama of the Dzong realised that he was outnumbered by the pursuing Tibetan army. He ordered his troops to leave the Dzong from the hidden exit, then circle around a hillock and enter the fortress again and again through the main entrance in full view of the enemy. It gave a false impression of a huge reinforcement. It worked and the Tibetan army did not attack.\r\nPunaka Dzong is the administrative and religious centre of the district.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bonbbgwh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[89.63882,27.46807]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tokyo, Japan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/tokyo_st.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/Tokyo_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/sumo.jpg\">The Imperial Palace.\r\nAt the very heart of Tokyo - a mega-metropolis of 12 million inhabitants - is a large expanse of greenery, which is the setting for the Kokyo, the Imperial Palace. Surrounded by a moat, it was built on the site of the castle of the Tokugawa shoguns, the feudal lords who ruled the old city of Edo for more than 250 years from 1603. In 1868 the shogunate was overthrown in the Meiji Restoration of imperial rule, and Edo was renamed To-kyo (\\'Eastern Capital\\'), taking the role previously held by Kyoto. The Meiji palace was destroyed in the Second World War, but rebuilt in traditional style. It is usually closed to the public, but various famous landmarks can be seen. They include the Nijubashi \\'double bridge\\', and the Otemon Gate that leads to the Kokyo Higashi Gyoen (Imperial Palace East Garden), which includes a traditional Japanese garden. Close by, to the north of the garden, is the National Museum of Modern Art (exhibiting cutting-edge 20th and 21st-century Japanese art), and its separate Crafts Gallery (exquisite textiles, ceramics, glass, lacquerware, metalwork, from 1868 on). The palace is in the Chiyoda ward (municipal district), which also contains the Marunouchi business quarter and the Akihabara shopping area, dubbed the \\'Electric Town\\' for its thousands of shops selling electronic wizardry, especially in its main street Chuo-Dori. \r\nGinza.\r\nConsumer culture is a dominant theme in modern Tokyo life, and there is no better place to participate than Ginza, the city\\'s premier district for shopping and entertainment. It is part of the Chuo (\\'centre\\') ward, close to the Imperial Palace. Here you will find the famous department stores such as Wako, Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya and Matsuya. Ginza is also a good place to hunt down, test and marvel at the latest in Japanese hi-tech gizmos, notably at the Sony Building, which has eight storeys of hands-on displays. There are small museums and galleries all over Tokyo: Ginza has scores of them. Among them is the Riccar Museum (on the seventh floor of the Riccar Building), which has a fine collection of Ukiyo-e woodblock prints by the great 18th and 19th-century Japanese printmakers such as Hokusai, Hiroshige and Utamaro. Ginza also has dozens of tearooms, cafés and restaurants of all descriptions. Also part of the Chuo ward is the famous and huge Tsukiji fish market, where lively auctions take place early each day (except Sundays).  \r\nMeiji Shrine.\r\nThe most famous of all the Shinto shrines of Tokyo is the Meiji Jingu in the Shibuya ward, dedicated to Emperor Meiji (ruled 1867-1912) and built in 1920. A winding gravel paths leads through a huge torii entrance gate and woods to a stunning complex of wooden buildings beneath dramatically curving roofs. The shrine is the focus of huge celebrations during festivals, notably the \\'Coming of Age\\' festival (second Monday in January, for men and women who are reaching the age of 20) and the \\'Three-Five-Seven\\' festival, for children reaching those ages (15 November), and some two million people come here on New Year\\'s Eve. \r\nUeno Park.\r\nEstablished in 1868, in the Taito ward, this was Tokyo\\'s first public park and it remains one of its most beautiful. It is also home to a cluster of some of its best museums and galleries. This includes the Tokyo National Museum, containing Japan\\'s greatest art collection (paintings, woodblock prints, swords and armour and many other artefacts). The collection is spread over four buildings: Honkan (the main building, devoted to Japanese art); Heiseikan (Japanese archaeology); Toyokan (Far Eastern collection); and the Gallery of Horyuji Treasures for a precious temple collection, housed in a remarkable building (1999) designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, who also designed the celebrated new MoMA in New York. The park also contains the National Museum of Western Art, where work by many of the great names is displayed in a building by Le Corbusier; the National Science Museum (main building currently under renovation); a zoo; and several old shrines and temples, including the 17th-century Ueno Toshogu, a temple to the Shogun Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa shogunate. There is also has a large boating lake, beside which stands the delightful Shitamachi Museum, displaying the reconstructed houses and shops of ordinary folk in early 20th-century Tokyo. The park is especially beautiful in spring when the cherry blossom attracts thousands of people indulging in the tradition of hanami (cherry blossom viewing). \r\nAsakusa Kannon.\r\nAlso known as the Senso-ji Temple, the Asakusa Kannon in the Taito ward is the largest and most popular Buddhist temple in Tokyo. It is also the oldest, said to date from AD 628. The story goes that, in that year, two fishermen-brothers found a small statue of Kannon, the Goddess of Mercy, in the River Sumida nearby, and this temple was built for it; the Kannon statue was later treated as a Buddha image. The famous giant red paper lantern of the Kaminarimon (\\'Thunder Gate\\') leads visitors first to the old Nakamise shopping street, lined with stalls selling traditional souvenirs and snacks. Beyond the Hozomon gate, decorated with a giant straw sandal, lies the Kannondo (Kannon Hall) - originally built in 649, destroyed in the war and rebuilt in 1958 - as well as the five-tiered pagoda called the Gojuto, which is said to house ashes of the Buddha. The Shinto shrine next door, the Asakusa Jinja, was built to protect the Buddhist temple, and both become the focus of Tokyo\\'s largest Shinto \\'matsuri\\', festival, each spring.  \r\nEdo-Tokyo Museum.\r\nFor a vivid insight into Tokyo\\'s past, go to the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Ryogoku, in the Sumida ward on the eastern edge of the city. The huge, ultra-modern building was apparently inspired by traditional warehouse on stilts, but looks more like a spaceship. Inside it presents a picture of the history of the Tokyo and all the districts from which the city is composed, covering culture and lifestyle plus major historical events, from the Edo of the Tokugawa shoguns to modern Tokyo. The 50 life-size replicas of buildings and interiors include a Kabuki theatre.\r\nSumo at Ryogoku Kogukikan.\r\nRyogoku is also famous as the home of sumo wrestling. It contains the Kogukikan National Sumo Stadium, as well as most of the sumo \\'stables\\', where the wrestlers live and are trained. Tournaments, called basho, last 15 days and are held six times a year, when tickets are available to join 10,000 other spectators in the stadium (take bioculars for the cheaper seats). English-language leaflets explain the highly-ritualized proceedings. The Kogukikan also has a small Sumo Museum. A few of the stables permit visitors to watch training sessions, which take place in the early morning. \r\nEdo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum.\r\nThe architecture of Tokyo, flattened once by the earthquake of 1923, and then by bombing in the Second World War, is ever-changing and often breathtakingly modern. But memories of the past are preserved in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei Park, in the western suburbs of the city, which presents a collection of historic buildings from in and around Tokyo that have survived the calamities of history and been rescued from the wrecking ball. Among the 30 or so buildings are farmhouses, shops, a bathhouse, a photography studio, a tavern and the homes of famous people.  \r\nA view of Tokyo.\r\nFor one of the best views over the city, go to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Shinjuku ward, the impressive skyscraper district. It offers views from the observatories (North and South) on the 45th floor at 202m (663ft), and has the advantage of being free. The Tower also contains the Tokyo Tourist Information Centre. Alternatively, in the futuristic cityscape of Roppongi Hills, a shopping and entertainment complex in the Minato (\\'port\\') ward, the Tokyo City View at the Mori building gives a 360° view from 250 m (820ft); a ticket to the Mori Art Museum includes entrance to the viewing deck. Similar views are possible from the upper observation deck of the Tokyo Tower, also in Minato, a replica of the Eiffel Tower, built in 1958, and part of a tourist complex.  \r\nSanrio Puroland.\r\nOf course, if you want a theme park, you could always go to the hugely successful Tokyo Disney Resort, located in Urayasu, Chiba, just east of Tokyo. But for a more authentically Japanese experience, try the Sanrio Puroland, in the western suburb of Tama, an indoor theme park animated by favourite Japanese cartoon characters created by Sanrio company, the most famous of which is Hello Kitty.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bolprnh7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.75708,35.68965]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\" href=\"http://www.cstmswaps.com\">Cstmswaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/2/mongolie_paysage_1.jpg\">Ulaan Baatar is the capital of Mongolia. It also holds the record of the coldest capital in the World as it can be as cold as -46C. Its population is only 600 000 habitants.\r\nWhen arriving at the city on board the Trans-Siberian the first sight that you see is the industrial suburbs and concrete tower blocks, with tends to put you off a bit, but don t be alarmed, the city is a jewel.\r\nThe majors sites are the The Gandan Monastery which means the Palace of Joy. The original monastery built in 1785 was destroyed but later rebuilt in 1938. It now hosts a giant Buddah 28 metres high. As well as the main temple there are also stupas and a library. Suhbaatar Square is the centre of town and at the middle you can find a statue of Suhbaatar, a Mongolian hero. You can also visit his mausoleum on the other side of the square, it has been preserved like the one of Lenin. \r\nThe Zaisan memorial dedicated to Soviet heros, perched on a hill is the best way to see views over UB.\r\nThe Bogd Khan Palace (check opening days and times!!) is a wonderful old place, it is like the Forbidden City in Beijing on a smaller scale. There are exhibits of Thanghas which are Buddhist paintings as well as musical instruments, stuffed animals and Mongolian furnitures. You will need to pay a fee if you want to take pictures or videos. In the evening dont miss The Tumen Ekh Ensemble Palace, it  offers shows with traditional Mongolian music and throat singing.\r\nThe Natural History Museum hosts exhibits about ancient burial sites, ethnic folk, art, and Buddhist ceremonial objects. You will also find a room dedicated to the life of Genghis Khan the famous Mongolian conqueror.\r\nThe State Department Store is a very good place to go shopping offering every thing you need. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n4bp01cz3w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[107.33643,47.7504]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/39639","metadata":null,"contact_name":"cstmswaps","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:cstmswaps","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/39639","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=39639,platial:user=cstmswaps","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41916}
