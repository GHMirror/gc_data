(And you\\'d have the added bonus of being able to check out the matching ostrich or eel boots and belts at Botas Durango next door, or the arts and crafts on display at Josefina Lopez\\'s cultural center and shop in the same block.)\n\nAna Rosa Leon, who comes from Jalisco, opened La Cenaduria almost four years ago after running two restaurants in her hometown, Autlan, and then cooking at Fruitvale\\'s El Taco Zamorano for eight years.\n\nThe menu is as long as the place is small, so check the specials on the white board and seek advice before ordering. If you talk to Leon, she\\'ll steer you right to her whole grilled snapper (filete de pescado), served with either a powerful garlic sauce or El Diablo, a deep-flavored red chile sauce. Both are fantastic, and you can wash them down with a glass of Spanish Muga rose.\n\nPozole, birria, carnitas -- these are common dishes, but Leon\\'s aren\\'t cookie-cutter versions. The best example of her regional approach is her pollo mole pipian with nopales, a well-spiced stew of chicken in a thick green sauce rich with pumpkin seeds, chiles, garlic and cumin.\n\nLike most places in the area, she makes her own thick tortillas daily with fresh masa from La Finca.\n\nEverything comes with radishes. Why radishes? \"I don\\'t know -- it\\'s traditional,\" Leon says. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69femxv98nj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.210375,37.769946]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Huarache Azteca","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\" href=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\">Tanabutler</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3842 International Boulevard, Oakland, CA, 94601El Huarache Azteca 510-533-2395\n3842 International Blvd. (between 38th and 39th avenues); (510) 533-2395.

Unlike the owners of any other restaurant we know of, we are the folks sowing turnip seeds in the morning and cooking turnip greens in the evening. We supplement our harvests with those of other local family farmers and ranchers that avoid harmful chemicals and practice sustainable agriculture. Our menu, based on seasonal shifts in the field, changes as often as the weather. Our meat comes from pasture-raised animals &amp; is hormone &amp; antibiotic free. We purchase whole animals &amp; use all the various cuts of meat throughout our menu.\n\n\"We are as committed to good community as we are to our cuisine. We have an open kitchen so that dinner is a dialogue, where the farmer-chefs and diner-neighbors can have a meaningful exchange; we offer live music every night in honor of its legacy in this town; and we designed our restaurant with an eye toward the history of the 1930’s building that houses it.

Because the farm is just 5 miles north of Santa Cruz, you get the freshest possible produce delivered right to your door within hours of harvest. All deliveries are made by bicycle and trailer and I carefully consider the pros and cons of each gallon of petroleum product used in the farming process. While the farm is not petroleum free (yet) I try to use as little as possible. I aim to provide just prices in an effort to make eating healthy and local an affordable option for everyone. About our Community Supported Agriculture Program: Freewheelin\\' Farm provides a weekly harvest share from the beginning of May through the end of October. Payment for the season is NOT required up front, but your commitment is. CSA pick-up spots: Shares are delivered by bike and trailer direct to your house or a convenient location in Downtown or West Side Santa Cruz.

Its fertile soil and Mediterranean climate translated into an abundance of fresh produce as well as treasured seafood and game. Legend tells that Kokkari is the site where Orion, a mighty hunter and a young man of gigantic stature and great beauty, fell in love with the daughter of the King of Chios. For the love of her, Orion foraged the island for wild game and seafood to prepare elaborate banquets in celebration of their love. Today we hope you will enjoy your own celebration as you dine at Kokkari Estiatorio on food \"fit for the Gods\" prepared with an Aegean palate and the style of innovative California fare. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69femz5ipsh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.399707,37.797103]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kuumbwa Jazz Center","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\" href=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\">Tanabutler</a><img src=\"http://kuumbwajazz.org/images/trumpetman_ctr.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 320 Cedar St., Santa Cruz CA 95060 World-class jazz center presenting quality music and dinner in an intimate setting.\n\n320-2 Cedar St • Santa Cruz, CA, 95060\nContact:\n\tJulie Rix, production/facility manager\nPhone:\n\t831.427.2227\n\nThe blending of the culinary arts and the art of jazz seems to be the perfect recipe for enjoying a creative evening.

We use neither synthetic hormones nor fed antibiotics: our animals grow only as fast as their genetics and the range will allow. Their range, of course, serves also as watersheds and habitat for us as well as other biological communities. We manage our animals so that they enhance the diversity of life on the range, as well as the quality of the water that falls on the range and flows to the towns and sea. We believe this web of relationships we are stewarding is an integral whole, depending for its health upon all its members: damaging the health of any member of the \"whole\" community, therefore, damages the rest.

The new restaurant takes this vision even further in its new environment, designed by Olle Lundberg, overlooking the San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe food, relaxed atmosphere, riesling-driven wine list, full bar with premium brands and fresh squeezed juices, and hard-to-find Chinese teas all speak to the restaurant\\'s originality and commitment to quality.
