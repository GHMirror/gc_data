On the one hand, he gave us impressive Portland stone giants like the Senate House and 55 Broadway – two of London’s tallest buildings in their day. But the same chap also masterminded the design of 20 or so tube stations – those elegant brown brick affairs best seen on the northern stretch of the Piccadilly Line. These in particular show off Holden’s principles of ‘total design’. Interiors, light fittings, clocks and tiles – everything in his buildings was crafted to work together harmoniously. \n\nBut do his buildings work together harmoniously.

The first pile, on High Holborn itself, is an angular, heavily rusticated branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

Surrounded by later less-significant buildings of similar height, 55 Broadway fails to really stand out. Eighty years ago, however, this cruciform building was the tallest office complex in London. Holden really didn’t learn his lesson about Epstein and commissioned the maverick sculptor to craft the slightly rude pieces ‘Day and Night’ for his building.

Nineteen floors of Portland stone founded on granite: it’s a true tower of strength. Hitler thought so. Had he conquered England, this was to have been his headquarters. Its qualities of power have also spilled into fiction. This is the Ministry of Truth in Orwell’s 1984; Richard III’s power base in the Ian McKellen reworking; and the short-lived command-centre-cum-sanctuary in Wyndham’s Day of the Triffids. Holden also designed many of the surrounding buildings, though his complete scheme was never realised. Senate House itself was to have been the tallest building in London, but fell foul of financial restrictions.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v96e69bfg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12895,51.521141]}},{"properties":{"name":"South Wimbledon Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v965aklsl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.19196,51.415294]}},{"properties":{"name":"Southgate Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>Tube, Holden<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v968etgil"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.127802,51.632297]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sudbury Hill Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>sudbury<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v96gy46ql"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.336456,51.557062]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sudbury Town Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>sudbury<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v96ifsy8q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.315514,51.550818]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tooting Bec Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v968lh1ux"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.159817,51.435765]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tooting Broadway Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9668bh3e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.167885,51.427471]}},{"properties":{"name":"Turnpike Lane Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v96b95bh8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.102997,51.590403]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wood Green Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>Bounds Green <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v96fr36xa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.109777,51.597494]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zimbabwe House, 429 Strand (1907-8)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/Holden_Zimbabwe_House.jpg\">We’ve been here before. Long-time readers will remember the controversial sculptures by Jacob Epstein that adorn this building, most of which have had their features hacked away. Well, their story can be read here www.londonist.com/archives/2006/01/londonist_stalk_3.php. Today we’re concerned with the building. One of Holden’s (and Epstein’s) first big commissions, it’s a reasonably impressive set of offices on the Strand, originally built to house the British Medical Association. The typical Holden mixture of granite and Portland stone creates a building of character and mass, albeit one that most people on the bustling Strand will never notice.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v96fuu2jx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.123985,51.509594]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/6619","metadata":null,"contact_name":"londonist","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:londonist","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/6619","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":35,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=6619,platial:user=londonist","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":31226}
