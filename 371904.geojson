I graduated the Faculty of Geodesy, the specilization Terrestrial Measurements and Cadastre, in one item- Surveying. This is also the field I've been working into in the last 3 years, since graduation. I would like to know if there is a possibility to have my education over there acknowledged and optionally to continue my studies there, for example to make a master degree...or whatever necessary to find o job in this domain. Another problem would be my visa. I already have a 10 year visa for U.S.A., but I assume that for studying or working I would be needing a student or working visa. So I should also be interested to know what the procedure for changing the visa status is. Well,my dear friend from us, thank you for reading this, I wish you all the best and say goodbye , with the hope that maybe you know someone who could provide you with this information or that maybe you find out something which could help me further. Any encouriging news will mean a lot for me.   Best wishes and thanks,  Adrian:)<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.643608,26.260941&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhgk1dlos","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[26.260941,47.643608]}},{"properties":{"name":"Adrian Colmenares","geo_score":0.0,"description":"construction stakes and topographics surveys<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=10.68769,-71.597572&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhglp8t65","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.597572,10.68769]}},{"properties":{"name":"adrian delos santos","geo_score":0.0,"description":"Updates with software and technology<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=22.372999,46.279911&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhgjdcyhd","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[46.279911,22.372999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Adrian Nicdao","geo_score":0.0,"description":"Specialize in property surveying and land administration, registration and real estate development.<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=14.566700,121.033302&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhgs04iqw","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[121.033302,14.5667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Adrian Seidler","geo_score":0.0,"description":"To network with other Surveyors worldwide<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-18.482264,133.500862&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhgpcci91","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[133.500862,-18.482264]}},{"properties":{"name":"Adrian Wakoli","geo_score":0.0,"description":"incorporating G.i.s technology with survey<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-1.2833333,36.8166667&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhgi92dkl","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.8166667,-1.2833333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Adv.

These skills have been applied across a wide ranging client base including development sites for retail, hospitality, commercial, residential, educational and medical purposes in addition to infrastructure projects including highways, railways and environmental commissions.  I am inspired most when working on challenging and diverse projects and enjoy taking full ownership of the project from the initial design stages through to completion. I have a strong understanding of the drivers to change within individual projects whilst adopting a value driven approach to project management. My meticulous approach to project planning guarantees that medium to large scale projects are delivered on time, to the highest standard and in accordance with exacting specifications. Furthermore, by taking appropriate preventative measures, I avoid problems and issues, thereby exceeding expectations.

These were still the days of theodolite and chain measurements for the most part. Then 2 years in the Peace Corps as an ag. extension agent in Sierra Leone doing primarily rice paddy development and Survey/Mapping support for paddy irrigation systems. After Peace Corps I went out to the west coast (CA)to work for the US Forest Service as a Transportation Planner, Logging Systems Specialist, wildland fire fighter, and eventually back into Cadastral Surveying with the USFS and BLM. My work as Party Chief of a Cadastral Survey crew involved retracing suspect and/or fraudulent 1880's GLO surveys in remote Northern CA mountains.

I have been the Chief Surveyor for several firms in the Boston area, as well as owned and operated my own Surveying/Engineerin business in Colebrook, NH for 12 years. I have the strong opinion that many surveyors have become so enarmored with modern technology that they forget that there were millions of boundaries established before they were born; those boundaries cannot be re-established by us. They can only be redefined. Defining a boundary to the nearest 1/100th of a foot and 1 second of arc can give us an unwarranted confidence in our work, especially if we have moved the original boundary. We must learn Boundary Law and the rules of evidence at the same time we learn how to use the tools and instruments..the tools and instruments constantly change but the laws and rules regarding the locations of boundaries has changed very little since the early 1600's. New tools and instruments allow us to mathematically redefine boundaries...their use does not give us permission to change the location of a long established boundary! We older surveyors need to learn the new technology and at the same time pass on our knowledge and experience re\" boundary laws and the rules of evidence.<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.76503,-69.97435&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhhkpo6is","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-69.97435,43.76503]}},{"properties":{"name":"David Chang","geo_score":0.0,"description":"Sharing and exchange information and knowledge on land surveying and geomatics<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3.15905,101.519478&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhhnhaiaw","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[101.519478,3.15905]}},{"properties":{"name":"David Decker","geo_score":0.0,"description":"Hydrography<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.627365,-121.383732&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhhi7a2oy","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.383732,38.627365]}},{"properties":{"name":"David Enberg","geo_score":0.0,"description":"<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.650735,-70.243044&amp;t=k&amp;z=18\">Zoom in!</a>","id":"afaxhhnoju70","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.243044,41.650735]}},{"properties":{"name":"David G.

As I moved to Germany, after having continued for a time with my dual occupation of mixed surveying and site managing, the time came when my surveying skills were really put to the test. Major projects in Munich's downtown and, right after that, the Allianz Arena, the new football stadium in Munich which hosted the opening game of the soccer's world championship 2006. After that I remained stuck to surveying and, sincerely, I don't have reasons to regret it. The sites remained big and demanding and the demand about my person just as well.
