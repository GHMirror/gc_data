A popular tourist destination, the rock is adjacent to the beach and accessible by foot during low tide. Haystack Rock tide pools are home to many intertidal animals, including sea stars, anemone, crabs, chitons, limpets, and sea slugs. The rock is also a refuge for many sea birds including terns and puffins.\n\nGeology\n\nComposed of basalt, Haystack Rock was formed by lava flows emanating from the Grand Ronde Mountains 10 to 17 million years ago. The lava flows created many of the Oregon coast\\'s natural features, including Tillamook Head, Arch Cape, and Saddle Mountain. Haystack Rock was once joined to the coastline but years of erosion have since separated the monolith from the coast. Three smaller, adjacent rock formations to the south of Haystack Rock are collectively called \"The Needles\".\n[edit]\n\nEcology\n\nHaystack Rock was granted Marine Garden status by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1990. Collecting plants or animals is strictly prohibited. Climbing above the mean high tide level (barnacle line) disturbs nesting birds and is not allowed. The Haystack Rock Awareness Program is a volunteer association which conducts educational seminars at the rock during low tide between May and September.\n[edit]\n\nRecreation\n\nVisitors to Haystack Rock can view many species of marine wildlife in their natural habitat during low tide. The thin strip of rock and sand that connects it to the beach at these times features many tide pools. The area surrounding the rock is popular for picnicking, kite-flying, and bird-watching. Artists and photographers can be found capturing the beauty of Haystack Rock on canvas or on film. Haystack Rock is one of the most identifiable geological formations of Oregon. Many people each year become temporarily trapped on Haystack Rock when high tide engulfs the rock in water, necessitating rescue from the United States Coast Guard or local authorities. Oregon\\'s beaches are publicly owned, and there are several hotels along the beachfront within walking distance of Haystack Rock, making the area congested with tourists during the high season (May through September). On the contrary, visitors during the winter months will find a desolate, wet, windswept terrain, which many native Oregonians also appreciate.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cqpjq521z3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.969051,45.884407]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hell's Gate at Cape Mendocino","description":"Posted by WetlanderdVacation with Kyle... picnic with Bachetti family.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cqpjr37pb4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.390296936,40.4044117516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Honeyman State Park","description":"Posted by Wetlanderd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Cleawox Lake, Florence, OregonIn the dunes with Rosalie... and a lot of sand.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cqpjvii57y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.114823,43.926335]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hunters Hot Springs, OR","description":"Posted by CrschmidtHot spring, temperature: 205  degress F, 96  degress C<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cqpjwppzs7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.368,42.221]}},{"properties":{"name":"I saw my...","description":"Posted by WetlanderdFirst AligatorCollecting on Sunday, we saw my first Aligator<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cqpjtbkh9l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.359867,27.99857]}},{"properties":{"name":"Imnaha River Fishing","description":"Posted by Wetlanderd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Went fishing with Steve and Dave on day 4 of july 2003 trip.
