This initiative was launched in 1999 by Swaziland, Mozambique and South Africa. It is mainly aimed at accelerating development, particularly with regard to agriculture and tourism within an area of approximately 30 000 square kilometres, covering southern Mozambique, eastern Swaziland, and north-eastern South Africa. \r\n\r\nThe spatial information targeted by this initiative is broadly defined as Southern Mozambique, eastern parts of Swaziland and northern KwaZulu-Natal. These three countries have differing malaria endemicities.\r\n\r\nThe region is largely undeveloped, this being exacerbated by the fact that it falls within a malaria area. Increasing drug resistance and the lack of a malaria control programme in the region mainly in south Mozambique have contributed to this impeded development.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"name":{"max":0,"min":0,"median":0}},"features":[{"properties":{"name":0,"description":" xmlns:fo=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format\" xmlns:msxsl=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt\"&gt;\r\r\n\r\r\n0\r\r\n\r\r\nFID\r\r\n0\r\r\nId\r\r\n0\r\r\n\r\r\n","id":"ag68s49cib5v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[32.0434062418579,-25.6008815701581],[31.8013122083754,-25.5990973119191],[31.7991367135887,-25.8160435654712],[31.5566291832456,-25.813837530642],[31.3141525301654,-25.8112272001235],[31.3110640807664,-26.0281203972842],[31.3079401314009,-26.2450067392922],[31.3047803965079,-26.4618861835826],[31.301584586016,-26.6787586879181],[31.2983524052725,-26.8956242103896],[31.2950835549705,-27.1124827094177],[31.54030035328,-27.1152453249491],[31.7855495676724,-27.1175800640051],[31.7831940678325,-27.3344789385985],[31.7808119990652,-27.5513708877562],[31.7784031376867,-27.7682558733037],[31.7759672564735,-27.9851338574298],[32.0231778935049,-27.9871119169238],[32.2704107983601,-27.9886457112309],[32.2689423506679,-28.2055486520487],[32.5166894706509,-28.2066479767874],[32.7644476832937,-28.2072987642647],[32.7649208741572,-27.9903800218451],[32.7653888290894,-27.7734544267047],[32.7658515924619,-27.5565220138365],[32.7663092079548,-27.3395828186282],[33.0121147978506,-27.3397777532941],[33.0120913389243,-27.1228300137869],[33.0120681424509,-26.9058755706362],[33.01204520627,-26.6889144603133],[33.0120225282548,-26.4719467196779],[33.0120001063118,-26.2549723859752],[33.01197793838,-26.0379914968346],[32.768949157106,-26.0378072492119],[32.5259253519832,-26.0372142266836],[32.526792723576,-25.8202342389068],[32.5276502016856,-25.6032477458373],[32.2855206222905,-25.6022650861885],[32.0434062418579,-25.6008815701581]]]}]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"Julie Deleu","contact_address":"EUROSENSE\r\nNerviërslaan 54\r\n1780 Wemmel\r\nBELGIUM","source":"","contact_phone":"+32 (0)2 460 70 00"},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"south-africa","published":"2014-08-16T16:26:46-04:00","id":382796}
