They lived in Coral Gables for several years, too.  My grandparents moved here from Kentucky during the first land boom of the late 20s.  They lived in different parts of Kentucky, but the same general region, but they met here in Florida.  Grandpa was a business and economics professor at the University of Miami and Grandma worked at the bookstore.  My dad went to Miami after he transferred back home from attempting med school at Tulane.  So yeah, I\\'m a die hard Miami Hurricane to the bitter end.

Columbus is home to the largest infantry training base in the US, Fort Benning.  Columbus is also the largest city in West Central Georgia.

I was born here also, but my mom already lived in Atlanta at the time. She just wanted to go back home to have me so she could be in familiar surroundings. We moved back to Atlanta after things settled down. Dad\\'s job was in Atlanta, so he stayed behind while my grandparents took care of my mom. My grandparents moved here from Columbus after WWII. Albany is the home of the late Ray Charles. It was devastated by a massive flooding of the Flint River in the mid-90s. Chehaw Park is one of the best zoos in the world. It was designed by local zoologist, Jack Hannah.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69jcqsuuv8s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.150847,31.590341]}},{"properties":{"name":"My Brother's Birthplace","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/atlanta_skyline_4_b.jpeg\">Atlanta, GA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69jcqm2x0m2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"My Sister's Birthplace","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/56218220_sky2.jpeg\">Nashville, TN<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69jcqty491f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.784444,36.165833]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/2971","metadata":null,"contact_name":"mountainmaverick","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:mountainmaverick","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/2971","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=2971,platial:user=mountainmaverick","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44629}
