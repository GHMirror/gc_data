It was a crazy place to live for 4 people, located right behind the Star Market in Porter Square. I used to take the \"T\" out to Alewife for work. The Porter Sq T station is insanely deep, requiring a descent down two very long escalators. Boston is a city focused around Squares. It\\'s very New Englandy. Bostonians have candlepin bowling, which sometimes requires one to \"use the wood.\" The day my girlfriend and I broke up, I went and saw \"American Pie\" at the Davis Sq. movie theater, which wasn\\'t the best way to ease the pain.
