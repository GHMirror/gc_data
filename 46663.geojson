During the 2006 summer beach season, we sell beach memberships that permit unlimited use of the beach during its regular hours of operation. Everyone needs to check-in. Resident and non-resident adults show their driver\\'s licenses; walk-ins give their names to the gate attendant. All registered names are on our computerized list.  As always, the beach staff is planning some great programs this summer. Once again, we offer preschool and Certified Red Cross Swim lessons this season.  Our summer season runs from June 26 through Aug. 25.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hjk366ij1z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1435127258,42.4548744234]}},{"properties":{"name":"Castle Island Beach","description":"Posted by Berwin<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hjk2yuief4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.01022,42.33729]}},{"properties":{"name":"City Point Beach","description":"Posted by Berwin<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hjk2yp59uc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.02326,42.33507]}},{"properties":{"name":"Magazine Beach Pool","description":"Posted by Berwin<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/1/Picture_16_3_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Magazine Beach pool\nVeterans Memorial Swimming and Wading Pool (Magazine Beach), 719 Memorial Dr., (617) 354-9381\n\n11:00am - 7:00pm\n\nopen Jun 21 till Aug 17 (2008 season)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hjk375vgur"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.11399,42.35531]}},{"properties":{"name":"Malibu Beach / Savin Hill Beach","description":"Posted by Berwin<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Malibu and Savin Hill Beaches are great sandy spots for summer sunbathing.
