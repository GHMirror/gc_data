But actually, the name Big Ben refers to the clock\\'s hour bell, the largest of the clock\\'s five bells. The other bells are used as quarter bells.\r\nThere were two bells cast as the clock tower\\'s hour bell. The first bell was cast by John Warner and Sons in 1856. Since the Clock Tower was not completed yet, the bell was hung temporarily in the Palace Yard. The bell cracked so it was recast in 1858 in the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Unfortunately, soon after this bell was placed in the belfry, it cracked again. This time, instead of recasting the bell, the crack was repaired by a lighter hammer.\r\nThe hour bell was probably named after Benjamin Hall, the first commissioner of works. Some sources however claim the bell was named after Benjamin Caunt, a British heavyweight boxing champion.\r\nThe clock was the largest in the world and still the largest in Great-Britain. The clock faces have a diameter of 25ft, the hour hand is 9ft long, and the minute hand is 14ft long.\r\nThe clock is known for its reliability, because it has rarely failed during its long life span. Even after the nearby House of Commons was destroyed by bombing during World War II, the clock kept on chiming.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuoifo1gp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hershey, Pennsylvania","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://www.7en.cn/voa/UploadFiles_7577/200609/200692120545299.jpg\"><img src=\"http://advantageserviceltd.com/images/herseybar.jpg\">Hershey, PennsylvaniaThis a little background on the chocolate capital of North America. Milton S. Hershey was born in a small town northwest of Lancaster in Derry Township, Pennsylvania. This is where he would return to build his chocolate empire and create a whole new way of life. The young entrepreneur left the countryside to discover the world of candy making.  Milton Hershey finally returned to his hometown, Lancaster County in 1886 and focused building up  the Lancaster Caramel Company. Twelve years later, he sold the company for  million dollars. After this, he started to acquire knowledge in milk chocolate production, and created the Hershey\\'s milk chocolate bar. He made the world\\'s largest chocolate manufacturing plant. But, Milton Hershey had bigger plans than his successful confectionery business. He envisioned a town built for his family and for the people who worked in his factory. He hired architects to design and build homes, each individual and unique, for the chocolate-factory workers. By 1927, Hershey Estates was incorporated under state law and even included a park and a zoo. The town of Hershey continues to be a special place for its residents and a popular attraction for millions of visitors annually. Today, The Hershey Company is the nation\\'s leading manufacturer of confectionery products. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuoat1g87"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.64754,40.282079]}},{"properties":{"name":"Leaning Tower of Pisa","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://www.freefoto.com/images/14/19/14_19_53---The-Leaning-Tower-of-Pisa--Tuscany--Italy_web.jpg\">Pisa, ItalyThe leaning Tower in Pisa, Italy, is famous simply because it leans. It was closed to the public in 1990, after fears that an entire busload of tourists at the top would be enough to make it fall. Eleven years later, the lean was corrected a little, but not entirely. \r\nThe story of the tower dates back to1172, when a wealthy widow named Berta di Bernado, used sixty coins  to buy stones to begin the construction of the tower. It is was a bell tower to accompany the cathedral that it stands next to it. No one really knows who the actual designer was, but construction was begun on August 9, 1173. Due to all of the wars, and several stops to fight, it took until 1350 to complete the building. The tower is circular, and made up of eight floors of limestone and lime mortar, covered on the outside with marble. There is a staircase of 293 steps leading up from the ground to the eighth floor. The eighth floor contains the bells, seven in all. Only 5 years after work on the building began, it was leaning noticeably to the North. During the building of the next three floors, the lean was corrected by building the floors parallel to the ground, but after this phase, the tower started to lean the other way. The reason the Tower leans is because it is built on unsuitable ground for such a heavy and tall building. After years of recent rebuilding, engineers believe that it is safe for at least another 300 years.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuo7wd7uq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[10.396602,43.716135]}},{"properties":{"name":"Loch Ness","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://codeka.com/uk/blog/20051003-nessie.jpg\">ScotlandLoch Ness in Scotland is probably the most famous lake in the world. It extends from Fort Augustus in the south to the narrows of Bona Ferry in the north. Its distance is almost 23 miles. The waters of Loch Ness cover an area of almost 22 square miles and its deepest part is 754 feet deep. The most surprising statistic is the volume of water contained in the Lake. It is estimated to be about 263,000 million cubic feet. That is greater than any other lake in Great Britain, and is three times greater than Loch Lomond. Loch Ness is famous throughout the world for its Loch Ness monster, more often called Nessie. There have been numerous monster sightings over many years and the usual description is of a small head at the end of a long neck, with a broad body with humps. Nessie is also described as having four flippers, and a long tail with a rounded end.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuojgru9q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.689306,57.735832]}},{"properties":{"name":"Milano, Italy","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://www.traveldir.org/images/milan/photo3_full.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.traveldir.org/images/milan/photo1_full.jpg\">Milano, ItalyMilan\\'s history is a story of wealth and conflict. It has known failure and incredible successes throughout its time, and has faced both with high spirits and hope. This is why it is one of the most famous in the world. Milan is located in North Italy, and a great deal of the city dates back to the beginning of the 20th Century, when many areas were redesigned and rebuilt. Milan’s neighborhoods were filled with houses in impressive tree-lined avenues.\r\nFortunately, Milan is being transformed from being ugly and ruined, into a beautiful city. Economic revival has made it rich and quite interesting. Milan is very different from all the artistic cities scattered around the country. It is the center of economic activity in Italy.  The country\\'s Stock Exchange is based here, and its main fame is also boosted by its role in the world of fashion.  Many important industries, reside in this city including one of the major TV networks which has its headquarters at the gate of Milan.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuo7ln4mi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[9.188126,45.463671]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris, France","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/921917.jpg\">ParisParis is more than 2,000 years old.

During the building phase a series of cost problems and political pressure made the Danish architect  resign in 1966. Many years later though, many different architects completed the job. The Sydney Opera House is one of the world\\'s most distinctive 20th century buildings, and one of the most famous performing arts venues in the world.\r\nAs well as many touring theatre, ballet, and musical productions, the Opera House is the home of Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company, and the Sydney Symphony. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuoj68ofv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.210006,-33.869998]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Colosseum","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://www.visitingdc.com/images/colosseum-picture.jpg\">Roma, ItalyRomans built amphitheaters for entertainment. Gladiator battles and animal fights were among the events held there. The Colosseum was built by the Emperor Vespasian’s architects  in an area that was once a marsh. The land was cleared and the Colosseum was built.  When it was completed, it could hold up to 55,000 spectators. Many other Emperors used the Colosseum to entertain the public with free games. Those games were a symbol of power and were a way for an emperor to increase his popularity.\r\nGames would be held several days in a row, and they usually started with comical acts and displays of exotic animals. They usually ended with fights to the death between animals and gladiators, or just between gladiators. These fighters were usually slaves, prisoners of war or, condemned criminals. Sometimes free Romans and even Emperors took part in the action. The Colosseum is still mostly intact, and is used for concerts and plays.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuojoo9yf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.482323,41.895466]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Grand Canyon","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://www.soultones.com/canyon/canyon5_LG.jpg\">ArizonaThe Grand Canyon is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is a 277 mile long gorge that is more than 5,000 feet deep, and 1/2 mile wide at its narrowest point. On the bottom, the Colorado River weaves around the beautiful mesas and valleys that stand in this magnificent canyon. The first known Native Americans to occupy the canyon were the Pueblo people from about 200 B. C. to 1200 A. D. They farmed vegetables for food and used Yucca plant leaves for sandals. It is believed that due to a long drought these people left the canyon. The first exploration to the canyon was by the Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado. In 1540 he led an expedition from Mexico. Due to the harshness of this land, it wasn’t until over three hundred years later, the next expedition team came to the canyon.\r\nToday, at the bottom of the canyon lives one of the most isolated and smallest Native American tribe, the Havasupai Indians. At the present, with only about 547 people in the tribe, they have been able to preserve their culture consisting of basket weaving, language, and special customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuobodl1m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.927971,34.167862]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Great Pyramid of Giza","description":"Posted by Rockygrrl08<img src=\"http://www.richard-seaman.com/Wallpaper/Travel/MiddleEast/GizaPyramids1.jpg\">Cairo, EgyptThe Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest monument of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is also the only one left standing. It is a marvel of human engineering and construction. It\\'s construction, though, has always been the debate among scholars, because of its massive size and almost  perfect proportions.\r\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza was built for the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Khufu, and was completed around  2560 B.C. It is part of a complex of 3 large pyramids in the Giza Necropolis located in Cairo, Egypt. The Great Pyramid is the largest of the three pyramids. It’s construction also contains 3 small pyramids that were built for Khufu\\'s wives.\r\nThe Great Pyramid took approximately 20 years to complete. It was constructed out of stone blocks, each weighing at least 2 tons. However the pyramid was constructed, it is a marvelous feat, and should be awed and respected, especially because it is standing today with very minor damage.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuoavwbaw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.25,30.059999]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/103538","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rockygrrl08","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rockygrrl08","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/103538","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=103538,platial:user=rockygrrl08","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47692}
