In 1878 it was sold to Edward Barron, the mining company executive.  He added a locally famed octagonal fourth-floor cupola, as well as an enormous two storied west wing.  The house also had two dining rooms, a billiards room, a two story back wing for servants and a wide central staircase that welcomed visitors into the interior of the Victorian mansion.  By 1936, the 26 room building \nhad begun a new life as the Interdale School for Boys.  \n\nBut in the late afternoon of November 29th, 1936, a fire began in one of the towers of the 80 year-old wooden house that would change Barron Park forever.  While the cause of the blaze has long remained a mystery, electrical wiring was the likely culprit.  Writer Joaquin Vienna first saw smoke pouring out of an upper-floor window while driving down El Camino Real, he turned into the estate, ran into the building and called the fire in to three local fire departments.  \n\nSoon, fire crews from Redwood City, Menlo Park, San Mateo, County headquarters, and Moffett Naval Air Station were all racing toward the burning house.  But it would be the reaction of the nearby Palo Alto Fire Department which would linger in the memories of Barron Park residents for decades.\n\nUpon strict orders from the City Council, Palo Alto firefighters were not allowed to cross into other cities to \nfight fires because they might not be covered by insurance.\n\nIn the end, despite the valiant efforts of various other fire departments, the mansion was totally lost.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sizw1ssf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.13091,37.41592]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bell's Books","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/2/bells1975.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/2/bells2007.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Bell\\'s Books, the longtime independent book seller, has managed to hang on even as Border dominates all down the street.

His \none-story house design is known for its clean lines, open floor plans, and glass walls that allow residents to \nlook out onto garden areas. Eichler homes were considered forward thinking in their design. They came to symbolize the promise of a better tomorrow to a burgeoning middle class. But today some critics now \nbelieve the Eichlers have the appearance of the future misjudged. Like the Jetsons\\' home, they represent a \nfuture that never came to be.\n\nThey are most certainly dated --- the question is whether they are dated/historic or dated/badly mistaken.\n\nIf the National Park Service is any judge, they are historic. In 2005, two Eichler-dominated Palo Alto \nneighborhoods, Greenmeadow and Green Gables were named to the National Register of Historic Places \nby the National Park Service. Indeed, Eichler homes are now beginning to be seen as pieces of history---\nsuburban tract history, yes.

He wanted the entrance gates to the university to be situated on Stanford Avenue near Hanover Street.  One \ncatch though --- Stanford wanted the town to go “dry” --- no more alcohol (obviously universities did not have the same reputations as they do today). Mayfield, with its 13 saloons, voted no thanks. Rejected, Stanford turned his eyes north and convinced his friend, Timothy Hopkins of the Southern Pacific Railroad, to buy 700 acres of private property and sell lots. The collection of homes that grew up around the university (originally called University Park) eventually became Palo Alto.

Since that night, Palo Alto’s sense of security has never really been the same.\n\nOn the night of June 12th, 1997 all that would come to an end.  After putting their two-year old twins to \nbed, Meg dozed off and Bert set out from his apartment for his nightly “thinking walk.”  Meanwhile over in \nEast Palo Alto, six members of a Samoan gang called the True Blue Crips were drinking Mad Dog 20/20, a \ntype of potent wine, and making plans to “jack someone.”  They piled into the blue Isuzu Rodeo owned by 20 year old Christian Valdes and headed across the 101.  Circling downtown around 10:30pm, they spotted \nKay walking down Gilman Street, a typically serene setting that serves as the Saturday morning home for the Palo Alto Farmer’s Market.\n\nWhile Valdes remained in his car around the corner, his five friends snuck up on the unsuspecting scientist.  \nOne of the attackers brutally struck Kay in the head, knocking him to the ground.  Searching Kay’s pockets, \nthey only found a little girl’s ponytail holder (Kay had actually left his wallet at home).

Not to say that Palo Alto has not had its share of both peaceful and enlightened protests.  But especially between 1968 and 1972, Lytton Plaza became famous for a series of chaotic riots that symbolized the worst of the youth movement, not the best.\n\nThe former location of the monumental American Trust Building, the 8,500 square foot plaza was constructed in 1964 by Bart Lytton across the street from his Lytton Savings Bank at Emerson and University.  With its brick and cement foundation and modernist rounded concrete bench/plant holders, the plaza always had a somewhat severe appearance.  Still, at its inception in 1964, it was clean, well-groomed and a needed pedestrian oasis in an increasingly automobile-centered downtown.  \n\nBut while Lytton intended the plaza for the “use and enjoyment of the people of Palo Alto,” some people’s \nidea of “enjoyment” was not exactly what Lytton had in mind.  Within five years, the plaza had become the favored spot in Palo Alto for both protest and late-night rock concerts.  Because it was privately owned, it \nwas not subject to city park regulations, and because it was not fenced, anti-trespass laws did not apply.  As a sort of legal “no man’s land,” Lytton Plaza soon became the place to challenge the system in Palo Alto.\n\nNote: To be renamed in 2009 and re-landscaped.\nThe older photos are circa 1965 and 1971.

In some ways, it was a classic culture clash.   It featured two groups, the yachters and the \nenvironmentalists, each possessing vastly different worldviews, with little in common in how they saw the \ndestiny of Palo Alto Harbor.  What resulted was perhaps the most compelling political campaign in the city’s \nhistory.  Not only was it exciting, always in doubt and full of rhetorical sparks, but in the end, the campaign \nitself really mattered.  Because despite the close divide in public opinion, the environmentalists’ campaign \nwas so utterly victorious and the boaters’ campaign so profoundly defeated, that by 1985, the public had \ntwice backed what was once almost unthinkable --- the complete demolition of the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.\n\nPhotos: Photo #1 from 2008, #2 iis circa 1980.

A novice flier who had \nrecently undertaken his first solo flight, McWard was practicing landings when he became distracted for a \nmoment by a radio antenna network.  Upon approaching the runway, he didn’t see a set of utility power \nlines until it was too late.  Swerving violently upward, the undercarriage of the plane struck the top two lines \nof the 110,000 volt main feeder line for PG&amp;E.  The lines parted and McWard’s plane crashed to the \nground, flipped over and skidded 100 feet, stopping just yards away from where Embarcadero Road ends.  \nGasoline spilled out of the wing tanks and covered the ground around the plane.

After failing to stop the construction of the Oregon Expressway and having had \ntheir power reduced during the 1967 recall election, the residentialists were now clinging to just two \nremaining Council seats and were in need of a political victory.  They would stake their comeback on the \nrejection of two major development projects in 1970 and 1971:  the so-called Superblock project --- twin \n11 story towers that were proposed on a downtown site along University Avenue --- and the 18 story \nPatient Care Health Center to be erected on a two block square in quiet Professorville.\n\nDreaming of a city hospital to remedy the crowded conditions at Stanford University Hospital, The Palo Alto \nMedical Research Foundation (PAMRF), a non-profit corporation founded in 1930 by Dr. Russel V. Lee, \nproposed a “jet-age” hospital to open across from the Palo Alto medical clinic.  The hospital project was \nmassive in scope:  The original proposal called for a 1 million, 18 story hospital of 600,000 square feet, \n300 beds, and between 800 to 1,000 employees.\n\nBut the problem was not just the size, but the location.  Professorville is Palo Alto’s most historic \nneighborhood having acquired its name for the many Stanford professors who built their homes there in the \n1890s.  The PAMRF claimed (perhaps a bit cynically) that the location bordered by Waverley and Bryant \nStreets, Addison and Channing Avenues was the best of the many sites they considered for the hospital.  But \nhospital opponents noted that it \"is incredible that the PAMRF should conclude from their alleged site studies \nthat the best location for the new hospital just happens to be across the street from their present medical \nclinic.\"  Pointing to the small scale nature of the neighborhood and the old homes that would have to go, \nresidentialists argued that “The site’s not right.”\n\nPhoto #1: The tower would have risen in this photograph had the opposition forces won the battle.\nPhoto #2: A sketch of the proposed hospital.\nPhoto #3: A biker makes her opinion known.

As cable and color television, VCRs and year-round TV sports lured people to stay home on Friday and Saturday nights --- and big screen \nmultiplexes opened within a short freeway drive --- the Stanford began to sink ever further down the cinematic food chain, eventually showing second-run Hollywood action flicks while continuously poised on the verge of being eaten up by shops and restaurants.\n\nBut thanks to the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the zeal of the billionaire’s movie-buff son, David Woodley Packard, the story of the Stanford has a happy ending after all. It just goes to show what  million can do.\n\nBut no matter how high the price tag for the theatre’s restoration and operation, today the Stanford is one of \nPalo Alto’s treasures, sending lines of patrons around the block for “Casablanca,” “Citizen Kane” and the annual Christmas Eve showing of “It’s a Wonderful Life.”  Indeed, it’s the Stanford that gives Palo Alto the same kind of small-town charm that inspired George Bailey to run down Main Street calling out hellos to Bedford Falls.\n\nPhoto #1: 2008\nPhoto #2: 1925 on the night of the theatre\\'s opening\nPhoto #3: In 1985 showing Dance With Stranger\nPhoto #4: The interior in 1925\nPhoto #5: In the theatre in 2007\nPhoto #6: Savior David Woodley Packard\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sjdmrv5v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16255,37.44516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steve Jobs House (1934-present)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/3/jobs4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> When he first bought his medieval-revival mansion, he had a minor complication with Palo Alto\\'s \nrather strict historic preservation regulations.

That would be Pericles (Perry to close friends), one of two donkeys who live at Bol Park and serve as would-be neighborhood mascots.\n\nDonkeys have lived in the 13 acre Bol Park since its farmland days in the Great Depression.  Originally full \nof apricot orchards and strawberry fields, the land also served as a donkey pasture.  It was then the \nproperty of Cornelius Bol, the long-time Stanford professor and inventor of the mercury vapor light who \nmoved to Palo Alto from his native Holland to escape the Nazis.  \n\nBol often allowed neighborhood kids to play with and even ride the seven donkeys that grazed the pasture in \nthose early days.  And if a group of donkeys would wander from the pasture and begin marching around the \nneighborhood in single file --- as they were apt to do --- local kids would round them up and lead them \nback to pasture.  It seems the donkeys have always been seen as community pets.\n\nPhoto #1: The donkeys are huge favorites with Barron Park children.\nPhoto #2: Mickey who became a Barron Park favorite even though he was known as the \"braying-est donkey this side of the Holy Land.\"  Mickey died in 1998.\nPhoto #3: Paul Wolff and Richard Placone posing with Negrita, the Gunn mascot in 1969.\nPhoto #4: The map\\'s author poses with Miner 49er.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sizmkway"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.1386,37.40799]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Children's Library","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/4/cl2007.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/childrenslibrary1945.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> This was the nation\\'s first freestanding Children\\'s Library, built by Palo Alto\\'s greatest benefactor.

By 1937, they had won their own \nvenue at 1305 Middlefield Road donated by generous Palo Alto benefactor Lucie Stern. A public theatre,  funded by government, had come to Palo Alto. Even today, funding for the Palo Alto Children\\'s Theatre comes from the city. The current budget is over a half a million dollars, plus use of the building, facilities and  utilities. Ticket prices are set by the City Council, and the money collected goes back to the city. Prices have \nbeen kept low ---  for adults and  for children --- making the Children\\'s Theatre an inexpensive  entertainment option for families.\n\nn the 1940’s, the Children’s Theatre became the pride of Palo Alto as none other than The New York Times published two articles on the organization. The Palo Alto Children\\'s Theatre was also featured in Life magazine that year --- it was supposed to be the cover story, but it was bumped by the bombing of Hiroshima and the end of World War II, an understandable editorial decision.  \n\nThe Children\\'s Theatre also had a half-hour weekly local radio show --- \"Under the Red Tile Roof\" --- in the 1940s, which drew national sponsorship. In the 1950s, the youth theater group performed \"Rumplestiltskin\" on KRON television in San Francisco. They also produced seven short films --- such as \"Pudge,\" which was about the group\\'s mascot, a cute cocker spaniel with big, floppy ears.\n\nPhoto #1:  The Children\\'s Theatre in the 1940s\nPhoto #2: The same shot in 2007.\nPhoto #3:  \"James and the Giant Peach\" in 1985.\nPhoto #4: Members of the Children\\'s Theatre marching at the Centennial Parade in 1994.

During the Great Depression year of 1935, the church faced foreclosure, but white and Japanese neighbors help raise enough money to save it.  Palo Alto’s first historian, Guy Miller, called it “one of the city\\'s brightest brotherhood-in-action \nepisodes.”  The All Saint\\'s Episcopal Church --- which was predominately White --- sponsored numerous \nfund raising dinners to help retire the mortgage on the church.  The American Legion, Shriners, Kiwanis, and \nRotary Club also provided financial support and the media backed the effort in the form of Dallas E. Wood\\'s \n\"The Prowler\" column in the Times.  Eventually, accounts were established at all local banks for the AME \nZion so that contributions could be made.  On July 8, 1939 the mortgage was \"burned\" and the AME Zion \nwas saved.\n\nOf course, the church is also at the heart of two of Palo Alto’s less tolerant moments -- when the African-\nAmerican and Japanese-American residents were expelled from downtown Palo Alto.  During World War \nII, Japanese-Americans on Ramona Street lost their homes and were sent to internment camps.  During the \n1950s, African-Americans in the neighborhood were redlined into moving to East Palo Alto.  \nPhoto #1: Boarded up in 2006.\nPhoto #2: 1980s.\nPhoto #3: Up on stilts during renovation.\nPhoto #4: Ruth Anne Gray who fought \nto save the old church.\nPhoto #5: In the 1970s.\nVideo link: http://www.youtube.com/paweekly#p/u/42/dBKUYr8DCnc<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sj2zm3ij"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15792,37.4428]}},{"properties":{"name":"The HP Garage","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/hp4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/hpgar2007.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/0/partnership.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0072_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/hp8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/12/3/IMG0021_6_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Hewlett-Packard story is legendary in Valleyfolklore. Beginning with 38 in start-up capital, the boys set to work in that one-car shed with a used Sears Craftsman drill press that Packard had lugged out from Schenectady in his car. Packard and his newly-wedded wife Lucile lived on the first floor of the house on Addison originally built for Palo Alto’s first mayor. The landlady (the mayor’s widow who charged just 45  bucks a months for rent) lived on the second floor and Bill in a little shack behind the house just big enough \nfor a cot and a sink.\n\nThe garage lit by a single, overhanging bare lightbulb, served as the research lab, development workshop and manufacturing plant for HP\\'s early products, including the Model 200A audio oscillator used to test sound quality in radio and TV.\n\nHewlett and Packard’s naming process show what an unseasoned enterprise it was. The boys flipped a coin to decide the name of the company and because Bill won, it was H-P that would one day be listed as a Blue \nChip stock on Wall Street, not P-H. For the name of the first oscillator, they chose the name Model 200A, rather than 100A, which might reveal the greenness of the company. And for the product’s original price, the boys chose 4.40, as in “54-40 or fight,” James Polk’s old presidential campaign slogan. These were truly the whims of business world newcomers.\n\nWhile some of their early clients were of the local variety---they helped invent a foot fault indicator for a San Mateo bowling alley---in 1939, HP gained a more prestigious client. They sold 8 of their audio oscillators to \nWalt Disney to test the state-of-the-art soundtrack for Fantasia. HP used those profits to move to a larger  space, at Page Mill Road, and hire a few employees. They were on the road to eventually establishing a 90 \nbillion dollar a year company with over 150,000 employees--- a company that is largely credited for laying the foundation for what would become Silicon Valley.\n\nPhoto #1: The HP Garage in early days.\nPhoto #2: The restored HP Garage.\nPhoto #3: Inside the restored house.\nPhoto #4: Packard with the oscillator. \nPhoto #5: Packard and Hewlett at their \ngarage before renovation.\nPhoto #6: The boys in earlier days.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sjc47sai"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.1548,37.44306]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Hotel Cabaña: Vegas Comes to Palo Alto","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/4/cabana3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/cabana.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Palo Alto\\'s Cabana Hotel hosted a stay by the Beatles in 1965 --- and all hell broke loose.

Paterson Ross for unofficial weatherman and official Stanford lecturer John Adams Squire, he a direct descendant of President John Adams.  The seven \nbedroom mansion was built for 6,000 (a whopping sum in 1904) and would survive the 1906 earthquake, \nnumerous termite invasions, and even the roller skating parties of the Squire girls.\n\nThe effort to save “the grand old lady” of University Avenue would mark the dawning of the preservation \nmovement in Palo Alto. 1969, Gail Woolley started her quest to save historic old homes in the city, \nauthoring a booklet called “Gone Tomorrow,” which told the stories of endangered Palo Alto houses. Her \ninvolvement soon broadened and she became a key player in the Palo Alto Historical Association’s fight to \nsave the Squire House from the wrecker’s ball.\n\nEventually Woolley (a future Palo Alto mayor herself) and the Association convinced the city to purchase the \nhouse for 0,000. There was a catch, however: they would have to raise the money to pay the city back \nwithin a year’s time. Woolley’s “Save the Squire House” committee went into fundraising overdrive.  A \n“Save the Squire House Art Show” was held in the lobby of the Palo Alto Times depicting old Palo Alto \nbuildings and scenes.  Contributions were also sought between  and ,000 to “do something for \ntomorrow, today!”  By 1973, the 0,000 had been raised and the Squire House became the first house in \nPalo Alto to be preserved.  A movement had begun.\n\nPhoto #1: The Squire House in 2007.\nPhoto #2: From the same angle circa 1930.\nPhoto #3: In disrepair in the 1970s.\nPhoto #4: Saving the \"Old Lady\" of University Avenue.\nPhoto #5: One of the Squire family daughters lies in a haystack behind her home on University Avenue with the Tobey House at 567 Hale Street visible in the background.\nPhoto #6: Some teenagers and a snowman enjoy the company of the Squire House in perhaps 1976.\nPhoto #7: Under construction in 1904.\nPhoto #8: Surrounded by much shorter palm trees.\nPhoto #9: With really short palm trees.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sjdhj89a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.1538,37.45319]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Medico-Dental Building","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/birgeclark2007_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/birgeclark1928.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> This downtown building was one of Birge Clark\\'s greatest.

In fact, original plans called for twin 15 story structures with a much larger central plaza featuring fountains, promenades and additional upper walkways.  But in the late 1960s and early ‘70s, anti-growth “residentialists” took control of the city and scuttled other proposed emblems of a growing downtown --- notably, an 18 story hospital project in 1970 and the twin-towered “Superblock” commercial project the following year.  By 1974, a residentialist-dominated Council had put a 50 foot height limit on all Palo Alto buildings.  Today the Palo Alto Office Center stands as a lonely, oversized monument to a path not taken, an alternate vision of what Palo Alto never became.\n(PAHA Collection)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2sjbp62ii"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15897,37.44878]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Roth Building","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/12/3/russelvalee1931.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> Palo Alto\\'s Dr. Russel Lee was a revolutionary doctor in the history of American medicine.

A host of \nnon-profits including a center for non-verbal therapy for childhood trauma victims, a historic clothing society \nand chocolate factory (an odd juxtaposition?), and a care center for deaf children were among the \napplicants.  Eventually, the decision came down to the proposals from the Museum of American Heritage \nand the Pacific Art League.  And even after the city awarded the site to the museum, the process almost \nreverted back to square one again when the museum submitted a sizable building alteration plan to the city.  \nFearing that the Williams House might never be filled, Council member Gary Fazzino joked at one meeting \nthat “given the amount of time we\\'ve spent on this issue in the last three years, we\\'re probably discouraging \nPalo Altans from including the city in their wills.”\n\nEventually, however  the Museum of American Heritage  went forward with their plans.
