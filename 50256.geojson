Earlier this year, a Postwatch undercover survey labelled it the country\\'s worst offender for queues, with a customer waiting time of up to 21 minutes. \rUnfortunately, nine months on, despite being admonished by Postwatch, the queues do not seem to be shrinking. Last week, when Financial Mail visited, only three of the main 13 counters were open despite it being lunchtime and more than two-dozen people waiting  -  though customers say it can get far busier. \r <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/campaigns/savepo/article.html?in_article_id=415314&amp;in_page_id=508\">Read the full story</a> <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/travelswithtoby\">Blog: Travels with Toby</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62dq917t822"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.121576,52.204069]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chesham Bois","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://img.thisismoney.co.uk/i/pix/2007/01/MimiHarker_200x220.jpg\">HP5 1DE, EnglandWalking past the cluster of shops in the attractive village of Chesham Bois, nothing appears amiss. It is a quiet and pleasant spot with a steady stream of customers arriving by car to shop. \rYet despite an upmarket feel to the parade in Bois Lane, which includes a home furnishings shop with coffee bar and a butcher\\'s shop, there is a lack of grassroots services. \rLuxury goods and cappuccinos are all well and good, say locals, but there is nowhere for basic groceries, postage or banking needs. \r <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/campaigns/savepo/article.html?in_article_id=414405&amp;in_page_id=508\">Read the full story</a> <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/travelswithtoby\">Blog: Travels with Toby</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62dq8ts5ww4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.61116,51.707116]}},{"properties":{"name":"Crewe","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://img.thisismoney.co.uk/i/pix/2007/01/AlanGreen_200x220.jpg\">CW1 5EQ, EnglandRoyal Mail launched a competition three months ago to find the country\\'s favourite post offices. Embarrassingly, not long after, the Government said its support of the 14,300-strong network was unsustainable and that two-thirds could be axed. Last Thursday, behind closed doors, GMTV presenter Lorraine Kelly and Royal Mail \\'unveiled\\' the competition winners. Financial Mail on Sunday reporters visited the winning post offices to get reaction from postmasters and postmistresses and their customers. \rOverall winner: Running a post office is in Alan Green\\'s blood. His grandfather, William Green, opened the doors of the family\\'s sub-post office in Crewe, Cheshire, almost 50 years ago. And Alan\\'s father, Neville, took over in 1977. \rThirteen years ago, the post office moved a couple of hundred yards to its current location in Hungerford Road on the town\\'s eastern edge. Neville and his wife, Margaret, ran the business until Alan took over ten years ago. \r <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/campaigns/savepo/article.html?in_article_id=414823&amp;in_page_id=508Read%20the%20full%20story&lt;/a&gt;%20&lt;p&gt;&lt;a%20href=\">Blog: Travels with Toby</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62dq8wzmipb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.429032,53.097532]}},{"properties":{"name":"Galmpton","description":"Posted by Thisismoney<img src=\"http://img.thisismoney.co.uk/i/pix/2007/01/GaryDreare_200x220.jpg\">TQ5 0NH, EnglandThe quiet Devon village of Galmpton near Brixham is an unlikely setting for a revolution. But it is here that subpostmaster Gary Deare, 47, believes he has discovered a formula to transform the gloomy prospects of many threatened branches - with up to 3,000 facing the axe in the latest cull. Sick of Government meddling, he has embraced the ideas of his local community to create a post office branch that is thriving against the odds. There is nothing to make the old-fashioned Galleon Stores &amp; Galmpton Post Office stand out - other than a fresh lick of white paint. Across the road is a family butcher and a hairdresser, the only other shops that serve this 1,200-strong community on the banks of the River Dart. But step inside and former bank manager Gary has revamped the interior, creating an innovative \\'express post office\\' service and a shop selling organic produce.  <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/campaigns/savepo/article.html?in_article_id=416383&amp;in_page_id=508\">Read the full story</a> <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/travelswithtoby\">Blog: Travels with Toby</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62dq91xi3ai"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.567359,50.395258]}},{"properties":{"name":"Isle of Wight","description":"Posted by ThisismoneyPO31 7BS, EnglandThey are a belligerent bunch on the Isle of Wight.

The island has 52 branches serving 120,000 people, which is one for every 2,308 residents and almost double the national average. \rBut that does not include the 2.6m \\'grockles\\' - tourists - who holiday on the island every year and often use the post office network.

Three years ago, when pensioners and others on benefits were told they could no longer receive payments in cash, hundreds took the Post Office\\'s advice and opened a card account, which allows benefits, pensions and tax credits to be collected at post offices using a card and Pin. \rThey thought that doing so secured the future of their post office branch. But now they fear the worst. \rIf the account is scrapped, as the Government has now indicated it will be, pensioners and other benefits recipients will be forced to use their banks, stripping post offices of business and revenue. \r <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/campaigns/savepo/article.html?in_article_id=408346&amp;in_page_id=508\">Read the full story</a> <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/travelswithtoby\">Blog: Travels with Toby</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62dq8yjmnbr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.686332,53.175145]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/14521","metadata":null,"contact_name":"thisismoney","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:thisismoney","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/14521","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=14521,platial:user=thisismoney","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":50256}
