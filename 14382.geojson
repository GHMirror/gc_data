The legal boundaries of Thesee sanctuaries are defined within the Code of Federal Regulations, at 15 C.F.R. Part 922 and the subparts for each national marine sanctuary. The GIS compatible digital boundary files for each national marine sanctuary are representations of those legal boundaries and are based on the best available data. Thesee files are available for public use at locations defined in this metadata record. \n    Purpose:\n        Thesee GIS compatible digital files are provided to promote an understanding of the boundaries of each national marine sanctuary. They are based on the legal definition of each sanctuary as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, at 15 C.F.R. Part 922 and the subparts for each national marine sanctuary. Thesee digital files are not intended and should not be relied upon for use in navigation or legal purposes.
