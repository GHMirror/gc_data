Wilson Rd., Altadena, CAFounded in December 1904 by George Ellery Hale as one of the original scientific enterprises of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Mt. Wilson Observatory is completing its first century as one of the world\\'s premier astronomical observatories. During the first half of the twentieth century Mt. Wilson was successively home to the world\\'s two largest telescopes as well as the most powerful facilities in existence for studying the sun. The 60-inch and 100-inch night-time telescopes and the 60-ft and 150-ft solar tower telescopes in the hands of the brilliant scientists who used them revolutionized astronomy through such discoveries as:\r\r    * recognition that the Sun is not at the center of the Milky Way galaxy\r    * proof that countless galaxies exist in addition to the Milky Way\r    * the existence of the magnetic field of the sun and its key role in solar activity\r    * the recession of the galaxies indicating the Big Bang origin of the Universe\r    * the existence of populations of stars of various ages in our galaxy\rOn December 20, 1904 the Carnegie Institution of Washington approved George Ellery Hale\\'s proposal to found a new solar observatory atop Mount Wilson in Southern California. Thus began an unprecendented 100-year journey. Mount Wilson ushered in 20th century astronomy and defined the field for much of the 20th century. As Mount Wilson Observatory begins its second century we take a look back at the first 100 years of one of the most productive scientific institutions in history.\rIn the twenty-first century, the Observatory hosts several of the most technologically advanced facilities in the world for studying astronomical objects with unprecedented resolution and clarity. The 100-inch Hooker telescope remains in active scientific service, and the solar towers are daily collecting data representing the world\\'s longest continuous record of the sun.\r\rSince 1986, Mt. Wilson Observatory has been operated under an agreement with the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW) by the Mount Wilson Institute (MWI), a 501c(3) non-profit corporation whose mission focuses on scientific research, historic preservation, astronomical education and public outreach. Guest institutions operating facilities on the Observatory grounds include: the University of California, Berkeley; Georgia State University; University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana; the University of California, Los Angeles; and the University of Southern California. The Mount Wilson Observatory Association (MWOA) provides invaluable volunteer and docent support to the Observatory.\rDirections to Mount Wilson\rTo visit Mount Wilson Observatory, follow CA Route 2 (Angeles Crest Highway) out of La Ca?ñada/Flintridge into the San Gabriel Mountains for 14 miles to Red Box Road; turn right, and go another 5 miles to the Observatory gate. Parking is available in a large lot just beyond the front gate. No private vehicles are allowed beyond the parking lots.\r\r<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mtwilson.edu/vis/roadmap.jpg%5C'\">http://www.mtwilson.edu/vis/roadmap.jpg</a>\r\rBecause the observatory is located in the Angeles National Forest be sure to purchase a Forest Service Adventure Pass before visiting. Adventure Passes valid for one day for  and annual passes valid anywhere in the Forest for 0 are available at two locations just off the I-210 freeway at the bottom of Angeles Crest Highway: Sport Chalet on Foothill Blvd. just east of Angeles Crest Highway and Jay\\'s Shell Station on Angeles Crest (Hwy 2) just south of I-210.\r\rThere is no food available on the mountain but picnic tables are available for visitors\\' use. Drinking water is available on the observatory grounds far from the visitors\\' parking lot. Visitors are strongly advised to bring their own drinking water.\r\rAngeles Crest Highway has been designated by the California Highway Patrol as a \"special enforcement zone\". Daylight headlights are required on the road from just above La Canada all the way to Angeles Forest Highway. The requirement is rigorously enforced and the ticket is over 80. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mtwilson.edu%5C'\">www.mtwilson.edu</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m79qljy32s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.094572,34.190512]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Wilson Observatory","description":"Posted by Physicus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Mt.

Rancho La Brea is one of the world??s most famous fossil localities, recognized for having the largest and most diverse assemblage of extinct Ice Age plants and animals in the world. Visitors can learn about Los Angeles as it was between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, when animals such as saber-toothed cats and mammoths roamed the Los Angeles Basin. Through windows at the Page Museum Laboratory, visitors can watch bones being cleaned and repaired. Outside the Museum, in Hancock Park, life-size replicas of several extinct mammals are featured.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.tarpits.org%5C'\">www.tarpits.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m79qt8vera"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.355047,34.062536]}},{"properties":{"name":"Page Museum - La Brea Tar Pits","description":"Posted by Physicus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 5801 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m79r049mxs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.355047,34.062536]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History","description":"Posted by Yahoolocal<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 2559 Puesta Del Sol, Santa Barbara, CASanta Barbara Museum of Natural History (805) 682-4711<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m79r00lud3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.71469,34.441298]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History","description":"Posted by Physicus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2559 Puesta Del Sol, Santa Barbara, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m79qntjy4y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.71469,34.441298]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santa Barbara Zoo","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.kchristieh.com/blog\" href=\"http://www.kchristieh.com/blog\">Kchristieh</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/santa_barbara_zoo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 500 Ninos Drive, Santa Barbara, CALie on your back on the hilltop in the middle of the field at the Santa Barbara Zoo.
