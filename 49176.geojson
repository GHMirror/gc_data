For a long time, I thought every city looked like this sprawling suburb, filled with ranch houses. Luckily, I discovered the Garden District before I left. With its sprawling oak trees, it looks surprisingly like New Orleans.

It\\'s not as good as the original in New Orleans, because sometimes the sushi rice is hard, but it\\'s just 0 for all you can eat. It seems to be a trend around here for Chinese buffets to have Japanese, Thai, etc.. as well. They have stuffed potatoes, boiled crawfish, raw oysters and crab legs.
