The Abbasid caliphate was finally abolished when Hulagu, the Mongol ruler, captured Baghdad in 1258, destroying much of the city including its incomparable libraries.\n\nWhile the Abbasids ruled in Baghdad, a number of powerful dynasties such as the Fatimids, Ayyubids and Mamluks held power in Egypt, Syria and Palestine. The most important event in this area as far as the relation between Islam and the Western world was concerned was the series of Crusades declared by the Pope and espoused by various European kings. The purpose, although political, was outwardly to recapture the Holy Land and especially Jerusalem for Christianity. Although there was at the beginning some success and local European rule was set up in parts of Syria and Palestine, Muslims finally prevailed and in 1187 Saladin, the great Muslim leader, recaptured Jerusalem and defeated the Crusaders.\n\nWhen the Abbasids captured Damascus, one of the Umayyad princes escaped and made the long journey from there to Spain to found Umayyad rule there, thus beginning the golden age of Islam in Spain. Cordoba was established as the capital and soon became Europe\\'s greatest city not only in population but from the point of view of its cultural and intellectual life. The Umayyads ruled over two centuries until they weakened and were replaced by local rulers.\n\nMeanwhile in North Africa, various local dynasties held sway until two powerful Berber dynasties succeeded in uniting much of North Africa and also Spain in the 12th and 13th centuries. After them this area was ruled once again by local dynasties such as the Sharifids of Morocco who still rule in that country. As for Spain itself, Muslim power continued to wane until the last Muslim dynasty was defeated in Granada in 1492 thus bringing nearly eight hundred years of Muslim rule in Spain to an end. \n\nexcerpted from http://www.barkati.net/english/#05<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69ogxet3y8q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[44.3916320801,33.3087248296]}},{"properties":{"name":"Al-Aqsa","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\" href=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\">Annuralislam</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/0/aqsa.jpg\">Third holiest site in Islam.\nTemple at Jerusalem erected by Prophet Sulaiman (AS) (King Solomon), and site of Muhammad (pbuh) celestial jouney.\nMosque built by Khalifah Umar (AS) in AH 69.\nReward for praying here is 500 times the normal reward.\nFormer qibla until it was changed to Kaba.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69ogx4g73d8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.23516,31.77802]}},{"properties":{"name":"Damascus","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\" href=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\">Annuralislam</a>damascusTaken by Khalid in AH13, during the reign of Khalifah Umar (AS)\nBecame the capital of Umayyad Khalifate under Mu\\'awiyah in AH41, and remained the chief city of Islam until the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in AH132, when the Abassides moved their capital to al-Kufah and then to Baghdad<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69ogx4j9kd3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.319999,33.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jerusalem","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\" href=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\">Annuralislam</a>At that time, there were 12,000 Greeks and 50,000 natives in the city.

In 1453 Mehmet the Conqueror captured Constantinople and put an end to the Byzantine empire. The Ottomans conquered much of eastem Europe and nearly the whole of the Arab world, only Morocco and Mauritania in the West and Yemen, Hadramaut and parts of the Arabian peninsula remaining beyond their control. They reached their zenith of power with Suleyman the Magnificent whose armies reached Hungary and Austria. From the 17th century onward with the rise of Westem European powers and later Russia, the power of the Ottomans began to wane. But they nevertheless remained a force to be reckoned with until the First World War when they were defeated by the Westem nations. Soon thereafter Kamal Ataturk gained power in Turkey and abolished the six centuries of rule of the Ottomans in 1924.\n\nexcerpted from http://www.barkati.net/english/#05<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69ogx49kc1u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.6930541992,36.8889572244]}},{"properties":{"name":"Timbouktou","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\" href=\"http://www.annuralislam.com\">Annuralislam</a>First official contact with Islam was during the caliphate of Sayyidina Uthman, who sent an official Muslim envoy to Vietnam and Tang Dynasty China in 650.\n\n\n\nThere had been earlier contacts with Muslim traders en route to China.\n\n\n\nIslam mainly grew in Vietnam through the influence of the Malay people.\n\n\n\nAfter the 1975 establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, some of the 55,000 Muslim Chams emigrated to Malaysia. 1,750 were also accepted as immigrants by Yemen; most settled in Ta\\'izz.
