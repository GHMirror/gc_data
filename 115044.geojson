The Fire Festival celebrates the rebirth of Pioneer Square after the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889. The fire destroyed 120 acres or 25 city blocks and caused an estimated $20 million in damage. It was the most devastating fire ever to hit Seattle and led to the birth of the modern day Seattle Fire Department.\nThe festival gives a glimpse into Seattle’s past. Displays include antique and classic fire engines, classic police cars, a gold mining demonstration, and other family friendly activities. Kids can color pictures while sitting in the back of a 1940 fire engine, or try on firefighter turnout gear.\nLocated one to two blocks away from Occidental Square Park are: the Last Resort Fire Department Museum, located in Seattle Fire Department Headquarters; the Seattle Metropolitan Police Museum located in a historic building; and the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park – Seattle, located in the restored Cadillac Hotel.
