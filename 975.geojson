This report is a resource for Social Security Administration (SSA) staff in formulating policy and for local service providers and economic planners.\n\nThe SSI program is a cash assistance program that provides monthly benefits to low-income aged, blind, or disabled persons in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The states and other jurisdictions have the option of supplementing their residents' SSI payments and may choose to have the additional payments administered by the federal government.
