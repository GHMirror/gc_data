It’s the second consecutive year that Miami claimed the top spot. The other two cities with the worst road rage were Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe most courteous city is Portland, Ore., followed closely by Pittsburgh, Seattle/Tacoma, St. Louis and Dallas/Ft. Worth.\n\nThe In The Driver's Seat 2007 AutoVantage Road Rage Survey, released today, was conducted to determine the driving habits and attitudes of commuters across the U.S. and to learn more about consumer views on the topic of road rage.\n\n&quot;Road rage has unfortunately too often become a way of life, both on and off the track,&quot;&quot; said NASCAR racing TV personality, radio host, best-selling author and AutoVantage spokesperson Liz Allison. &quot;\nMore and more, in cities across America, people are acting out their frustrations with dangerous results. It's bad for professional and everyday drivers alike.\n\n&quot;Our Road Rage survey shines the light on emerging driving trends, and there are some very interesting results.&quot;\n\nThe survey's best and worst cities are:\nLeast Courteous Cities (Worst Road Rage):\n2007  2006\n1.
