The service itself is divided into five sections:\n\nWe Gather to Worship: Come “early” (at 9:15) for a time of welcome, informal hymn-singing and greeting one another, plus announcements of upcoming events.\n\nActs of Prayer and Praise: We begin with hymns, litanies, and prayers of adoration and praise. Organist/Choirmaster Robert Bruce, using our state-of-the-art midi-enhanced electronic organ, brings the sounds of heaven to earth.\n\nProclamation of the Word: A choral anthem, scripture readings, and a hymn lay the foundation for the sermon.\n\nActs of Response to the Word: A litany or creed, a time of prayer in which joys and concerns of the community are shared, the pastoral prayer, a time of stewardship and dedication (plus communion on the first Sunday of each month) all serve to help us seal our covenant with God.\n\nWe Scatter to Serve: A final hymn, benediction, and postlude send the church back into the world to serve as the body of Christ. Following the service, everyone is encouraged to gather in the Fireside Lounge for refreshments and conversation. We hope YOU will be among us this Sunday!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68wuvnqhi0k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.45132,34.044818]}},{"properties":{"name":"West Los Angeles United Methodist Church","description":"Posted by Fivefingers<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/0/slide0001_image002.jpg\">1913 Purdue Avenue, Los Angeles, CAOne of the basic premises of the CrossRoads Method is that our congregation\\'s unique identity is found in the nucleus of its spiritual DNA, its values, competencies, mission, vision, and other genetic information, including its history.
