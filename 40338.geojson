Parts of it deal with direct marketing. Other parts provide technology for Burda. Two of them cooperate in the exploitation of modern technology for privacy-invasive direct marketing: Budra Direct (a marketing services company) and Burda Ciscom (the technology provider).\r\nTogether, they offer a platform for computerized direct marketing calls. They rent out computer time and call capacity on the platform to other companies that wish to call people. Phone numbers and call consent is to be managed by the renting customers of Burda direct. This way, Burda Direct avoids being sued for supporting illegal cold calls, which are banned in Germany.\r\nHowever, which phone numbers are being provided by the customers renting the service is none of Burda\\'s business. This resulted to a series of calls and messages to my private line, stuffing my answering machine with calls of the \"Hit 1 to have instant lottery wins with our system\" kind.  I hit \"1\" and asked for the origin of my phone number. They hung up on me. Uh oh.\r\n\r\nI started to investigate.\r\n\r\nGoing through the order call center, I found Burda Ciscom as the service provider. Inquiries remained unanswered. Calling in, a person on the phone explained to me that the lottery sales company moved away. The town hall secretary told me the company should still be there.\r\n\r\nSo I went for a visit. I found Burda Direct, and on their board of doorbells, there was a buzzer for the lottery team. Okay.\r\n\r\nNext, I sent a formal letter to the privacy officer, asking for the documented consent, and ordering my blacklisting on their core machine. I got it, including a 3-page-letter explaining why direct marketing has positive effects on society in general.\r\n\r\nAlso, I posted Burda Ciscom\\'s president\\'s tennis club, golf club, public speech at the Baden-Baden marketing club and personal profile to a newsgroup about tele-marketing lottery fraud, where many users were wondering how to cancel the lottery subscriptions their grandparents had made on the phone with Burda Direct\\'s customers.

No? Well... this taxi driver even radioed the CVC code used for internet verification.\r\nThe radio has a range of at least 10 miles... when no relais is involved. Cambridge is full of technology students... what a radio programming to listen to! \r\nReady-to-shop credit card data! \r\n\r\nNaturally I was rater displeased by the incident. So was Eurocard when I reported it. \r\n\r\nHere we go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo: Panther Taxis / www.panthertaxis.co.uk / (01223)715714\r\n\r\nCc: Eurocard Norge Customer Service\r\n\r\nConcerning: Mishandling of Eurocard credit card of Mr. ******** **********, ending number **********\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir or Madam,\r\n\r\nI have been a customer of your company on 16-Dec-2007. I ordered a taxi for a transfer from Cabridge to Stansted, which took place on that day from approx. 14:45 to 15:30.\r\n\r\nI have two unsatisfactory points to express about the handling of my credit card. First of all, a 5% add-on fee for credit card use was charged, but not put on the receipt written by the driver of the taxi with licence plate KNO3XMA. Thus I have paied approx. £44, but received a\r\nreceipt of £41.00. I like to express that I will go ahead and ask Eurocard to cancel the transaction if my card should show more than the £41.00 amount which I have received a receipt for.\r\n\r\nSecondly, for credit card clearing, your driver used the taxi radio to broadcast my credit card number AND my personal CVC (card verification code) to the dispatcher. The CVC is a personal security code, not a public\r\nasset. I requested not to broadcast the CVC - and my wife was a witness in the cab that the driver not only neglected to inform me that he was going to compromise my credit card CVC on a broadcast radio, but also that he ignored my urgent request not to broadcast the CVC to the public in\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nI have talked to Eurocard. They have never heard of such a dilletantic practice, and offered to block and re-issue my credit card for security reasons.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the secure handling of my credit card and CVC, I hereby request a statement of the data acquisition, storage, processing, and deletion\r\nprocedure concerning my above mentioned personal data according to the British implementation of  the EU data protection directive (2002/58/EC). In detail, I request complete information on:\r\n\r\n- the audience that can listen to the taxi radio system (is it digital? Is it encrypted? How strong is the encryption? Is this property certified?\r\nWhat broadcast range has the radio system in the taxi  ith licence plate KNO3XMA?)\r\n\r\n- how the call center receiving the broadcast is handling the card number? Where is it stored, how many people have access to the data record, and how is the access control security of the CVC record handled? How many\r\ncomputer systems between dispatching call center and card clearer are involved? What is the exact way the CVC went through these systems?\r\n\r\n- How long is the card number &amp; CVC kept on your IT system, and how is secure deletion ensured?\r\n\r\nPlease have your data protection officer reply to these questions in satisfactory detail within two weeks (Dec. 31, 2007), otherwise I will contact the British Information Commissioner requesting an audit of your firm in this matter.\r\n\r\nThis e-mail is copied to Eurocard Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThank you for your email dated 17th December.  I am sorry to hear of the  problem you encountered whilst paying by Credit Card.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the questions raised regarding our handling of card transactions I am pleased that you brought to my attention the drivers use of his radio to transmit your card details. Drivers are instructed to telephone the office using their mobile telephones, or request a call back \r\nfrom the office, in order to obtain authorisation for payment by credit card. This clearly did not happen on this occasion and the driver in question has been reminded of his duties and responsibilities when dealing with card payments, as has the radio controller who should have also advised the driver to telephone the office or indeed called him back.\r\n\r\nThe handling fee of 5% is added to all credit card transactions; I have listened to the recording of the booking made for you, during which a quote was given of £41.00 GBP, it was not mentioned during the booking that payment was being made by credit card. If it had been mentioned then we would have advised of the charge and taken payment then and there over the \r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\nWhen the driver has arrived and been told that payment was to be made by credit card, he has advised you of the charge and given you the opportunity to pay by cash, offering to take you to a cash point if required.  The \r\ndriver told you of the 5% charge which ultimately you agreed to pay,  although the driver should have included the fee on the receipt.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to forward the PDQ machine receipt to you as proof of the charge, as we do for other customers who make a request for it, but require a postal address to do so.\r\n\r\nIn respect of your request for information; The taxi radio is not encrypted, the broadcast range is approximately a 10 miles radius from the drivers vehicle.  Please note that transmission and reception are carried out on different radio channels.\r\n\r\nThe card details are entered directly into a PDQ machine supplied by our card handling merchant; the card details are not entered into a computer at any point of the transaction within our office.  There is no written record \r\nof the CVC held by us; once the transaction has taken place a customer and merchant receipt is printed, neither receipt has the CVC number upon it. \r\nThese receipts are subsequently kept in a secure area where only two appointed members of senior staff have access.\r\n\r\nI trust this email has answered your questions,and I am truly sorry that this breach has taken place.  We do take the security of confidential information very seriously and have been registered under the Data Protection Act 1988 for many years.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately even with the tightest controls mistakes can happen which they clearly did on this occasion. As a gesture of goodwill I am happy to refund the administration charge made to your card and I will await your instructions.\r\n\r\nWarm regards and Christmas greetings.\r\n\r\nJohn Raynham\r\nDirector\r\n\r\nPanther Taxis Ltd,\r\nConvent Drive,\r\nWaterbeach,\r\nCambridge.\r\nCB5 9QT.\r\n\r\nTel (01223) 715715\r\nFax (01223) 715716\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnencrypted radio?

It implements the Nordic E-Ticket specification (http://www.nsb.no/flexus/). Now - as a paparazzi - you could actually  put up receivers at train stations that tell you who\\'s boarding which train (with a RFID ticket), and then go  steal the harddisks with the videos from these trains if you need celebrity photos.

It was quite interesting to find a large room full of facial photos of people who are using a cash / ATM machine while being unaware of the ATM security cameras taking their photo. Obviously, the artist got access to the CCTV system... so was it really \"closed\"?\r\nAnyway, this is what the great exhibit is about:\r\nSophie Calle developed the Cash\r\nMachine series in 1991 from\r\nphotographs stored in a\r\nMinneapolis police station -from\r\nshots taken every 20 seconds by a\r\nsecurity camera above a cash\r\npoint connected to the station.\r\nSophie Calle has extracted a\r\ncollection of eloquent sequences\r\nthat sensitively relate human\r\nemotions and behaviour, from\r\nhope to fear, disappointment, loss,\r\nviolence and joy.\r\n\r\nSpotted Nov. 2004<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rh697ztyq3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.381455,52.50674]}},{"properties":{"name":"Swipe your credit card - Flytoget will keep it for 10 years!","description":"Posted by Geoblogger<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/Reis_billettl%C3%B8st.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/initial_image.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/togetkv.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Oslo LufthavnOslo\\'s hi-speed airport train shuttle is the most important train in Norway.
