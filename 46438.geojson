It was kind of pricey, but it\\'s the sort of thing you spring for once in a while when you\\'re on vacation. They have three trains which run every 15 minutes until about 5:30. You can either go all around in a loop, or do like we did and take half the loop to the zoo, then the other half later to get back to the park.\n\nThe train ride is really only interesting as a train ride. You can\\'t really see animals. It\\'s not like a safari train or anything. You drive through an area where they keep machinery and old train parts. You drive behind the elephant exhibit.\n\nThe nicest part of the ride is through the woods. There\\'s a beautiful, steep ravine off one side of the train.\n\nYou go through a little <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/post/158919\">tunnel</a> when the train pulls into the zoo. That\\'s a nice touch.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639dh054bk9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.70617,45.517508]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tunnel Before Zoo Stop","description":"Posted by Micropopetah<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/2.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639dgup0hnx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.714549,45.509807]}},{"properties":{"name":"Very Scary Anaconda","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/218658903_d430c4f1de.jpg?v=0\">Not that there are other kinds of anacondas than \"very scary.\"\n\nThis exhibit is pretty neat. It has a sort of half-tank, half mangrove, so you can see underwater and above. In one part of the exhibit, an anaconda sits twisted around a root with only its nose sticking out above the water, waiting for some hapless monkey to come get a drink of water.\n\nYikes.\n\nI don\\'t think the snake moves much ever. I wonder what the passage of time is like to an anaconda. \n\nThe exhibit also has a lot of fish in it, and one small member of the crocodile family. At the far end there is a section with a few monkeys in it, but I think they and the anaconda are in separated exhibits.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639dh2134lx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.713573,45.508764]}},{"properties":{"name":"We Stumbled onto the Zoo","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/bear_malayan_sun.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 4001 Southwest Canyon Road, Portland, OR, 97221We didn\\'t really have any plans. I just wanted to drive up the hill behind <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/jason\">Jason</a> and <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/deisnor\">Di-Ann\\'s</a> neighborhood to see if we could find a nice view. I didn\\'t even know that the zoo was up there.\n\nAs I went up the hill, I saw signs for Washington Park and decided to follow them, then I saw signs for the zoo. As we entered Washinton Park near the Rose Garden, I saw the sign for the zoo train and decided that wandering around the zoo would be a great thing to do for the afternoon.\n\nWe got really lucky with a free parking spot on Sherwood, right next to the Rose Test Garden and the <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/post/158916\">Zoo Train Station</a>. We walked over to the Rose Garden concession stand for a bottle of water and an apple, then we walked up to the train station.\n\nWe ended up having a great day at the zoo, even though we hadn\\'t planned on going anywhere in particular.\n\nAt the end of our visit we ran into Di-Ann and Emiko and Tabor.
