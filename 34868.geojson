The lawless Cite Soleil is regarded by many as one of the most dangerous places on earth. It was developed as a shanty town. Most of its estimated 200,000 to 400,000 residents live in extreme poverty.[1] The area is generally regarded as one of the poorest and most dangerous areas of the Western Hemisphere's poorest country; it is one of the biggest slums in the Northern Hemisphere. There is little to no police presence, no sewers, no stores, and little to no electricity.[2]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe neighborhood, originally designed to house manual laborers for a local Export Processing Zone (EPZ), quickly became home to squatters from around the countryside looking for work in the newly constructed factories. After a 1991 coup d'état deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a boycott of Haitian products closed the EPZ.[3] Cité Soleil was soon thrust into extreme poverty and persistent unemployment, with high rates of illiteracy.[2]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nArmed gangs roam the streets. Murder, rape, kidnapping, looting, and shootings are common as every few blocks is controlled by one of more than 30 armed factions.[4] The area has been called a &amp;quot;microcosm of all the ills in Haitian society: endemic unemployment, illiteracy, non-existent public services, insanitary conditions, rampant crime and armed violence&amp;quot;.[5]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it took nearly two weeks for relief aid to arrive in Cité-Soleil.[6] Although the US military have willingly accepted their new role, their relief efforts have been criticized by some as insufficient.[7]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;","link:enclosure (image/jpeg)":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4768687556_3a5c1907f6_o.jpg","updated":{"end_time":"2010/07/06 13:46:00 -0400","original":"Tue Jul 06 17:45:59 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/06 13:45:59 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.334177,18.586343]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oddwick/4775650640/","title":"Crying","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/08 17:39:36 -0400","original":"Thu Jul 08 21:39:35 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/08 17:39:35 -0400"},"id":"127","link:license (text/html)":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/oddwick/\"&gt;Todd Huffman&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oddwick/4775650640/\" title=\"Crying\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4775650640_9a41288850_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Crying\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lone child in a Cite Soleil slum.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cité_Soleil\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cité_Soleil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","link:enclosure (image/jpeg)":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4775650640_9d249c49b6_o.jpg","updated":{"end_time":"2010/07/08 17:39:36 -0400","original":"Thu Jul 08 21:39:35 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/08 17:39:35 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.339971,18.603711]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oddwick/5695023314/","title":"UAV Landing","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/06 21:57:29 -0400","original":"2011-05-07T01:57:28Z","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/06 21:57:28 -0400"},"id":"a64ffv917zm2","link:license (text/html)":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en","description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/oddwick/\">Todd Huffman</a> posted a video:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oddwick/5695023314/\" title=\"UAV Landing\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5309/5695023314_6e695bf1f6_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"135\" alt=\"UAV Landing\"></a>\n\nA UAV landing at Camp Roberts.
