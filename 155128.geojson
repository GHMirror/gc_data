The coordinates are for sporting venues. A place only appears if 5 or more people have checked into a location. The category only picks up locations that have been put into a category related to the sport. It may not be accurate as a location may be mistagged or tagged with other categories. (Example: Eden Park in Auckland was tagged as a baseball stadium, not a football stadium. It appears under baseball. The United Center in Chicago appears under hockey and basketball.) Sporting events being played may not match the category.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"total people":{"max":319,"min":319,"median":319},"lattitude":{"max":36.150599,"min":36.150599,"median":36.150599},"total checkins":{"max":1281,"min":1281,"median":1281},"date time":{"max":"2011/09/10 16:28:00 -0400","min":"2011/09/10 16:28:00 -0400","median":"2011/09/10 16:28:00 -0400"},"longitude":{"max":-86.809369,"min":-86.809369,"median":-86.809369},"count":{"max":7,"min":7,"median":7}},"features":[{"properties":{"category 16":null,"category 8":null,"total people":319,"city":"Nashville","lattitude":36.150599,"category 17":null,"category 9":null,"category 18":null,"total checkins":1281,"date time":{"end_time":"2011/09/10 16:29:00 -0400","original":" 9/10/11 16:28","granularity":"min","time":"2011/09/10 16:28:00 -0400"},"category 19":null,"category 20":null,"category 1":"Ski Area","category 10":null,"category 2":"Skating Rink","category 11":null,"category 3":null,"postal code":"37203","category 12":null,"category 4":null,"category 13":null,"category 5":null,"longitude":-86.809369,"count":7,"id":"a636myhmzu31","category 14":null,"category 6":null,"category 15":null,"category 7":null,"state":"TN","location":"The Centennial Sportsplex"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.809369,36.150599]}}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-13T03:59:19-04:00","id":155128}
