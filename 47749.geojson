This building was originally called the Flavian Ampitheatre. The 160- foot Colosseum was built by the Romans between 70-72 AD under Emperor Vespasian. The elliptical-shaped structure kept participants from retreating in corners. The Colosseum could hold iver 50,000 people and seating was divided into different sections by class. Underneath the Colosseum lies and intricate web of tunnels and cages for the gladiators and animals to be held. Numerous trap doors provided more exciting entrances.\r\n\r\nThe Romans are known for their love of brutality and the Colosseum is home to the famous gladiator wars. Gladiators consisted of slaves or criminals committed of a crime and sometimes free men who volunteered. The men would fight each other to the death. To add a new element, the Colosseum would sometimes be filled with water and naval battles would be performed. The Colosseum now lies in ruins but is still a great historical monument of Roman culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68w7sj05uki"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.482323,41.895466]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eiffel Tower","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\" href=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\">Rosebud423</a><img src=\"http://www.europeportreviews.com/WesternEuropeImages/Eiffel_Tower.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.traveljournals.net/pictures/l/1/14721-eiffel-tower-paris-france.jpg\">Paris, FranceThe Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and therefore named in honor of him. His design was unanimously chosen out of 700 designs entered in a competition. People developed mixed feelings about the Eiffel Tower. A petition of 300 names opposed to construction of the tower. Despite the oppposition, construction began in 1887. It was completed in 1889 for the Exhibition of Paris. \r\n\r\nThe tower is made completely of iron and weighs 7000 tons. It reaches a height of 1,052 feet and was the tallest structure in the world until 1930 with the construction of the Chrysler Building. The Eiffel Tower was actually about to be destroyed in 1909 because it was accused of having no important use. It was saved due to its antenna used as a vital telegraphy service. Its antenna is also used for radio and television transmissions. The Eiffel Tower is now accepted by all the French people as an important French symbol.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68w7sgeaqiv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.350966,48.856558]}},{"properties":{"name":"Great Wall of China","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\" href=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\">Rosebud423</a><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2128102856_91f60ca172.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2360/1753142050_b00c6bd141.jpg\">ChinaThe Great Wall of China is an extensive and magnificent structure. It stretches over 4,000 miles long and travels from east to west China. The wall was built to defend it from invadors. The wall was built over 2,000 years ago from stone, wood, bricks, or grass and little of it is still standing. More than 1 million people participate on construction of the wall and thousands of them died and were buried in the wall.\r\n\r\nBefore the Great Wall, many smaller sections of walls were built by individual states to protect themselves. Emporer Qin connected the walls in 221 B.C. During the Ming dynasty, construction of the wall peaked and the wall greatly expanded. The Great Wall of China is about 22 feet high and 16 feet wide. The Great Wall of China is an incredible structure that contains so much history.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68w7sf6zl75"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hoover Dam","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\" href=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\">Rosebud423</a><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2385/2307807147_62eef14f10.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2148/2271130940_a3ee5ed3e3.jpg\">Boulder City, NVThe Hoover Dam was originally called Boulder Dam due to its location. After the location of the dam changed, the name continued. In 1930, the name was changed to Hoover Dam at the Silver Spike Ceremony in honor of President Hoover. It was built from 1930 to 1935. The Hoover Dam is an important structure in American history that harvested massive amounts of energy from the Colorado River. \r\n\r\nThe Hoover Dam is 726 feet tall; 171 feet taller than the Washington Monument. It contains 4 1/2 million cubic yards of concrete. That\\'s enough concrete to build a 4 foot sidewalk around the earth at the equator. The base of the dam is 660 feet thick; as much as 2 football fields measured from end to end. The Hoover Dam is definitely an engineering wonder. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68w7s82abr2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.831667,35.978611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Leaning Tower of Pisa","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\" href=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\">Rosebud423</a><img src=\"http://www.freefoto.com/images/14/19/14_19_53---The-Leaning-Tower-of-Pisa--Tuscany--Italy_web.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.solarnavigator.net/geography/geography_images/Italy_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg\">Pisa, ItalyThe Leaning Tower of Pisa is a bell tower located in Pisa, Italy. It is a national landmark and major tourist attraction. A wealthy widow, Berta of Bernardo, gave a donation of sixty coins in her will to the church to purchase stones to build the bell tower next the cathedral. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a 183-foot circular building with 8 floors and 293 stairs. The tower took centuries to build due to miscalculations and problems.\r\n   \r\nConstruction of the tower began on August 9th, 1173. The architect remains a mystery to this day. The lean of the tower became noticable after building the third floor due to an unstable foundation of a clay mixture. Construcion was halted for almost 100 years to allow the soil to settle. The last four levels were built and the bell tower was added. Construction ended between 1360-1370. It now leans about 14 feet fromt the top floor. Multiple attempts have been made to reverse the leaning of the tower. Accomplishments have been made but the lean has not been entirely reversed.

The idea of carving into the mountains was conceived in 1923 to bring attraction to South Dakota. Carving began in 1927. Dynamite was often used to clear large areas of rocks out of the mountain. 90% of the granite removed from the mountain was done with dynamite. The four famous faces were carved by Gutzon Borglum.\r\n\r\nThe people chosen to be carved in Mount Rushmore were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. George Washington was chosen due to his significance as America\\'s \"founding father\" and first President. Jefferson, our 3rd President, was chosen for his great contributions to the U.S. with the Louisiana Purchase. He also drafted the Declaration of Independence. Due to his dedication through politics and perseverence through the Civil War, Lincoln earned a spot on the monument. Lincoln was favored by Borglum and he even named his son after him. Theodore Roosevelt was the only selection to bring controversy. Borglum chose him due to his fondness and for Roosevelt\\'s completion of the Panama Canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Mount Rushmore is a famous place in American history that contains the faces of important U.S. figures.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68w7sjqs5i2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.425366,43.893603]}},{"properties":{"name":"Niagara Falls","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\" href=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\">Rosebud423</a><img src=\"http://www.radisson.com/rad/images/hotels/ONNIAGRA/loc_450.jpg\">Niagara Falls, New York Niagara Falls is an amazing place. It is an immense waterfall on the border of the United States and Canada. It is the second largest falls on the earth. 12 million tourists visit the mighty falls each  year. Niagara Falls is actually a collective name for three separate waterfalls. \r\n\r\nThe American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls are located next to each other and separated by a small island called Luna island. Bridal Veil falls received its name due to its appearance.These two falls are 1,060 feet wide, 176 feet tall, and 150,000 gallons of water falls over them per second.\r\n\r\nThe third falls is the Canadaian or \"Horseshoe\" Falls. It is 2,600 feet wide with a 167 feet drop. 600,000 gallons of water fall over it per second. Daredevils have attempted to survive a journey over Horshoe Falls. Annie Taylor was the first woman and the first person to go over the falls in a barrell. On October 24, 1901 she made the dive and survived. Instead of the fame and fortune she anticipated, she became a Niagara street vendor and died with nothing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68w7s8zzuum"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.060758,43.090591]}},{"properties":{"name":"Statue of Liberty","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\" href=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\">Rosebud423</a><img src=\"http://www.ken-lab.com/assets/images/Statue_of_Liberty640.jpg\">Liberty Island New York, NYThe Statue of Liberty originally called \"Liberty Enlightening the World\" is an important United States monument.

The statue was given as a gift from France symbolizing their friendship during the American Revolution. Frederic  Auguste Bartholdi with the aid of Alexandre-Gustave  Eiffel, the mastermind of the Eiffel tower,  were the sculptors of the 151-foot masterpiece that has been visited by over 5 million people each year. \r\n\r\nThe Statue of Liberty is made of a steel skeleton with a copper overlay and weighs almost 225 tons. It was dedicated as a national monument on October 15th, 1924. The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of unity between two nations but has also become a symbol of patriotism among American people. She holds a torch to symbolize enlightenment and a tablet inscribed with the Roman numeral U.S. date of independence to represent the book of law. The seven rays of her crown symbolize the seven seas and the seven continents.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68w7sflzvjt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.045364,40.68979]}},{"properties":{"name":"Taj Mahal","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\" href=\"http://platial.com/rosebud423\">Rosebud423</a><img src=\"http://bulgar.no-ip.info/downloads/snimki/wall/Taj%20Mahal,%20Agra,%20India.jpg\">The Taj Mahal is a beatiful building in Agra, India.

Construction occured in two phases: 1848-1856 and 1876-1884. There was a gap during construction because of the Civil War and a lack of adequate funding. The original design for the monument by Robert Mills was an elaborate statue of Washington in a chariot. The design was later changed to a simpler obelisk structure.\r\n\r\nThe monument was only 152 feet tall when construction was halted. It was planned to be 600 feet tall but due to uncapable foundation, the monument was only built 550 feet tall. The Washington Monument is the tallest building in Washington, D.C. by law. It cost over ,180,000. It was offically opened to the public in October of 1888. Inside the monument there is an elevator and an 897-step stairway.
