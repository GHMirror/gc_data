The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, from what is called “Mexicanized” and reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico to the Puuc style found among the Puuc Maya of the northern lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6killgcd65z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.094338,20.709879]}},{"properties":{"name":"Colossus of Rhodes","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Colosse_de_Rhodes_%28Barclay%29.jpg/400px-Colosse_de_Rhodes_%28Barclay%29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Rhodes0211.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> This drawing of Colossus of Rhodes, which illustrated The Grolier Society\\'s 1911 Book of Knowledge, is probably fanciful, as the statue likely did not stand astride the harbour mouth. \r\nColossus of Rhodes, imagined in a 16th-century engraving by Martin Heemskerck, part of his series of the Seven Wonders of the World.The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek god Helios, erected on the Greek island of Rhodes by Chares of Lindos between 292 and 280 BC.

It was abandoned less than 100 years later. It is likely that most of its inhabitants were wiped out by smallpox before the Spanish conquistadores arrived in the area, and there is no record of their having known of the remote city. Hiram Bingham, the credited discoverer of the site, along with several others, originally hypothesized that the citadel was the traditional birthplace of the Inca of the \"Virgins of the Suns\".[4]\r\n\r\nAnother theory maintains that Machu Picchu was an Inca \"llacta\", a settlement built to control the economy of these conquered regions. Yet another asserts that it may have been built as a prison for a select few who had committed heinous crimes against Inca society. Research conducted by scholars, such as John Rowe and Richard Burger, has convinced most archaeologists that rather than a defensive retreat, Machu Picchu was an estate of the Inca emperor, Pachacuti. In addition, Johan Reinhard presented evidence that the site was selected because of its position relative to sacred landscape features—such as its mountains, which are purported to be in alignment with key astronomical events that would have been important to the Incas.\r\n\r\nAlthough the citadel is located only about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Cusco, the Inca capital, it was never found by the Spanish and consequently not plundered and destroyed, as was the case with many other Inca sites. Over the centuries, the surrounding jungle grew over much of the site, and few knew of its existence. On July 24, 1911, Machu Picchu was brought to the attention of scholars by Hiram Bingham, an American historian employed as a lecturer at Yale University. Bingham was led up to Machu Picchu by a local 11 year old Quechan boy named Pablito Alvarez.[5] Bingham undertook archaeological studies and completed a survey of the area. Bingham coined the name \"The Lost City of the Incas\", which was the title of his first book.\r\n\r\nBingham had been searching for the city of Vilcapampa, the last Inca refuge and spot of resistance during the Spanish conquest of Peru. In 1911, after years of previous trips and explorations around the zone, he was led to the citadel by Quechuans. These people were living in Machu Picchu, in the original Inca infrastructure. Although most of the original inhabitants had died within a century of the city\\'s construction, a small number of families survived so by the time the site was \\'discovered\\' in 1911, people still were living on the site, and many mummies—mostly of women—were discovered as well. Bingham made several more trips and conducted excavations on the site through 1915, carrying off artifacts. He wrote a number of books and articles about the discovery of Machu Picchu in his lifetime.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6killioqq75"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.545556,-13.163056]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mausoleum at Halicarnassus","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bodrummauzoleum.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/The_maussolleion_model_dsc02711-miniaturk_nevit.jpg/450px-The_maussolleion_model_dsc02711-miniaturk_nevit.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Tomb of Mausolus, Mausoleum of Mausolus or Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (in Greek, Μαυσωλεῖον της Ἁλικαρνασσοῦ) was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC at Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus, a satrap in the Persian Empire, and Artemisia II of Caria, his wife and sister. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythis. It stood approximately 45 metres (135 ft) in height, and each of the four sides was adorned with sculptural reliefs created by each one of four Greek sculptors — Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas of Paros and Timotheus.

It is renowned for its rock-cut architecture. Petra is also one of the new wonders of the world. The Nabateans constructed it as their capital city around 100 BCE.\r\n\r\nThe site remained unknown to the Western world until 1812, when it was introduced to the West by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. It was famously described as \"a rose-red city half as old as time\" in a Newdigate prize-winning sonnet by John William Burgon. UNESCO has described it as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man\\'s cultural heritage.\" In 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site.\r\n\r\nRekem is an ancient name for Petra and appears in Dead Sea scrolls associated with Mount Seir. Additionally, Eusebius and Jerome assert that Rekem was the native name of Petra, supposedly on the authority of Josephus. Pliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataeans, Aramaic-speaking Semites, and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6killfeg6ky"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.441944,30.328611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pyramids of Egypt","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/PyramidsofGiza_at_night.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> Jīzah, EgyptThe Giza Necropolis stands on the Giza Plateau, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt.

In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was cited as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the white domed marble mausoleum is its most familiar component, the Taj Mahal is actually an integrated complex of structures. Building began around 1632 and was completed around 1653, and employed thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The Persian architect, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri is generally considered to be the principal designer of the Taj Mahal.\r\n\r\nIn 1631, Shah Jahan, emperor during the Mughal empire\\'s period of greatest prosperity, was griefstricken when his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, died during the birth of their fourteenth child, Gauhara Begum. The court chronicles of Shah Jahan\\'s grief illustrates the love story traditionally held as an inspiration for Taj Mahal. The construction of Taj Mahal begun soon after Mumtaz\\'s death with the principal mausoleum completed in 1648. The surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. Emperor Shah Jahan himself described the Taj in these words:\r\n\r\nShould guilty seek asylum here,\r\nLike one pardoned, he becomes free from sin.\r\nShould a sinner make his way to this mansion,\r\nAll his past sins are to be washed away.\r\nThe sight of this mansion creates sorrowing sighs;\r\nAnd the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.\r\nIn this world this edifice has been made;\r\nTo display thereby the creator\\'s glory.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6killjazc8f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[78.042222,27.174167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Temple of Artemis","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Ac_artemisephesus.jpg/800px-Ac_artemisephesus.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Temple of Artemis (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον Artemision), also known less precisely as Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to Artemis completed— in its most famous phase— around 550 BC at Ephesus (in present-day Turkey) under the Achaemenid dynasty of the Persian Empire. Nothing remains of the temple, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. There were previous temples on its site, where evidence of a sanctuary dates as early as the Bronze Age.\r\n\r\nThe old temple antedated the Ionic immigration by many years. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis, attributed the origin of the temenos at Ephesus to the Amazons, whose worship he imagines already centered upon an image (bretas). In the seventh century the old temple was destroyed by a flood. Around 550 BC, they started to build the \"new\" temple, known as one of the wonders of the ancient world. It was a 120-year project, initially designed and constructed by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes, at the expense of Croesus of Lydia.\r\n\r\nIt was described by Antipater of Sidon, who compiled the list of the Seven Wonders:\r\n\r\nI have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, and the colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \"Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\".<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6killjr5elj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.363889,37.949722]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Colosseum","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Cole_Thomas_Interior_of_the_Colosseum_Rome_1832.jpg/800px-Cole_Thomas_Interior_of_the_Colosseum_Rome_1832.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/The_Christian_Martyrs_Last_Prayer.jpg/800px-The_Christian_Martyrs_Last_Prayer.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg/800px-Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> Rome, ItalyThe Colosseum or Roman Coliseum, originally the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium, Italian Anfiteatro Flavio or Colosseo), is an elliptical amphitheatre in the center of the city of Rome, Italy, the largest ever built in the Roman Empire. It is one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and Roman engineering.\r\n\r\nOccupying a site just east of the Roman Forum, its construction started between 70 and 72 AD under the emperor Vespasian and was completed in 80 AD under Titus, with further modifications being made during Domitian\\'s reign (81–96). The name \"Amphitheatrum Flavium\" derives from both Vespasian\\'s and Titus\\'s family name (Flavius, from the gens Flavia).\r\n\r\nCapable of seating 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. As well as the gladiatorial games, other public spectacles were held there, such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that about 500,000 people and over a million wild animals died in the Colosseum games.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6killjlrg5w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.482323,41.895466]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Great Wall of China","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Map_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China.jpg/745px-Map_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Great_wall_of_china-mutianyu_4.JPG/800px-Great_wall_of_china-mutianyu_4.JPG\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Jinshangling2.jpg/800px-Jinshangling2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Great_wall_of_china-mutianyu_3.JPG/800px-Great_wall_of_china-mutianyu_3.JPG\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/The_Great_wall_-_by_Bernard_Goldbach.jpg/800px-The_Great_wall_-_by_Bernard_Goldbach.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Chinese_Wall.JPG/800px-Chinese_Wall.JPG\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Great_Wall_of_China_location_map.PNG/800px-Great_Wall_of_China_location_map.PNG\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Greatwall_large.jpg/519px-Greatwall_large.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Noel_2005_P%C3%A9kin_031_muraille_de_chine_Mutianyu.jpg/800px-Noel_2005_P%C3%A9kin_031_muraille_de_chine_Mutianyu.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/GreatWall_2004_Summer_1.jpg/800px-GreatWall_2004_Summer_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> ChinaThe Great Wall of China (simplified Chinese: 长城; traditional Chinese: 長城; pinyin: Chángchéng; literally \"long city/fortress\") or (simplified Chinese: 万里长城; traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng; literally \"The long wall of 10,000 Li (里)\") is a series of stone and earthen fortifications in China, built, rebuilt, and maintained between the 5th century BC and the 16th century to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire from Xiongnu attacks during the rule of successive dynasties. Several walls, referred to as the Great Wall of China, were built since the 5th century BC. One of the most famous is the wall built between 220–206 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang; little of it remains; it was much farther north than the current wall, which was built during the Ming Dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe Great Wall stretches over approximately 6,400 km (4,000 miles) from Shanhaiguan in the east to Lop Nur in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia, but stretches to over 6,700 km (4,160 miles) in total. At its peak, the Ming Wall was guarded by more than one million men. It has been estimated that somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 million Chinese died as part of the centuries-long project of building the wall.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kill8wsurz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Hanging Gardens of Babylon","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, also known as the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis, near present-day Al Hillah in Iraq (formerly Babylon), is considered one of the original Seven Wonders of the World. They were built by Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BC. He is reported to have constructed the gardens to please his wife, Amytis of Media, who longed for the trees and fragrant plants of her homeland Persia. The gardens were destroyed by several earthquakes after the 2nd century BC.\r\n\r\nThe lush Hanging Gardens are extensively documented by Greek historians such as Strabo and Diodorus Siculus. Through the ages, the location may have been confused with gardens that existed at Nineveh, since tablets from there clearly show gardens. Writings on these tablets describe the possible use of something similar to an Archimedes screw as a process of raising the water to the required height. Nebuchadnezzar II also used massive slabs of stone, which was unheard of in Babylon, to prevent the water from eroding the ground.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kill99ksky"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[44.433333,32.483333]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Lighthouse of Alexandria","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/PHAROS2006.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Lighthouse_-_Thiersch.gif\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Pharos_of_Alexandria1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Lighthouse of Alexandria (or The Pharos of Alexandria, Greek: ὁ Φάρος τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας) was a tower built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247 BC) on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt to serve as that port\\'s landmark, and later, its lighthouse.\r\n\r\nWith a height variously estimated at between 115 and 200 m (380 and 660 ft) it was among the tallest man-made structures on Earth for many centuries, and was identified as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World by Antipater of Sidon. It may have been the third tallest building after the two Great Pyramids (of Khufu and Khafra) for its entire life. Some scholars estimate that would make the tower the tallest building up to the 14th century.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kill7s2vkm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[29.885,31.214167]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Statue of Zeus","description":"Posted by Squitano<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Zeus_Hermitage_St._Petersburg_20021009.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was made by the Greek sculptor of the Classical period, Phidias, circa 432 BC on the site where it was erected in the temple of Zeus, Olympia, Greece.\r\n\r\nThe seated statue, some 12 meters (39 feet) tall, occupied the whole width of the aisle of the temple built to house it. \"It seems that if Zeus were to stand up,\" the geographer Strabo noted early in the first century BC, \"he would unroof the temple.\" Zeus was a chryselephantine sculpture, made of ivory and gold-plated bronze. No copy, in marble or bronze, has survived, though there are recognizable but approximate versions on coins of Elis and Roman coins and engraved gems but a very detailed description of the sculpture and the throne was recorded by the traveller Pausanias, in the second century AD. In the sculpture, he was wreathed with shoots of olive and seated on a magnificent throne of cedarwood, inlaid with ivory, gold, ebony, and precious stones. In Zeus\\' right hand there was a small statue of crowned Nike, goddess of victory, also chryselephantine, and in his left hand, a sceptre inlaid with metals, on which an eagle perched. Plutarch, in his Life of the Roman general Aemilius Paulus, records that the victor over Macedon, when he beheld the statue, “was moved to his soul, as if he had beheld the god in person,” while the Greek orator Dio Chrysostom declared that a single glimpse of the statue would make a man forget his earthly troubles.\r\n\r\nThe date of the statue, in the third quarter of the fifth century BC, long a subject of debate, was confirmed archaeologically by the rediscovery and excavation of Phidias\\' workshop.\r\n\r\nAccording to a legend, when Phidias was asked what inspired him -- whether he climbed Mount Olympus to see Zeus, or whether Zeus came down from Olympus so that Phidias could see him -- the artist answered that he portrayed Zeus according to Book One, verses 528 - 530 of Homer´s Iliad.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6killbwl2i0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.629444,37.638611]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/618673","metadata":null,"contact_name":"squitano","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:squitano","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/618673","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":18,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=618673,platial:user=squitano","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41457}
