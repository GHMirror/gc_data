From the mad passion of Carnaval to the immensity of the dark Amazon, it is a country of mythic proportions.\n\nPerhaps it\\'s not quite the Eden of popular imagination, but it\\'s still a land of staggering beauty.

Tropicana, Las Vegas NV 89121 Las Vegas is known for the unusual and offbeat. Places like the Liberace Museum, the Neon Museum, the Clown Factory, The Elvis Museum, the Barry Manilow Store, the Pinball Hall of Fame... Wait a second. The Pinball Hall of Fame? What exactly is that? Or more importantly, why is there a Pinball Hall of Fame?\n\nThe Pinball Hall of Fame is an attempt by the members of the Las Vegas Pinball Collectors Club to house and display the world\\'s largest pinball collection, open to the public. A not-for-profit corporation was established to further this cause. The games belong to one club member (Tim Arnold), and range from 1950s up to 1990s pinball machines. Since it is a non-profit museum, older games from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s are the prevelant, as this was the \\'heyday\\' of pinball. There are no \\'ticket spitters\\' here (aka kiddie casinos or redemption). It\\'s all pure pinball (and a few arcade novelty games) from the past. And since it\\'s a non-profit, excess revenues go to non-denominational charities. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xybyrzo1a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.102156,36.100054]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yellowstone National Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a><img src=\"http://data2.itc.nps.gov/parkphotos/roosveltarch%2Ejpg\"><img src=\"http://www.nps.gov/yell/slidefile/nationalparkareas/Images/04685.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1402.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1395.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1444.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Long before any recorded human history in Yellowstone, a massive volcanic eruption spewed an immense volume of ash that covered all of the western U.S., much of the Midwest, northern Mexico and some areas of the eastern Pacific.
