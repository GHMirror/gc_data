When I\\'m in the right mood, I can <i>own</i> my cheesy pick-up lines.\n\nIt reminds me of my friend Mike the Aussie, who was once reading a newspaper on a subway and noticed a pretty girl watching him from across the train, as well as a guy behind her staring at his paper. He took out a marker and wrote, \"You are very, very good-looking. (No, not the dude.)\" on his paper, and held it up so she\\'d see it when he went back to reading the paper.

La\\'ie\\'s kind of <i>weird</i>.  It\\'s mostly Mormon, and it\\'s where Brigham-Young University is, and they\\'ve set up this phenomenally successful Polynesian Cultural Center to make money for the university.  So you\\'ve got an odd situation where a bunch of Mormons have become the curators of a culture that died out, to make money for their church.  So La\\'ie has some weird influences.  The mormon population means the grocery stores don\\'t sell liquor, and everything, even the beaches, are closed on Sundays.  But the Polynesian influence means...  Well, here\\'s what the La\\'ie McDonalds looks like:\n\n<a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/LaieMcDonalds1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/LaieMcDonalds1.jpg\" alt=\"Image hosted by Photobucket.com\" width=\"600\"></a>\nInside it\\'s big and weird and shaded, and looks more like a fancy restaurant than a fast food franchise.  There are lots of vitrines (plexiglass museum display boxes) inside, full of Polynesian artifacts like the instruments they\\'d play ancient hula music on, and a fountain in the back.  And, apparently, this McDonalds does karaoke.\n\nI wasn\\'t in La\\'ie for even an hour before I got missionaries trying to pimp their good friend God to me.  \"Our friend Jesus thinks you\\'re really cute.\"  (Note:  Not a literal quote.)  They\\'re clever in La\\'ie; they send attractive young women after the young guys.  I found myself talking to a girl from Japan and another from Nevada for a while before I read their nametags more closely (I figured they were guides with the tour group I was near), and realized they weren\\'t actually really friendly, outgoing people who though I looking interesting and wanted to be friends.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:18EegjV1ms4J:www.str.com.br/English/Scientia/memeplexes.htm+%22altruism+trick%22&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari\">Altruism Trick</a> makes me sad.

American culture is a pulpy fluid with big solid chunks still in it, unshredded cultures that survive on, floating in the goo. For the moment.\n\nAnd then, occasionally, America turns the blender on. And when they turn it off again, you can buy sushi and Top Ramen in grocery stores without having to go to the ethnic foods section.\n\nThis is one of the things living in Hawai\\'i has taught me. Here, the blender is more active than usual. You can buy dim sum out of a plexiglas display on the counter of 7-11, and when you throw the cellophane away outside, the trash can says \"Mahalo\" instead of \"Thank You.\" This is a place where cultures meet, and get pureed together so the rest of America can digest them easier.\n\nAnd that\\'s good, because it adds variety. And it\\'s bad, because the \"variety\" it creates is just more mass-produced, mono-culture crap with no meaning left behind it, goo with a different flavor but the same consistency as everything else.

In the above photo, a monk is balanced on the points of <i>six spears</i>, and they didn\\'t break his skin.  It was insane.\n\nThere were 18 monks in this exhibition, ranging in ages from 5 to 22 (yes, they\\'re all younger than me.  It was humbling.  Like most things in my life), plus their grandmaster, who did some incredibly badass feats.  In fact, they all did incredibly badass feats.\n\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/twinfingers.gif\" alt=\"Image hosted by Photobucket.com\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/keikikungfu.gif\" alt=\"Image hosted by Photobucket.com\" height=\"357\">Like <b>doing handstands, using only two fingers</b>... and then <b>doing <i>one-handed handstands</i>, using only two fingers</b>.\n\nThe coolest part was that the youngest monks... were 5-year-old triplets.  The Shaolin Triplets.  They were not only badass, they were adorable too -- kind of shy when they first came out on stage, and then way cool when they started doing things.  They did headsprings.  People did lots of headspings in this show.  They also leaned over and planted their heads on the ground... and then <i>walked around them</i> spinning their bodies, keeping their heads planted on the stage.\n\nThere were lots of weapons demonstrations, and animal-style demonstrations.  There was a guy who demonstrated drunken boxing, and then drunken sword fighting, and then drunken staff fighting.  There were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip-up\">kip-ups</a> in every single demonstration.  They did lots of flips and tucks and cartwheels and stuff, all right out of my gymnastics class -- except they never landed on their feet, they always landed on their backs, which was a little odd.\n\nThe grandmaster did demonstrations where big, burly men in the audience would get a chance to try to hurt him.  He took repeated kicks to the crotch from very large men, and chain-punches to the stomach... and then the monks brought in a battering ram, and a bunch of them rammed it into his stomach a lot.  The Shaolin Triplets did a \\'shell game,\\' where kids from the audience had to close their eyes while the three kids ran around and rearranged themselves, and then the kids had to guess which of the three was which.  And there was a really cheezy computer animated video accompanying it, and a very \\'80s World music soundtrack.  So in addition to being extremely badass, it was also extremely exploitative.\n\nAfterwards, they signed autographs and posed for pictures...  and my friend Japalino was totally crushing on her \\'dreamboat monk\\' (which was the coolest thing ever -- my friend had a crush on a monk!  A monk who could kick your ass!).  And I was thinking...\n\nThis is a bunch of <i>monks</i>, from China.

I don\\'t remember.  I do remember screaming \"OH MY GOD!!!\" at the absolute top of my lungs as I found myself abruptly falling out of an airplane.\n\nThink about the last time you flew somewhere.  Think about cruising altitude, when the clouds cleared below you, and you could see the ground.  Remember it?  Remember how much you could see, and how far away it looked?\n\nIt\\'s just like that.  Only it completely surrounds you, there\\'s no tiny scratched doublepane plexiglass airplane porthole restricting your view.  It\\'s all around you everywhere you look.  You\\'re up above the clouds, and above you is sky, and below you is the ground.\n\nIt\\'s just like looking out an airplane window.  Except you\\'re falling towards it at terminal velocity, 124 miles an hour, and the wind is worse that you\\'ve ever felt it, and it\\'s coming <i>up</i> instead of sideways, and it\\'s in your sinuses and in your throat and your cheeks won\\'t stop flapping and your voice doesn\\'t get any louder, yet you still can\\'t hear yourself, and you\\'re wishing you\\'d worn a hoodie instead of a tanktop, because goddamn it\\'s cold.  And it\\'s all getting BIGGER, and more detailed, and closer.\n\nOne way or another, I stepped out of the plane, and fell.  And my first thought was \"I JUST JUMPED OUT OF A PLANE!!  WHY!  WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING??\"  \n\nO\\'ahu is a small island.  From three miles up, it seems like you can see the whole thing.  You can certainly see most of the North Shore, and the east side, the Windward side, of the island too, and the mountains and plains in the interior.  If you can\\'t see the whole thing, you can see enough that it seems like it.  I don\\'t know what it\\'s like to skydive anywhere else, but skydive on O\\'ahu, and you can see it all, this extreme range of landscapes.  Big, lush mountains to one side of me; gorgeous, blue-green ocean on the other side, and under me is forests and farmlands and a town that\\'s rapidly resolving itself into roads and houses and swimming pools.\n\nSo my first thought got interrupted by my second thought, \"Oh my god this is so incredibly cool!\"\n\nI really don\\'t have the words for it.  It was incredible.  I was in freefall, I didn\\'t have a clue what I was doing, but there was far too much to see and feel for me to actually worry about it.  There was The World, and I was too engrossed in it to really be concerned with my own imminent mortality any more.\n\nFreefall lasted a full minute.\n\nAnd then, with a tremendous yanking on my extremities, the parachute opened, and the wind cut out its upward flooding, and resumed a more normal sideways motion.  We weren\\'t falling anymore, we were flying.  And it was suddenly really quiet.\n\nI said something like \"Oh, we can talk now.\"  I was a little shocked at the whole thing.\n\n<b>Existential Crisis at 17,000 Feet</b>\nThere\\'s something about dropping like a stone from a plane three miles in the air towards the North Shore of O\\'ahu that really makes one go \"AHHHHHOHMYGODWHATTHEFUCKWASITHINKINGSTOPwow, this is REALLY FUCKING COOL!  Why the FUCK didn\\'t I ever DO THIS BEFORE!!  ... Shit.  What\\'ve I been doing with my life?\"\n\nAt that moment, I felt like I\\'d just utterly wasted 24 years, because they really didn\\'t hold anything that could compare to the world I was approaching.\n\nI talked to Wisconsin about it too, because he\\'s been on a \"What am I doing with myself?\" trip more intense than mine since I met him.  He said he felt the same thing too.\n\nI really want to talk about it.  I want to crystalize it in memory, I want to remember every detail I can so I don\\'t lose any of them over time, and I want to tell people bout it.  I want to be able to share it, and I don\\'t want to lose it.\n\nBut I don\\'t have the words.  I don\\'t know if I\\'d say it was a religious experience for me (because that would be dumb), but I think it\\'s the closest I\\'ve ever gotten to one.\n\nPlus, the edges have already lost their sharpness.  As soon as I landed, the Brit and I were going \"Oh my god!  That was awesome!  Wasn\\'t it awesome?  That was awesome!\"  Meanwhile, Wisconsin just had this shocked look on his face.  And then he fell down and lay on his stomach in the grass for a little while.\n\nI wish I\\'d done that.  Taken a minute, by myself, to let it sink in, to pay attention to how I felt and how I\\'d just gotten done feeling, to remember the way it looked and the way it felt, and just <i>focused</i>, instead of jumping back into company.\n\nI think this really could\\'ve changed my life, if I\\'d paid attention to it.  Not, like, massively overhauled my life, but adjusted its course slightly, pointed it in a more specific direction.  (Actually, I think it <i>has</i> -- just not as much as it <i>should</i> have.)  Because... JESUS CHRIST that was intense.  And beautiful.\n\nIt made me wonder why I waste my time on the things I waste my time on, when there\\'s intense and beautiful things to experience out there.\n\nAnyway.  I talked to Wisconsin and my coworker about it.  I want to start doing stuff like that, big, adventurous stuff, on a regular basis.  Shark cage adventures, skydiving, glider riding, bungie jumping if we can find it, stuff like that, once every month or two.  Make it part of What We DO.  Because there\\'s so many things like that that I\\'d like to do, but haven\\'t yet, and I don\\'t have <i>any</i> good reasons not to.\n\nBut that\\'s not the point, is it?  The point is that I don\\'t push myself to do the things that I get the most out of, I\\'m just content to keep on wasting my time.  The point is to raise the bar for the rest of my life, so I don\\'t spend it willfully doing so much mediocre bullshit and dreaming about the things I don\\'t have the guts to actually try.\n\nI\\'m working on that.  Just nowhere near as hard as I <i>should</i> be working on it.\n\n<i>\"...As I look back at countless crossroads, and the middle where I stay.

When I went there in 2005, we\\'d come for one, and ended up doing the other.\n\nA friend of mine at the hostel was turning 21, and rather than have his friends spend money on gifts for him, he wanted us to join him in doing something dangerous, thrilling and expensive with him.\n\nHe decided on a shark cage adventure in Hale\\'iwa (\"holly-eeva\").  So three of us paid 25 and rented a ridiculous red sportscar (which I got to drive), and drove to the North Shore at 8 in the morning.\n\nWe were met by a guy at the dock, who told us it was too windy for the shark cage thing.  The wind made the water choppy, which would make the boat ride suck and the visibility bad.  But if we still wanted to do something expensive and adventurous, he told us, we could go to the Airfield and go for a glider ride.\n\nNone of us were that enthusiastic about gliders, but we had the car, and we\\'d paid 25 that we were going to get refunded anyway, so I drove us to the Airfield.\n\nAnd along the way, we got behind a van for Skydive Hawai\\'i.  \\'Hmm,\\' we thought.  \\'Skydiving...\\'\n\nAt the Airfield I passed the van and turned the car around.  \"You here to skydive?\" the van\\'s driver asked us?\"  Actually, we\\'re just turning around, we told him.  \"Because if you <i>are</i> here to skydive, I\\'ll make it half price.  20.  But you need to make up your minds, because the plane takes off in 10 minutes!\"\n\nThe next 10 minutes were spent initialing waivers.  In 2005, 27 people around the world would die skydiving; that works out to about one every 160,000 jumps, but it\\'s still a huge liability.\n\nAfter that, we got in the plane, which had no door, and flew up to 17,000 feet.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a nice, relaxing morning,\" my friend Wisconsin remarked at one point, \"in a cage, surrounded by sharks!\"\n\n<i>(Read my <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/post/873214\">blog entry</a> about the jump itself, and the effect it had on me.)</i><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxxbx00tm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-158.20004,21.57588]}},{"properties":{"name":"Driving through Kalihi Valley at night on New Year's Eve is like the Gaza Strip, as a ride at Disneyworld.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> [December 31, 2004]You\\'re surrounded by explosions, as the working class celebrates the birth of the new year (or maybe the death of the old one?) as noisily and brightly as possible.

All it needs are some snappy musical numbers about the Israeli/Palestine conflict, and a love story.

I go back as far as I can on top of the rocks, and start my run.\n\nA couple feet from the edge, the duct-tape holding my sandal together breaks, and I fall flat on my face -- a few inches from the edge of the cliff.  So I took my sandals off, and ran and jumped -- and cleared the ledge below by roughly a foot, with enough time to yell \"Ohhhhh shiittttt!\" before I hit the water.

The moon\\'s full, and everything\\'s lit up.  We talked about life, and it was a good time.  It was worth it just for the bike ride.\n\nAnd then we got to the cemetery.  it turned out to be a Chinese graveyard, up on this little hill in the middle of the valley, just high enough that you could see... everything.  Over all the houses on three sides, turning into the slopes of the hills to either side, and eventually turning into the big hotels of Waikiki in front.  It was gorgeous.

You can swing out over the shrine, over the tops of the lions, towards one of those big Chinese gateway-things whose names I don\\'t know.  So I swung on it a lot.

(This was two weeks ago.  it really shakes me up when I get in big conflicts with people, so I\\'m only comfortable writing about it now.)\n\nSo, I laughed joyously the whole ride up to the cemetery, which I found to be just as wonderous as when I left.

It\\'s the sort of idea that makes me <i>glad I exist</i>.\n\nSo I was terribly delighted to open Willamette Week the first week I was in Portland to <a href=\"http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3245/7977/\">discover</a> a group called <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/pillowfightpdx\">Pillow Fight PDX</a> had turned it into a recurring event, with a fight scheduled for the end of the week.\n\nI bought a small heart-shaped throw pillow at Goodwill (both for the irony of beating up people with it, and so I could give it to a friend who likes such things afterwards) and showed up at O\\'Bryant Square a half hour late.  There were still several hundred people there, mostly spectators, but in the middle was a clump of between 50 and 100 folks at any given time, clobbering each other with pillows.\n\n<a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/96/247673242_5e43e704a1_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/96/247673242_5e43e704a1_m.jpg\"></a>The number of combatants would dwindle at times, and then with a shout a new group would come running into the mix of it, adding more cotton batting and feathers to the mess.  At one point, a guy who looked a bit like a high school football player took charge, splitting the battle down the middle.  \"You can take our lives, but you can\\'t take our freedom!\" someone shouted in a Scottish accent, and then the two sides surged at each other.\n\nThe crowd really got into the silliness.  \"I\\'ve got bandaids!\" a girl bearing a first aid kit yelled.  \"Q-Tips!  And condoms!\"  There were lots of people in costume; at one point a guy was getting his picture taken on the lap of someone dressed as Santa, and when I swooped in with my camera for my own picture he yelled \"Everyone sit on Santa\\'s lap!\"\n\nI ran into Mike, the Aussie bloke from the hostel I\\'m staying at.  \"Do you have a photo of someone about to hit you in the camera with a pillow?\" he asked, and then swung his pillow like a windmill until I got a good picture.  \"I look like an evil yuppie!\" he exclaimed when he saw it.  I also followed him around a bit with my camera, figuring if I wanted to sell an article about the whole thing I could interview him later, or at least easily get his full name.  (He confessed afterwards that he was targeting cute girls, and after hitting them with his pillow, he\\'d flirt with them.)\n\n<a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/87/247672991_03450415a3_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/87/247672991_03450415a3.jpg?v=0\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx3y5jnv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.67999,45.52129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pet the Infestation!","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a>The University of Hawaii Manoa is infested with feral cats, just like the rest of Hawaii.

It would also become known for construction faults which led to a partial collapse, as well as for a fire during which a wooden outbuilding burnt down in 1942, killing 39 people (41 according to some sources). The victims were trapped in a locked ward.\n\nThe asylum was less than 20 miles north of Dunedin and close to the county centre of Palmerston, in an isolated coastal spot, within a forested reserve. The site is now divided between the Truby King Recreation Reserve, where all historical buildings have been demolished and most of the area still remains dense woodland,[3] and The Asylum backpacker hostel, which uses some remaining hospital buildings.\n\n(From Wikipedia)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx6np9jb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[170.622242,-45.67741]}},{"properties":{"name":"Seaside Cairns","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/SeasideCairns.jpg?t=1166516287\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/SeasideCairns.jpg?t=1166516287\" width=\"600\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxxbz00gs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.86283,21.55985]}},{"properties":{"name":"Seaside Tree Swing","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/oceanswing.jpg?t=1166516533\" width=\"600\">\nIt seems like every third tree along the ocean on the Windward Side has a rope swing hanging from it.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx61ip8i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.87558,21.56128]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sequential Art:  An art gallery for comics","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 328 nw broadway, portland, ORAn art gallery for comics and other sequential art (a series of art pieces that, when put next to each other in a certain order, tell a story).

After an hour and a half of buses, I discovered that the listing in the newspaper was wrong, it\\'d been yesterday and Friday.  After that, I planned on taking it easy for the evening.  The highlight of the day was running into two of my friends from back home on the bus and bringing them on a tour to my favorite bar, coffeehouse, pizza joint and playground in the neighborhood.\n\nBut then I sang at a strip club instead.\n\nTo preface:  In my 26 years, I\\'ve only been in a strip club once, many years ago.  By the end of the night, I\\'d decided I\\'d never go to one again, because it was just too easy.\n\nToo easy to spend my last 0, which I\\'d planned to spend on re-piercing my eyebrow.\n\nBut when the Aussie told me there\\'s a club further down the bus route that has \"Stripparaoke\" every Sunday night, I knew some things in my head had to change.\n\nAnd so it was that me, the Aussie and the Minnesotan walked into the Devil\\'s Point to the sound of \"Land of the Rising Sun,\" sung by a guy sharing the stage with a dancer named Valentine.\n\nStripparaoke.  It\\'s all in the name.  You\\'re singing karaoke on the stage of the club, next to the pole, reading the lyrics off a TV screen or the projector behind you, surrounded by mirrors -- while a stripper rubs up against you, gyrates around, and occasionally flips upside-down on the pole and spreads her legs for the audience.\n\nThere were some damn good songs.  One guy got on stage, and told us about how one method of torture the U.S. uses against detainees is to play The Eagles loudly, for a long time.  Then he sang \"The Eagles Must Die.\"  Another guy announced, \"This song is from George Bush to Osama bin Laden,\" and sang \"Never There\" by Cake.  \"When I need you, baby?  You\\'re never there!\"\n\nThe Minnesotan sang \"Mustang Sally,\" and the Aussie sang \"Mack The Knife\" despite the computer glitching.  Myself, I chose \"Kiss Off\" by The Violent Femmes over the Dynamite Hack version of \"Boyz in da Hood\" and \"Mambo #5.\"  This wasn\\'t the wisest choice, because as soon as the music started I realized I\\'m only familiar with live recordings off it and the cover Matt Hopper plays, yet I don\\'t think I did that bad in the end.\n\nBut maybe next Sunday it\\'ll be time for \"Boyz in da Hood,\" \"Mambo #5\" and perhaps even \"You Can\\'t Hurry Love\" by The Supremes.

The Losers broke up this winter, and I\\'d been looking forward to seeing Ryan\\'s new bands.\n\nI was not prepared for <b>The Builders And The Butchers</b>.  They shunned the stage, and set up in the middle of the restaurant floor.  They performed unplugged and unmiced, hammering on their guitars, banjos, mandolins and more to make up for it, and Ryan sang without using a microphone.  And the music they played?  <a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/103/256702122_1c785aae6b_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/103/256702122_1c785aae6b_m.jpg\"></a>You know alternate histories, stories where the Confederacy got the A-Bomb and stuff like that?  The Builders And The Butchers are like an alternate history of music, where rock and roll was invented by poor kids in the South in the 1940s.\n\nWhen they started, the audience had a general sensation of \"... What the fuck is <i>this</i>?\"  After a song or two, that turned into \"<i>This</i> is <i>awesome</i>!\"\n\nOn some nights, the band ends the show by leaving the building one by one, and wandering off down the street, still playing their instruments.  I was a little disappointed that they didn\\'t close the show that way when I saw them, although Ryan did take his megaphone up to the stage during the last song.  I\\'m also a little disappointed that they no longer set themselves up under covered bus stops on rainy days and play random shows around town like they did when they were first starting out.  (Ryan told me about one rainy Halloween when they were playing a show at a bus stop -- and a guy walked up with an <i>upright bass</i> and started playing with them.)\n\n<a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/87/256702178_66ac1f2c3c_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/87/256702178_66ac1f2c3c.jpg?v=0\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx5j537j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675558,45.548337]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Byodo-In","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a>A replica of a 900-year-old Japanese temple in the shape of a phoenix.

He had a pair of plastic samurai swords. He stood out in one of the roads, and would stay still until someone walked by him. Then, sometimes, he would scream like a pterodactyl and attack them in a fury of blades, or follow them with one sword. Sometimes he\\'d go down into a crouch, with his swords over his head. \"I do this when I\\'m really angry.\"\n\nHe did this for three hours. Maybe longer.\n\nBy the end of the night, all of us from the booth were following him around, and just watching. Someone put a hat out for tips. The kid must have made 0, 5 by the end of the night.  We also discovered that we could learn his secrets if we gave him money.  For a dollar, he told us his name was Brian.\n\nHis mom finally came to drag him away after midnight.\n\n\"Mom, just so you know, I\\'m not leaving until everyone at the Fair is gone.\"\n\n\"No, actually you\\'re leaving <i>now</i>.\"\n\nA security guard walked over while we were watching him. \"I told that kid to be careful, or somebody\\'s going to lose an eye.\" He pointed at his face -- and we saw that he had a patch over one eye, and a big smirk.\n\nHe showed us his replacement eye, which is made out of coral rather than glass.

When Kamehameha the Great invaded from the Big Island, O\\'ahu\\'s armies made their last stand in the pass, and Kamehameha\\'s armies drove them over the cliffs.  When they built the original Pali highway here, they found the bones of hundreds of Hawai\\'ian soldiers.  The Lookout gives you this incredible panorama of O\\'ahu\\'s Windward, east side.  You can see both the cities on the Windward side, Kaneohe and Kailua, from the pass.\n\nWhen you stand in the pass, on the old Pali Highway, the wind gets funneled between the cliffs and hits you so hard it\\'ll support you if you lean against it.  Then you walk another ten feet forward, and the wind dies, just dies, none left.\n\nThe old Pali Highway is my favorite thing about the Lookout.

How tight did I want my garment to be?  How much flesh should it cover, or show?  Do I want to be tasteful, or silly?  And how much, well, <i>wobbling</i> is okay, and how much would be scandalous.\n\nAnd is scandalous even a bad thing in this situation?\n\nI\\'d been invited to the party by a gentleman I met at the after-party for an art show he\\'d organized in my neighborhood.  He was also the organizer of the Underpants Dance, and several similar events in the past few months.  This one was at a house in northeast Portland, and at the Aussie\\'s behest we took a cab -- which proved to be a lengthy and frightening mistake.  Portland is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry\">bilaterally symmetrical</a>, cut down the middle by the Willamette river, with mirroring numbered streets running north-south on either side of it.  The party was on the east side, just like us, but the cabbie wanted to take the freeway, so he pulled onto a bride over the Willamette -- and discovered the exit closed.  And the next exit closed.  We crossed the river twice, as the cabbie got increasingly more frustrated, and started driving faster and faster.  The exits were closed due to an accident, and at one point it looked like we were about to T-bone a fire engine on its way there.\n\n0 later, we were at the party, and stripped down to our party attire.  (I\\'d settled on a pair of new Super-Man boxer shorts and my Green Lantern t-shirt.  Wearing the two, I told people I was the Justice League of America.)  The night featured a slew of DJs and bands (including <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/blitzentrapper\">Blitzen Trapper</a>, who I\\'d been wanting to see), a game of Twister, and a whole bunch of people in their underwear.\n\nReally, of the several hundred people there, maybe half were undressed for it.  The large quantity of fully-clothed people detracted from it for me.  Seriously, if you aren\\'t willing to meet the undress code, why are you going to an underwear party, unless it\\'s to check people out?\n\nThose of you who don\\'t know me may be experiencing a sensation of \"... You went to an <i>underwear</i> party?\"  I think people imagine this sort of thing to be more risque than it actually is.  The women there were wearing at least as much as you\\'d see them in at the beach, and many of them were wearing lingerie that was probably much less revealing than their swimsuits.  (There were more guys in skimpy clothes than you\\'d expect to see on an American beach, but that seemed mainly done out of humor.)  It was promoted as a safe-space party, where everyone was asked to respect each other\\'s boundaries, and if <i>anyone</i> asked you to leave, you were supposed to leave.  Lots of people would imagine the opposite, but I saw far less making-out, cuddling and displays of sexuality than I do at the usual party.\n\n(Though based on their demeanor and where their eyes were pointed, I\\'d swear two girls were deep in conversation about my crotch.)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxxbmg6jw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673427,45.577952]}},{"properties":{"name":"The rabid feral statues of Waikiki","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 2116 Kalakaua Ave, honolulu, HI<a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/TimBrandonFightingStatue.jpg\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/TimBrandonFightingStatue.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxwy25kk1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.830812,21.281785]}},{"properties":{"name":"The river downtown","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a>As you go through Chinatown towards the river it gets sketchier and sketchier, so I was really surprised to find that the riverfront itself is quite nice and scenic, with neat statues and some temples.\n\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/DSC00829.jpg?t=1165974451\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v484/lankythetangosmurf/Winter%202004/Hawaii/DSC00816.jpg?t=1165974626\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx0k8arr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.86988,21.32421]}},{"properties":{"name":"The subtle strangeness of UH Manoa","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a>[December 14, 2004] Walking around the University of Hawaii Manoa, I continue to have the feeling that I\\'ve wandered onto the set of a college movie.

I went to a concert this week where I wanted to dance, but nobody was dancing, and I was one of, like, three white guys in the club. I didn\\'t end up dancing, but even then, I was more afraid that they\\'d go \"Look at that guy! He isn\\'t local!\" than \"Look at that guy!

He never tried to find something to do (\"Television\\'s boring.\"), and he was too afraid of getting lost and being unable to find his way back to go sightseeing, even in the neighborhood. So he just stayed in the patio, looking terribly bored, for three days. The first night I had to ask him to stop following me around while I worked, because his questions were getting on my nerves (standing in the driveway: \"So... this is where people park their cars?\").\n\nImagine Ralph from The Simpsons fundamentally unchanged at 37, except that age has removed all the cuteness and endearingness from his naivety, slow-wittedness and lack of social skills.\n\nHe smells like he chronically sleeps in his clothes, after a hard night of smoking in bed. This is odd, because he doesn\\'t smoke.\n\nHe was hoping to move to Hawaii. However, he doesn\\'t like the heat, and even as cold as the nights have been getting here recently (sometimes I sleep with a hoodie on... mostly because I only have one blanket, and it\\'s very thin), they were still too hot for him to sleep comfortably. He likes beaches, but he can\\'t swim. He doesn\\'t really have a profession, but he used to work in a grocery store. He wanted to come to Hawaii because he used to see shows about the hotels here on the Travel Channel, and he thought that if he could get a job in one of those hotels, like as a busboy? Then his life would be good. He also came here because his Jr. High teacher was from Hawaii, and he was hoping he could find his teacher.\n\nYeah.\n\nAt 37, as far as he could tell, he has less life experience, less marketable skills, and less common sense than any teenager I could name. And he severely creeped everyone out. Until I found out his story, and told the rest of the staff. After that, he just depressed us all heavily.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx13tlgo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.82231,21.300017]}},{"properties":{"name":"You slept alone for a long time, underneath a pile of stone","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/140/326834870_af5e42c8f0_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/140/326834870_af5e42c8f0_m.jpg\"></a>[December 18, 2006] It was a cold, introspective day in a cold, introspective week, and I had some thinking to do about transience.  So when I finished my cleaning shift, I set off for the Portland Memorial Mausoleum in Sellwood.\n\nThe Mausoleum is on the edge of Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge, and the back of it looks out on a marshy lake I was not prepared to see inside Portland.  The Mausoleum itself spreads across two and a half city blocks and is eight stories tall.  Chuck Palahniuk\\'s book on Portland says it has 58,000 people interred in it, more people than my hometown of Fairbanks, Alaska (a town of 30,000 people).  His book also says it has space for 120,000 more -- around a fifth of the population of Portland.\n\nI only got to spend about 20 minutes in it before it closed for the evening.  It wasn\\'t what I was expecting -- the building was under construction for 70 years, and they only finished it in 1980, so it doesn\\'t have the \"old\" feel I associate with <i>proper</i> cemeteries.  The sections I saw (admittedly, few of them) seemed rather uniform, which makes me uncomfortable.  I want to see more than just someone\\'s name and the dates they existed between.  The Mausoleum reminded me a little of <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/post/871645\">Punchbowl Crater</a> in Honolulu, where the U.S. military dead of World War II are buried -- impressive because of its shear scope, but depressing because there\\'s no trace of who the people buried there <i>were</i>.\n\nThe building was startling cold inside.  \"Isn\\'t this place heated?\" I asked the security guard as he kicked me out.\n\n\"Used to be,\" he said behind me as I stepped into the elevator.  \"When it opened.  But now, it\\'d cost the National Debt.\"  The doors shut on his chuckling.  I stared at the elevator buttons, each marked with the name of the President that the floor is named after, and chose the ground floor button.  I found the door I\\'m come in locked, and my heart leapt at the possibility that I was stuck there for the night.  But no; the Exit arrows on the wall pointed me out.\n\nOutside the Mausoleum I selected <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=5383458\">June Madrona</a> on my iPod, and walked off through Sellwood listening to somber songs about dreams and the death of loved ones.\n\n<a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/143/326834828_4aa8c5bb24_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/143/326834828_4aa8c5bb24.jpg?v=0\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx0ehqpd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.65229,45.47475]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zombies Invade the Mall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/281848391_5b4532f5c3_o_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/281864884_5799028ed8_o_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/281864835_ebc0e90dc7_o_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/281864783_654fa4b021_o_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/281864744_db62b8c1d6_o_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/281864694_2f2d718e5a_o_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Portland\\'s second Zombie Walk of October 2006 started in Pioneer Square, and went through Pioneer Place mall, which was definitely the highlight of the lurch.  The other great part was attacking the MAX light rail when it went by, with cries of \"TRAAAAAAAAINS!\". Lots of pounding on windows and smearing blood on the side as we tried to get at the people inside, until the driver cut in over the loudspeaker. \"You\\'ll be dead for real if you keep hanging on the side like that.\"\n\nAfter leaving the mall, we passed a street musician playing some drums.  And a bunch of zombies paused for a dance party.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a8azxx364x11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.67737,45.51824]}},{"properties":{"name":"thirtyninehotel:  My favorite nightclub in Honolulu, or possibly anywhere","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 39 N Hotel Street, Honolulu, HIthirtyninehotel is a \"multimedia art gallery\" -- a gallery with art on the walls that\\'s open for the First Friday Gallery Walk, that doubles as a nightclub with DJed and live music.
