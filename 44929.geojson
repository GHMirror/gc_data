Sports need to grow bigger in size and impression as they are increasingly competing for the attention and money of the passive media consumer. Horse and rider sliding down banisters in front of the police station, or jumping parked cars would be a sure thing.\nFor the animal rights activist, a robotic horse could be developed.

You can read about this project on my web site.  It\\'s 30 laps around the block.  Look for the paper clips on the chain link fence.  These mark the number of laps.  Bring your own though!  After you do this, email me with pics, writing, scans, songs, or whatever you want to document your experience.

Show up at 11am. We mush at 11:30am sharp. You can pre-register by sending e-mail. The event is held on the same date the \"real\" race each year - the first Saturday of March.\n\nIn the Alaskan Iditarod, more than sixty dog sled teams race across the frozen tundra from Anchorage to Nome. In our urban version, teams of \"dogs\" lead by a musher will pull their sleds (shopping carts) through some of Portland\\'s most scenic areas. These teams of barking humans must negotiate through the unrelenting and unforgiving dangers of Portland\\'s urban frontier. As an incentive to run, dogs and mushers alike will have several \"rest stops\" to replenish lost fluids and discuss tales of mayhem. The course is over four miles, so dogs and mushers alike need to be ready and able to run their tails off.\n\nThe 5th annual Urban Iditarod will start at the Fire Station on S.E. Madison right next to the Willamette River and follow the same basic course as the 2005 event. The course map will be posted on the website as well as passed out at the race start once the \"rest stops\" are confirmed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6em5tds32e9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.665889,45.513001]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/1460","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jason","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jason","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/1460","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=1460,platial:user=jason","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44929}
