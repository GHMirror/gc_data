These included synthetic rubber, chlorine, aluminium, detergents, and pesticides. While the factories remained fully operational, 70-120,000 tons of harmful emissions were released into the air annually. With the emphasis placed on maximum, low-cost production at the expense of environmental and occupational health and safety, industry has left the city heavily contaminated. Factory workers and residents of the city have been exposed to a combination of high-level occupational and environmental pollution problems for several decades.\n\nUntreated sewage and mercury-contaminated sludge (from chlor-alkali industries) continue to be dumped haphazardly. A continuing lack of pollution controls, dated technologies and the improper disposal and treatment of accumulated industrial waste are just some of the issues that plague the city.\n\nHealth Impacts:\n\nSumgayit had one of the highest morbidity rates during the Soviet Era and the legacy of illness and death persist. A study jointly conducted by the UNDP, WHO, Azerbaijan Republic Ministry of Health and the University of Alberta demonstrated that residents of Sumgayit experience intensely high levels of both cancer morbidity and mortality. Cancer rates in Sumgayit are 22-51% higher than average incidence rates in the rest of Azerbaijan. Mortality rates from cancer are 8% higher. Evidence suggests that lower reported cancer rates are flawed as a result of underreporting.\n\nA high percentage of babies are born premature, stillborn, and with genetic defects like downs syndrome, anencephaly, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, bone disease, and mutations such as club feet, cleft palate, and additional digits. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99v5bb4n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[49.3011474609,40.5096228496]}},{"properties":{"name":"#10 KABWE, ZAMBIA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10j1T.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10j3x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10j2x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> KABWE, ZAMBIAPotentially Affected People: 255,000\n\nType of Pollutants: Lead, cadmium\n\n<a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/site10j.php\">read more about this location</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j9a05lq9m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[29.562201,-8.568496]}},{"properties":{"name":"#2 LINFEN, CHINA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/site10b1x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Rapid development and unequivocal faith in industry has led to the development of hundreds of unregulated coal mines, steel factories and refineries which have not only polluted indiscriminately but have also diverted agricultural water sources. Water is so tightly rationed that even the provincial capital receives water for only a few hours each day.\n\nHealth Impacts:\n\nThe high levels of pollution are taking a serious toll on the health of Linfen\\'s inhabitants. Local clinics are seeing growing cases of bronchitis, pneumonia, and lung cancer. The children of Shanxi Province also have high rates of lead poisoning. A growing number of local deaths in recent years have been linked to these overwhelming pollution levels.\n\nArsenicosis, a disease caused by drinking elevated concentrations of arsenic found in water is at epidemic levels in the area. Chronic exposure to this toxic chemical results in skin lesions, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, blackfoot disease, and high cancer incidence rates. A study of Shanxi\\'s well water published in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology found the rate of unsafe well water in the province to be at an alarming 52%. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99xnbxdi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[111.544189453,36.1290016557]}},{"properties":{"name":"#3 TIANYING, CHINA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> The Problem:\n\nTianying in Anhui province is one of the largest lead production bases in China, with an output accounting for half of the country\\'s total production. Low-level technologies, illegal operation and the lack of any serious pollution control measures in the firms have caused several severe lead poisoning cases in the region. It is also believed that there are numerous small scale recycling plants in the area, which are notorious for polluting. As a result of these indiscriminate practices, lead processing firms in Tianying have been pressured by local residents and officials to shut down their operations.\n\nThe average lead concentrations in air and soils were (respectively) 8.5 times and 10 times national health standards. Eighty-five per cent of air samples collected had lead concentrations higher than the national standards. Local crops and wheat at farmers\\' homes were also contaminated by lead dust, with some levels 24 times higher than national standards.\n\nHealth Impacts:\n\nResidents, particularly children, are reported to suffer from lead poisoning and its related effects: lead encephalopathy, lower IQs, short attention spans, learning disabilities, hyperactivity, impaired physical growth, hearing and visual problems, stomach aches, irritation of the colon, kidney malfunction, anaemia and brain damage. Pregnant women have reported numerous cases of premature births and smaller/underdeveloped infants. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99yo48ho"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.570678711,33.2708427727]}},{"properties":{"name":"#4 SUKINDA, INDIA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10d1T.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10d3x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> SUKINDA, INDIATwelve mines continue to operate without any environmental management plans and over 30 million tons of waste rock are spread over the surrounding areas and the Brahmani riverbanks. Untreated water is discharged by the mines into the river. This area is also flood-prone, resulting in further contamination of the waterways. Approximately 70% of the surface water and 60% of the drinking water contains hexavalent chromium at more than double national and international standards and levels of over 20 times the standard have been recorded. The Brahmani River is the only water source for the residents and treatment facilities are extremely limited. The State Pollution Control Board has conceded that the water quality at various locations suffers from very high levels of contamination. The air and soils are also heavily impacted. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99pgmtwu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[85.916321,20.96751]}},{"properties":{"name":"#5 VAPI, INDIA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10e3x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10e2x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10e4x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10e5x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10e1T.jpg\">VAPI, INDIA\tToxic waste containing heavy metals -- cyanide, pesticides and other carcinogens are haphazardly dumped throughout the environment. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99u874w3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[72.909093,20.375969]}},{"properties":{"name":"#6 LA OROYA, PERU","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10f8x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10f1x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10f2x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10f3x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10f6T.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10f9x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10f7x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> LA OROYA, PERUThe Problem:\n\nSince 1922, adults and children in La Oroya, Peru - a mining town in the Peruvian Andes and the site of a poly-metallic smelter - have been exposed to the toxic emissions and wastes from the plant. Peru\\'s Clean Air Act cites La Oroya in a list of Peruvian towns suffering from critical levels of air pollution, but action to clean up and curtail this pollution has been delayed for area\\'s 35,000 inhabitants. Currently owned by the Missouri-based Doe Run Corporation, the plant has been largely responsible for the dangerously high lead levels found in children\\'s blood. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99mymvgw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.934769,-11.52101]}},{"properties":{"name":"#7 DZERZINSK, RUSSIA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10g1T.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> DZERZINSK, RUSSIAType of Pollutants: Chemicals and toxic byproducts, including Sarin, VX gas, etc. Also lead, phenols.\n\nSource of Pollution: Cold War-era chemical weapons manufacturing <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99roecxx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[43.44527,56.235443]}},{"properties":{"name":"#8 NORILSK, RUSSIA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10h3x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10h2x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10h1T.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> NORILSK, RUSSIAType of Pollutants: Air pollution - particulates, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals (nickel, copper, cobalt, lead, selenium), phenols, hydrogen sulfide. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99ot1dpz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[88.220482,69.330422]}},{"properties":{"name":"#9 CHERNOBYL, UKRAINE","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10i5x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10i3x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10i2x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10i4x.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/2/site10i1T.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> CHERNOBYL, UKRAINE<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67j99l9u2rm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.240339,51.274609]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/54397","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jason","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jason","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/54397","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=54397,platial:user=jason","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48472}
