Accessible from downtown, the HarborWalk extends along Pleasure Bay, with a detour to Castle Island. Pleasure Bay is a calm, enclosed lagoon with a sandy beach for swimming. Pleasure Bay is one of the most popular swimming and sunning beaches in the City. Foot showers and water fountains are located on-site. Because the bay is fully enclosed by the man-made Head Island Causeway, water and sediment quality are consistently high. The causeway located behind the beach provides a great walk way for strolling around Pleasure Bay.\n\nOriginally freestanding, Castle Island has been connected to the mainland since the 1930s, when streetcars brought bathers to Pleasure Bay. Fort Independence, located on Castle Island, is a five pointed granite structure. The current structure is the eighth fort to occupy this site and contains over 172,687 linear feet of hammered stone and was constructed under the direction of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer between 1834 and 1851. The fort is open during the summer months, and visitors can explore independently or take a free tour. The fort and the island are on the State and National Registers of Historic Places, and Fort Independence is a National Historic Landmark. There are views to Logan Airport and the Harbor Islands, and visitors can observe boating activity in the Harbor. The area is excellent for jogging, walking, picnicking, biking and hiking, and there is a fishing pier and swimming area.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atf5nseo9a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.023521,42.335707]}},{"properties":{"name":"Red Rock Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/lynnshores.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Lynn<a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/lynn_sh.gif\">Lynn Shores Reservation facilities map</a>\n\nLook for tide pools and walk up the beach to the swimming area.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atf5f51jll"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.933914,42.459054]}},{"properties":{"name":"Revere Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/77645611@N00/95514828/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/95514828_7388455529_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/Revere_Beach_Poster.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Revere, MAThe prize for best-known urban beach goes to Revere Beach. Ask a Bostonian if there are any city beaches, and he or she will likely mention this one. While it might be regarded as the anti-Vineyard, Revere Beach is nonetheless loads of fun, convenient for most city dwellers, and a great place to people-watch.\n\nIt\\'s easy to find this beach. Just get on the Blue Line and follow all the people with their radios blasting merengue or hip-hop. It\\'s a youthful beach, popular with teenagers and 20-somethings, especially those who listen to WJMN-FM. This popularity comes in part because of the long sea wall where you can sit and scope for \\'\\'hotties.\\'\\' For Boston babe watch, this is the place to go.\n\nAt a venerable 102, Revere is the oldest public beach in America. Public concerts at the bandstand and easy T access make it one of the most popular beaches in the state. Lifeguards are on duty from late June to early September. Downsides are loud noise from incoming jets, and sometimes smelly water.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atf5u16o36"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.990434,42.406094]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sandy Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/33897928_8d308547de_s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Winchester, MA<a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/mystl.gif\">Park facilities map</a>.\nFor information about Sandy Beach call 781-729-9819.\nMystic Lakes\nSwimmingPicnicRowingSailing\nIn 1893, when the Metropolitan Park System was established, large estates lined the shores of the Mystic Lakes. In part through generous gifts of land, the eastern became part of the park system. The western shores were never acquired and were subdivided into smaller house lots. Today the Mystic Lakes are popular for freshwater swimming at Sandy Beach. Special sailing programs are available at the Tufts University Boathouse.
