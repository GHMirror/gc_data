The Clean Air Act includes a list of 187 of these pollutants. Air toxics are of potential concern because exposure to high levels of these pollutants over many decades could result in long-term health effects.\n\nEPA selected schools after evaluating a number of factors including results from an EPA computer modeling analysis, the mix of pollution sources near the schools, results from an analysis conducted for a recent newspaper series on air toxics at schools, and information from state and local air pollution agencies.  \n\nEPA and our partners at state and local air pollution control agencies will:\n\ncollect samples of outdoor air near selected schools over 60 days,\nanalyze those samples for air toxics of potential concern,\nreport on levels of air toxics found and their potential for long-term health impacts,\nevaluate actions that may be needed to reduce levels of pollutants of concern, and\ntake action as needed to ensure that nearby industries are in compliance with clean air regulations.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Abraham Lincoln Elementary School","description":"East Chicago, IN<img src=\"http://www.epa.gov/mxplorer/pixelshim.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"1\">Pollutants to be monitored: Metals in PM10, Metals in TSP, PAH, VOCs\r\nPollutants to be measured have been selected based on emission sources in the vicinity of each school.<b>4,4-Methylenedianiline</b>: A chemical compound used mainly for making polyurethane foams.<b>Carbonyls</b>: Also known as aldehydes (e.g., formaldehyde and acetaldehyde).<b>Cr+6</b>: Hexavalent chromium.<b>Diisocyanates</b>: Chemical compounds used in manufacturing foam-containing products;
