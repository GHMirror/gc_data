HISD spends $17 million a year on magnet programs.\n\n“This is just a springboard,” HISD Superintendent Terry Grier said Friday. “Trustees and staff have to look at where we are, be honest and analyze that what we are doing is best for all kids in the district. There will be some tweaks to this. These are all just recommendations.”\n\nMSA recommended eliminating magnet programs that do not meet its requirements for a magnet program, schools having limited building capacity and schools that are part of the district’s school turn-around program, Apollo 20.\n\nHISD trustees will ultimately have the final say on what changes, if any, happen with HISD’s magnet program.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"p: per-pupil spending on magnet students
