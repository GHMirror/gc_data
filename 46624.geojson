I wouldn\\'t suggest it. Got dropped off here from some friendly driver from Santa Cruz. Anytime I would step foot onto the highway some \"friendly\" highway policeman would march back off the road.

We were going to take a route through the middle of the country because, why not? It would be fun. One of my co-riders was anxious as soon as we got out of Portland...the car we were in was too sketchy, we weren\\'t far enough back, etc. So when we pulled into a siding in Hinkle he informed us that  rideable wasn\\'t more than 20 cars behind us. Off we went. 10 cars, 20 cars, 30 cars....\"Hey, where was this rideable again?\" \"Oh, I think its at the end of the line.\" (Liar) In the middle of the summer, in the middle of nowhere, with giant packs on the last thing you want to be doing is running like mad over train ballast for a rideable that might not actually exist before your train leaves you behind. Well, we got spotted by a train cop and were all cited tickets. We hitchiked to Pasco, Washington (also a poor place to hop trains, by the by...)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n32d1xw8gb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.31111,45.79667]}},{"properties":{"name":"I don't speak French, he didn't speak Spanish or English","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.flickr.com/jennpants\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/jennpants\">Jennpants</a>Lille, FranceI was hitchhiking from England to Spain.

We knew we had to get off soon -- it was broad daylight and there was *gasp* a cop shadowing the train. We threw our bags off the train and then ourselves. Laughing at the silly looks we received from all the commuters waiting for the next Metra we joined in waiting as well.  My companions started making coffee with a rocket stove and some jackass thought it was a bomb and called the cops on us. The cops came, ran our names, and then let us get on the arriving Metra.

Night fell, no real places to hide and sleep. While crossing a bridge a driver (drunk? asleep?) heading in the opposite direction swerved in the road and hit the bridge barrier cascading sparks over my head. Five feet (?) closer and it would have been me.\nI got a hotel room that night.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n32cyed8pd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.8950805664,35.2276723549]}},{"properties":{"name":"The truckdriver was on crack.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.flickr.com/jennpants\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/jennpants\">Jennpants</a>Ripon, CaliforniaHitchhiking to the bay area, I caught a ride with a fairly friendly driver out of Eugene, Oregon.
