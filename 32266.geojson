You turn off of 38th Ave onto Simms Ct, follow that all the way to the end and turn right and immediately park. The entrance will be on your left. A large sign stands next to the entrance. It\\'s a small path that leads down into the Greenbelt, where the path starts it runs between two houses on Simms St. This is a great night-time entrance if you\\'re quiet and quick. Take care to not make too much noise, we wouldn\\'t want the people who live here to complain to the city, now would we? The path takes you down a hill. When you get to the very bottom there will be a wooden walkway. Take the right fork (the left one has been closed for years) and follow it. You\\'ll end up following the path through some vegetation and you\\'ll come out across the trail from Prospect park.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p763p00088"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.129541755,39.7717864984]}},{"properties":{"name":"41st Ave entrance","description":"Posted by Jeffwa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This entrance is off of Kipling, you take 41st Ave west to get to it. This marker is right at the top of a small hill where the road forks. Stay to the right and you\\'ll descend from the top of the hill into a parking area. All that is at this entrance is the parking area, no rest rooms, no drinking fountain. Police come through the parking lot somewhat regularly at night so it\\'s sort of an ok night-time entrance if you\\'re walking. You do not have to go through the parking are to continue along the Greenbelt. At the back of the parking area you\\'ll see a couple of forks in the path. There used to be an area north of the parking area where lots of people would go 4-wheeling and get their trucks stuck.
