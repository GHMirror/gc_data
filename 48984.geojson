Constructed by the Western Union Cable Company in 1913, the Cable Station was restored by the Bay Roberts Heritage Society. It houses the \"Road to Yesterday Museum,\" the Christopher Pratt Art Gallery, the Bay Roberts Archives, and the Bay Roberts municipal offices, and the Bay Roberts Council Chambers. In front of the building is a concourse which marks the site of the cable landing.\n\nRestoration\n\nBecause it is a good example of an early 20th century commercial building with classical revival elements, the building was designated as a Registered Heritage Structure by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador in October 1998.\n\nHistory of the The Western Union Cable Station\n\nThe Western Union Cable Company brought the outside world to Bay Roberts in 1910. Eventually, ten trans-Atlantic cables were landed here -- among them the fastest in the world at that time -- and hundreds of employees, both local and world-wide, passed through the doors of the Bay Roberts station. The brick building was erected as a relay station on the connection from England to North and South America. During two world wars, it necessitated a company of army personnel to guard the property from possible enemy action.Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt had a private line on the link through Bay Roberts station.\n\nIn 1960, these telegraph cables because obsolete, and the station closed. In 1996 the Bay Roberts Heritage Society Inc. acquired the building and had it completely restored and renovated. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74r5xkekv3p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-53.2537794113,47.5966716636]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shearstown Estuary","description":"Posted by Klondy<img src=\"http://www.bayroberts.com/Cable%20Building/eagle23-10-sm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bayroberts.com/graphics/291.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bayroberts.com/Cable%20Building/1estuary2-m.jpg\">The Shearstown Estuary is a shallow body of water where freshwater from Shearstown River meets and mixes with saltwater from Spaniard\\'s Bay. The resulting mixture of water is termed \"brackish,\" or partially salty. Shearstown River, Shearstown Pond, Muddy Hole Pond, Arnie\\'s Pond and the shallow inner reaches of Spaniard\\'s Bay comprise the Shearstown Estuary. The salinity, or saltiness of the water, varies considerably throughout the estuary with time and location and is dependent on tides, winds and precipitation.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74r5xquh1sr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-53.2838630676,47.5977134846]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shoreline Heritage Walk","description":"Posted by Klondy<img src=\"http://www.bayroberts.com/Cable%20Building/hwt1-sm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bayroberts.com/Cable%20Building/4BREHWT21-M.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bayroberts.com/Cable%20Building/12madrock3-m2.jpg\">The Bay Roberts Shoreline Heritage Walk, which was developed by the Bay Roberts Heritage Society, offers a opportunity to pay honour to the past, while communing with nature away from the noise of today’s world.\n\nThe coastal walk wanders along sheer cliffs, sweeps of beach, sheltered coves, and craggy headlands. From cliffs, coves, beaches, and headlands see whales follow caplin, squid, and other fish into the bay, especially in June and July; observe seabirds and bald eagles, and examine different types of wild flowers.\n\nStand where French fishermen, as long ago as the1500s, cured their fish on flat beach rocks calling the area Baie de Robert. Walk through foundations of homes, restored rock walls, family gave yards, and refurbished root cellar on land where English fishermen and later their families lived and worked for almost 400 years.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74r5xx4jwvz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-53.2179880142,47.6162891421]}},{"properties":{"name":"Society of United Fishermen [SUF] Hall","description":"Posted by Klondy<img src=\"http://www.bayroberts.com/graphics/suf.jpg\">The Society of United Fishermen Dawe Lodge #82, was first established in Bay Roberts in 1873.
