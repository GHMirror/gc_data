This one is just  down from us and we love it.\n\nIt feels like a proper old school park.  Its got a bowling green, a duck pond, a brilliant library and some derelict old stable buildings.\n\nOne of the best bits is the Walled Garden.  It\\'s run by a small group of volunteers and is just a beautiful place to chill out.\n\nTha park is cared for by the city council and the friends of hillsborough park, there\\'s been a lot of work done recently;  a new, lit, jogging track, and improved playground (and big snake earth-sculpture) and the beautiful new Bowling Pavillion/Park office.\n\nIts used by the community a lot, we\\'ve just had a circus thete, in December it hosts a winter craft fair, and in the summer its home to the annual Mayfest.\n\nThis is a brilliant public space that jus seems to get get better and better.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fbde9fbc5y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.501393,53.40746]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\" href=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\">Askewben</a>Home in Sheffield, and home on the web\nspace to relax\nspace to unwind\nspace to be myself\nspace to welcome others\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fbdehagl0h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.50517,53.410785]}},{"properties":{"name":"Malta Island","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\" href=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\">Askewben</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/8605011@N02/737459652/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1385/737459652_85839ecf8a.jpg\"></a>katie i went in 2005 i went on the  beach<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fbdeawzoa9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.441528,35.88905]}},{"properties":{"name":"Malta Island","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\" href=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\">Askewben</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fbdeejdcyv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.441528,35.88905]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ponderosa","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\" href=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\">Askewben</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Ponderosa, SheffieldNice little bit of Park behind tesco in Upperthorpe.\nKairos will be meeting here after Summer Services every sunday for a picnic.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fbdec5to0w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.485429,53.387309]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sammamish","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\" href=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\">Askewben</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 22818 Se 8th St, Sammamish, WASpent a great week here at the beginning of January this year, and hoping to move there soon.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fbdegesxnt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.035069,47.601926]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sheffield","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\" href=\"www.benaskew.blogspot.com\">Askewben</a>SheffieldCurrent home - The Greenest and the best City in the North of England.
