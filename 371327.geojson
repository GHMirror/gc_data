The CPI ranks the following in terms of their physical contribution to lake-level change-related coastal change: geomorphology, regional coastal slope, rate of relative lake-level change, historical shoreline change rates, mean annual ice cover and mean significant wave height. The rankings for each input variable were combined and an index value calculated for 1-minute grid cells covering the park. The CPI highlights those regions where the physical effects of lake-level rise might be the greatest. This approach combines the coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, yielding a quantitative, although relative, measure of the park's natural succeptibility to the effects of lake-level change. The CPI and the data contained within this dataset provide an objective technique for evaluation and long-term planning by scientists and park managers.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"ice":{"max":30.0,"variance":0.0,"mean":30.0,"stdev":0.0,"median":30.0,"min":30.0},"rwave":{"max":4.0,"variance":0.0,"mean":4.0,"stdev":0.0,"median":4.0,"min":4.0},"slope":{"max":0.363603,"variance":0.0027893040227344,"mean":0.281473411764706,"stdev":0.0528138620319931,"median":0.300016,"min":0.12937},"rslope":{"max":5.0,"variance":0.0,"mean":5.0,"stdev":0.0,"median":5.0,"min":5.0},"rllr":{"max":3.0,"variance":0.0,"mean":3.0,"stdev":0.0,"median":3.0,"min":3.0},"rchan":{"max":4.0,"variance":0.71301247771836,"mean":2.88235294117647,"stdev":0.844400661841498,"median":3.0,"min":2.0},"Id":{"max":33,"variance":99.1666666666667,"mean":16.5,"stdev":9.9582461641931,"median":17,"min":0},"CPI":{"max":28.2842712475,"variance":23.6343893429315,"mean":21.7066438404059,"stdev":4.86152129923664,"median":21.9089023002,"min":12.6491106407},"geo":{"max":5.0,"variance":1.33689839572192,"mean":4.23529411764706,"stdev":1.1562432251572,"median":5.0,"min":2.0},"rice":{"max":4,"variance":0.0,"mean":4.0,"stdev":0.0,"median":4,"min":4},"wave":{"max":0.89552,"variance":0.00021760189090909,"mean":0.877070000000001,"stdev":0.0147513352246192,"median":0.86529,"min":0.86529},"chan":{"max":4.88,"variance":2.3190243315508,"mean":1.41382352941176,"stdev":1.52283430863335,"median":1.3,"min":-0.49},"rllc":{"max":4.0,"variance":0.0,"mean":4.0,"stdev":0.0,"median":4.0,"min":4.0}},"features":[{"properties":{"slope":0.185712,"rwave":4.0,"ice":30.0,"rslope":5.0,"Landform":"High
