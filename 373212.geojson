Department of Agricultural Resources. The Department provides technical assistance to individuals and groups trying to start a farmers' market, helps farmers find appropriate farmers' markets to participate in, and encourages consumers to patronize farmers' markets through various publications, etc., including the MassGrown Map, which also pulls data from the Farmers’ Markets database.As well as basic information about the markets, this data layer includes information about participation in the food assistance programs Women, Infants and Children Cash Value Vouchers (WIC-CVV), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program (FMNP).The vast majority of farmers’ markets accept some combination of EBT-SNAP, WIC-CVV, or Farmers Market Coupon Program coupons, and are thus included in the Department’s database. The Department also sends out an annual survey to all known market managers.The database is updated continually, particularly in the spring, and the MassGIS layer is updated monthly March through August as needed, and once in December. At the time of each release, there are still likely to be some markets that are created without DAR's knowledge. Additionally, markets may discontinue, and attribute values will change. It may take some time for DAR to hear about these changes. Occasionally a market’s location is unknown and cannot be included. The market will usually be included in the next update.There are three mobile farmers markets, based in Somerville, Springfield, and Worcester. Only one location is included for each of these three markets.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"YEAR_START":{"max":2013,"mean":2003.72401433692,"variance":136.862406848715,"stdev":11.6988207460716,"min":1934,"median":2009},"MARKET_ID":{"max":485.0,"mean":218.75593220339,"variance":23000.2055344171,"stdev":151.658186506424,"min":1.0,"median":196.0}},"features":[{"properties":{"NAME":"Holyoke/Open Square","YEAR_START":2011,"MARKET_ID":378.0,"EBT":"EBT-SNAP Accepted","COUPONS":"WIC &amp;
