The detections are obtained using both TERRA MODIS and AQUA MODIS data are collected and processed as a cooperative effort between the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Application Center, NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland. These fire detection data are collected for the USDA Forest Service MODIS Active Fire Mapping Program (http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us). These data are intended to provide a synoptic view of active fires for the past and present over the specified time period. These data are collected at a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer and therefore are only intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and regional levels. No responsibility is assumed by the USDA Forest Service in the use of these data.\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"PERIMETER":{"max":0.0,"mean":0.0,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":0.0,"median":0.0},"TPIX":{"max":2.0,"mean":1.20397368249625,"variance":0.0668389319457772,"stdev":0.258532264806111,"min":1.0,"median":1.1},"SPIX":{"max":4.8,"mean":1.59751156276464,"variance":0.654898041804343,"stdev":0.809257710376826,"min":1.0,"median":1.3},"FIRE_":{"max":15351.0,"mean":7676.0,"variance":19639046.0,"stdev":4431.59632638172,"min":1.0,"median":7676.0},"JULIAN":{"max":182,"mean":177.382841508697,"variance":4.8028039383314,"stdev":2.19153004504419,"min":175,"median":177},"GMT":{"max":2335,"mean":1449.61096996938,"variance":393707.487603437,"stdev":627.461144297746,"min":214,"median":1800},"FIRE_ID":{"max":312194.0,"mean":114315.816624324,"variance":16125985039.6006,"stdev":126988.129522411,"min":15.0,"median":15602.0},"AREA":{"max":0.0,"mean":0.0,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":0.0,"median":0.0},"LAT":{"max":67.47,"mean":40.0955769005279,"variance":76.3995085016928,"stdev":8.74068123784942,"min":18.024,"median":39.822},"TEMP":{"max":500.0,"mean":330.922063709205,"variance":601.983877330412,"stdev":24.5353597350928,"min":305.0,"median":324.2},"LONG":{"max":-58.747,"mean":-112.201951599244,"variance":217.893774901694,"stdev":14.761225386183,"min":-155.064,"median":-120.821}},"features":[],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/fireptdata/modisfire_2008_last7.htm","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Application Center, NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland.","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/fireptdata/modisfire_2008_last7.htm","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"america,detection,fire,forest,modis,north","published":"2008-06-30T12:00:00Z","id":2302}
