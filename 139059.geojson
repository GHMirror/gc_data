The basemap includes bathymetry, marine water body names, undersea feature names, and derived depth values in meters. Land features include administrative boundaries, cities, inland waters, roads, overlaid on land cover and shaded relief imagery.\r\n\r\nThe map was compiled from a variety of best available sources from several data providers, including General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans GEBCO_08 Grid version 20091120 and IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names August 2010 version (http://www.gebco.net), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Geographic, AND, and Esri. The basemap was designed and developed by Esri.\r\n\r\nThe basemap currently provides coverage for the world down to a scale of ~1:1m. U.S. waters have higher resolution bathymetry starting at 1:1m scale; bathymetric data was derived from NOAA survey point data. This demonstrates how the ocean basemap can and will be extended with higher resolution bathymetric data. \r\n\r\nA ready-to-use web map that uses this service as its basemap can be found here.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6348e67824504fc9a62976434bf0d8d5","metadata":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6348e67824504fc9a62976434bf0d8d5","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"ESRI ArcGIS.com","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6348e67824504fc9a62976434bf0d8d5","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"marine,ocean","published":"2011-06-16T16:00:00Z","id":139059}
