Gilbreath constructed the chapel around an old oak tree after the completion of Jamestown Village in 1962. Gilbreath had razed a magnificent Victorian home for the center, and wanted to save the oak tree in the parking lot. The chapel is a miniature version of a Tennessee church that his grandmother used to visit. The companion tree died years ago, so nowadays, the church stands alone. One day\\'s rental costs just 00, but you have to clean and decorate the chapel yourself. \n\nIf interested, call Gerda Brucks of Gerda\\'s Antiques: (714) 832-4932.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qhcjta4m5f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.82433,33.740808]}},{"properties":{"name":"One small step","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/83/242776760_78cc304cca_s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_photo_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qhcjzcpblm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.127621,34.136138]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rad Tiny Treehouse","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/174311754_1d0843d962.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 20th &amp; Sanchez, SF, CAlooks like a 1 seater, in a wonderfully overgrown yard.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qhcjpbkbas"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.430399,37.758107]}},{"properties":{"name":"Smallest House in Somerville","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/17/89730986_c742fcb417.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> It\\'s a tiny blue shed, but somebody lives in it.

Due to road construction, Mill Ends Park (24 inches across and located at the intersection of downtown Portland\\'s Southwest Taylor Street and Naito Parkway) will be moved 80 feet from its current location. The park will reside in the plaza area of Portland\\'s World Trade Center complex for approximately six months.\n\nAccording to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation officials, a move was necessary to protect the tiny green space from the threat posed by the much larger construction equipment. (What Portlanders won\\'t do to protect the environment.)\n\nWhen the Naito Parkway roadway improvements are completed in six or seven months, the park will be moved back to a new location on Naito Parkway, 7.5 feet east of its current home. The big - or little - move takes place on Tuesday, Feb. 7. Some sort of \"mobile platform,\" perhaps an all-terrain vehicle, will be used to move the park in its entirety. Mill Ends Park, which was dedicated as an official city park in 1976, is one of 200 parks managed by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Note: At this time, the city has no plans to move Portland\\'s 5,000-acre Forest Park. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qhck26x3f1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673286,45.516136]}},{"properties":{"name":"the world's smallest studio apartment","description":"Posted by Sweetleon125 Jersey St., 941142004, minus the time I spent in Baltimore (Feb-Apr) and Korea (Sep-Dec)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qhck1s0c0s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.427955,37.750902]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/8258","metadata":null,"contact_name":"baostar","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:baostar","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/8258","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=8258,platial:user=baostar","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":45621}
