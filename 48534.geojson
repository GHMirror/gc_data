It is the oldest masonry and only extant 17th century fort in North America. It is a great example of the \"bastion system\" of fortification. The construction by the Spanish, the Castillo began on October 2, 1672, and was mostly complete by 1695. The fort was built of coquina, a type of shellstone native to the area and quarried from Anastasia Island.\r\nEven though the fort has served many nations, it has never been taken by military force. In the 1870s and 1880s, the fort housed Indians detained by the U.S. Government.The Castillo was made a National Monument in 1924 and became part of the National Park system in 1933.  \r\n \r\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mrrwfb3qkg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.31431,29.89202]}},{"properties":{"name":"Great Barrier Reef","description":"Posted by Melissa23<img src=\"http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2006/09/22/great_barrier200.jpg\"><img src=\"http://liveandletdive.googlepages.com/dreamstimeweb_7417461_reef.JPG/dreamstimeweb_7417461_reef-full.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/24577309_d996e50113.jpg\">Queensland, AustraliaThe Great Barrier Reef extends over 2300km along the Queensland coast. At 344,400km, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is the world\\'s largest World Heritage Area. The Reef was declared World Heritage on 26th October 1981. The Park is bigger than New Zealand,and is roughly equal in size to Japan. The Great Barrier Reef is the only living organic thing visible on Earth seen from Earth\\'s orbit. The Great Barrier Reef is also one of Australia\\'s premier tourist destinations, with marine tourism annually contributing about  billion to the Australian economy. \r\nThe Reef has more than 1,500 species of fish, 4,000 types of mollusc and more than 200 species of bird life. 600 continental islands and 350 coral cays are spread throughout the reef. There are approximately 3400 individual reefs that make up the Barrier Reef. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mrrwme1t7c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.774002,-19.7061]}},{"properties":{"name":"Great Wall of China","description":"Posted by Melissa23<img src=\"http://z.about.com/d/architecture/1/7/H/l/greatwall01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.educ.uvic.ca/faculty/mroth/438/CHINA/great-wall.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.travel-centre.co.uk/site-media/images/sections/great_wall_1.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www.picschina.com/images/Great%20Wall%20pics001.jpg\">ChinaThe Great Wall was originally built in the Spring and Autumn as a defensive fortification by the three states: Yan, Zhao and Qin. The Great Wall began in many independent walls when it was first built. It did not become the \"Great\" wall until the Qin Dynasty. Emperor Qin succeeded in his effort to have the walls joined together to fend off the invasions from the Huns. The construction began in the 7th century B.C. when China was still divided into small states; and the joining of the walls began around 220 B.C.\r\nThe length of the latest constructionby the Ming dynasty is over 6,ooo kilomters. Including all the walls built in different dynasties around China, the total length will exceed 50,000 kilometers. There are actually many walls built from the different states in China. The Great Wall was usually built with local materials, mostly earth and stones.The labor force was made up of three groups: soldiers, common people, and criminals. The Ming Wall is the most solid and can still be seen as a wall. While other walls are now ruins. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mrrweteieg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hadrian","description":"Posted by Melissa23<img src=\"http://whatdoiknow.typepad.com/photos/hadrians_wall/dscn0339.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/classics/Hadrian%5C's_wall_at_Greenhead_Lough.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.northumbria-byways.com/nb%20region%20pics/hadrians_wall_region.jpg\">EnglandHadrian\\'s Wall was a stone barrier built to separate the Romans and the Picts tribes in Scotland. The Romans began building the wall in 122 A.D. There were 16 forts in total along the length of the Wall. It was 117 kilometers (73 miles) long across the narrow neck of England, from the North Sea to the Irish Sea. \r\nThe wall was eight to ten feet wide and fifteen feet high. It took about 14 years to complete Hadrian\\'s Wall. It was the largest structure ever made by the Romans. Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the wall to be built. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mrrwe44ke6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.458077,52.444486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Leaning Tower of Pisa","description":"Posted by Melissa23<img src=\"http://goeurope.about.com/library/graphics/gal/pisa_tower1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.summerabroad.utoronto.ca/gallery/england/ShaunChen2.JPG\">Pisa, ItalyThe Tower of Pisa is the bell tower of the Cathedral. The construction of this tower was started in the year 1174 by Bonanno Pisano. When the tower had reached its third story the work stopped because it had started sinking into the ground. The leam was 141/2 feet out of line when measured from the seventh story. \r\nThe Tower was designed to be \"vertical\", and started to incline during its construction. The tower was built on unsuitable ground for such a heavy and tall building. It is only about 6 feet above sea level and built on a riverbed. Because of its inclination, and its beauty, from 1173 up to now the Tower has been a very special tourist spot. \r\n  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mrrwb044kv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[10.396602,43.716135]}},{"properties":{"name":"Liberty Bell","description":"Posted by Melissa23<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/liberty_bell2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thedctraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/liberty-bell-1.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/liberty_bell1_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/liberty_bell.jpg\">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    As the official bell of the Pennsylvania State House, it rang many times for public announcements.
