This was the one and only guy I called to Multi Locksmith Vallejo - Emergency Lockout Service, mostly because he\\'s located nearby, and I hoped he would get there fast.  He told me to give him a ring at (707) 637-8095 about 1/2 hour before I got home, which I did.  He told me he would arrive in 25 minutes, and I told him I\\'d be at the bar down the block so to call my cell first.  When he arrived the entire ordeal lasted only about 10 minutes, all the while we discussed some spiritual stuff. He asked me if I wanted him to do a lock re-key, but since my lost keys were inside, I told him it wasn’t necessary. Once inside he made me show him proof that I lived there, and he charged me 0 (which he quoted me on the phone).  I accidentally gave him a 00, and he saw that, and handed  me 0 back.  So the guy\\'s honest too.  I\\'ll call him if I\\'m in a bind again, although the next morning I made a ton of extra sets of keys.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62z4hrx9eo8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.254539,38.165289]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/715664","metadata":null,"contact_name":"hayleighjerome","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:hayleighjerome","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/715664","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=715664,platial:user=hayleighjerome","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44957}
