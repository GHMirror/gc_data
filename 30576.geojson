I grew up North Vernon, a little town in southeastern Indiana.  I’ve spent my whole life there, swimming and running track and doing chores every morning.  Chopping wood, for example.  We have 20 acres of land, and lots of trees, and a beautiful pond, and we make apple cider every autumn.  And now I’m a freshman at Valparaiso University.  My dad sends me a copy of the North Vernon Plain Dealer and Sun every Sunday, so I can keep up with home.  I usually know everyone mentioned in the paper.  \r\n\r\nA couple months into this school year, I met Harry.  He was born in the States, but moved with his family to Singapore at age two.  He speaks Mandarin, and eats expertly with chopsticks, and as of last October, had never seen snow.  Or the stars, either, for that matter.  Singapore is always so humid and polluted that you never see the night sky.  So we wandered around campus on clear nights and I showed him the constellations while we waited to see shooting stars.  \r\n\r\nAnd for Spring Break 2007, he took me to see Singapore.  Except for some pretty intense jet lag, it was the most amazing trip of my life.    \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwjmkpr0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.87848,1.38826]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chinatown","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/chinatown.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/food_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/chinatown_2.jpg\">Yesterday (the 5th) Harry and I went to Chinatown. Isn\\'t that funny? Chinatown in Asia. ha. There was an earthquake. We couldn’t feel it because we were on the MRT (train), but Harry’s mom said she felt it in their apartment and Harry’s dad had to evacuate his building. Anyway, Chinatown was fabulous. I have some pretty sweet pictures and we\\'re going back there sometime soon. I got a really amazing skirt. It has a coconut thing on it. hard to explain but you\\'d love it. And I had gelato. Have you ever had it? I had, but it was still amazing. mm. Food here is incredible. I can\\'t figure out why I’m still feeling skinnier here than at home though. Maybe it\\'s all the sweating. I’m going to go have some tea with Harry’s parents now. It’s only 6:15 am here.

We ate at a Mexican place called Cafe Iguana and it was happy hour. Psh.  We shared a pitcher of margarita. Yum! Probably my favorite alcoholic beverage so far.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwr7lvtz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.84689,1.28881]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harry's Dad's Office","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/raffles_place.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/fishballs.jpg\">On the 4th, I visited Harry’s dad’s office. It’s in Raffles Place, which is the high class business district. Every major bank in the world has a station there. It\\'s pretty much the center for commerce in Asia. Plus, there are lots of lawyers and stuff like Harry\\'s dad. So we went to the office and the Chinese secretary there kept touching my hair and saying how pretty I was. Then she showed us videos on her computer of her golden retriever named Nicole. She asked me if I had dogs and I told her I had a Chihuahua and a Labrador. Then later, she asked me how old my la-brudder was and I thought she was talking about my brother. So I said 20 and it was all confused. Harry\\'s dad took us on a walking tour of Raffles and we got to see the river and some old historical type stuff including the oldest bridge in the city. Then, he took the rest of the afternoon off and drove us home. \r\n\r\nOn the 8th, we returned to Raffles Place for lunch. Harry’s Dad’s three Chinese secretaries went and got us a sampling of local dishes so I could see how I liked the Singapore cuisine. It was all pretty good except for the fish balls. Fish balls are these gelatinous/crunchy (that\\'s the only way to describe it) white balls in a clear broth. Pretty much one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever put in my mouth. They told me you have to grow up eating them to like them. Harry does. Sick. One of his secretaries, whom we fondly called Auntie Foong Toh, asked me all about my cultural heritage and we all agreed that I am about as American as it gets. On my mom\\'s side, I have an ancestor who came over on the Mayflower, and on my dad\\'s side, a revolutionary war veteran. And some Cherokee sprinkled in. Also, she asked me if I played with Barbies as a girl and then proceeded to tell me that I looked just like one.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwq5rzhn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.85908,1.29516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harry's House","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/harry%5C's_house.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/tiger_beer.jpg\">After the zoo, we came back to the house, worn out and dehydrated. So, of course, Harry and I decided to go out again! We just ran some errands at the grocery down the street. But here\\'s the funny part: I got a couple of pictures printed at the photo part, and the clerk kept staring at Harry funny. She started speaking to the other clerk in Hokkien really fast, but the only word we heard was \\'Spiderman\\'. When I went to pay, she said to Harry, \"You look like, movie star.  Is it you?\" He just smiled and said no.  But man did we get a kick out of that.  I told him he should start signing autographs.  \r\n\r\nWe came back home and his mom made an amazing dinner of bean burgers, rice, green beans, and sweet potatoes. I was so full!! The bean burgers were served up on this amazing foccacia bread that we bought at the bakery that morning and topped with almonaise and roasted red peppers that his mom made that afternoon. Oh my goodness! Fantastic. \r\n\r\nAfter that, Harry and I went down to the pool and drank like four beers and ate these things called peanut crackers. They were the perfect compliment. We relaxed by the most amazing swimming pool. It has a freakin waterfall!!  His pool is so beautiful at night. Perfect lighting of the palm trees and waterfall. He basically lives in paradise. No wonder he misses it so much.  \r\n\r\nI worked on my tan by the pool for about an hour this morning (it doesn\\'t take much equatorial sun to excite the melanin).\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwp02pdp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.78149,1.31773]}},{"properties":{"name":"Holland Village","description":"Posted by Ellen8788On Friday evening, Harry and I went to dinner with his parents at a restaurant in Holland Village. It’s really close to his house. It’s like a bohemian part of the city where they close off the roads at night and let people walk in the streets. We ate at a Mexican restaurant called Cha Cha Cha\\'s.  Harry and his dad have eaten there every Saturday for the past ten years or something. It was really good.  I had a chicken burrito that was amazing (plus Harry’s dad ordered two pitchers of the most amazing sangria…).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwfr1wpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.78904,1.31215]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little India","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/little_india.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/hindu_temple.jpg\">On the morning of the 8th, Harry’s mom and I went and had foot reflexology done. In case you aren\\'t familiar, it’s the Chinese art of stimulating the blood vessels in different parts of the foot in order to relieve stress in corresponding parts of the body.  For example, the inside of your big toe corresponds with the brain. It was pretty neat. But really really painful!! Man. But afterwards I felt really really good. They did my neck and shoulders too. Just like a massage but they used their elbows!! Yikes. Oh yeah, and the lady who did Harry’s mom looked exactly like Jackie Chan.  After that was over, Harry met us and we went to a sushi bar.  It was amazing. You sit around the perimeter of the restaurant and there\\'s a conveyor belt with all kinds of plates with different types of sushi.  Soo fun.  I ate some fried tofu. Eh. It was ok. Then Harry and I went to little India. It was really…interesting. \r\n\r\nWhen we got off the subway, we accidentally went out the wrong side and had to walk through the wet market. It was soooo disgusting!! We had to walk through the meat section and it was enough to turn anyone into a vegetarian. Yuck. Little India was pretty dirty. It smelled awful. Took awhile to get used to. Everywhere we went, all you could see were booths of gold. Gold gold gold. I guess it\\'s part of Hinduism.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwpxce24"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.84998,1.30786]}},{"properties":{"name":"Singapore Botanic Gardens","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/botanic_gardens_2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/botanic_gardens.jpg\">In the morning on the 9th, Harry’s mom and I went to the Singapore Botanic Gardens and did an exercise walk that was about 4 miles long. Then we went into the orchid gardens. They were absolutely amazing. I took a picture of the most beautiful flower I’ve ever seen—a hanging orchid. It was luscious pink and spidery. So intricate. Being inside the gardens, you forget you\\'re even in the city. The greenery is so thick that you can\\'t see any of the buildings throughout most of the park. It’s incredible. That reminds me, one of the best parts of being here is being able to wake up in the morning to the sound of chirping birds. It makes me want summer really badly. Kinda jealous that they have that all year round here. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwk1rlru"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.81565,1.31412]}},{"properties":{"name":"Singapore Zoo","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/n40804691_30574984_7034.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/white_tiger_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/elephants.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/spider_monkey.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/bamboo.jpg\">We made it to the zoo yesterday (the 11th).  It was fantastic!!! I had no idea there could be zoos where half of the monkeys were free-range and you could get so close! Harry and I had our picture taken with orangutans.  They are the Singapore Zoo\\'s pride and joy.  They boast the world\\'s largest exhibit of these primates.  My other favorite creature from the zoo was the white tiger. They had THREE of them! The tigers were so beautiful and majestic. I was really surprised at how huge they were. And...get this: their eyes are blue! Oh man, they were so beautiful.  There were elephants, too—Asian elephants, of course, who ate or drank from this suspended metal cylinder.  They looked pretty funny, reaching their trunks up as far as they could go, and their mouths hanging open.  And there were zebras, and giraffes, and a pregnant spider monkey eating a melon, and some really big bamboo.  (The monkey wasn’t eating that).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwhltrsb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.79093,1.3838]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Main Drag","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/kopi.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/plaza_singapura.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/kelsey_sushi.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/satay.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/food.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/icecream_sandwiches.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/mos_burger.jpg\">Harry and I went downtown to one of the huge ass malls they have. I got to ride on my first city bus! We rode on the top floor (there were two stories) and in the front. Every time we came to a stop in a line of traffic, it looked like the bus had gobbled up the tiny Asian car in front of it because of my angle. \r\n\r\nWe went to the mall and just walked around for awhile then ate lunch at a food court there. We had Malaysian food. We each had a plate with rice in the middle and then two meats and a vegetable. It was crazy how they served it on regular china instead of paper plates like at food courts in America. The food was all kinda spicy except the lemon chicken. I tried a piece of Harry\\'s squid. It wasn\\'t fried or breaded, just these rings of chewiness in a spicy orange-reddish sauce. Not bad, but I wouldn\\'t order it. Then we took another bus to meet Harry\\'s mom for tea with two of her friends. Then we took another bus (man I am gettin good at flashin my very own bus pass in front of the little beepy thingie) to Harry\\'s dad\\'s office. \r\n\r\nOn another day, I shopped around this huge Japanese-owned department store called takashimaya. I had a Japanese pancake that is like oval-shaped with melted chocolate in the middle. Oh my gosh. Heaven. In my mouth. \r\n\r\nWe went back again later with Harry’s mom. Had some delicious japanese rice and skewers of meat. And to drink, we had kopi, which is coffee mixed with sweetened condensed milk instead of cream and sugar. Definitely amazing. They serve the Styrofoam cups in these little carrier things that look like the handles of plastic grocery bags. I took pictures. Gettin pretty good with the chop sticks too. Then we went and saw the movie 300. All the movies come out on Thursdays here. We had assigned seats. And I got carded!! I guess the little Asian lady didn\\'t think I looked 18. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday we had lunch at this place called Mos Burger which serves Japanese food in fast food form. We had chicken teriyaki burgers topped with sautéed onions and instead of a bun, it was on patties of white rice. You wouldn\\'t believe how good they were. Then we walked down the main drag (Orchard Road) and went to the Gap. Sounds lame, but they just got Gap in Singapore last month so it\\'s a big deal here. We got shirts that say Gap Singapore. Pretty neat. And we finally bought a famed ice cream sandwich from a street vendor. It was exactly how Harry described it: a rectangle of ice cream chopped off of a block and served in a piece of \"rainbow\" bread. I put it in quotes because it just looks rainbow. It actually tastes like regular white bread. It was the strangest thing, but didn\\'t taste as bad as I thought it would. \r\n\r\nYesterday we ate at the food court at Takashimaya again. I had the most amazing brownie. Oh man. They had a stall with JUST brownies. I, of course, chose the triple chocolate fudge variety. Soooo amazing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwmxpqs4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.82166,1.30434]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Shangri La","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/shangri_la.jpg\">I\\'m used to people thinking Harry strongly resembles Spiderman, but this time in the Shangri La beats them all. On the 10th, we went out for dinner with Harry\\'s parents. Oh my gosh! The Shangri La started here in Singapore, so you can imagine how nice it was. Holy crap. It was the fanciest place I had ever seen. geez. We ate at The Line, which is a really ritzy buffet. They had about twelve different buffets actually. And there was a world-renowned chef at each one. They had Chinese, Indian, pasta, salad, and sushi, not to mention a dessert bar complete with chocolate fountain and Coldstone ice cream. I was in chocolate heaven!! Ok so here\\'s the funniest part of the evening: when we got there, Harry’s dad ordered a bottle of champagne. The waiter was gone for a few minutes and then came back with the wrong bottle. So they brought us a whole new complimentary bottle of champagne! Yeah. Two minutes later (literally) they brought the right bottle, which by the way, was a million times better. Then they kept bringing us plates of food with like appetizers (like Peking duck wraps) that weren\\'t on the regular buffet. We thought they just felt bad about the mistake. THEN, when we got the check they gave us vouchers for \"shang dollars\" to use at the hotel or any of its amenities. But here\\'s the kicker... when we got up to leave, the assistant manager came up to Harry’s dad and gave him his card and told him that the next time we come to call him ahead of time for \\'special\\' service. Well! We had no idea what this meant. So when we got in the car to leave we started trying to figure out WHY they did all that for us. We decided that it couldn\\'t have been because of the champagne incident, because it wasn\\'t really an incident at all. It occurred to us that what must have happened is that the wait-staff thought Harry was Tobey McGuire. Seriously. Because famous people always stay at the Shang when they come to Singapore. He\\'ll probably end up in the local papers here in the next week or so. Once, while Harry was at the table by himself, THREE different waiters came over to the table to fold our napkins. ha! and then one time, one of our like nine waiters walked away from the table and then talked into like this earphone-mouthpiece thing he was wearing. i mean it was like high security or something. Well, in any case, the food was amazing. And we were treated like royalty. Some evening. (Oh yeah, and I had like 5 glasses of really really expensive champagne.) Tee hee. I could really get used to living like this.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gqkwkcmjza"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.86028,1.29284]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20089","metadata":null,"contact_name":"ellen8788","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:ellen8788","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20089","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20089,platial:user=ellen8788","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":30576}
