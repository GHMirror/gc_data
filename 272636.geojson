Only key information is represented to provide geographic context, allowing your data to come to the foreground. \r\n\r\nOpen this web map and choose the &quot;Add&quot; button at the top to add your thematic content, or drag and drop your GIS-ready data to the map.\r\n\r\nThis web map uses the World Light Gray Base map service as its basemap. This web map also contains the World Light Gray Reference map service to provide labels for selected cities and towns.\r\n\r\nThis light gray web map supports any strong colors and labels for your theme, creating a visually compelling map graphic which helps your reader see the patterns intended. \r\n\r\nSee these blog posts for more information on how to use this map: Esri Canvas Maps Part I: Author Beautiful Web Maps With Our New Artisan Basemap Sandwich and Esri Canvas Maps Part II: Using the Light Gray Canvas Map effectively.\r\n\r\nThe map shows political boundaries, populated places, water, roads, urban areas, parks and building footprints. This map was compiled by Esri using NAVTEQ data for North America, DeLorme basemap layers, and Esri basemap data. The basemap includes boundaries, city labels and outlines, and major roads worldwide from 1:591M scale to 1:72k scale. More detailed nationwide coverage is included in Europe, Southern Africa, South America, and Australia to be fully consistent with the World Street Map and World Topo map down to the 1:9k scale.\r\n\r\nSee ESRI TOS http://links.esri.com/e800-summary","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-14T17:53:45-04:00","id":272636}
