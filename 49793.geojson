This SCHOOL MASTER HAS DONE IT ALL. He has won Training level horse trials, he is suitable for lower level eventing, and dressage with potiential for more, is a nice enough mover for the show hunter ring,&amp; has fox hunting experience. Walk In The Park\\'s USEA # is 20,000 (even). Whip\\'s Further accomplishments with his junior rider include; Pony Club competitions through C-2, experience &amp; ribbons at dressage schooling shows, numerous Novice Level Horse Trials Placings (ALWAYS in the ribbons in the recognized events)through 2nd with scores as low as 29.5 and Pony Club National Champion in Tetrathlon. Whip is a great horse to just go have fun on and let the rider work on there own riding skills instead of the horse\\'s skills! Priced VERY fair for so much experience. Please see web for more pics www.fineequin2002.com\n\nWhip is not high strung at shows at all. He also fox hunts very well. His Usef# is 20000 if you want to see his scores. He has done very well showing dressage from what I know. He is a working 2nd level. He wears shoes all the way around. He goes in a waterford bit. He is not on any supplements at this time. He jumps 3\\'3 to 3\\'6 very comfortable. He is not prone to lameness issues. Whip is very well educated and will not tolerate any one hanging all over his mouth. That is about the worse vise he has. So soft hands are important. He knows his job inside and out. His owner is selling him because he belonged to her daughter who is off to college. She is the one who has done the great stuff with him as a junior. You are also welcome to talk with Debrah as well about any of his history( his owner). Just let me know when you want to come over and try him to see if it is a good match. We are around all next week.
