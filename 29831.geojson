That was sadly my first &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; experience of a war, which has been going on for too long. She talked to me about the random late night phone calls from across the globe and all I could think about was the constant daily fear of missing someone so endangered.\nFor most of us this war has had to be pushed to the backs of our minds. Feeling apathetic or just plain incapable of making any changes in the current state of things is a common sentiment among Americans these days.\nBut there are many people that don't have the option of turning off the TV or just leaving the room when the conversation gets heavy. Husbands and wives, children and parents of soldiers suffer daily not knowing where their loved ones are.

It was started by one person—-me, Martin Kelley—-in my home office in 1995. Almost eight years later, it’s won accolades and attention from the mainstream media but has remained largely invisible to progressive foundations and much of the old peace movement.\n\nThe past eight years have seen countless “New Media” projects burst on the scene only to wither away. Yet Nonviolence.org continues without any funding, attracting a larger audience every year. As the years have gone by and I’ve found the strength to continue it, I’ve realized more and more that this is a ministry. As a member of the Religious Society of Friends I’m committed to spreading the good news that war is unnecessary. In my personal life this is a matter of faith in the “power that takes away occassion for all war.” In my work with Nonviolence.org I also draw on all the practical and pragmatic reasons why war is wrong. \n(For more details please go to original url above)\n    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6396otvc8ot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.202445,39.959732]}},{"properties":{"name":"A hooded Turkish man holds a picture of an Iraqi detainee","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Istanbul, TurkeyA hooded Turkish man holds a picture of an Iraqi detainee with a sign that reads \"Look at the liberator\" during a demonstration in Istanbul, Turkey, Wednesday May 5, 2004.

Freedom of the press, and freedom of religion supported by the strict separation of church and state.\n    * Your right to equal protection under the law - equal treatment regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.\n    * Your right to due process - fair treatment by the government whenever the loss of your liberty or property is at stake.\n    * Your right to privacy - freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into your personal and private affairs.\n\nWe work also to extend rights to segments of our population that have traditionally been denied their rights, including Native Americans and other people of color; lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgendered people; women; mental-health patients; prisoners; people with disabilities; and the poor.\n\nIf the rights of society\\'s most vulnerable members are denied, everybody\\'s rights are imperiled.\n\nThe ACLU was founded by Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Albert DeSilver and others in 1920. We are nonprofit and nonpartisan and have grown from a roomful of civil liberties activists to an organization of more than 500,000 members and supporters. We handle nearly 6,000 court cases annually from our offices in almost every state.\n\nThe ACLU has maintained the position that civil liberties must be respected, even in times of national emergency.

The\ntruth is that the Bush Administration has used the McCain anti-torture bill to codify a policy of torture that is\nnow embedded in our legal system for perpetuity.\n\nProfessor Alfred McCoy is the author of a new book, \"A Question of Torture\", in which he gives a history of US\ntorture from the CIA\\'s development of torture techniques through the latest generation of systematic torture in\nthe Bush Administration\\'s \"war on terror\".\n\nMcCoy explains how the Bush Administration has purposefully crafted a strategy of torture. They have claimed\nexecutive powers and have had laws re-interpreted by Administration lawyers to give the government the power to\ncontinue the practice. Loopholes slipped into the McCain bill now ensure an enduring policy of torture.\n\nDemocracy Now interviewed Professor McCoy several weeks ago. We\\'ve taken about 9 minutes of clips frmo the 23\nminute interview and provided them here. The entire interview and transcript are available from Democracy Now.\n\nDue to the focus on detainees\\' human rights at Guantánamo, the U.S. is quietly expanding a detention center at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. In the past few years, the population has increased by 5 times. While there\nhas been significant legal action over Gitmo, little has been done for the detainees at Bagram.\nMany say the conditions at Bagram are far worse than even during the height of the Abu Ghraib abuse.\nAdded on April 29, 2006, 09:27 PM by halfandhalf \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6396p031iaa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.002529,40.718511]}},{"properties":{"name":"Candlelight vigil for Americans killed in Iraq War","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/candlelight_vigil_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Richmond, VirginiaChristopher Martin\n53 sec - Oct 26, 2005\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5259377977906571965&amp;q=iraq+war&amp;pl=true\n\n\n              \nThis video is silent.

March 19, 2006: The Constitution is the supreme law because every other law in all fifty states is linked directly to its seven articles and twenty-seven amendments. Whether you think the Constitution is a dead letter or not, no federal official or branch of government has ever declared a veto of the Constitution in a court of law.\n\n Law is objective, it is fact. In constitutional law it is absolute, you can either do something or you cannot. You have a procedure, it is followed.\n\n A federal lawsuit Walker v. Members of Congress (05-35023 U.S. Ninth Circuit Court) is newsworthy because it is concerned with Article V and the amendatory process. The Constitution requires that 34 states must apply before a convention can be called. Just as there “shall be” three branches of government, Congress “shall call a convention for proposing amendments” once the state applications are received. This is the direct language of the law all elected officials and members of our U.S. Military swear an oath to uphold, and the evidence before the court is that 567 state applications from all fifty states have been received by Congress.\n\n When Supreme Court decisions state emphatically that it is not the place of either the court or legislature to alter the amendatory process, and when the case before them concerns the issue directly, then the U.S. must follow the law as written. Congress by its actions is claiming a veto power over a clause of the Constitution. Article V makes clear the clause was “peremptory,” done without debate, and that Congress shall have no option in the matter. In short, the Founders anticipated the political question doctrine almost 250 years ago and dealt with it directly. Thus a convention call is ministerial in duty, not discretionary.\n\n Going back to 1969, 1986, 1993, and 1999, when talk of a convention circulated, the traditional fear has been that such a convention might tamper with the Constitution. Besides what Congress is currently doing to the Constitution, it must be noted that such a fear is invalid since any proposed amendment needs 38 states to agree to it, which means any idea that is even slightly questionable has no chance of being ratified. Only those with broad and overwhelming support will be ratified.\n\n The one and only thing which will come out of America’s first Article V Convention is a roster of ideas, and Walker frames the situation, not that it is time to a hold a national convention, but that it is a constitutional requirement. The refusal of Congress to issue the call when a sufficient number of applying states exists is illegal and unconstitutional. Congress cannot veto the calling of a convention.\n\nMembers of Congress, the President, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General will tell you how important the Constitution is just about every chance they get--and they are right. The Founders knew then what we know now, that governments can become corrupt. That is why the legal mechanism of the convention call was placed in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nPlease send a letter to your congressional representatives and ask them about Walker.\n\nPlease go to the above url to see more about how you can help affect the change you want to see in our country.\n\nAlso for more information please email:  admin1@cc2.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6396ouyny3z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036667,38.895]}},{"properties":{"name":"David Gergen: Bush's New Iraq PR Campaign Will Fail by happyfaceman","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/2_6_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> United States As the third anniversary of the Iraq War nears, President Bush and other administration officials will begin delivering speeches today designed to bolster public opinion of the Iraq war.

It is structured around a national office in Saint Louis, MO and comprised of members across the country organized in chapters or as at-large members. There is an annual convention in August for members from across the nation. Members receive periodic VFP publications.\n\nThe organization includes men and women veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, other conflicts and peacetime veterans. Our collective experience tells us wars are easy to start and hard to stop and that those hurt are often the innocent. Thus, other means of problem solving are necessary.\n\nVeterans For Peace is an official Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) represented at the UN.\n\nWhether or not you wish to participate in chapter activities, please consider becoming a Veteran For Peace member. As an organization, we are what our members make us. You can be part of that effort. Help us put an end to war.\n   \nWe draw on our personal experiences and perspectives gained as veterans to raise public awareness of the true costs and consequences of militarism and war - and to seek peaceful, effective alternatives.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6396p1jiou3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.339927,38.64733]}},{"properties":{"name":"Voices In The Wilderness","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/k08_380.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/28969497@N00/135569872/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/48/135569872_0c5814c9a2_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/60095017@N00/134222759/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/45/134222759_f940d7ba68_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/88893304@N00/7605801/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/8/7605801_ddffda2195_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> 1460 W. Carmen Ave Chicago, IL 60640Purpose of VitW: Voices in the Wilderness (VitW) was formed in 1996 to nonviolently challenge the economic warfare being waged by the US against the people of Iraq. Voices continues its work today, acting to end the US occupation of Iraq.\n\nWhat We Can Do:\n\nEducate &amp; Learn the story:\n\nGet informed about the history of the U.S. conflict with Iraq. Visit the Voices in the Wilderness website and the Electronic Iraq website to brush up on the myths and realities of 13 years of sanctions and war. For a helpful digest, read “Sanctions and War: Myths and Realities.”\n\nUnderstanding Corporate Media:\n\nCorporate media, or the Fourth Estate are no longer run as public trusts with a responsibility to society. They are now consumer products that are marketed and manufactured. Understanding the corporate media and knowing which independent and trustworthy alternatives are available is essential in truth telling and bringing justice during this most recent war and the failures of the on-going occupation. Reverse the corporate media spin IN EVERY CREATIVE WAY YOU CAN. Stay updated with website news services such as www.antiwar.com, news.independent.co.uk/world/, www.commondreams.org, and the “world news” section of the Guardian Unlimited Then use mediums such as art, street theatre, flyers, and alternative literature to effectively communicate the “rest of the story” to the public.\n\nEducate yourself wisely:\n\nIf you are a student, sign up for courses in Peace Studies, Arabic Studies, and International Relations. Consider getting a major or minor in one of these subjects. Or, attend lectures about these topics. The movement for a humane and just U.S. foreign policy towards Iraq and the Middle East will benefit from people with this sort of knowledge.\n\nResearch divestment:\n\nFind out which military contractors or corporations (e.g. Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Pentagon, and Department of Defense) have a vested interest in your school through grants and/or research. Consider starting a divestment campaign like students from Penn and Colombia have done: check out www.columbiadivest.org, www.geocities.com/penndivest/, and divest-from-israel-campaign.org.\n\nTeach others:\n\nHold a teach-in at a local educational, community or religious center. Contact Voices in the Wilderness at 773-784-8065 for speakers and educational materials such as literature, videos, and enlarged photos taken in Iraq. On the iraqpeaceteam.org website, click on “multimedia” and then “activism.”\n\nQuestion:\n\nAttend the public speeches of political candidates or any public figure who has supported or has remained silent about the crimes of sanctions and war. Ask questions. Be respectful, but DO NOT back down. Come with a group of friends who will help distribute literature, hold banners, etc. Send out a press release before and after the event.\n\nPressure:\n\nAfter you’ve called, emailed, faxed, and visited your Senators, Representative and the White House (for contact info see capwiz.com and the WH at 202.456.1111) to say NO! to continued U.S. military aggression, step it up a notch. Sit-ins, die-ins, and singing in a congressional office make an impression. Make connections with domestic concerns, such as heightened domestic insecurity if our government keeps exporting war around the world. Additional points to bring up are the number of civilian and military casualties, the high cost of war compared to the lack of funding of social welfare programs, and the loss of civil liberties.\n\nAct:\n\nWith most actions it is well worth it to contact the media. For an excellent media manual, see the Ruckus Society websites media manual.\n\nProtest:\n\nIf there is a defense company in your area, hold regular vigils at the site, distributing info, and making music to attract attention. Since March 2003, there have been countless creative nonviolent actions at Boeing Headquarters in Chicago. For example, a group of 15 people recently drummed and leafleted outside Boeing for 6 hours one afternoon and reached hundreds of people. Other possible sites include Congressional offices, federal buildings, military recruitment centers, and gas stations. VitW can send you sample leaflets as well as banner and slogan ideas. Email info@vitw.org.\n\nResist war taxes:\n\nAt present, close to 50% of every federal tax dollar goes to military spending for present and past wars. Consult with a war tax resister, such as those within the Voices network, or contact the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee, (800) 269-7464; nwtrcc@lightlink.com; War Resisters League (800) 975-9688; email wrl@igc.org.\n\nGive blood:\n\nOrganize a blood drive in your area and donate blood locally. Do this in memory of Iraqi children who have suffered and died in Iraq from sanctions and war. You could invite each donor to share a few words about the reasons she or he is giving blood. Look up blood banks in your local yellow pages. Usually you’ll need a minimum number of definite participants and a location. Work to get local community leaders, religious figures and other well-respected individuals to attend. And as always, invite the media.\n\nMonitor:\n\nHelp monitor military access and involvement in our schools. For more information, check out the American Friends Service Committee’s Youth and Militarism website.\n\nSponsor:\n\nDonate towards the stipend of an activist who is combating economic and military injustice. Help sponsor an organization working to end economic and military warfare through a donation of time, energy, or resources.\nWrite:\n\nSend a letter to the editor of your local paper or an article to a news magazine. If they are not published, call and ask for a non-discriminatory policy. Keep writing. If your paper presents only a pro-war perspective, consider requesting a meeting with the editorial board to pressure for better media coverage.\n\nAvoid oil consumption:\n\nExplore and use alternative transportation and energy. Love your bike!\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6396p4559ci"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.667058,41.974524]}},{"properties":{"name":"mikecheck Iraq Verse---by mikecheckmikecheck","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/2_19_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Iraq\n\nyoutube user: mikecheckmikecheck\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8z_DoGfAe8\n\nMy favorite of all the videos I have seen so far.
