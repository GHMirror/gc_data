You can read about this project on my web site.  It\\'s 30 laps around the block.  Look for the paper clips on the chain link fence.  These mark the number of laps.  Bring your own though!  After you do this, email me with pics, writing, scans, songs, or whatever you want to document your experience.  I predict you will have a meditative journey, and you will be surprised by what happens.

Such is the urban pooch experience.  Normandale Park is great because it\\'s pretty big, has lots of trees, and isn\\'t a former toxic waste dump like the fenced dog areas at Delta Park and Gabriel Park.  I have also met a few very nice humans in my time at Normandale who are courteous and responsible with their pets, as well as being good conversationalists.\n\nPortland still has yet to have a really great dog park like the one in Ashland or the Dr. Jose Rizal Park in Seattle.  But for the time being, this one does quite well.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68f0gbh7fon"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.605285,45.531]}},{"properties":{"name":"a pretty great dog park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\" href=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\">Tooldiva</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/c378870772a3d3120a79c7e060782d35.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> If you\\'re stuck in Ashland with your dog, this is a great place to pass the time.  If it\\'s summer, you\\'re in luck - there\\'s a wading pool just for your dog!  Otherwise, it\\'s pretty cool - a picnic table under a tree, tennis balls with rackets for hitting them in the huge 2 acre grassy field.  What more could a dog ask for, really?  (Well, maybe the Dr. Jose Rizal Dog Park in Seattle, but that\\'s a different story.)  \n\nI don\\'t know if I got the exact location pinpointed on the Platial map, so you\\'d be wise to consult another source before trying to find it on your own.  It\\'s behind some greenhouses, as I recall.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68f0g265ezv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.711985,42.210656]}},{"properties":{"name":"a really cool dog park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\" href=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\">Tooldiva</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/81acc14a3dfe9ce0156ca9c733f12457.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is a fantastic dog park.  It\\'s good for the dogs because they can run way way out of the range of their owners and have less of a chance of being called back because the owner knows that they are fenced in and secure.  But it\\'s great for the owners because it\\'s got a spectacular view of Seattle, as well as having a 9.5 acre area to walk on the trails that run throughout.  \n\nA word of warning:  I followed the directions on the city\\'s website to this park, and there was a \"right\" turn when it should have been a \"left\" turn early in the directions.  Somehow we were able to figure this out, and I don\\'t know if they\\'ve corrected it in the past 2 years, but be warned!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68f0g6mcmdh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.318237,47.593488]}},{"properties":{"name":"art 4 dogs","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\" href=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\">Tooldiva</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/63d36d4a05937e173f42da9ee8ac176a.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> I might not have the exact location pinpointed on the map, but this is a piece of public art commissioned by a private group a few years ago.  It\\'s by the artist William Wegman, better known for his portraits of Weimeraners in human clothing.  \n\nIt\\'s not prominent, but if you look, you will find it.  There\\'s a patch of black and white granite tiles (with a little turf mixed in) meant to evoke a linoleum tile kitchen floor.  Inside this area is a dog bowl that was originally intended to be perpetually refilled with water, like a little fountain.  (It was inspired by the Benson Bubblers.)  I haven\\'t been by in a while, but I remember that there was some controversy for a while about the city paying the water bill so it was shut off.  \n\nI\\'m sure someone on Platial will be able to comment on the current status of the water.

Anyone know?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68f0gb8h4d9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.678994,45.524736]}},{"properties":{"name":"more everyday sunshine","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\" href=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\">Tooldiva</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/b2d8c7293ff8b5d3766ebc6f08832efb.jpg\">This is as good a place as any to start discovering one of Portland\\'s most conceptual public art projects.  Along the entire length of the streetcar line, there are fourteen motion-sensored spotlights that are triggered by pedestrians walking along the sidewalk.  You must be on the same side of the street and walking in the same direction as the streetcar runs.  The spotlights are attached to utility poles.  The light won\\'t come on immediately - sometimes it takes several minutes for it to fade on and slowly fade off.  The spotlights illuminate things you might not normally think too much about, like a simple architectural feature, a park bench, or a patch of dirt.  \n\nWhen I first heard Harrell Fletcher describe his concept for the project, it went something like this: \"When I was a boy, my father and I would go on walks and he would point at things that he thought were interesting.  Later in my life, I studied photography, and I thought of that as a form of pointing, or saying \"I find this interesting.\"  The spotlights are intended to illuminate things that I found interesting along the streetcar line.\"  \n\nThis public art piece makes a really fun evening walk for the curious.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68f0ga6q79i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675,45.523611]}},{"properties":{"name":"the place where I first kissed a boy and also where I first kissed a girl","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\" href=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\">Tooldiva</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Klimt_kiss.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/b90e327ee78a056ebd2eb320344b8ab8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> I think it\\'s now called \"Agate Hall\" but when I was in 5th grade, it was still a school.  It was Condon School.  I was in an \"arranged\" relationship which was announced to me in a phone call by a classmate who basically explained to me that I was now with her old boyfriend Kevin, so she could go out with Todd.  I guess I said okay.\n\nA few weeks or so later, I was told by my friend that Kevin was going to kiss me after school.  A bunch of other students were hanging around - I guess they\\'d heard the news too.  Finally everyone left except me and Kevin.  We were at the bottom of one of the stairwells of the building.  He leaned over to kiss me and I turned my head, thinking he would kiss my cheek.  This made him kiss the air because he was aiming for my mouth.  We were both embarassed.  He hit the mark the next time.\n\nFifteen years later, I was on my first date with a woman in the same building, which was now turned into a performance space.  I brought her to the same place and bravely told her the story I just shared with you.  \n\nThe rest is history.\n\nBut I\\'ll tell you, the second first kiss in that spot was MUCH better than the first first one.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68f0g1t2c3s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.069266,44.042116]}},{"properties":{"name":"the wave organ","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\" href=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\">Tooldiva</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/652d2e5952cff23a68988290dc8a6a96.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> San FranciscoThe wave organ was built as a project for the exploratorium in San Francisco.  It\\'s an amphitheater on the shore of the San Francisco bay.  The seats are made from recycled city cement from demolished curbs or graveyard stones.  The sound is provided by the bay - tubes extend from underwater to the amphitheater.  If you sit very quietly, a sloshing symphony will fill your ears.  I hear the best time to experience it is early in the morning.\n\nTo find the wave organ, follow the shoreline north of the exploratorium.  You will come to a marina, and you walk out on a little piece of land - it looks like you\\'re just going to a yacht club, (it\\'s near Yacht Road, in fact)  but you will have to trust and when you see a yellow diamond sign that says \"not a through street\" you are getting close.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68f0gbztugo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.442627,37.805444]}},{"properties":{"name":"tiny noises","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\" href=\"http://www.hilarypfeifer.com\">Tooldiva</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/68b0990d3e503c1e8c65b380ac566e51.jpg\">This is one of many Benson Bubblers in Portland.
