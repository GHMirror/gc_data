More than 50 maars, tuff rings, small lava shields, and scoria cones have formed in the past 140,000 years in an elliptical volcanic field 29 km long in its largest (N-S) direction.  The Auckland volcanic field has dominantly produced intraplate alkali basaltic to basantic rocks forming the northernmost of a group of Quaternary volcanic fields of the Auckland Intraplate Province.  Of the 19 eruptions known to have occurred within the past 20,000 years, only one eruptive center is known to have been active during the Holocene (Smith and Allen, 1993).  The Rangitoto eruption, about 600 years ago, was the largest of the Auckland volcanic field and created the 6-km-wide Rangitoto Island, which consists of multiple scoria cones up to 260-m high that cap a low shield volcano with a broad apron of lava flows.<a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/info/about/about_ge.cfm\">About Volcano Data</a><i><a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0401-02=&amp;volpage=photos&amp;photo=088006\">Larger photo with caption and credit.</a></i><a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0401-02=\">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.geonet.org.nz/\">New Zealand GeoNet Project</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.gns.cri.nz/what/earthact/volcanoes/index.html\">Institute of Geological &amp; Nuclear Sciences</a>\n","id":"a62p8k7brpu6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[174.87,-36.9]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brothers","description":"<a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/\"><img src=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/ge/gvplogo.png\" width=\"227\" height=\"43\"></a><b>Brothers</b><b>New Zealand</b><img src=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/ge/photos/118069.jpg\"><b>Volcano types:</b>\n    Submarine volcano    Caldera    Lava dome\n\n\n<b>Summit Elev:</b> -1350 m<b>Latitude:</b> 34.875°S<b>Longitude:</b> 179.075°E\n\nThe submarine Brothers volcano, located NE of the Healy submarine volcano, contains an oval-shaped summit caldera 3-3.5 km wide.

The pre-caldera Macauley volcano consisted of two generations of shield volcanoes separated by a period of growth of a pyroclastic cone.  Eruption of the voluminous Sandy Bay Tuff about 6300 years ago truncated the NW side of the Annexation shield volcano and formed a 12-km-wide, 1.1-km deep caldera during one of the largest eruptions identified in the SW Pacific.   Following formation of the caldera and substantial marine erosion, a partly submarine and partly subaerial eruption centered about 2 km north of present-day Macauley Island produced basaltic scoriae and lava flows.  A reported possible eruption from \"Brimstone Island,\" 45 km west of Macauley at a location with a depth of about 2000 m and SW of Giggenbach submarine volcano, is likely a location error and could refer to an eruption from the submarine flank of Macauley caldera (Lloyd et al., 1996).<a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/info/about/about_ge.cfm\">About Volcano Data</a><i><a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0402-021&amp;volpage=photos&amp;photo=116093\">Larger photo with caption and credit.</a></i><a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0402-021\">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.geonet.org.nz/\">New Zealand GeoNet Project</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.gns.cri.nz/what/earthact/volcanoes/index.html\">Institute of Geological &amp; Nuclear Sciences</a>\n","id":"a62p8k4lzvjd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-178.47,-30.2]}},{"properties":{"name":"Maroa","description":"<a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/\"><img src=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/ge/gvplogo.png\" width=\"227\" height=\"43\"></a><b>Maroa</b><b>New Zealand</b><img src=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/ge/photos/091079.jpg\"><b>Volcano types:</b>\n    Calderas    Lava domes\n\n\n<b>Summit Elev:</b> 1156 m<b>Latitude:</b> 38.42°S<b>Longitude:</b> 176.08°E\n\nThe 16 x 25 km Maroa caldera formed sometime after 230 thousand years ago (ka) in the NE corner of the 30 x 40 km Whakamaru caldera, which is the largest of the Taupo volcanic zone.

This was the largest known eruption at Taupo, producing about 1170 cu km of tephra.  This eruption was preceded during the late Pleistocene by the eruption of a large number of rhyolitic lava domes north of Lake Taupo.  Large explosive eruptions have occurred frequently during the Holocene from many vents within Lake Taupo and near its margins.  The most recent major eruption took place about 1800 years BP from at least three vents along a NE-SW-trending fissure centered on the Horomotangi Reefs.

A chain of explosion craters up to 100 m deep cut the flank of one of the scoria cones, and thick deposits of ash and scoria blanket the caldera floor nearby.  The lack of organic sediments between volcaniclastic deposits exposed in one portion of the caldera wall suggest it was constructed within the past 200 years.

The most extensive activity during the Pleistocene took place along a 20-km segment along the central axis of the island.  Following a lengthy period of erosion, the latest lava flows, at least three of which were estimated to be as young as a few hundred to a few thousand years old, were erupted from vents near the crest of the island at its center and western side (Stearns, 1944).  One of the youngest flows reached the north-central coast along a roughly 1.5-km-wide front east of Vailele Bay, and another traveled down the Lefaga River channel and reached the SW coast at Lefaga Bay.  Apolima Island off the western tip of Upolu is a Holocene tuff cone too young to be fringed by a coral reef, and other reef-free areas along the coastline may be formed by Holocene lava flows.<a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/info/about/about_ge.cfm\">About Volcano Data</a><i><a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0404-03-&amp;volpage=photos&amp;photo=119016\">Larger photo with caption and credit.</a></i><a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0404-03-\">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a>\n\n\n","id":"a62p8kd59bqd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-171.72,-13.935]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vailulu'u","description":"<a href=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/\"><img src=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/ge/gvplogo.png\" width=\"227\" height=\"43\"></a><b>Vailulu'u</b><b>American Samoa (SW Pacific)</b><img src=\"http://www.volcano.si.edu/ge/photos/117004.jpg\"><b>Volcano types:</b>\n    Submarine volcano    Caldera\n\n\n<b>Summit Elev:</b> -592 m<b>Latitude:</b> 14.215°S<b>Longitude:</b> 169.058°W\n\nA massive volcanic seamount, not discovered until 1975, rises 4200 m from the sea floor to a depth of 590 m about one-third of the way between Ta'u and Rose islands at the eastern end of the American Samoas.

Two principal rift zones extend east and west from the summit, parallel to the trend of the Samoan hotspot, and a third less prominent rift extends SE of the summit.   The rift zones and escarpments produced by mass wasting phenomena give the seamount a star-shaped pattern.  On July 10, 1973, explosions from Vailulu'u were recorded by SOFAR (hydrophone records of underwater acoustic signals).  An earthquake swarm in 1995 may have been related to an eruption from the seamount.

Intermittent moderate phreatomagmatic and strombolian eruptions have occurred at White Island throughout the short historical period beginning in 1826, but its activity also forms a prominent part of Maori legends.  Formation of many new vents during the 19th and 20th centuries has produced rapid changes in crater floor topography.
