So much like me, in fact, that we could start a girl-gang.  That\\'s what Beauty Sleep is essentially all about...  a private themed residence where you can feel pretty and safe.\nTHE PLACE:\nFormerly a huge house split up into 4 separate apartments. In the heart of Belmont/Hawthorne district and walking distance to everything. I\\'ve converted the main floor into common space that everyone can enjoy. So you get the best of both worlds - privacy, minimal sharing of bathrooms/kitchens, and lots of super-fun common space.  A room for your every whim, every inclination.  Why not sing, dance, hula-hoop and glue things to other things!  \nTHE ROOMS:\nEvery bedroom (and there are 4 for rent weekly, monthly,... whatever you desire) has a princess bed of one sort or another.  You deserve the canopy bed!  One is royal purple, another precious pink, the other ruby red, and then there\\'s sophisticated seafoam.  Your room is trimmed in gold with lots of big-eyed pictures and mirrors for you to look at and kiss.\n***COMMON SPACE***\nLadie\\'s Lounge, office/craft room, dancefloor with pro effects lights, tiki bar, music room/stage, theater with DLP projector. Space to sip wine and fold origami or knit and talk about boys.  A place to hang out while trying on vintage shoes or reading 1950\\'s Family Circle magazines.  Do anything your little golden heart desires.  Rates vary depending on length of your stay, the room, and other options.
