The park protects a fine example of the threatened and still declining riparian oak woodland, which once flourished throughout California\\'s Central Valley. Caswell is home to several endangered animal species, including the riparian brush rabbit which is not known to occur anywhere else.\r\rThe Native Americans who lived along this river and collected acorns among these ancient groves were Yokuts. In the early 1800s, Spanish explorers traversed this area, and fur trappers found the river bountiful.\r\rThomas Caswell, landowner, enjoyed this wonderful forest and felt it should be preserved. In 1950 the children and grand children donated 134 acres to the people of California. Additional donations and state purchases brought Caswell to its current size of 258 acres.

The ceilings within the caves get very low and some parts will need to be crawled through.\n\nThe hiking here is great, but bring sun protection.\n\nThis site is also home to carved petroglyphs and painted pictographs left by native peoples. The majority of these are located at what is now called Petroglyph Point. (I\\'m quite sad because I didn\\'t know about the rock art when I was visiting here and I didn\\'t see it... Guess I\\'ll have to go back now!)\n\nThe native Modoc people used their knowledge of these caves to help them fight off the US army during the Modoc War of 1872-1873. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635q7hu1wiu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.511535645,41.7508241355]}},{"properties":{"name":"McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park","description":"Posted by Carpfish<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/04/3/Mom_cam_pics_0932.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> While the hiking here is great (the park is on the Pacific Crest Trail), the main reason to visit this park is Burney Falls.

I have yet to try camping in this area, but I\\'m guessing that it would be a far superior experience to lodging in the nearby town of Fall River Mills. The only place to shop for food was a tiny convenience store, and the only restaurant in town was a nightmare. If you\\'re intent on staying at a motel, the town of Burney might be a better bet- it at least has a Safeway.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635q7dvb90c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.65058136,41.0148791653]}},{"properties":{"name":"Montana de Oro State Park","description":"Posted by Carpfish<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/0/SLO_010.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> From the California State Parks website:\n\"This park features rugged cliffs, secluded sandy beaches, coastal plains, streams, canyons, and hills, including 1,347-foot Valencia Peak.

The park contains 368 square miles (950 km2) including all of Mount Rainier, a 14,410-foot (4,392 m) stratovolcano.[2] The mountain rises abruptly from the surrounding land with elevations in the park ranging from 1,600 feet (490 m) to over 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The highest point in the Cascade Range, around it are valleys, waterfalls, subalpine wildflower meadows, old growth forest and more than 26 glaciers. The volcano is often shrouded in clouds that dump enormous amounts of rain and snow on the peak every year and hide it from the crowds that head to the park on weekends.\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier_National_Park<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635q7j5ejkm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.712036133,46.8564347635]}},{"properties":{"name":"Olympic National Park","description":"Posted by Carpfish<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> From wikipedia:\n\"Olympic National Park is located in the U.S. state of Washington, in the Olympic Peninsula.

In 1976, Olympic National Park became an International Biosphere Reserve, and in 1981 it was designated a World Heritage Site.
