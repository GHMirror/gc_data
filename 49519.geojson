They have wonderful truffles, ice cream and a coffee bar.  Be sure and try the Mini Winter Cabernet Truffles....

They have a wonderful selection of wines by the bottle and by the glass, plus they serve some nice dishes to compliment the wines.  Not really a place to go to dinner, but you may want to stay all night.  Sit on the saddle and talk to a stranger... trust me. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wp5oa1gj9f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.285149,38.299402]}},{"properties":{"name":"Copia","description":"Posted by Mamamisty<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> At Copia they have classes, exhibits and lots of great stuff to try.  Not to mention the beautiful gardens.  A great place to unwind or to brush up on your wine knowledge.  There is also a restaurant onsite (Julia\\'s Kitchen) which serves good food, but in my opinion is overpriced and the servers are somewhat pretentious.  Play here, eat somewhere else!  If you\\'re around in February you have to catch the Death by Chocolate exhibit. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wp5ogbaqiv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.280578613,38.3022637555]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ghirardelli Square","description":"Posted by Mamamisty<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 900 North Point St., San Francisco, CA, United StatesThis is my favorite date place.

Their blueberry muffins are too good, and their breakfast are super yummy.  My favorite here is the Greek scramble, hold olives, add mushrooms with a side of fruit and a blueberry muffin.  It also has a nice outdoor seating area nestled in with some cute shops.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wp5omvkf25"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.28857,38.297818]}},{"properties":{"name":"Milbrae Pancake House","description":"Posted by MamamistyThis place is AWESOME!
