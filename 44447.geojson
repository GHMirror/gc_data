She carried a camera, a parting gift from her father, and wore excessive amounts of blue bracelets. She was girthy by European standards, but was by no means fat. During the winter she had come to visit her boyfriend; she stayed with him for weeks in Memorial Hall.\r\n\r\nThis was her second visit, and ultimately, it would be her last. \r\n\r\nWhile he went to class, she would sit in his room and busy herself with little things: Making bracelets, writing e-mails, and tidying up. There were always issues she wanted to address and knew the grains of sand in her hourglass were slipping away. \r\n\r\nBut they wanted to live in the moment remembering the crazy past. \r\n\r\nAnd so they spent their evenings drinking cheap, canned beer instead. They would talk about the times that he had come to Paris and drunk Vodka straight out of the bottle. They would talk about their mutual love of Tom Waits or fucking in the sea. Sometimes, she would drink 14 beers and cry. \r\n\r\nMost of the time, she didn\\'t understand the jokes; her command of English was poor, but she laughed at them anyway. She\\'d marvel at the size of things and would readily take offence to Miller High Life\\'s moniker \"The Champagne of Beers\" as she crumbled the empty can and reached for another.\r\n\r\nHe always knew that their time was limited, by distance and by both of their restlessness, and so he\\'d sleep with her each night and relish the blessed absurdity that would highlight his thoughts for years. In the morning, they\\'d keep their moaning to a minimum to avoid waking his roommate.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day she left that place. She left the country knowing that it would never be the same. \r\n\r\nNeither of them liked constants. Both of them loved memories.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9pf4kxhw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0639,41.50035]}},{"properties":{"name":"Coach K","description":"Posted by RammsteinMany people have argued about Mark Korntheuer’s real identity over the years. While most people think he is the happy-go-lucky high school teacher he purports to be, some people have a suspicion that he is Ned Flanders, incarnate. His push broom mustache doesn’t do much to dissuade those few people. \r\n\r\nRegardless, Mark Korntheuer is what one might call a neighborhood institution. He’s lived in Maywood for over thirty years and has taught at the same high school just as long. His house is on 3rd Avenue in what is affectionately referred to as the “Lutheran Ghetto,” due to the high concentration of former and current Lutheran school teachers who chose to live in Maywood because they couldn’t afford the more pricey neighborhoods in the area. The house, of course, is immaculate. The yard is well groomed and it almost looks like he irons his lawn. \r\n\r\nThere isn’t much to say about him except that he’s a stand up guy. He’s a fervent Christian who regularly attends church. In the great Lutheran tradition, though, he can always drink one beer too many if the situation dictates it. \r\n\r\nThough he’s been recognized multiple times for his achievements at Walther Lutheran High School, the accolades have not gone to his head. Every morning he wakes up and happily goes to his job. He teaches students about geography and coaches the tennis team and is always willing to put in extra time with any one of his pupils. If you rise early enough on a Saturday, you’ll catch him and his wife on their morning walk – clad in Walther attire, of course. Mark is the friendly face you see at the grocery store. He’s the guy who never feigns interest in what you have to say, but pays only real attention. \r\n\r\nMark is the guy who future homeowners dream of having as a neighbor<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9peozxkb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.83604,41.89634]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dean the Cocksucker","description":"Posted by RammsteinIn a semi-opulent office, he sits in absolute piety. His clerical collar is immaculate just like his saviors\\' birth. His alcoholic wife or special-needs child is nowhere on his mind. He pages through a gold trimmed bible with his large hands and ponders the meaning of the sacred word. But his righteousness is a farce. He does not cope well - but unlike his wife who self medicates, he deludes himself into thinking an enemy is lurking within the confines of his own flock. Like a Catholic priest who turns his nightstand photo of God around before penetrating the alter boy, deep down, Dean knows what he has done, and what he is doing, is wrong. He dislikes homosexuality. He dislikes it so much that he loves it, he feeds on it. He believes that to tolerate such a facet of wickedness is to commit the same transgression yourself. And so he thinks further. He thinks only in hypothetical terms. He does not think of the effect his actions will have, but rather how good they\\'ll feel when he carries them out. The term \"hypocrisy\" has never bogged down his thoughts because he is an instrument of God - finely tuned to carry out His precise will. Never mind the fact that his assistant pastor dresses up like a cheerleader at basketball games or that he knits or that he\\'s deeper in the closet than Dean\\'s wife is in the bottle. No. He won\\'t pull that card until he\\'s ready to sink the entire ship. For now he\\'s content to sit, page through the bible and formulate plans for the next witch hunt.

Joe Scuedero and his shop have been a part of it all.But that bastion is crumbling. Fast. The old Goombas have moved down to Florida and their kids have moved out to the suburbs. Italians won\\'t sell their homes to blacks; the Mexicans have swarmed the entire area.Joe would stand behind the counter of his small shop and yell at his teenage sons with a thick Chicago accent. \"Anthony. Little Joey. Two Meatballs wit Mozarella!\" He would give the cops free sandwiches and address people as \"counselor.\" He wore the same apron all the time and proudly displayed an article from the local newspaper with him and the boys on the cover. Anthony and Joey still run this small bakery. I came into the shop yesterday afternoon to get a capicola sandwich and was greeted by an unfamiliar man. His face was sunken with cancer, his cheeks gaunt and eyes yellow. He carried an oxygen tank behind him. By the time anybody reads this, Joe Scuedero will be dead. Joe\\'s memory won\\'t live on for long. Within months, the humble and earnest work that went on his shop will be replaced with mariachi music and cowboy boots.

His eyes are tinged with the hue of festering jaundice. He chain smokes Newport 100s despite the NO SMOKING signs posted conspicuously around the shop. He scratches his arm, revealing a tattoo of a pitchfork – the official mark of the Gangsta Disciples. He explains that it was done with a guitar string. It is no secret that he helps himself to almost anything not protected by lock and key. Mario has been to prison on nine separate occasions, the last four of which times were for the same class one felony: Possession with Intent to Distribute. His mannerisms are nervous, as if he feels he’s always being watched. His command of the English language is weak. He adds a superfluous “ed” ending to every verb. “I loveded that bitch” is one of his common sayings. Mario can hardly spell and when marking the contents of boxes he must ask coworkers how to spell words like “plate” and “bowl.” \r\n\r\nMario is trying to get back on his feet. He currently lives in a halfway home on Chicago’s impoverished West Side. At thirty eight years old, the outlook on his life is bleak. He constantly faces the temptations of the business end of a crack pipe – the ever present pitfall of all his previous lives. To curb that desire, he has begun substituting alcohol for cocaine and it has taken a sharp toll. After a lifetime of drug abuse and malnourishment, the ethanol taxes his energy and resolve. But, he believes it’s better than hustling again. \r\n\r\nIn spite of his obstacles, Mario is an optimistic soul. His outlook on life is admirable. As he smokes his cigarette, he breathes in the fresh air between drags and a smile comes to his face. He informs me that every day he wakes that he is thankful – thankful for his freedom, his possessions, and simply thankful for waking each morning. He regularly attends church to show his appreciation. \r\n\r\nBehind his jaded and sickened eyes, the face of a child occasionally peers through. Mario likes to play small pranks on co-workers and spray people with the hose while he’s working outside. He’s replaced the candy of childhood with cigarettes, in which he delights. Mario never had a shot at life; he never had a foundation to build upon. He lacked the education to accomplish much. Many would tell him to pull himself up by the bootstraps, but it won’t happen. Mario will most likely die young or in prison without a penny to his name. Some people will consider it sad and some people will consider it a merciful ending. \r\n\r\nMost people rarely consider a person like Mario at all. \r\n\r\nBut while people take his money and dignity regularly, there’s one thing Mario will tell you they can’t take – his fresh start, every morning.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9pjn7iz9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.16106,41.77969]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ray Mottis","description":"Posted by RammsteinIt’s difficult to watch Ray move. He moves like he’s an old man, but his birthday says differently.  His motions are labored. His feet are unsure of themselves. Ray was once a virile, generous, and eccentric man. But now he stands in the living room as only a remnant, a ghostly relic of what he once was. Ray offers me a drink, as he does every time I come over, and I decline to limit the distance he must cover.  \r\n\r\nHe was a popular man around the town. Born in raised in Maywood, he spent years drinking and traveling with John Prine. He ran several respectable businesses: two carwashes and a Laundromat (above which he lived). But now the concept of him living by himself seems archaic, a bitter reminder of what once was and will never again be.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, as Ray was drawing a bath for himself, a group of junkies quietly scaled the fire escape and entered his apartment. They snuck up behind and caved his head in with an aluminum bat. As he lay in his own blood with a multiply fractured skull, the attackers made themselves comfortable and did drugs for several hours. Upon leaving, they simply left him for dead. \r\n\r\nOl’ Ray didn’t die. \r\n\r\nBut the recovery process would take years and everybody knows that he will never be the same. His vision is poor and his short-term memory is spotty. He suffered extensive nerve damage and keeping his balance is difficult. \r\n\r\nRay is not angry that his assailants were never found. He’s not even bitter that the attack happened. Now, his focus is elsewhere. He knows the way he lived is nothing but a pleasant memory. But now, stuck with the hand dealt him, he’s happy to give everything left of him away. His nieces and nephews come by and visit regularly, and he’s filled with joy each time. He spoils them with money and with his love. He tells them stories which never fail to bring a smile. \r\n\r\nIt’s hard to watch an uncle be prematurely and unfairly turned into a frail grandpa years before his time. But nobody else could ever play the role as well as Ray.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9phf7sih"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.83656,41.89124]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tim Eberhard","description":"Posted by RammsteinIn the Greek legend, Icarus forgot that his wings were not real and tragedy befell him. \r\n\r\nTim Eberhard used to have wings. As a fourty-something wrestling coach who had spent his whole life alone, he had plenty of time to build his wings by doing lat pull downs from dusk \\'til dawn. His team always thought if he ever fell out of an airplane, he could glide to safety on the width of his back. \r\n\r\nRather than find somebody to share himself with, he prefered instead to give himself away. No request for money would ever be denied. He gave away his time and resources at work and he gave away every ounce of strength in the gym when he came home. Though they brought him temporary salvation, his identity was that of a broken man who was slowly disappearing. \r\n\r\nAt night, he used to sit and drink iced tea while editing wrestling videos for his team. He would do this until afternoon the next day. When he could no longer sit upright, he\\'d sleep for an hour or two, only to go right back at it. Other nights, he would sit and sob. He\\'d often forgo meals because his torpidity had no interest in food. There were also days when he didn\\'t leave bed. \r\n\r\nBut he still had those wings. Those massive lats in which he took pride.\r\n\r\nSeveral months ago, Tim met somebody and they became engaged. His demeanor improved and his habits began to tilt towards healthy.  \r\n\r\nI saw Tim recently. The wings were gone. He was one of the few who didn\\'t succumb to hubris. He decided to strive for new horizons, and this time, the wings weren\\'t necessary.\r\n\r\nWe\\'re all happy for him.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9pghd97c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.84067,41.90263]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/21541","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rammstein","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rammstein","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/21541","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":7,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=21541,platial:user=rammstein","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44447}
