I\\'d already taken the SATs, the SAT 2s, and the APs.  It felt like I\\'d been applying to college forever.\n\nMy dad was out of town, and my mom always went to bed early and slept like a rock.  So I snuck out of the house and drove over to Jason\\'s house to hang out with him and Joel.  We were three honors students in a basement, pilfering their parents\\' booze.\n\nIt was rare to be unsupervised for more than an hour or two back then.  I guess we went a little nuts.  Jason got so drunk I watched him throw up in the middle of a sentence.  It took him completely by surprise.\n\nJoel made several phone calls to girls, with no success, and then curled up on the couch to pass out.  I got in my car and drove home.\n\nIt was freezing and snowy out, and I was drunk, so I drove the half-mile home carefully.  When I got there, my dad\\'s car was in the garage and the back door was locked.  He had come home from his business trip and locked me out!\n\nThe last thing I wanted to do was wake my parents up in the middle of the night, drunk, and confess what I\\'d been up to the night before the ACTs.  So I curled up in the back seat of my car and prayed for sleep.  I wrapped myself tightly in my coat, but it was too cold to sleep.\n\nI marched up to the front door, held my breath, and rang the doorbell.  I could imagine my parents, groggy and annoyed, waking up and plodding downstairs.  I waited, then rang again.  Nothing.  Bravely and resolutely facing my fate, I used the brass knocker.  Usually this thing was loud enough to wake the dead.  But knock as I might, I couldn\\'t wake my parents up.\n\nI realized now that I wouldn\\'t be rescued.  I had to get into that house or I\\'d freeze out there in the midwestern winter.  And I had only myself to rely on.\n\nSo I dragged the ladder out of the garage and stood it up on the lawn in front of the house.  I climbed to the very top, onto the step that says \"not a step,\" and managed to grab onto the house\\'s gutter.  I pulled myself up and scrambled up the icy roof.  I took off my gloves and pressed my hands against the window to my room.  I kept it unlocked, so if I could get enough traction on the icy roof...  the window was open and I fell inside to warmth, carpeting, and glorious silence.\n\nDrunk though I still was, I remembered to go downstairs, unlock the back door, put the ladder back in the garage, and re-lock the back door.\n\nMy mom woke me up a few hours later.  I had a vicious hangover.  I told her I had the flu.  I took the ACTs anyway, and I got my first college acceptance letter -- with no ACTs required -- a week later.  I never told my parents.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fowc7wt4aj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.4636230469,41.4732164677]}},{"properties":{"name":"Austin","description":"Posted by ChilmoeTX 78731<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fowc3d6byc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.77427,30.354241]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carvels Icecream","description":"Posted by Chilmoe<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/carvels.gif\">Carvel\\'s, Grand Avenue, Englewood, NJ\nWhen I was in high school, my friends Mary, Judy and I would sometimes sneak out of school go under the overpass and walk along Grand Avenue to reach our local Carvel\\'s icecream stand.  It was always such an enjoyable and satisfyingly bad thing to do. I don\\'t know, maybe it\\'s because I was raised a Catholic, that it really doesn\\'t take much to be \"bad\" in a satisfying way.   Ice cream is one of those ways, I guess.  I\\'d always get the same thing -- a chocolate marshmallow sundae with hot fudge sauce.

No facilities; just a piece of land that someone within our rock climbing circle knew about. The owner was probably ignorant about his uninvited guests. Eventually, with liability in mind, the place was place off limits.\n\nMost incredible showing of the Milky Way I\\'ve ever seen from the rocky outcrops high above the river. \n\nSpelunking nearby. One time we were not prepared for drop in temperature.   Because some of us turned out to be uncomfortable in the caves, we didn\\'t have the option of taking refuge within their warmth at night. Instead, we slept about 6 to a pup tent trying to stay warm with each other\\'s body heat. I remember my feet sticking out from under covers and out the pup tent wall (before the days of tent floors). I don\\'t remember ever being so unprepared ever again.\n\nMy experiences at Caudy\\'s Castle were pretty much an expression of my need to be outdoor in the most primitive of ways. This is when I am at peace and feel most myself. \n\nWhen I have time, I\\'ll post an entry for my trips to the Grand Canyon....21 day trip down the river in a kayak and an overnight hike to the bottom of the gorge from the South side. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fowcd4yedb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.7250366211,38.8033298397]}},{"properties":{"name":"French River, Minnesota","description":"Posted by Chilmoeduluth, mnFrench River - This river saved my sanity all through the four years I lived on its banks while in high school.

Vibeke was the daughter of a Danish diplomat. A lot of diplomats\\' kids attended our D.C. suburban schools.  \n\nSteve S. often came by towards the end of lunch to visit with us. I had the biggest crush on him. He rode to school on a 10-speed bike --- I really wanted a bike like that instead of my 3-speed.  He had the greatest eyes....soft and deep.  His hair was long and curly. He had a lope in his gait.  Even today, I wonder whatever happened to him. No google results sort of scare me. \n\nThis particular day, I handed him a Hershey\\'s kiss. I don\\'t remember planning this in advance. Thinking back, such a \"bold\" move was not in my nature. I don\\'t remember how he acknowledged me, but I do remember that an instant later he handed the kiss to Vibeke. She was sort of exotic and I guess he had a crush on her. \n\nThat may have been the first time I minimized my feelings towards a romantic interest since I don\\'t remember even being embarrassed or aggravated by what now seems, in hindsight, a rather cruel or thoughtless act on Steve\\'s part.  Ah, but this is what being a teenager means.  \n\nI think I may be a Valentine\\'s Day Scrooge.

It was demolished to make way for the new high school building that appears on this map. It was a geodesic dome and very innovative for it\\'s time...constructed in the 1960\\'s.\r\n\r\nThe Dome was a multi-purpose facility.  On the ground level the basketball courts/gym/auditorium floor was surronded on 3 sides by fold-out bleachers and the stage on the 4th. For stage events the court/floor would be covered with folding chairs. On the \"balcony\" area above were more fold-out bleachers looking down on the floor and stage below.  Behind these bleachers were other athletic/gym facilities: gymnastic equipment, volly ball courts, etc.  It was a huge facility.  From the outside it was a remarkable land mark.  Painted silver, it was also a wonderful canvas for school spirit and other types of HUGE grafitti.\r\nThe major events of the school year were held in the dome:  concerts, lectures, convocations, dances (proms were held in hotel ballrooms) and, finally, graduation.  It was at my graduation in June 1971 where I last saw most of my high school classmates.  We were from political, governmental, media and corporate families.  After graduation we all scattered to attend college and go to work.  And, many of our families/parents subsequently relocated from the DC area. I have lost track of all my high school friends and aquiantences.\r\nOne of my classmates recently gave a lecture in her area of expertise as part of the continuing education program at the community where my Mom now lives.  When introduced to my Mom she recognized our last name and indicated she knew one of my sisters.  Mom got the woman\\'s contact info and passed it on to the sister mentioned.  I saw it at my sister\\'s house and we agreed that I was the one who had been friends with the woman.  I have the contact info somewhere on my desk in my home office.  And, as is my habit, once I uncover it in the midst of one of my occasional fits of organizational fevor, I will properly file it...not sure if I will make contact with her after 35+ years.\r\n\r\nS.
