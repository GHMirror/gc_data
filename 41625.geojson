The father had gifts of charm and dance. The aunt was Miss Philipines just before my birth. At one time, the pageant banner was housed with us. Recently I came across a website about Vida Doria, Miss Photogenic Miss Universe 1971 and smiled about the relationship between her and the press.

Found memories of low income \"luxury apartments\" which included a jacuzzi that never worked and pool which never had a water BUT there were windows everywhere and sliding doors onto the balcony. \n\nIn the winter the snowplows would push all the snow to the end of the complex to create giant snow mountains which all the kids tunneled through to create igloos. There was also a basketball court and I remember learning to play HORSE with the neighborkid, Israel.

We just wanted to get out of Broek en Waterland as soon as possible, we wanted to move that week.  But in Amsterdam, people put their apartments on the rental market months before they are even ready to start moving out, so this was the only vacant place i saw that could be occupied right away.  It had been vacant for a months, asking too much, we just offered them less, and they accepted (the dutch people we told this to had never ever heard of such a thing).  \n\nOnce we moved in, we realized it was basically a young family commune.  The building turned out to be an old police station covnerted into condos just 3 years prior.  It filled up immediatly with 10 new couples, who all proceeded to make babies.  So there were 9 young kids, and in fact, every kid born in those years was a boy.  Tabor was no exception, he officially became part of the Kattenburgergracht Futbal Club on St. Patty\\'s Day, 2004, born right there in the apartment, under the stark exposed beams.  \n\nMost of the units in the building had open door attitudes, and packs of young kids would run from one home to the next, leaving a trail of speeletjes, hagelslag, appelstroop, and dikkesaap.  We built a little playspace with padded climbing area, and a sort of slide that the kids would rampage on.\n\nThe building shares a little park in the rear with a few other buildings (college dorms and other apartment buildings) with a playground and a meticulously cared for array of flora that stays green and lush all year round.  Riding into the back courtyard from the street in the winter is a transformation from grey stone gritty old europe to a modern fresh light green alive new nation.  It was paradise.\n\nThe apartment was a very euro, super modern, minimalist loft like place, but with cozy carpet filled bedrooms upstairs.  The windows and balcony looks out over 2 converging canals, the neighbors had boats.  The open kitchen with island mounted stovetop made cooking a supremely social activity, especially when in need of advice on how to really make the pindasaus just right.\n\nThe only downers: too many stairs with kids and groceries, no closets in the whole place, it was such a fancy place that we ended up ruining it (kids), and it was haunted, sorta.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62n2am16b7v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.91711,52.370499]}},{"properties":{"name":"Partygirls","description":"Posted by Trygger<img src=\"http://www.wigstock.nu/photos/images1994/1994_slide_09.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62n2akmm7zh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.980947,40.727942]}},{"properties":{"name":"Platial HQ","description":"Posted by Trygger<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/c7275a6918a70abe3d2364baf94df05d.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/c7275a6918a70abe3d2364baf94df05d.jpg\">Your Collaborative Atlas<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62n2alrfag2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.68106,45.525943]}},{"properties":{"name":"Platial's humble roots","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/7/10854618_fd5c1d90c0_o.jpg\">2347 NW Kearney Street, Portland, OR, 97210, Portland, OR, 97210Where we started building things, dreaming<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62n2apbn4tp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.699997,45.529202]}},{"properties":{"name":"SidUps","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://www.eisnor.com/emiko/old/images/tree_babies.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/11/12529584_dd86d02318.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://www.eisnor.com/emiko/old/images/eskimo3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 460 Driggs Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211Emiko\\'s Treehouse, Dance Dance Revolution Olympics, The great flood and blizzard of 03.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62n2apw8hep"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9543,40.7192]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/1663","metadata":null,"contact_name":"deisnor","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:deisnor","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/1663","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":18,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=1663,platial:user=deisnor","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41625}
