The campaign, however, had cost him many casualties, and although he had been waiting on reinforcements under General Howe, they never came. Colonial forces began to encircle Burgoyne's troops until he was forced to take the offensive. Under the leadership of Horatio Gates and his field general, Benedict Arnold, the Continental Army defeats Burgoyne's troops and Burgoyne surrenders.  This battle is significant not only because it was a major victory for the Continental Army, but also because it convinced the French that the American colonists could aptly fight a war against a European military power, winning over the French as crucial allies in the war.

Raffles had good knowledge of the Malay language, which had helped him gain the position that he then held, Governor-General of Bencoolen, and was in search of a port to counter the Dutch trading powers. This action did not make the Dutch happy, but Singapore grew quickly as a port city and a Sir Raffles, though he spent little time there, was instrumental in the drafting of a constitution for Singapore in 1823. In 1824, a treaty between the Dutch and the English secured Singapore for the British. Singapore would remain a British colony, with various degrees of independence, until World War II, when it was occupied by the Japanese.

After receiving a land grant from the crown, He declared New Smyrna the 14th colony in North America. The site was named for the hometown of Trumbull's wife, the town of Smyrna in what is now Turkey. The British traded control of Cuba to the Spanish after the Seven Years' War, and in return took over the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida. Nearly the entire Spanish population left, and the British began an aggressive campaign to bring new settlers to Florida. The settlers tried to grow sugarcane, hemp, and indigo, but few crops survived in the sandy Florida soil, and many settlers died of tropical diseases in the sweltering heat. The indentured laborers eventually tired of Trumbull's authoritarian rule, and the settlement collapsed. The surviving settlers fled north to St. Augustine. The sparsely populated Florida remained loyal to the British Empire during the American Revolution, but as part of the Treaty of Paris ending the war, Florida south of the 31st parallel was returned to Spanish control.

The Amritsar Massacre was prompted by a British fear of Indian rebellion and reprisal. Since 1857, British Officials in India governed heir subjects with fear and suspicion. In early 1919, tensions between native Indians in Punjab and British officials was at an all time high. Indian Crowds in the Punjab Province protested the detainment of rebellion leaders by British forces. General Dyer saw the protest as an opportunity to flex British military muscle. His forces fired on the crowd for over ten minutes. Dyer did not face stringent consequences for his actions and blatant disregard for Indian life and civil order.

In 1693, during the race for spices and textiles between Great Britain and the Netherlands, the Dutch captured Pondicherry, but eventually gave it back to the French in 1699.

At the Treaty of Paris in 1763, however, the British decided to return the colony to the French. Not 30 years later, though, did the British once again capture Pondicherry during the chaos of the French Revolution, but like before, they released control of it in 1814.

Instead of circumnavigating the Cape of Good Hope en route to India, the British sailed to Egypt, made the short journey to the Red Sea on foot, and continued from there. In fact, Napoleon realized the strategic importance of Egypt to the British and landed his troops there in an effort to block this valuable corridor. This was the provocation for the great naval battle of Aboukir Bay, where Nelson and the Royal Navy dealt a decisive blow to Napoleon’s forces, with the French forces ultimately surrendering in 1801. Fast-forward 70 years and British interest in Egypt is again sparked in large regard due to their Indian colonies. The French inaugurated the Suez Canal in 1869, cutting the London-Bombay transit times by a number of weeks. Needless to say, the British were less than pleased that this crucial passage was controlled by the French (in conjunction with the local Khedive government.)  However, the Khedive had borrowed heavily in undertaking this mammoth project and consequently found himself inundated with debt. The opportunistic British investors were quick to swoop in and purchased Khedive’s shares of the Suez Canal Company, once again using their economic muscle for strategic means. However, the Khedive government again found itself in dire economic straits a few years later and at this point the British and French assumed control of its financial dealings. The British then ousted Khedive after he resisted their power-grab and inserted his son Tawfiq in his stead. This Egyptians began to riot in response to this gradual loss in autonomy and tried to bring an end to all European involvement in their country.. Once again the British took the helm in quashing Egyptian resistance as the French opted to focus on various domestic issues.

Though situated across the world in Ghazipur, Cornwallis’ tomb and its parallels in design and appearance to Jefferson’s remain a physical testament to the breadth and expanse of the British Empire, serving to link two such remote locations as Charlottesville, Virginia and Ghazipur, India.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Emery Poor&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Friday 12pm (Dzavid)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/2/2012 12:54:13&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://images.frontdoor.com/FDOOR/articles/Architecture-Images/Neoclassical-Monticello.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohdjiig1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.479933,38.031419]}},{"properties":{"name":"Versailles","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Versailles was the location of the negotiations that concluded World War I and led to the Treaty of Versailles.

In the months leading up to the battle, American forces led by George Washington had besieged British troops led by Lord Cornwallis at nearby Yorktown, VA.  Chesapeake Bay served as a strategic naval point of interest, as the Royal Navy could use it to reinforce or evacuate Cornwallis' blockaded troops at Yorktown.

This policy implementation was followed by a flight from Ireland from many of the Gaelic lords of Ulster. This departure however, opened the way for the plantation of Ulster to be governed by a new landowning class consisting of Scots and Englishmen. This provided for the most successful British settlement made in Ireland. In 1606 British tenantry and laborers were introduced as landowners and many became extremely wealthy in the process and in 1609 King James officially controlled the plantation. The official colony of Ulster included the counties of Tyrconnell, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan, Coleraine, and Armagh. It is said that the colonization of Ulster was to pay for the costly Nine Years War but this vision was not shared by all including the British Attorney-General of Ireland Sir John Davies. The Plantation of Ulster continued up until the 18th century with little interruption.   **in an ironic turn of events the flight of the Irish to North America at the beginning of the 17th century laid the foundation for the Glorious Revolution where Britain ultimately lost the control of the 13 Colonies. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Garrett Barnard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Thursday 2pm (Gitanjali)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/3/2012 15:46:46&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.ulsterphotography.co.uk/images/castles0038.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohjq8h11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.7813989,54.7960608]}},{"properties":{"name":"Goald Coast","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Gold Coast, now Ghana was a British Colony until it gained independence in 1957.

A few years later, the Khedive was forced to seek out loans from both Britain and France, which established a joint oversight committee into Egyptian economic and domestic affairs as a condition for financial help. As France's influence in the country waned, British control grew, and soon Britain was the de facto ruler (though the position of khedive was formally kept to present a facade of Egyptian political rule). Together with this newfound political power, the Suez Canal provided huge economic opportunities to Britain, creating entirely new and faster trading routes to connect Britain's vast empire. Maps could be drastically reworked to facilitate shipping, and overseas travel time to India could be cut in half.

The massacre in Kanpur (or Cawnpore as it was known by the British) came at the heels of a twenty-day siege on the British garrison at Kanpur.  Greatly outnumbered, the British sustained heavy losses during the fighting while disease coupled with food and water shortages also took their toll on the British troops.  On June 25, 1857 the British agreed to surrender to the Sepoy forces in exchange for safe passage out of Kanpur to the nearby Allahabad.  However, on June 27, the morning of the evacuation, Sepoy soldiers attacked the British, killing many and capturing the rest.  Within a few hours, these captives were also killed.  Many details concerning why shots were fired and who instigated the fighting are unknown to this day. Nevertheless, the Kanpur Massacre marks one of the bloodiest moments in the Sepoy rebellion, and perhaps in the entire history of British rule in India.  In addition to leaving hundreds of British soldiers, women, and children dead, the massacre also made headlines back home in Britain.  As stories of the horrors that occurred reached Britain, they became an important source of pro-Imperialist propaganda.  As a result, the Kanpur massacre resulted not only in massive loss of life, but also served to illustrate the barbarity and savagery of natives in India that the British feared.

His mission was to quell the growing rebellion in Massachusetts by retaliating against coastal towns such as Falmouth that harbored Patriot activities. Mowat told the citizens of the town that he would withhold fire only if they would swear allegiance to King George and surrender their weapons.  When the townspeople failed to do so, Mowat ordered his fleet to fire upon Falmouth on the morning of October 18.  The bombardment continued well into the evening.  By day's end, the fleet had destroyed hundreds of buildings and left over two-fifths of the town's population homeless. Instead of quelling the growing rebellion, the Burning of Falmouth ended up fueling it.  Within weeks of the incident, news spread throughout the colonies and became the subject of propaganda.

The construction of the foundation started on March 31st, 1911. However, it was interrupted between 1915 and 1919 due to reclamations for the land on which the gateway was being built. The foundations were completed in 1920, and construction was finished in 1924. Built from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete, the Gateway combines Hindu and Muslim architectural styles which complement each other: the arch belongs to the Muslim style which is best seen in the three domes located on top of the arch and the decorations are in Hindu style. The Gateway was opened on 4 December 1924, by the Viceroy, the Earl of Reading. The estimated cost of the construction amounted to 2,100,000 rupees.  The gateway is also a symbol of the independence of India. The last British troops to leave India, the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the Gateway in a ceremony on 28 February 1948. Furthermore, a statue of Chatrapati Shivaji (19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680), the founder of Maratha Empire was erected in front of the monument to serve as a reminder that modern India was also built through the efforts of its ancestors.

The ship, called the Trouvadore, had been bound for Cuba, where the slaves were to be sold.  Because the Caicos Islands were part of the British Empire, which had gradually abolished slavery in its colonies in the wake of the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act, residents were unsure what to do with the ostensibly enslaved survivors of the wreck.  While the ship’s Spanish captain attempted to offer a cash reward to locals who would ensure the slaves’ delivery to Spain, authorities in Grand Turk ultimately sent their own ships and soldiers to rescue the survivors and brought them back to the courthouse where they were detained for some time.  Since authorities realized that sending the slaves back to Africa—or even to another local island for that matter—would be far too expensive (especially given the cost of the rescue), they decided instead to keep the majority of the Africans on the island on a three-year contract working for the salt rakers.  Though the Africans weren’t technically slaves any longer, the working conditions were difficult and locals insisted that they go to church and learn English.  There is no definitive record as to what happened after the contract was up, but evidence suggests that the former slaves became free citizens of the Caicos Islands, perhaps even starting their own settlement, known as Bambarra, in Middle Caicos, having been saved by a shipwreck from a lifetime of slavery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Amy Weiss-Meyer&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 3pm (Anouska)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/4/2012 22:16:23&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2008/images/keel.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohlbn84m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.5486562,21.6810256]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cyprus","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cyprus’s entry into the British Empire happened under rather unusual circumstances in 1878. The Cyprus Convention of 4 June 1878 was a good example of how the British Empire acquired some lands in secret agreements with other countries/empires in exchange for their support in wars, agreements and congresses. British Empire and Ottoman Empire reached an agreement that granted control of Cyprus to Great Britain following the British intervention on the side of the Ottoman Turks by sending a fleet to intimidate the Russians. The timing of this new land acquisition was very important for the British, as it was a period of fast increase of sea-borne traffic in the Eastern Mediterranean due to the Suez Canal that had opened nine years ago. Since much of this traffic was British en route to or from India, this island proved to be a major base of operation for the occupation of Egypt that would happen only 4 years later. This was an important mark of Britain’s growing dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean. Even though the British had agreed to run Cyprus on behalf of the Ottomans, this agreement was paused and even reversed during the chaotic years of World War One. Cyprus was declared to be a Crown Colony in 1925. Its history from then until 1960 is full of events such as Italian and German invasions, internal chaos and Greek Cypriot riots.

The war of 1812 had left the Northeastern-most border of the United States unclear, but with the region containing more moose than people that was of little concern until the formation of the State of Maine and gradual settlement by loggers seeking old growth timber sparked border disputes and skirmishes between rival lumberjacks. As tensions rose, Maine raised its militia, expanding the road to the region and constructing two forts along the St. John river which today mark the Northern and Eastern-most towns in the region. The federal government also took interest, authorizing 50,000 soldiers and $10 million dollars for an offensive should open conflict break out, and moving several regiments and artillery units north in preparation. The British, for their part, moved their own militias and military to the border, making a conflict seem imminent. Thankfully, diplomats intervened before shots were fired, settling the border in part using and old map drawn by Benjamin Franklin. Though the conflict was never a hot war, dozens of troops reportedly died in the frigid Maine winter (with temperatures dipping below negative 40 degree Fahrenheit), often getting lost on patrols when blizzards would strike, and the newly constructed road aided settlement of an area that would later house Loring Air Force Base one of the largest in the world, and a key location in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Jared Sleeper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 2pm (Dzavid)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/4/2012 23:58:37&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1070/578891220_d5b75ef60c.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohgltm9w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-68.1401375,46.9293817]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bambatha Rebellion","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Bambatha Rebellion of 1906 was a response to the increase in taxes placed on the colony in the years following.

A common legal system did indeed extend across the divide, but after the English conversion to Protestantism in the early 1500s, the question of religion was a contentious one, as most Irish citizens remained fiercely Catholic. The Irish finally won independence from the British in 1923, though Northern Ireland is still under British rule today.

Planter militia, troops, and even Maroon soldiers (contracted by the British) mobilized to combat Tacky and his forces. Fearing retribution and capture, many slaves returned to their plantations. Tacky and a small company of his men continued to fight. When a Maroon fighter killed Tacky, his men went into hiding and eventually committed suicide rather than return to their slave lives.  A monument was erected in Tacky’s honor in Claude Stuart Park, Port Maria. The revolt, known as Tacky’s War, was not the only attempted slave rebellion in the Sugar Islands, but it was significant in its demonstration of colonial brutality against and oppression of Caribbean slaves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mattie Kahn&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 5pm (Nick)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/5/2012 11:09:40&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://keepitjiggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tacky-Monument.png\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohrkbrg3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.8913122,18.3712]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nova Scotia","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nova Scotia, located at the head of the St. Lawrence River, was the ideal location for settlement and trade and therefore the site of many power struggles between the French and British Empires. The French had originally claimed it as a part of its New France colony, naming it Acadia, but between numerous wars such as King Williams' War, the British won control of the territory by 1710. The American Revolution (1776-1783) brought many raids on Nova Scotian ports, and after the Patriots' victory, the colony became the evacuation site for thousands of Loyalists. In 1758, Nova Scotia, with its elected Assembly, became the first British colony to establish representative government. Later, in 1848, under the direction of Haligonian Joseph Howe, Nova Scotia also became the first British colony to be governed by a responsible government, or a system of government in which the executive branch is directly accountable to the legislative branch, and therefore the common people (i.e. the House of Commons).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Veri Seo&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Thursday 3pm (Gitanjali)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/5/2012 11:12:19&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.nsexplore.ca/maps1/nova_scotia_1733.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohq3dwkc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-63.726136,45.0752516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Greenwich Mean Time","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;With Britain's naval supremacy over the seas in the 19th Century, it became necessary for ships to develop a precise way to track their current position in degrees of longitude and latitude.

The simplest way to calculate longitude is to keep track of time at a certain position use a marine chronometer to determine the distance away from that time source. An observatory in Greenwich served as the official time keeper of the British Empire. It became the accepted as the standard time around the globe for just under a century and was not replaced until 1972 by several atomic clocks located around the world.

He looked to the salt tax as an issue around which all regions, classes, and ethnic groups could rally, for the mineral was a necessity to all Indian subjects. Gandhi decried the salt tax to be, “the most iniquitous of all [of the Salt Laws] from the poor man’s standpoint,” for the British monopoly on the salt tax marked the sale or production of salt—an easily accessible resource—by anyone other than the British government as a criminal offense (Scott). On March 12, 1930, Gandhi, accompanied by 78 satyagrahi men, began his 240 mile 23 day journey on foot from Sabarmati to the coastal village of Dandi. Over the course of each day, the procession swelled with more followers, eventually reaching two miles in length. On April 6, 1930, Ghandi picked up a lump of mud and salt from the seashore at Dandi and boiled it to illegally make salt in defiance of the Salt Tax. He subsequently urged his thousands of followers to make their own salt from the seashore. Thus began a “war” on the salt tax, which lasted until April 13, 1930. In reaction to Ghandi’s defiant act, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month. Ghandi was later arrested “under a regulation of 1827” on May 4 of the same year (Scott). Regardless of these arrests, thousands of people continued to make or buy illegal salt. As a result, this period is considered to be the highest point of Gandhi’s political career and a turning point in the Indian struggle for independence from Great Britain, for it mobilized thousands of Indians and attracted international attention to the independence movement (Scott).

The conquest of Palestine would secure both the Suez Canal as well as a land bridge between the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf, which would strengthen military dominance in the area as well as an additional defense of British interests in India.    Palestine, with its Arab majority, Jewish minority and complicated religious and political history, would prove to be a very challenging territory for British leaders.

Though it was not a capital city at the time, today it is an important center of commerce and tourism. The BNBC began in 1881 as a follow-up to small colonizations and trading posts on Borneo. It first established a settlement on Gaya Island just off the mainland, but this was destroyed in 1897 by an uprising of the indigenous seafaring Bajau people. The BNBC also began collecting taxes from locals. After the first settlement destruction, the BNBC established Jesselton on the mainland (after Charles Jessel, who was the Vice Chairman of the Company). Jesselton proceeded to become a major trading post and the terminus of the North Borneo Railway by 1906, the only rail transport system still operating on Borneo. Much of the city's original architecture was destroyed during WWII, as the British razed the city early in the war when fleeing the Japanese. The last South Pacific Allied offensive in 1945 destroyed what was left of the city. After WWII, the BNBC was unable to refinance rebuilding of Jesselton and gave control to the British Crown in 1946. Jesselton became the capital of Sabah (formerly North Borneo) in 1963 with Malaysian independence, and it was renamed \"Kota Kinabalu\" in 1968.

In particular, the use of the Lee-Enfield Rifle, which required the soldier to bite off the end of a cartridge covered in pig fat and beef tallow in order to load the firearm, proved problematic for Hindu soldiers, for whom cows are sacred, and Muslim soldiers, for whom eating pork is prohibited. On May 9th, 1857, almost the entirety of the 3rd cavalry was imprisoned for refusing to obey their superiors' orders to bite the cartridges. Along with members of the 11th and 20th cavalry, they broke out and turned on the British officers, initiating the rebellion.

In the early years of the Revolution, local residents caught wind of the fact that the British fleet was heading toward Charleston to lay siege on the city, so they quickly built a fort made out of wood from palmetto trees.

The telegraph cable allowed communication between the United Kingdom and North America to take a matter of minutes rather than weeks. It took many tries to lay the cable; after a failed attempt in 1857, the connection was successfully made in 1858, and the first official telegraph sent across the Atlantic Ocean was a congratulatory message from Queen Victoria to U.S. President James Buchanan. However, this first cable failed several weeks later. Several more attempts were made over the next decade; eventually, the first long-lasting, truly successful cable was laid in 1866. The cable was made of copper wires, wrapped in layers of gutta-percha (a rubber-like material from Southeast Asia - thank goodness for those colonies!), wound with tarred hemp. The thousands of miles of cable were loaded onto a ship in coils, and then gradually unwound and laid to rest on the ocean floor as the ship chugged across the Atlantic. The ship which finally laid the successful cable in 1866 was the Great Eastern, designed by the great Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel (who also designed the Bristol Bridge and the Thames Tunnel).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chelsea Link&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 3pm (Anouska)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/6/2012 2:18:59&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://static.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld-ic/imageasset/iclarge/historyworld-webapp/user/jonathanwoods/object/nV6cNBDYRuS_SE5uxGdxwg/asset/1\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohiox5pk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-10.3542012,51.9129889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Barbados","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Holetown was the first site of colonization by the British in February of 1627 on the island of Barbados.

Historically this is a very important place, because this hall is the place where the British Government found University of Dhaka, the first university in East Bengal. After 1911, when the British government abolished the 1905 partition of Bengal (which was done in the favor of the Muslim majority of East Bengal), in 1912 Viceroy Lord Hardinge proposed to establish a university in East Bengal as a compensation of the annulment of the partition. The university started it's activity in the Curzon Hall.  The foundation of the Curzon Hall and the University of Dhaka reminds us of the fact that the British divided the whole India in terms of religion; later we see the reflection of this very fact in 1947, when the British left India, but divided the whole region into two parts-- Parkistan and India.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tarik Adnan Moon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Friday 11am (Sakura)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/6/2012 18:44:03&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/DSC03638.JPG/640px-DSC03638.JPG\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohpmpbkt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[90.4022739,23.7281046]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bermuda","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Although Bermuda was first discovered by Spanish explorers in 1505, it was settled (by accident) by the Virginia Company. Sir George Somers was captaining the boat Sea Venture to Jamestown, Virginia to provide extra provisions for the settlers already there as part of the Virginia Company. During a storm, the ship crashed on Bermuda where the sailors spent months rebuilding their ship. They eventually made their way successfully to Jamestown, only to find the settlers there starving, before they turned around back to England. The Virginia Company decided to keep some settlers on the island and as a result Britain has maintained possession on the island continuously to this day. The islands were sometimes called the 'Somers Isles' in reference to its founder. Given their small amount of land, especially compared to the Americas, Bermuda focused its economy on ship building as opposed to agriculture. The island also served as an important dockyard for the Royal Navy including during the War of 1812. Today, still under British control, Bermuda is known as a tourist location and a location for offshore banking.

The British had two main reasons for building this fort, to protect their waterways, and to protect the Royal Navy Dockyards from attacks by the USA. An attack on Point Henry would have been detrimental to the British because it would have cut off communication between the Royal Navy Dockyards and all settlement to the east of Kingston. Thus jeopardizing possible attacks on all of Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the the St.Lawrence River. Point Henry was located where Lake Ontario met the Saint Lawrence River, both were fundamental trading routes for the British. Furthermore, after the War of 1812, Point Henry was even more vital to British trade due to construction of the Rideau Canal. After completion of the Rideau Canal, Point Henry was located where Lake Ontario, the Rideau Canal, and the St.Lawrence River all intersected, which would be considered the heart of the British's trading routes in present Canada. The original fort cost 70,000 pounds for the British to construct. It was occupied by British troops until 1870. Fort Henry is the largest fortification west of Quebec city.

Zanzibar became a British protectorate in 1890, as a result of the Treaty of Zanzibar with Germany. European interest in Zanzibar derived largely from its position as a commercial hub of slavery, as slavery was not abolished there until 1889. Even as Zanzibar lost economic importance with the end of the slave trade, the British continued to control its leadership, appointing Sultans as they saw fit. When Sultan Hamed bin Thuwain died, the British appointed his cousin as his replacement, but Khaled bin Bargash, who had already tried to come to power when Hamed was alive, moved into the palace with 2000 men and declared himself Sultan. In response, British naval troops bombarded the palace, destroying it and causing 500 deaths amongst Khaled's forces and just one British death. The firing lasted for only 40 minutes. Khaled fled Zanzibar, and the British appointed their original choice, Sultan Hamoud, who supported the British government. The incident not only demonstrated the influence of the British Empire in its less economically significant territories, but also the power it had to enforce its dominance in such territories.

Surrounded by water near an area called “The Rocks” and the present-day location of the Sydney Opera House, Fort Denison fulfilled the requirement of being what Niall Ferguson called, a “prison within the prison.” (Ferguson, pg. 87). This colony had been founded as a location of punishment for convicts, but was beginning to thrive and establish its own society under the rule of the colony’s governor Lcahlan Macquarie. Yet despite this, not every convict could be redeemed and Fort Denison served as one location of continued punishment for those who committed crimes while in Australia. Originally just a slab of rock, the first prisoner, Thomas Hill, was sentenced to a week chained on the rocks with just bread and water. (According to a tour guide of mine in Sydney this past winter, great white sharks were so abundant in the Sydney Harbor at that time that no prisoner—even if un-chained— dared attempt to swim back to the mainland in fear of being eaten!). In 1796, a gibbet was installed on this island to hang those who committed the most egregious of crimes while in this penal colony. It is said that the first person hung was Francis Morgan, a man who was sent to the penal colony for murder and then subsequently bashed a man to death with a rock in Sydney. While serving as a prison within a prison, convicted people were forced to build a fort upon this slab of rock. With the completion of a small fort on this rock, Fort Denison later became a lookout to help protect Sydney Harbor from foreign attack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bruce Taylor&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 2pm (Matthew)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/7/2012 0:36:47&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.hotfrog.com.au/companies/Fort-Denison-Restaurant/images/Fort-Denison-Restaurant_101013_image.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohon6vuf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.2257982,-33.8550141]}},{"properties":{"name":"Battle of Quebec","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Battle of Quebec in 1775 was the first major defeat of the American Continental Army in the Revolutionary War, as part of General Richard Montgomery's failed attempt to invade Canada.  During this battle, General Montgomery was killed, and over 400 American soldiers were taken prisoner. After a series of key military victories at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, Continental forces moved north to engage the British at their now-fortified position in Quebec city, reinforced by forces under Benedict Arnold. At this point of the war, the Continental Army had expected for the local French Canadian population to join forces against the British, due to residual tensions from the French and Indian War. However, due to the Quebec Act of 1774, which restored significant land holdings to the local French in Quebec, they chose not to join the battle between British forces and the Continental Army. With the British position heavily reinforced and cold weather affecting the condition of Continental army supplies, the American forces were forced to surrender after suffering heavy casualties, including Benedict Arnold being shot in the leg and the death of General Montgomery.

The main result was the declaration of free trade at the Congo and the Niger rivers. The Berlin Conference was a milestone in the race for the colonization process of the European Imperial powers in Africa. Before the Berlin conference, the imperial powers were mainly concentrated on the coast of Africa, a result of the slave and commodity trade in the 18th and 19th century. The extraction of the resources of interior Africa and the strategic civilization of the Native population began mainly under the Belgian king Leopold II. in Congo, a region endowed with resources that elsewhere hardly exist.

The British Antarctic Territory remains one of the British Overseas Territories—a group of 14 British landholdings that, having been claimed during the height of British imperialism, fall under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom but are not an official a part of the nation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hana Rouse&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 4pm (Mircea)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/7/2012 14:28:18&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.flags.net/images/largeflags/BANT0001.GIF\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohgu80q8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-68.1433282,-67.1294198]}},{"properties":{"name":"Battle of Concord","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Battle of Concord was the second British-American encounter in the American Revolutionary War after the Battle of Lexington earlier that day where the redcoats easily won.  Concord was told that the British were advancing.  The Minutemen, a volunteer force of Americans ready to fight with very little notice, gather together to face the British force on April 19, 1775. The minutemen met the British forces at the North Bridge, which is over the Concord River.  After the conflict, the British retreat, and later, the Americans fought sneakily instead of facing the British in the open, which frustrated the British very much.  Combined from the battle of Lexington and Concord, the British casualties were numbered at 273, whereas the Minutemen suffered 94 deaths. This fighting signified the start of the American Revolutionary War. The specific location is of the Minute Man National Historical Park. This relates to the history of the British Empire because it showed not only that the American Revolution had begun, but although the British were clearly better trained, more experienced, and more equipped than the Americans, it was not going to be an easy British victory. On a larger scale, the loss of this territory to the British will be a large one and the loss of this war has been argued as a significant symbol of the decline of the British empire.

Though the Spaniards were doubtfully the first to stumble upon the island, it was Fray Tomas de Berlanga who made the first recorded discovery of the islands in 1535. The first British visit came nearly 60 years later, yet it was the British who would largely make use of the spot in the immediate future. At least initially, the Britons used the islands not for its famed indigenous fauna but rather for its strategic location.  As Niall Ferguson wrote in his history, Empire, some of the first traces of imperial power were sown by British pirates ransacking the gold from Spanish ships and colonies, some of which returned was returned to the Crown. These buccaneers, as they were later called, utilized the Galapagos as a hiding ground to avoid the Spanish for over a century. The aforementioned fauna, including the large whale population, which helped feed the hiding pirates, also made the island attractive to various whalers and Pacific travelers, who made such frequent visits to the island that a small post office was erected on the island of Floreana in 1800. But the islands’ most significant contribution to British history came in 1835, when a 26-year old naturalist named Charles Darwin pulled into the Galapagos aboard the H.M.S. Beagle, which was charged with surveying many different parts of the world to help the ever-expansive British trade and war effort. While on the Galapagos, Darwin famously examined and studied the island’s finches, and it was there that he formulated his theory of evolution, which fundamentally changed people’s views of animals and, ultimately, of themselves.

Approximately 200 years later, the British Honduras would gain independence from the British Empire. After officially gaining independence, the British Honduras was renamed Belize.

It was called a \"slave factory\"  after the some 30,000 slaves that passed through by the 18th century (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p260.html).

After being owned by the Portuguese and the Dutch, Elmina came under British rule in 1871. Elmina is a significant place in the British Empire mostly because of what it represented to the British. Land on the Gold Coast was so fervently sought after because of its trade opportunities - namely, gold, ivory, and slaves. By the time the British came in possession of Elmina Castle, one of their primary concerns was maintaining superiority to other Empires.

The Chinese Emperor had created the “Canton System” to regulate trade with the west and gave the British East India Company a monopoly on trade, so long as they only conduct trade with China at Canton (Van Dyke 2005: 3). Britain imported several goods into the harbor, such as tea, and acquired mainly fine silks and textiles from China until the early 19th century. In the early 1800s, opium – a drug from India - became one of Britain’s major imports into China (Poon 2008). The Chinese Emperor banned opium and sent Lin Zexu to govern Canton. Lin Zexu, on order of the Emperor, hoped to shut down Britain’s opium trade in Canton. The Chinese governor blockaded Canton’s waterways – effectively choking off Britain’s access to Canton – and seized 20,000 chests of British opium in 1839 (Poon 2008). This event forced a break in Britain’s policy with China because, prior to the seizure at Canton, Britain had focused on maintaining a strong economic presence in China without military intervention. Now, Britain’s informal empire, defined as land conquered by Britain through trade and influence rather than an army, in China needed to be reforged through military force. Britain responded to the seizure with her army and sparked the First Opium War (1839-1842). Britain won the war and captured Canton, freeing the British merchants who had become trapped in the harbor after Lin’s opium confiscation. After the war, Britain strengthened her economic presence in China through a series of treaties, including the Treaty of Nanjing. Through these treaties, Britain obtained the Island of Hong Kong, new ports for trade in China, and acquired “most-favored nation status” with China (Poon 2008). The opium ordeal in Canton, rather than break Britain’s profitable trade system in China, reinforced it. Britain’s response to the Canton seizure and victory in the Opium War opened the door for larger future profits in China than the crown had ever dreamed of.

Based in Baghdad, Faisal understood that his shaky government was dependent on British support, and he therefore signed the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922, which lasted eight years before a revised treaty was signed. This installed British advisers and ministers in various government positions, gave Britain the ultimate say in fiscal matters, and allowed British troops to be stationed in the country. In return, Britain would provide financial, military, and social aid, as well as political support for the monarchy.

The battle itself began because Captain Thomas Best sought to settle in the city of Surat to create a factory for the British East India Company. At the time, the Portuguese had a monopoly on trade with India, and the British were seeking to gain footing in the spice trade. The British ships settled by the nearby village of Suvali, which they mispronounced as \"Swally,\" and were attacked by Portuguese ships. Best quickly ran three of the Portuguese galleons aground, and then began to attack the smaller barques with cannon fire.

With growing anti-slavery unrest in England, slaves in Jamaica became increasingly agitated with their status and took matters into their own hands. In 1831, Samuel Sharpe organized a peaceful strike, which soon turned deadly. Upon retaliation by plantation, rebels burned the crops on Kensington estate in St. James Parish (The Christmas Rebellion) and escalated the non-violent strike into what became the largest slave rebellion in Jamaica.

The Hudson’s Bay Company, operating using a system of trading posts and forts in northern Canada, became one of Britain’s most valuable assets in its trade war with France. Eventually, the Company’s dominance around Hudson Bay established British control over the fur trade. The company’s growing power also contributed to 1713’s Treaty of Utrecht, with which much of New France was ceded to Britain, foreshadowing Britain’s future territorial gains in North America.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sam Gillis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 2pm (Matthew)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/7/2012 23:07:12&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://umanitoba.ca/libraries/units/archives/tribune/photos/HudsonBayCo1.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohewgocj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.253906,59.712097]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kolkata","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Kolkata, or Calcutta, is the capital of West Bengal.

It was occupied by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah in 1756 but it was overtaken by the East India Company the next year. The British began to increase fortifications in the area after dealing with many conflicts with France, which led the Nawab of Bengal to attack. He captured Fort William and brutally killed many British prisoners of war in the Black Hole of Calcutta. A force of British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year and Kolkata was named the capital of British India in 1772. Kolkata was the capital of British india until 1911, when it was changed to New Delhi. The city was the center of an Indian independence movement and in 1947, after India claimed its independence, Kolkata experienced relatively slow economic growth, which has begun to pick up in recent decades.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lotus Cannon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Thursday 5pm (Anouska)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/7/2012 23:12:42&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/HooglyKolkata1945.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohpzc72n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[88.3711199,22.6036115]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brimstone Hill","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;The British explorer Sir Thomas Warner landed on the island of St. Kitts (a small Caribbean island southeast of Puerto Rico) in 1624.

Drake's Bay represents the English and eventual British exploration of the west coast of North America, which cemented later colonial holdings in Pacific Northwest (notably British Columbia and the port of Vancouver). Drake's contributions to this set up a strong tradition of British naval entrepreneurship and strength.

Upon arrival, the Virginians found the French had already constructed Fort Duquesne. This led Washington to ambush the French at Jumonville Glen, where a French diplomat was killed. Retreating from the site of the battle and expecting an attack, Washington hastily and of necessity erected a fort and, uncreatively but with admirable candor, dubbed it Fort Necessity.

It was the French who ultimately annexed them in 1744, creating secret spice plantations in the town of Mahé, which they hoped could compete with the Dutch monopoly. Indeed, in an effort to keep the plantations secret, the French set them on fire in 1778 when a ship flying a British flag appeared in the harbor. Ironically, it was a French ship in disguise.   In 1794 the commander of the colony, Jean-Baptiste Queau de Quincy, surrendered to the British, who cared only about the strategic location and wanted little to do with the settlement itself. The settlement remained neutral for many years (or rather, mercenary), but after significant French infighting and British outmaneuvering, French rule in Mauritius, and subsequently Seychelles, fell. The British were nominal rulers and would send their prisoners there, but the island continued to function as French.

This decision, while it may have seemed reasonable to not drastically change the power dynamic in Jerusalem, lead to increased violence and anti-Zionism in Palestine. al-Husayni was an Arab nationalist and Muslim leader, and his positions on organizations, such as the Supreme Muslim Council, lead to increased violence in the region and the formation of the Palestinian Black Hand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Rafic Melhem&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 3pm (Anouska)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/8/2012 1:53:26&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Samuelarrival.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohfm7y85"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.214634,31.77458]}},{"properties":{"name":"Weihai Garrison","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;The British Empire obtained a lease for the port in March of 1898 after Russia leased Port Arthur from China.

The culture and landscape of this island nation have been indelibly affected by different empires over the course of history, beginning with the Dutch, who gave the island its name. Prior to the Dutch, the island was uninhabited, and Dutch attempts at settling it ultimately failed. In 1715, the French took control of Mauritius and established a colony based on sugar cane production. French corsairs used the island as a base for attacking British ships during the Napoleonic Wars, but the French ended up surrendering the island to the British in 1810. The British continued using the island for sugar cane production, but after the Empire abolished slavery in 1835, they had to find the workforce elsewhere. Most of it came in the form on indentured Indians, but there was also immigration from China, Madagascar, and parts of Africa, so the island's population became incredibly diverse. Mauritius finally gained its independence in 1968. Today, the languages spoken in Mauritius are English, French, and Mauritian Creole, reflecting the two empires that had once ruled it. The predominant religions (together comprising 96% of all religions represented in the republic), on the other hand, are Hinduism, Catholicism, and Islam, showing the different origins of the people of Mauritius. One of the most telling effects of European colonization of the island is the extinction of the curious Dodo bird (pictured), which was numerous when the first settlers arrived, but could not survive the colonists and their imported animals.

Prior to the battle, the French had concocted a desperate scheme to invade England through freeing its forces from Britain’s constricting blockade. Such was a valiant attempt by the French, but instead it failed most spectacularly. Aided by a turbulent storm, a British force of 24 ships of the line – under the direction of Admiral Sir Edward Hawke – relentlessly chased the French fleet into Quiberon Bay on the southern coast of Brittany. In the ensuing onslaught, the British forces essentially decimated their rivals; a more-than-sizeable portion of the French’s 21 ships of the line had been destroyed through wreckage, fire, or capture. As a result of this turning point battle, the French fleet was never able to fully recover its devastating losses for the remainder of the war, and Britain thus solidified a naval supremacy – soon accompanied by land domination – that effectively secured its victory in the Seven Years’ War overall.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Dianna Hu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 5pm (Nick)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/8/2012 3:52:27&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/06/article-1255826-07DC0127000005DC-463_634x328.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohn7n4zq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.0171174,47.6752721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Savannah, GA","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;The city of Savannah, Georgia, is a key historical site in the history of the British Empire. Not only was the city the site of critical historical events like the Siege of Savannah during the Revolutionary War, but Savannah’s early history also represents several key themes of the British colonization of America.   The first theme that Savannah represents is the competition Britain faced with other imperial powers. Originally, the British founded Savannah and the providence of Georgia to create a ‘buffer colony’ in order to protect all territory north of the Savannah River from French and Spanish settlements in the South.   Savannah also represents the Atlantic trade that emerged as a result of the British Empire’s expansion. While deerskins and other goods were exported to Europe from Savannah, British trade also transformed Savannah by shipping African Slaves to the city. These slaves, brought to Savannah in the Atlantic slave trade, were sold and worked in the marshes in Savannah--soon turning them into profitable rice fields.   Later, in 1779, Savannah was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Revolutionary War and a decisive victory for Britain. But Savannah also represented the tension throughout the war of the varied loyalty of American colonists; Britain considered the South a stronghold because of the heavy loyalist presence, and hence developed a Southern strategy that began with conquering Savannah.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Caroline McKay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{section}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wednesday 2pm (Matthew)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;Timestamp:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2/8/2012 4:01:07&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img border=0 class=\"tabIMG\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://edu.glogster.com/media/5/24/43/87/24438779.jpg\" /&gt;","id":"aaw0ohmu1nh0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.0956998,32.0971675]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","description":"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\"l\"&gt;{description}:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Brazil began to trade with Britain, among other foreign allies, in 1808.

Tensions had been building as a large demand for wool to be sent to textile mills in England fueled a growing settler population. Dramatic augmentations in land occupancy in the early 19th century increasingly edged the Aborigines, a hunter-gatherer people, off of their kangaroo and wallaby hunting grounds. The British put forth a Government Notice in 1826 that laid down legal conditions to fight back against the Aborigines, asserting that attackers should be treated openly as enemies.  A series of attacks and retaliations between the Aborigines and the British settlers led to the Cape Grim Massacre in which the Aboriginal hunters were shot and killed, their bodies then thrown from the cliffs.
