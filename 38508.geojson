Velvet painting is technically difficult and requires different skills than ordinary painting. Our pieces range from fine art to \\'Oh my God, what were they thinking?\\' With over 170 painting on display, there is something for everyone.\n\n\"Velveteria takes one through the South Sea islands to a lair of beautiful ladies to the Wall of Fame where the classics of velvet are found. Dogs playing poker, Elvis, Banditos and clowns. Plus, we have rotating shows, like the story of Jesus and Mary on velvet, during April for Easter.
