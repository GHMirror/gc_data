August 3 - 5, 2006\r\nThere website says: It all began in the 19th century when sausage found its way to Sheboygan through German Settlers.  Over the years the ancient Roman tradition of cooking them over an open flame has been kept alive by the people of Sheboygan.  Though no one will ever understand the phrase Ã¢ÂÂBrat FryÃ¢ÂÂ because they are grilled, brats continue to be the focal point of the community.\r\n\r\nThe first festival was held in 1953 in downtown Sheboygan.  Back then it was a common sight to see streets re-named Bratwurst Blvd., and Seemel-Strasse.  Horse drawn wagons were also seen in the annual parade.\r\n\r\nAfter holding it for more than 13 years, the decision was made to cancel it because the crowds had gotten too big for the cityÃ¢ÂÂs downtown to handle.\r\n\r\nIn 1978 the festival was revitalized!  Brat dayÃ¢ÂÂs is the largest fundraiser for the Sheboygan Jaycees.  All proceeds are given back to the community primarily through donations.  Past organizations that have received donations include the Field of Dreams (Sheboygan Recreation Department), Above and Beyond ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Museum, Jaycee Quarryview Park, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Area High School Scholarship Program, the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society.\r\n\r\nThis shows one of the many brat stands setup throughout downtown Sheboygan in the 1950\\'s.  At one time there were over 50 brat stands operated by different organizations and businesses.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6378lxl30tz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.727777,43.75204]}},{"properties":{"name":"Capitol Dome","description":"Posted by Paulirving<img src=\"http://peabod.com/Wisconsin_Capital/images/p1010361.jpg\"><img src=\"http://peabod.com/Wisconsin_Capital/images/p1010362.jpg\">Interior of the Wisconsin state capital building dome<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6378m1gylak"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.384513,43.074742]}},{"properties":{"name":"Corbett Fish House","description":"Posted by Kbeadle<img src=\"http://www.celiacchicks.com/images/Corbett%20exterio.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 5901 Sw Corbett Ave, Portland, ORThe owners are from Green Bay, WI and you can tell by the amount of Packer paraphernalia.
