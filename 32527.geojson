Once in place, they will be connected to a supply of low-voltage direct current produced by solar panels. Over time, electrochemical reactions will draw minerals from the sea to the armatures, creating walls of calcium carbonate, which is what us landlubbers commonly call limestone.  In much the same way that a household sponge absorbs water, the oceans absorb CO2. By removing carbon-containing compounds from the oceans, the mineral accretion process would help reduce the buildup of CO2, which is a greenhouse gas.\n\nA huge limestone dam will surround the city, Hilbertz says, and building components will be grown in the sea. Solar and wind generators will furnish power. So too will a thermal energy conversion system that will extract power from temperature differences among different ocean currents.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the new city\\'s economy would be \"limestone farming.\" The mineral accretion technique that has built reefs in the Caribbean and that could one day build marine cities could also make building components for use on land. Using appropriately shaped wire forms, the minerals deposited from seawater could grow building blocks, wall panels or complete building components just like those that would build a sea-born city, but for use on dry land.\n\nHilbertz envisions these products being lifted directly out of the sea into barges and ships, which could deliver them to seaports around the world. A limestone farm in the Caribbean could efficiently ship the building materials to coastal areas of North and South America, Europe and Africa, to inland North American ports on the St. Lawrence Seaway and Mississippi River systems, to most of Central Europe via the Rhine, Rhone and Danube rivers and to most of the Amazon basin in Brazil. A farm in the South Pacific could service the west coast of North and South America, and booming Pacific Rim countries.\n\nHilbertz also envisions others of his cities becoming centers for an undersea mining industry. The seafloor is believed to be littered with metal- and mineral-rich nodules, from which refiners in a city will produce pure metals. The fact that metals refining is an energy-intensive activity isn\\'t the least bit daunting. He enthusiastically describes a plan in which the sea would \"grow\" limestone conduits that would tap deep, slow-moving ocean currents and guide them through the blades of giant hydroelectric plants.\n\nWhatever Hilbertz\\'s cities manufactured, their occupants would dine on the bounty of the sea. Wild fish would be guided into nets, and domestic fish would be raised in pens, along with cultured abalone, sea urchins, oysters, mussels and other shellfish. Useful seaweeds will be cultured, and more common vegetables would be grown in hydroponic chambers.\n\nThe fact that ocean-grown cities could stand on their own economically and become independent and self-governing entities poses what Hilbertz believes to be one of the biggest barriers to their creation. He says there is no legal precedent regarding national ownership of a newly formed island that is beyond a nation\\'s territorial waters.\n\nHe plans to face this issue head-on with an experiment on Skerki Bank, in the Mediterranean Sea. The bank consists of a few-hundred square yards of knee-deep water between Tunisia and Sicily. It\\'s in international waters, but within the area both Italy and Tunisia claim as an \"Exclusive Economic Zone.\"\n\nHilbertz hopes to start growing an island there before the end of the year. \"We\\'ll establish our presence there and stake a claim, and see what happens. If anyone challenges us, we have lawyers ready to argue our case. We\\'ve had so many legal opinions that we decided just to go ahead and see what happens,\" he says.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eannkj088b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-13.0,33.133333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Big Crazy TreeHouse","description":"Posted by Travalicious<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eannmxgrz1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.630997,45.492901]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boat Shaped House - St. Johns","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Stainless Steel Mystery Dwelling, Near Cathedral Park.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eanntyq8n4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.758108,45.586391]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boeing 727 Conversion Home","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://urbanverb.com\" href=\"http://urbanverb.com\">Jake</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/be0bc57c80781761d5139fd3b13536c3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/444cf8fa7686896b7712660ff965893e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/f3fc06a6549a73fa640b43aa729e6d9e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Mid Stage conversion of a retired plane into an 1100 square foot home.
