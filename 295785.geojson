Occupy Sandy is working hard to expand their capacity and improve their ability to provide much-needed mutual aid to a devastated part of the New Jersey coast. Interested volunteers should contact Dawn, the current on-the-ground point-of-contact, to arrange local housing. \n\nSUPPLIES NEEDED:\n\nWith an eye toward expanding their capacity to deliver aid they've already amassed, they're seeking a BOX TRUCK for transportation and a large temporary STORAGE FACILITY (either on-site or nearby). \n\nThe same supplies needed in most other places are welcome here as well (baby supplies, socks, underwear, water, cleaning supplies, muck-out supplies, and winter clothing), but the capacity is limited for now, so large donations may need to be turned away until more storage becomes available.","hide_on_map":null,"contact info":"Dawn\n(917) 892-1132","link":null,"id":"aa3rnya4xjrn","address":"OFFICE: \n2517 Highway 35 \nBuilding 1, Suite 203\nBelmar, NJ 07719 \n\nCHURCH :\n2901 18th Ave.\nWall, NJ","geo_precision":"unmatched","state":"New Jersey"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/11/10 18:40:01 -0500","original":"11/10/2012 18:40:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/11/10 18:40:00 -0500"},"title":"Gospel Assembly Church","region":null,"type":"Volunteer and Drop-Off","type marker":"large_blue","geo_score":0.0,"description":"Dispatch, Distribution and Donation Collection Relief Site","hide_on_map":null,"contact info":null,"link":null,"id":"aa3rnye400cf","address":"2828 Neptune Avenue","geo_precision":"unmatched","state":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/11/10 18:40:01 -0500","original":"11/10/2012 18:40:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/11/10 18:40:00 -0500"},"title":"7400 Shore Front Parkway","region":"Rockaway","type":"Unknown","type marker":null,"geo_score":0.0,"description":"Operating in the laundry room","hide_on_map":null,"contact info":null,"link":null,"id":"aa3rnydxe938","address":"7400 Shore Front Parkway","geo_precision":"unmatched","state":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/11/10 19:02:01 -0500","original":"11/10/2012 19:02:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/11/10 19:02:00 -0500"},"title":"Library","region":"Far Rockaway","type":"Volunteer and Drop-Off","type marker":"large_blue","geo_score":0.0,"description":"Volunteers will be needed during all or part of that time, particularly in the mornings.
