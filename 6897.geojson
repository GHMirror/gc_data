The Dallas Cowboys, Pittsburgh Steelers, and San Francisco 49ers have all won five Super Bowls. However, all three franchises trail the Packers who have captured an overall twelve league titles (NFL and Super Bowl) in their illustrious history.In this dataset, the first four Super Bowls are not reflected, as the first four Super Bowls were World Championship games, not league titles. Hence they count toward another list dealing with world championships.Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_NFL_Championships#Championships_per_FranchiseAccessed: 9.5.07","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"Longitude0":{"max":-71.26435,"mean":-89.66370275,"variance":240.589547628909,"stdev":15.5109492820043,"min":-122.386256,"median":-86.163319},"Super Bowl":{"max":5.0,"mean":2.4375,"variance":2.12916666666667,"stdev":1.45916642870739,"min":1.0,"median":2.0},"Latitude0":{"max":44.501389,"mean":37.9579563125,"variance":24.6775113322304,"stdev":4.9676464580554,"min":25.957919,"median":39.277969}},"features":[{"properties":{"Team0":"Chicago Bears","Longitude0":-87.616672,"Super Bowl":1.0,"Latitude0":41.862306,"id":"a65n6w93eoni"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.616672,41.862306]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Tampa Bay Buccaneers","Longitude0":-82.50335,"Super Bowl":1.0,"Latitude0":27.975967,"id":"a65n6vyi83l4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.50335,27.975967]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Baltimore Ravens","Longitude0":-76.622767,"Super Bowl":1.0,"Latitude0":39.277969,"id":"a65n6wbbs4na"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.622767,39.277969]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"St Louis Rams","Longitude0":-90.188547,"Super Bowl":1.0,"Latitude0":38.632975,"id":"a65n6w5c7lt1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.188547,38.632975]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Kansas City Chiefs","Longitude0":-94.484039,"Super Bowl":1.0,"Latitude0":39.048914,"id":"a65n6wblzr9z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.484039,39.048914]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Miami Dolphins","Longitude0":-80.238842,"Super Bowl":2.0,"Latitude0":25.957919,"id":"a65n6w9uiyik"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.238842,25.957919]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Denver Broncos","Longitude0":-105.020097,"Super Bowl":2.0,"Latitude0":39.743936,"id":"a65n6w2jsk5f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.020097,39.743936]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Washington Redskins","Longitude0":-76.864517,"Super Bowl":2.0,"Latitude0":38.907697,"id":"a65n6vy0noe4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.864517,38.907697]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"New York Giants","Longitude0":-74.076983,"Super Bowl":2.0,"Latitude0":40.812194,"id":"a65n6w8t8r72"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.076983,40.812194]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Indianapolis Colts","Longitude0":-86.163319,"Super Bowl":2.0,"Latitude0":39.763658,"id":"a65n6warnpal"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.163319,39.763658]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Oakland Raiders","Longitude0":-122.200889,"Super Bowl":3.0,"Latitude0":37.751411,"id":"a65n6w1pac49"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.200889,37.751411]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"New England Patriots","Longitude0":-71.26435,"Super Bowl":3.0,"Latitude0":42.090925,"id":"a65n6w102r0j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.26435,42.090925]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Green Bay Packers","Longitude0":-88.061944,"Super Bowl":3.0,"Latitude0":44.501389,"id":"a65n6w08pi27"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.061944,44.501389]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"San Francisco 49ers","Longitude0":-122.386256,"Super Bowl":5.0,"Latitude0":37.713486,"id":"a65n6w2ygmog"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.386256,37.713486]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Pittsburgh Steelers","Longitude0":-80.015761,"Super Bowl":5.0,"Latitude0":40.446786,"id":"a65n6vwg1b65"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.015761,40.446786]}},{"properties":{"Team0":"Dallas Cowboys","Longitude0":-96.910911,"Super Bowl":5.0,"Latitude0":32.839769,"id":"a65n6w0q9cqi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.910911,32.839769]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_NFL_Championships#Championships_per_Franchise","metadata":null,"contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Wikipedia","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_NFL_Championships#Championships_per_Franchise","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":16,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"and,football,nfl,recreation,sports","published":"2007-09-04T12:00:00Z","id":6897}
