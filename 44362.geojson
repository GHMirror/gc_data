After some debate, we chose the song \"The Stroke,\" by Billy Squier, which my sister Angela had on a compilation tape.\n\nWe all thought that the song was about rowing, and came up with a dance routine where... well... we simulated rowing. It wasn\\'t very sophisticated.\n\nAt any rate, after a few days of practicing in the music room after school, our hopes of shining at the talent show were completely dashed when Sister Donna, our principal, told us that we would not be allowed to use that song, as it was inappropriate.\n\nI was baffled, and embarassed. I don\\'t know whether I was more embarassed to have chosen an inappropriate song or because I could not for the life of me figure out what was so dirty about it. Was rowing dirty? Was the pretend rowing gesture we were doing dirty? \n\nAt any rate our dreams of revealing ourselves as on par with the Solid Gold Dancers evaporated instantly. I ended up reciting a poem instead. Jenny and Cherry may have dropped out altogether. Stuart Ruddy fared well singing a Peace Corps parody song, and Antony Hjscinski astounded us by playing the accordion.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67e19damuls"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.164862,42.495553]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bob Dylan, starting some time in 1988","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/_38137539_bob_dylan_150bbc.jpg\">My Favorite Music for Several Years\n\nI discovered Bob Dylan at about the same time as I discovered the Columbia Record and Tape Club. The two went so well together. Those old albums were cheap to get, from the back of the catalogue. \n\nI listened to only Bob Dylan during several different phases of my life. My passion for Bob only waned some time in my 20s.\n\nI\\'m not sure I can even say for sure why this music meant so much to me. I was unhappy a lot during those high school years, and this music helped.\n\nWhen you\\'re 16, you spend a lot of time thinking about the meaning of things. The opacity of some of Dylan\\'s lyrics was an ideal ground for that yearning to dig for meaning.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67e19kp8kx1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.180656,42.499836]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grease Soundtrack, 1979","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/B000024ABE_03__SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Trying to Seduce the Babysitter\n\nThe oldest son of my mom\\'s best friend used to babysit us sometimes. I think his name was Alan, or maybe Andrew. I had a really big crush on him when I was 6 or 7, so whenever he came over to babysit I forced him to play the \"Grease\" sountrack on the record player and act it out, with me playing Sandra and him playing whatever John Travolta\\'s character\\'s name was.\n\nHe was a good sport.\n\nI had seen Grease on HBO at my grandparents\\' house, so I knew the moves. My favorite character had been Roz, though, not Sandra. I couldn\\'t identify with Sandra\\'s wussiness, but I could get into playing out that finale song (\"You\\'re the one that I want, You\\'re the one I want, I want, ooh, ooh, ooh, honey...\").\n\nMy little brother and sister and I used to play at acting out songs on the record player a lot. My mother was a big fan of novelty music, so she had several great compilations which really lent themselves well to this game.\n\nAlan eventually joined the army and was stationed in Germany. He met a German woman and they got married and had kids. They used to come back to Fort Dodge every couple years. I remember the woman he married didn\\'t talk very much. She always stocked up on blue jeans because apparently they were much more expensive in Germany.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67e19pobnhc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.180656,42.499836]}},{"properties":{"name":"I Want Your Sex, George Micheal, 1987","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/detasseling_gossip.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> The All-Girls\\' Detassling Crew Sing-a-Long Song\nThis was my first paying job. I had volunteered at the animal shelter and the art museum previous summers, but this year I was old enough to join a detassling crew.\n\nI was very excited about this job. I planned to buy myself contact lenses and a bicycle.\n\nI was a late bloomer. At age 15 I was still a child. My favorite passtimes were fishing and rabbit hunting and reading. Ambushing younger cousins in the woods, digging deep holes for tiger traps, building forts... \n\nThe first day I went to the municipal swimming pool parking lot to catch the detassling bus, I was a little nervous. I didn\\'t know anyone there. There were about 20 girls aged 15-17, mostly on the younger side. Everyone seemed to know someone else except for me. \n\nWhen we got to our first field of the day, after having slept a little bit on the bus in transit, we all woke up, ate something from our lunch stashes, and milled around while our crew leader got organized.\n\nWhen we got started working a group of four friends started singing \"I want your Sex,\" and most everyone joined in.\n\nI had never heard the song. It was very bizarre. For a fleeting moment at the beginning, I thought it might be a song the girls had made up themselves. Then everyone started singing it and I knew I had stumbled across something known to the entire world, except for me.\n\nIt kind of reminded me of the \"Two all-beef patties special sauce double cheese pickles onions on a sesame-seed bun\" craze of my grade-school years.\n\nI was shocked by the totally dirty lyrics, and excited. On the all-girls\\' detassling crew we tromped through fields sweating in the sun in our cut-offs and bikini tops, singing dirty songs. Nowhere else in the world could I experience anything like it. And be part of it! \n\nI became friends with two older heavy metal girls who took me under their wing. They brought in their lunch pails oranges into which they had injected peach schnappes with a hypodermic needle. They were the most fascinating women I had ever met in my life.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67e19dizr1b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.076443,42.53841]}},{"properties":{"name":"Industrial Teepee / Tom Waits 1989","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/indtepee.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 330 East Washington Street, Iowa City, IA, 52240\n\n\n\nMy friends Corrine and Tague and I made a road trip down to Iowa City to see a band...can\\'t remember which one. Probably the local band from Cedar Falls whose name I can\\'t remember. \n\nAnyhow, this band from NY called Industrial Teepee opened. Their songs had a lot of lyrics, which is something that I have always liked in a song. You know, lots and lots of words, hardly any repetition, long storied verses...\n\nSo, I went up and talked to the guys in the band when they were finished and then we all had a beer with them (We were 17). Then they invited us to go to a house party with them, which we did.\n\nIt was so exciting being at this house party, which was in a big old house where one of the other bands lived. I\\'d never been at a party like that before. I think it might have been my first grown-up party where I was playing the role of one of the grown ups. I had a beer and the band\\'s lead singer sat with me in a stairway whispering ee cummings poems he had learned by heart into my ear. \n\nI think that\\'s one of the hottest things anyone has ever done to seduce me. It was probably just a regular piece of the young man\\'s repertoire, but...well...good piece.\n\nWe had been talking about books and poems for a couple hours. He went out to the van and brought back a book of Roethke poems, which he gave to me. Men used to always give me books. It\\'s a good thing to give if you want to be remembered. Every time I see that book, I think of this night, even if it\\'s only in passing. \n\nAfter the party, Corrine and Tague and I went back to the motel with the singer and the bass player. They sang Tom Waits songs for a long time, accompanied by acoustic guitars. This is how I discovered Tom Waits. \n\nThen of course came the making out. Poor Tague was left out. He watched an old 30s horror movie on the TV while we smooched. When I told my new friend that I was still a virgin, he said, \"That\\'s great,\" like he was trying to mean it. I don\\'t remember if I also told him I was 17. I think that part of the reason I remained a virgin for so long (I was almost 19 before I got rid of that pesky virginity) was because I kept telling people about it. That and the fact that I have excellent taste in men and am generally attracted to a decent type of fellow.\n\nWhen we got back home, I went to the mall and bought \"Frank\\'s Wild Years\" on cassette. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67e19k3mwy1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.531356,41.65996]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jane's Addiction, Jane Says, 1988","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/f64731ko4a3_3_.jpg\">Hanging Out on the Campus Lawn at Night with a Boom Box\n\"Nothing\\'s Shocking\" was an important record for my generation.

We laughed, but we also loved the way the French youngsters were unashamed to be pretentious.\n\nI remember that in the later part of the night on Oui FM they had a really bizarre radio show co-hosted by a British woman who spoke French and a French guy speaking English, pretending to be American, parodying a brash American DJ style. All shouting and laughter that was too loud. They took calls from teenagers who wanted to talk about their romantic problems or school problems.
