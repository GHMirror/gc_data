Its sign \"Welcome to the City of Maywood Park\" always confused me. I always imagined  the residents to be a typical older person indignant with the way the area has changed. Their city website boasts their Christmas Light and annual Easter celebration. I once heard that my freshman English teacher lived here and perhaps I\\'ll forever think of its residents as caricatures of him. He was an evil Dr. Phil near retirement who despised freshmen and who was rumored to have thrown a stapler at a student once. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xt9fli9ew7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.298316,44.052667]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/696296","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jmarleneh","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jmarleneh","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/696296","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=696296,platial:user=jmarleneh","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47408}
