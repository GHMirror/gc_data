Very well. Virtually all work around me stopped, with people standing everywhere, talking over cube walls like so many gophers popped out of their holes. \n\nMy wife called, asking me to come home (we lived over an hour away) because she didn\\'t want me to die. There is nothing of any headline value or strategic value around, so I felt reasonably safe and preferred to stay where I was rather than risk aeons on the Beltway and Cabin John, er, Veterans Memorial Bridge - which I felt were significantly more likely targets than my humble building. So I continued working. \n\nWe completed a full cycle of testing that day in about 14 hours, which was very impressive as trial tests earlier had taken days to run. Testing the next day ran in about 12 hours, and dropped to 8 by the end of the week. After we got into routine we typically completed the cycle of testing in about 6.5 hours, to everyone\\'s delight. (Not that anyone really cares about how well our testing went. Or how wonderful and indispensable I was to the effort. *toot toot!* *pat pat*)\n\nI finally got to see video of the crashes and collapses on the 11 o\\'clock news. And the follow up reports after the new. And the hollow-eyed comments by Dan Rather and other reports who had been working all day, and were beyond beautifying by their make-up units.\n\nI couldn\\'t help but feel for the workers who had gone in to their jobs, as I had, for a good day\\'s work, but unlike me, never finished. Well, not in the way they would have preferred.

As you come down the river (from the bottom left side of the map) you reach this sharpish left-hand turn in the river. The water speed definitely picks up. The bank on the right grows higher and higher until it\\'s about 30\\' high, with large a large rock formation bursting forth.\n\nThen the river narrows, though it may be high enough that it barely slides over the rocks on both sides. The channel, though, is barely 6\\' wide, with the water, most of the river, gushing through the break in the natural dam. \n\nDrop to your knees, if you didn\\'t before you got to the turn, tighten your grip on your paddle, aim for the middle of the g....\n\nNever mind. You either did, and got through, or didn\\'t, and are now luxurating in the pool below the channel, trying to capture your canoe, life jackets, paddle, pack of snacks, water bottle, bailer, sponge, and canoeing partner. Or, if you were kayaking and didn\\'t make it, others are dragging your unconscious, lifeless, body to the shore to perform CPR in time for you to be able to navigate the trees and brush covering the river about a mile and a half down stream.\n\nBut if you made it through in one piece, and right side up, and afloat, you can eddy out, get back up close to the chute, and mock others as they come through with less style and grace than you were able to manage.\n\nI\\'m sure this race has a rating, probably 3 or 4 or 20 or 30. But really, a single chute where the white water is 10\\' long, what would it do with a rating?\n\nAt least they removed the metal staple that was there to hold a block of stone in place.

His father, who, as most Bretheren of the time, did not support military service, finally relented and let J. F. attend Virginia Military Institute. While there he studied Mathematics under Thomas Jackson. After finishing school he sat for the bar, setting up practice in Tennessee.\n\nWhen the Civil War descended upon the country John Francis returned to Virginia and joined the 33rd Virginia Regimental Infantry, where his men elected him Colonal. Under the leadership of Professor Jackson the men defended the Valley from the Yankee intruders. They also made a desparate rescue to Manassas in the east near the Potomac. John Francis and his men helped the Professor route the Yankees and earn the moniker by which he is best know: \"Stonewall\". \n\nAfter more fighting up and down the Valley, Stonewall Jackson led the men back to Manassas for a second meeting with the Yankees. During this conflict John Francis lost his life. His men returned to the battlefield that night and recovered his body. It was sent home and can be found in the Cedar Grove Cemetery.\n\nJohn Francis Neff was my great-great-great-uncle, and I met on several occassions his nephew, though he was born much to late to have met his uncle.\n\nThis kind of thing has a way of bringing history to life.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfnaiivh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.650007,38.695291]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chincoteague","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.mangoverde.com/birdsound/images/00000002615.jpg\">Well, this marker is in the middle of the pond, but we weren\\'t actualy there.

And on the Potomac. I think Hunting Creek is actually farther north past the country club - the blue line that comes in just south of the Beltway. (That would be I-95 for the uninitiated, foreigners, aliens and others of the non-Capitol variety of huminoid.)\n\nThe bay - the area from the boat landing (the hook just to the south) and the spit of green there by the bridge (well, it kinda HAS to be a bridge, now doesn\\'t it?) is fairly shallow and full of seaweed. You can often find Great Blue Heron wading most of the way across this area, though there seems to be a channel from the Potomac  up the creek. There are also Osprey here, and I once saw an Osprey and GBHeron arguing over a fish the GBHeron had. It won.\n\nA geographical curiosity, a bit of useless trivia: You can see on the map above the point, very near the Virginia shore, where a line comes in from the northeast and joins a line coming in from the north, and that junction is just below the bridge? That is the only point on the beltway that is inside DC\\'s boundaries. But, felons, speeders and others involved in illegal pursuits, don\\'t let that fool you: DC has confired on MD the rights to police that section of DC, so you cannot claim that the DC section is out of the jurisdiction of the MD cop who is about to nail your sorry butt to his ticket pad. \n\nAnd just in case you are running from the VA cops, MD &amp; VA have reciprocity agreements on the Wilson Bridge (that\\'s the one on the map above that involves all three jurisdictions), so they can chase you all the way across the bridge and catch you, and you then belong to them. And if you get past them, the MD cops will be waiting for you, and then you belong to them. And when they are done with you they will transfer you back to VA so the VA courts get their turn.\n\nWhew! I sound like I\\'ve been there. Haven\\'t, but read the Washington Post, even though that info is not on the funny pages.\n\nBut back to birding. This is a great place to picnic with the family and pets, and then they can play and read while you bird, and everyone\\'s happy for a change.\n\nThis is also where The Osprey\\'s Nest (DC area birding bulletin board, pre-internet days) would get together annually to meet and see the faces on the other side of the handles in the forum.\n\nAnd before I\\'m done, on down the road you stay by the river down at least until Mount Vernon. There are, or were, and since the population is growing I assume are more than before, Bald Eagles.

And not \"wetlands\" as under the Bush revised definition, but \"wetlands\" as in \"land wet from being under water\".\n\nBut I wax editorial.\n\nAt the point where the trail nears the edge of the swamp a boardwalk begins. It wanders out through the swamp, splitting and reconnecting, going around a beaver\\'s dam, reaching a lookout tower, and splitting again into two boardwalks. \n\nThese two boardwalks shortly reach the edge of the swamp and again turn into trails that circle east and north back around the swamp, rejoining the original trail about 50 yards before the boardwalk began. Along this circling back part of the trail I was fortunate enough to look up one spring and see a Scarlet Tananger. Now THAT\\'S red!\n\nAnother time I was out on the trail of some rails that had been reported on the Voice of the Naturalist, the DC area\\'s birding hotline &amp; weekly bird report sponsored by the Audubon Naturalist Society, the \"other\" Audubon Society. I was on the spur southwest of the lookout tower clicking in the side of my cheek to call the stupid thing in. (If it was intelligent it would have given us all a 2 minute look, satisfied our curiosities, and been on its way, but NOOOOO, it had to play hard-to-get, showing us a flirtacious eye here, a bit of leg there, some neck from behind that bush, and, well, you get the picture.) The boardwalk was crowded - and by that I mean someone every 10 or 15 yards or so - with people looking for the rail or out for an afternoon stroll. \n\nThere was one intense young (college age) guy bound and determined to add that rail to his list. He came bustling over asking where the rail was. I pointed to an clump of bushes and reeds about 20 yards away. He said no, the rail was right here by the boardwalk. I said no, it was over there and wouldn\\'t come any closer in the 20 minutes I had been there calling it in. He said he had heard it and began furiously looking behind every bush bordering that stretch of boardwalk. (Well, it was water so he couldn\\'t actually get behind the bushes, just trying different angles to see behind them.) Since he was busy, and knew better than I, I went back to watching the rail, or glimpses of the rail, 30 yards away. It started coming closer so I began clicking again, whereupon Mr. Intensity gave me a startled look, stopped looking behind bushes and hurried away. RISLAD! (There was no floor, so that means \"Roll In the Swamp Laughing And Drown!) \n\nIt was worth the trip just for his expression and reaction.\n\nAnd I did get a good look at the stupid thing.\n\nBirdlist: American Bittern (3\\' from the boardwalk!), American Coot, American Crow, American Goldfinch, Barn Swallow, Belted Kingfisher, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Brown Creeper, Canada Goose, Carolina Chickadee, Carolina Wren, Chimney Swift, Common Moorhen, Common Yellowthroat, Downy Woodpecker, Eastern Bluebird, Eastern Kingbird, Fish Crow, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Grey Catbird, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Green Heron, Hairy Woodpecker, Hooded Warbler, King Rail Mallard, Northern Cardinal, Northern Flicker, Pied-billed Grebe, Purple Martin, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Red-eyed Vireo, Red-headed Woodpecker, Red-shouldered Hawk, Red-tailed Hawk, Red-winged Blackbird, Ring-necked Duck, Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Scarlet Tanager, Song Sparrow, Sora, Spotted Sandpiper, Striated heron, Swamp Sparrow, Tree Swallow, Tufted Titmouse, White-breasted Nuthatch, White-throated Sparrow, Winter Wren, Wood Duck, Wood Thrush, Yellow-rumped Warbler\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfo3n8zo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.098532,38.757999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Indianapolis","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://199.8.200.90/www/ihb/govportraits/whitcombe.gif\">Edger D.

Zwingli went on to preach another day, and Adam went on to settle in this \"Aa\" town somewhere east of Lichenstein. Which isn\\'t saying much, because most of Switzerland is east of Lichenstein, but we went through Lichenstein from Germany on our way to Nafhaus. \n\nNo Neffs live there any more - they vacated the premises about 200 years ago because at some point they hooked up with the Radical Reformation (read Anabaptists here), and the normal reformers took a page from their own history and said \"we\\'ll wipe these heretics out if it\\'s the last thing we\\'ll do\", and instituted their own brand of religious persecution. (sigh) So, the Neff family became another unit in the Anabaptist migration through German to Philadelphia, PA, and on to Lancaster, PA, along the valley to Hagerstown and Frederick, MD, across the Potomac and up the Shenandoah Valley of VA. \n\nNot that all Anabaptists did that, but enough that they became known as Pennsylvania Dutch, and brought along some of their various religions: Mennonite (which gave rise to Amish), Dunkard (aka Brethern), and Luthern (even though they also joined in waging persecution back in \nGermany).\n\nBut more on Anabaptist history in the wiki at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptist\n\nNafhaus is a combined barn and house, with the heat from farm animals\\' bodies keeping the place warm, or at least warmer, during cold weather.\n\nIt was spring when we were there, and the kitchen garden was gorgeous - a number of raised beds, all well maintained as one would expect of the Swiss or Germans of the region.

Because \"down the River\" is North, to where the North Fork of the Shenandoah meets the South Fork of the Shenandoah just outside Front Royal, which is about 35 miles north, and from there the mighty Shenandoah continues north to Harpers Ferry where it joins the Potomac. So \"up\" is \"south\" and \"down\" is \"north\". And when one drives from DC to the Shenandoah Valley, one is truely going up - from an elevation of sea level on the Potomac to about 975\\' above sea level.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfwlyxce"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.684254,38.660448]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sherwood Forest","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://moblog.co.uk/blogs/1703/moblog_a89c981dcdf97.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/81593455@N00/250739866/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/109/250739866_315236c68c_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/81593455@N00/250739191/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/98/250739191_7edb62b565_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The place of legend.

If you\\'ve ever read or seen any of the Cadfael stories, this is the place. Um, the movies don\\'t match the actual church where Cadfael would have been, but it would have been difficult to film here because of the modern setting. \n\nJust south of the bridge and church was a Safeway where we got pita, mayo, sprouts and cheese, and had one of the best meals in England. It was just perfect: exactly what we were hungry for. \n\nShrewsbury capitalizes on the Brother Cadfael stories, and its medieval town, and is a great little walking town. \n\nGeoff &amp; I did email back to the States from a cyber cafe here.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfh2phcm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.7495,52.704683]}},{"properties":{"name":"Snake River/Hell's Canyon","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://pie.midco.net/dougback/miscphotos/AZ2005/cactus%20wren3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Took a jet boat ride up the Snake. An all day trip. We left quite early in the morning - I don\\'t remember how early, but it was cold - from about 20 miles up river from Lewiston/Clarkston. The road here is only on the Washington/Oregon side of the river, so I guess more correctly we put in about 20 miles up river from Clarkston.\n\nMy sons were big into fishing at the time, so the purpose of the trip was to catch Sturgeon (it was either that or Bigfoot): they\\'re protected, but not endangered, so they are fair game. But there are lots of rules: \n- You have to have a guide (the owner of the boat) to fish for them. \n- The license is a one-day license, or was it two weeks?\n- You cannot use barbed hooks, only plain hooks.\n- You cannot take them out of the water, so no \"poses\".\n- Obviously it is catch and release.\n\nIt is a surprisingly difficult task to catch these beasts. They can run to pretty good size. One son caught one about 3\\', the other caught 2 about 3\\' - 4\\', and I caught one about 7\\'4\". The captain took us to places that ran 50\\' deep or more, because they prefer cold water, and they\\'re bottom feeders. After about 45 minutes of the fish running and diving, and I\\'d crank it close, then it would run and dive again, repeat about 10 times, the fish was tired and we could \"herd\" it along toward the shore. The captain/guide hopped in (about knee deep) to remove the hook, and stretched a light string the length of the beast. I have that as \"my fish\". And no, it\\'s not mounted.\n\nBut you really don\\'t care about that. And the \"catching\" took only about 90 minutes, though the \"waiting\" took most of the day.\n\nThe day was beautiful, once the sun showed for a while. The canyon is pretty stark: sandstone (probably, I\\'m no geologist), with some sandy areas and desert scrub. Being on the water we drank quite a bit. (Water is our poison of choice, though we had sandwiches, juices, and various snacks.)\n\nAnd the birds were everywhere! Mostly not visible, but singing like you wouldn\\'t believe.\n\nThere was one distinctive songster. I never saw it, but caught its song on video. (I ran video, the mic picked up the song. And quite nicely, I might add.) Later I was listening to the Peterson recordings and heard it. Went back to the video and verified the song. Schweet!\n\nSo, this trip\\'s list: Cactus Wren.\n\nPretty pathetic, isn\\'t it?\n\nBut nothing was flying, and it\\'s hard to flush birds from the middle of the river. And the Cactus Wren was a lifer.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urficvc19"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.931953,46.154627]}},{"properties":{"name":"Somerset Park","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.naturesound.com/birds/hires/yellwrb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is just a little community park off River Road, accessable also from Willard Avenue. Trees, stream, wild undergrowth, bamboo. And, of course, birds. But the main thing is that it was a place where I could get away from work for a lunch hour and rejuvenate my feeble mental circuits.\n\nA brief interlude. The bamboo arrived in this local when one of the local families went to Florida on vacation back in the 50\\'s. One of the kids got a little pot of bamboo. They brought it back and it hung around for a while, barely surviving. Finally mom threw the pot out, and that was that. \n\nWell, almost. The pot of bamboo decided that it wasn\\'t quite dead, put down roots, and took off, filling the stream banks with shoots. And thus was the story as told to me by the son of the bamboo importer.\n\nOK, enough local lore.\n\nOne is struck by the levelness of the park, the unlikely smoothness of the grade as one goes along the stream. The reason is that this was once a part of some local rail line. There is a marker in the park with more information if you are really interested. \n\nBut what we\\'re really interested in is - birds. So here\\'s my birdlist: American Crow, American Goldfinch, American Redstart, American Robin, Blackpoll Warbler, Blue Jay, Carolina Chickadee, Carolina Wren, Cedar waxwing, Chimney Swift, Common Grackle, Cooper\\'s Hawk, Dark-eyed Junco, Downy Woodpecker, Eastern Kingbird, Eastern Wood-Peewee, European Starling, Gray Catbird, Hairy Woodpecker, House Finch, House Sparrow, House Wren, Killdeer, Magnolia Warbler, Mallard, Mourning Dove, Northern Cardinal, Northern Flicker, Northern Mockingbird, Northern Parula, Pileated Woodpecker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Red-winged Blackbird, Ring-billed Gull, Rock Dove, Song Sparrow, Tufted Titmouse, Veery, White-breasted Nuthatch, White-throated Sparrow, Yellow Warbler, Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, Yellow-rumped Warbler\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfw79frk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.096386,38.962479]}},{"properties":{"name":"Somewhere south of the James River","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.ksbirds.org/gallery/Snowy%20Owl%20in%20Flight2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> I don\\'t remember just where - I\\'d have to check my records for a more accurate place, but it was a on the edges of an industrial area.

But it wasn\\'t concrete because it moved, watching us, looking around, enjoying the sun. \n\nMaybe it was getting a tan.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfwj5n3g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.915627,37.168251]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Marks Square, Venice","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://paul.ilcs.hokudai.ac.jp/Venice%20gondolas%20background.JPG\">Well, that is about where it is supposed to be, anyway.

Gondolas all moored to the docks. Or quays. Or whatever they are in Venezia.\n\nBirding was interesting here: can you say \"Rock Dove\"? Ten thousand times? Of course that USED to be one of the attractions - buying pigeon feed from vendors and holding it in your hands while the urban chickens alit all over you. It is surprising how much those beasties weigh! Then you throw the seed &amp; they all scatter. Ever seen \"Home Alone 2\"? Kinda like that.\n\nWe didn\\'t have too long there, unfortunately, so we only walked the square, followed in James Bond\\'s path where he drove the gondola up the steps and through the square. Kind of weird, in a way.\n\nBut Dad had been there in 1953, so it was interesting seeing some of the things that he had painted from then.\n\nBirdlist: Rock Dove\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfpnibf9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.34314,45.431226]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stonehenge","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.stonehenge.org.uk/\">What can I say?

Parking and climbing over the stairs takes one to the beach, or, one could stay on the stairs and have a better view out to sea. One year we saw porpose swimming south.\n\nAnother time I crossed the road (the parking lot is on the east side of the road) and waded out into the marshy area of Tom\\'s Cove. The tide was out so I moved from hummock to hummock staying faily dry. But being eaten alive by no-see-ums. However, I had great views of Black Skimmers slurping across the cove. \n\nI also chased several rails around, but could not make a positive identification on them. Sneaky little twerps! I understand why shotguns were popular with birders back at the turn of the previous century.\n\nI also saw Brown Pelican here and/or looking out to sea.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76urfusfa94"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.343895,37.887115]}},{"properties":{"name":"Weekend Canoe Trip - South Fork of the Shenandoah","description":"Posted by WoodduckWoodduck did a number of weekend canoe trips with the college age members of his church.

They circled and circled, with one flapping to catch up, and cutting the circle short, until he (I assume it was a HE defending his territory from some interloper trying to cut in on his nesting area and mate) was so close the other broke out of the circle and headed WSW with all available speed.
