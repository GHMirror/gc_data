This is the biggest race in the nation for amateurs. Every pro has raced this race. Every amateur dream about race. This race only happens once a year and you have to race all over to quality for this race. Every qualifier race has 40 riders. They take the top 7 to move on to the next qualifier that has 40 people in it. If you manage to make it to the race it says a lot. Think of this race like arena football or minor league baseball. I’ve been to this race twice. The first time I wreck both on both my heat races and got 23rd out of 40 racers. The second time I had an overall of 17th overall. I had to race all over the East side of America over 8 mouth period just to qualify to race this race. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740uo4v6iiv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.77252,36.03133]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meadow Creek","description":"Posted by Czuk1431 Taylor chapel rd Crossville, Bike Concrete gate, Dubbed the fastest track around-groomed with semi truck loads of sawdust and water, natural uphill and down hill grade<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740unz0mtdd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.024883,36.025574]}},{"properties":{"name":"Monroe","description":"Posted by Cat4larry<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Monroe, GA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740uo8awut9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.71335,33.79544]}},{"properties":{"name":"Muddy Creek","description":"Posted by CzukThis track is named Muddy Creek.
