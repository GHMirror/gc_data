My son was born here in Salt Lake City.  Playing kick the can, jump rope, lighting fire crackers, flying kites.  Laying on freshly mowed grass.  Swimming.  That green strip of trees you see on the map shows the Millcreek River that ran behind my house.  My brothers and sisters and I spent countless hours in the gully fishing with safety pins and cheese, building forts and sleeping in them with a b.b. gun \"in case of robbers,\" building dams and swinging on a rope swing over the river.  Swimming in our pool.  You can see my high school at the bottom center of the photo, and my junior high to the left of it with the grassy track.  The best neighborhood in the world.   People who cared.  My father died when I was six and this was a good place to be.   Graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in English with an emphasis in Creative Writing.  My poetry teacher, poet laureate Mark Strand told my a poem I had written sounded like a Hallmark Card.

All by myself, which wasn\\'t too frightening at all since I speak French.  Stayed at the most wonderful hostel just a stone\\'s throw from Notre Dame Cathedral.  You can see on the map that I just had to cross a bridge to get to the island, Isle de la Cite where Notre Dame stands.  L\\'Orangerie, the Louvre (too big to see in such a short time.  Augh!), buying scarves at Sur un Air d\\'Opera on 35, avenue de l\\'Opera, going to a Pat Metheny concert and meeting he and Lyle Mays afterwards.  Wrote the forward to a book while there.  Took the train out to the Chateau de Versailles.  Be warned, carry your own water and hope you have a big bladder.  Seeing the Eiffel Tower from Plaza Trocadero across the Seine.  Went to Paris again in 2005.  Stayed at a hotel that looked out onto the Eiffel Tower, which was really something to see from my window at night.   Le Notre pastry shop on rue Cler.  The Costa Rica is the best pastry I\\'ve ever had.
