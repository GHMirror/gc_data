The bar serves up clever drinks like the Prell, made with Midori, pineapple and vodka, and the Platinum Blonde, which has vodka, Malibu rum and pineapple. The vintage blow-dryers are great to sit under while gossiping over cosmos in the early evening. But if you stay late enough on Thursdays, you\\'re likely spot indie hot shots like Har Mar Superstar, Nick Zinner from The Yeah Yeah Yeahs or Carlos D. from Interpol manning the turntables.

The \"Twin Peaks\" feeling carries over to the drink menu, which includes selections like the minty Girl Scout cookie, the flaming toasted marshmallow and the mighty Sasquatch (served in a very tall glass, of course). The kitschy cool vibe is exceeded only by the resident DJs, who add to the atmosphere by spinning unpredictable sequences of vintage vinyl selections. Doors open at 5pm on Mondays for Karaoke and on Tuesdays, kitsch-loving girls crowd out the indie-rock boys for Girls\\' Night Out and  pink drinks; Wednesdays belong to London Calling with DJ Lee on decks spinning punk, \\'80s, glam, mod, freak beat, goth, Brit pop and modern garage; Hee Haw Hell takes over on Thursdays cheap brews ( Pabst Blue Ribbons, to be exact) and sleazy rockabilly, punk and garage music; and on Sundays \"Spencer the Movie Guy\" shows wacky 16mm and 8mm archived films. \n\nTip: Drinks are  off from 5pm to 8pm daily.

It\\'s more about laid-back conversation than attempted hookups. The dimly lit, tan-and-dark-brown decor is stylish yet simple: Cushy booths, benches and oversized ottomans surround a rectangular bar that serves as a centerpiece to the cozy one-room interior. The regulars, often clad in retro rock T-shirts and leather jackets, seem more interested in the eclectic jukebox (it has everything from A Tribe Called Quest to Johnny Cash) and the sexy, stiff-pouring bartenders than making new friends or finding new lovers. And in Hollywood, that\\'s a rare thing indeed. On weekends, expect long lines out the door.\n\nTip: It\\'s the perfect pre-party place to grab a quick drink and bite before attending a concert at the Palladium across the street.
