Eighth St. Holland, MI 49424Traditional German specialities in a beautiful setting. \n\nThe Alpenrose is not just a restaurant. It\\'s an idea: to bring an authentic taste of the Alps to downtown Holland. To the average passerby, \"the Alps\" probably sparks visions of lederhosen and oompah bands, but the famed European mountain range actually carves through countries as diverse as Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland--a cornucopia of cultures and cuisines which can all claim the title \"Alpen.\"\n\nYears before our 1991 opening, many of us who were involved in developing this idea called Alpenrose, began cultivating an ever-deepening affinity for the people and places of the region. We hope that our on-going love affair is reflected, not only in the food we prepare and the service we deliver, but throughout the Alpenrose facility itself. \n\nEntering the Alpenrose, it\\'s hard to image that this building once housed a run-of-the-mill discount store. The Alpenrose is wall-to-wall wood, even support columns and ceiling rafters display exquisite wooden carvings of the Alpenrose--a rhododendron type flower found throughout the Alps.\n\nOur dream of bringing Alpen charm to West Michigan is reflected in our multiple dining rooms as well. From our family-oriented Kitzbuhel ski lodge to the classical, fine-dining elegance of our Salzburg room to the tasteful banquets available in the Garmisch room,  Alpenrose is a magnificent microcosm of the many dining experiences available in the Alpen region.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a638t7akzs0l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.106995,42.790166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amway Grand Plaza Hotel","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://www.amwaygrand.com/images/small/accomidations_03.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 187 Monroe Ave. NW Grand Rapids, MI 49503The Amway Grand Plaza, where every stay is marked by a memorable moment.

In 1994, feeling there was both a need and an opportunity to enhance their relationship with the Holland community, Hope College began working on plans for a hotel and conference center. These plans, soon fueled by a generous combined corporate/family donation to the \"Hope in the Future\" campaign from Haworth Inc. and the Haworth Family, began to take shape as the Haworth Inn and Conference Center at Hope College.\n\nOpening its doors to business on January 13, 1997, the Haworth Inn and Conference Center has fifty guest rooms and twelve conference rooms covering more than 10,000 square feet. Groups up to 350 can be accommodated in the conference rooms, while the hotel can house up to 172 people.\n\nSince its opening, the Haworth Inn and Conference Center has attracted state and regional associations, and has hosted everything from week long business conferences to a luncheon for Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, Hope College Alumni gatherings, Tulip Time visitors, family reunions and more.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a638t7m6ztvm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.104261,42.789098]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel St. Regis","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:44mXoyulPVph1M:www.find-your-hotel.com/hotel-photos/detroit/hotel-st-regis-detroit-picture.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 3071 W Grand Blvd, Detroit, MI Hotel St. Regis offers deluxe accommodation in close proximity to cultural, educational, entertainment and sporting events.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a638t7c9l86a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.074825,42.369952]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Express Ferry","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://www.margiejcharters.com/lake_express2.jpg\">1920 Lakeshore Dr. Muskegon, MI 49441Ferry service (car and passenger) between Milwaukee, WI and Muskegon, WI<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a638t7lxdyxf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.291149,43.216968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Forest Book Store","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/105357811_3334e9df89_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 680 North Western Ave. Lake Forest, IL 60045.

The Grille on Laurel excels with prime aged steaks and chops served with first-rate sides of grilled veggies, baked white or sweet potato, risotto or mac \\'n\\' cheese. Other tasty entrees include baby back ribs, grilled half chicken, sautéed red snapper and grilled grouper. Desserts are prepared in-house: toasted almond cheesecake and black and white chocolate cake will cure most anything. If not, there are 42 wines by the glass and weekend live entertainment to finish the job. \n\n-- Jacky Runice AOL City Guide <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a638t7hu938y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.842739,42.25905]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Weathervane Inn","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://www.theweathervaneinn.net/images/intro.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 4527 Dowling St. Montague, MI 49437White Lake\\'s only luxury waterfront accommodation.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a638t7hbcfd7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.354086,43.415177]}},{"properties":{"name":"Till Midnight Restaurant","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://www.tillmidnight.biz/images/banquet.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 171 East 24th st., Holland, MI 49423Upscale, funky, great food.
