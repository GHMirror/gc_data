We are more than a fine arts school, more than a gallery, more than a neighborhood art fair, and more than a space where other arts organizations meet or collaborate.\r\rSimply stated, the League is all of these things!\r\rThe League is a non-accredited school where every student has the opportunity to study with regionally and nationally recognized working artists in a wide selection of media. There is no set curriculum, and though students have the freedom to register on a monthly basis, they can have continuity in learning by taking ongoing classes, workshops, lectures and other programs often expand their art appetites by offering classes in specialized areas. In all studio classes, instructors have the latitude to facilitate individualized learning in a style that fits their personal philosophy and integrates demonstrations, study of master artists and critique.\r\rBeyond opportunities to make art, students gain experience in marketing and selling their work in the Summer Art Market, the League galleries, and in our annual fundraising auction, Art &amp; Soul. Outreach into diverse communities is central to the League\\'s mission and realized through partnerships with performing arts groups, public schools, museums and other art cent<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wxrkd8k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.98379,39.719459]}},{"properties":{"name":"Art-Nic Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 3995 South Broadway, Englewood, CO, United StatesEnglewoods newest art gallery!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wjxwlur"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.987823,39.644184]}},{"properties":{"name":"Artist Studio","description":"Posted by Baobot2295 Forest Ave., Boulder, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wjoz144"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.267094,40.032396]}},{"properties":{"name":"Artists on Santa Fe Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 747 Santa Fe Drive, Denver, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wstmsst"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.99861,39.728066]}},{"properties":{"name":"Artists' Gallery of Steamboat","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 1009 Lincoln Ave., Steamboat Springs, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wt8g0m8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.836961,40.487389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Artrain USA","description":"Posted by BaobotPearl street and 30th street, Boulder, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wygt3t3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2536,40.02337]}},{"properties":{"name":"Arts on Seventh","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 220 E. 7th Ave., Denver, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wp7wrx5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.984545,39.727278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Artwork Network Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 870 Santa Fe Drive, Denver, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wjef42r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.998623,39.730004]}},{"properties":{"name":"Artyard Sculpture Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1251 S.

Seawell. Finding himself at 14th and Curtis streets in downtown Denver one day, looking at the old Auditorium Theatre and the surrounding four blocks, Seawell had an idea for a first-class arts complex.\r\rGround was broken in December 1974. By 1978 the 2,700-seat Boettcher Concert Hall â the nation\\'s first in-the-round concert hall â was completed, along with an eight-story, 1,700-space parking garage. By 1979 the Auditorium Theatre had been renovated, two cabaret spaces had been added and the Helen G. Bonfils Theatre Complex opened with its four theatres: The Stage, Space, Source (now Jones) and Ricketson. The 2,830-seat Temple Hoyne Buell Theatre was completed in 1991 and the Donald R. Seawell Grand Ballroom was added in 1998.\r\rThe DCPA is currently the largest tenant of the Arts Complex and encompasses Denver Center Theatre Company, Denver Center Attractions, the Education Department, Denver Center Media and the National Center for Voice &amp; Speech.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.denvercenter.org%5C'\">www.denvercenter.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wnqekrq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.998304,39.744285]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boettcher Mansion","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 900 Colorow Road, Golden, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wz2pwwy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.246516,39.72956]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bond Park","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> E Riverside Dr, Estes Park, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wrocggx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.5216,40.37504]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bongo Billy's Cafe","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 713 S.

Opened in 1906 as Curran Opera House by wealthy billboard sign owner James Curran, the venue featured opera, musical productions and silent movies. In 1927 the first talkie, \"The Jazz Singer\", was presented by Warner Brothers. With the advent of the motion picture, all live performances ceased as the theater became a movie house from 1927 to 1978. During the Depression, the theater kept going with double features and \"Country Store Nights\", when sacks of groceries were given away to those in the lucky numbered seats.\r\rThe building as it stands today was designed by Robert Boller of Kansas City and had it\\'s Opening Night on January 9, 1936. The construction included an expansion of the Opera House and was finished in modernistic lines. The theater facade was decorated in the art deco style popular at that time, with Terra Cotta, colored glass and black glass tiles. The interior was painted with two twenty-five foot murals on either side in green and blue hues and a western themed mural on the ceiling in shades of orange. Before the opening a contest was held through the local newspaper to name the theater. The winning name was \"The Boulder\", with the entrant receiving a one year pass to the theater.\r\rIn 1981, the theater was once again renovated, this time into a state-of-the-art concert hall by Mountain Productions. It featured such diverse acts as Bonnie Raitt, the Plasmatics, Jeff Lorber and Timothy Leary. Mountain Productions operated the theater for 15 months, but the rigid movie house style seating restricted a diversity of activity and the theater was forced to close. The community rallied to reopen the theater, and in 1988 it was transformed into a multi-use hall with cabaret style seating. Care was given to preserve the art deco ornamentation, including the hand-painted murals and fresco ceiling.\r\rNew Hope Communications, purchased the theater in 1995, with plans to operate it primarily as an entertainment venue, while also bringing in non-musical and community events. Recent renovations have expanded the Boulder Theater\\'s capabilities as a multi-use facility. It has featured top acts such as Tori Amos, Blues Traveler, Branford Marsalis and Johnny Cash, some of which have performed on E-Town, the nationally syndicated radio show that makes it\\'s home at the theater. The versatility of the Boulder Theater makes it perfect for events ranging from meetings and conferences to live theater, private parties and concerts. Classic in design, with prime sound and an impressive tradition of the best in entertainment, the Historic Boulder Theater unites the past with the future in one exceptional space. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.bouldertheater.com%5C'\">www.bouldertheater.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wqeh45b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.277478,40.018798]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boulder Unitarian Universalist Church","description":"Posted by Baobot5001 Pennsylvania Avenue, Boulder, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wt4mfks"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.232424,40.006527]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boulder's Central Park - Corner Broadway &amp; Canyon","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Broadway at Canyon, Boulder, CO, United States3rd Anti-DrugWar Candlelight Vigil - To honor the fallen in America\\'s longest running war, the War on Some Drugs<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wm8wq1s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.27926,40.01582]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boulder's Dinner Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_3471.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 5501 Arapahoe Ave., Boulder, CO, United StatesSince 1977, Boulder\\'s Dinner Theatre has been committed to providing live, Broadway-quality entertainment with fine dining to create a unique experience for groups, families and discerning theatre-goers.

I was in town to visit some friends and interview for my current job at The Post. \r\rThe trip, for me, was also a fact-finding mission. In just a few short days, I had to take the temperature of Denver\\'s dining scene and decide whether to change everything about my life to move here and cover it. \r\rSo friends and potential bosses took me to a marathon succession of meals at some of the so-called finest restaurants in town, ostensibly to show me what was happening in Denver. \r\rAnd while I was charmed and impressed with the lamb roulades and three-way tomato appetizers and elk medallions with six dipping sauces, I felt, for most of that trip, like I could have been anywhere. \r\rI\\'d been shown plenty of culinary talent, but I was missing Denver. \r\rAt least, I was missing the Denver I\\'d left almost 20 years before. \r\rThat is, until I had lunch at the Brewery Bar II. \r\rEven though the Brewery Bar II existed when I was growing up a couple of neighborhoods away, I had never eaten there. \r\rBut as soon as I walked in I knew the place inside and out. Part sports bar, part Mexican restaurant, all familiar. \r\rChips and salsa on every table. Pitchers, not just glasses, of margaritas. TV talking heads speculating (loudly) about the Broncos\\' upcoming preseason. Barflies, office workers, construction crews, hipsters, and back in the then-nonsmoking room, kids. Sit-wherever-you-like waitresses in sweatshirts and sneakers who engage you with probers like \"hot or mild?\" and \"salt or no salt?\" A menu offering nothing over 0. Walls oozing Denver\\'s unique brand of wholesome West-Southwestern seediness. \r\rHere was the Denver I remembered, the one I\\'d never been able to explain, let alone find replicated, anywhere on the East Coast. \r\rSo it was at the Brewery Bar II (after a half-pitcher of margaritas and a combo platter No. 1) that I decided to make Denver, again, my home. Not because of the food, but because of the soul. \r\rThat combo platter No. 1 hasn\\'t changed in the dozen or so times I\\'ve been back to Brewery Bar II since. It is a king-sized feast. The star is a large, crispy, smoky, decadent cheese-filled chile relleno; the sidekick is an even bigger burrito (chicken, bean, ground beef, or ground beef and bean), stuffed into a soft flour tortilla. Your choice of smother: red or green chile. \r\rRecommendation: Go with the chicken in the burrito, and take the soft, smoky, splendid green chile smother. At the \"hot-or-mild\" bridge, ask for half-and-half. \r\rElegant food? No. Refined? Nope. Best in town? No way. But the combo No. 1, like all the food at Brewery Bar, is a fine example of solid, everyday neighborhood cooking. And it\\'ll fill you up for the rest of the night. \r\rWhen the No. 1 is too ambitious, I go for the No. 4: Chile relleno, Spanish rice, beans, and two tortillas. It\\'s a little less challenging in its size but plenty satisfying. \r\rThe Mexican hamburger, a dish I\\'m always game to try even though it\\'s usually awful, was nicely if not perfectly cooked, drowning as it was in its own chile bath. \r\rThe best time to enjoy Brewery Bar II\\'s smothered cheese and onion enchiladas is midday on a Saturday, with a margarita that you know will keep you from accomplishing much for the rest of the day but who cares? Ask them to throw a fried egg on your enchiladas for an extra buck, over easy. Let the yolk run into your chile. Perfect. \r\rRequiring its own category of guilty pleasure gross-good are Brewery Bar II\\'s miniature cheese and onion rellenos with chile on the side. These little deep-fried nuggets of cheese- filled wonton are appalling in concept and in execution. They\\'re also absolutely irresistible. \r\rChips-and-salsa are the bread and butter of Mexican restaurants, and I wish Brewery Bar II would up the ante on their lackluster salsa. I also wish they served better chips. Same goes for the guacamole. \r\rBack to those margaritas. Wherever you order a pitcher of margaritas, there\\'s always a gamble involved. As a rule, the larger the quantity of cocktail your bartender\\'s mixing, the less precision he or she likely uses in the measuring the ingredients. And while most of the margaritas I\\'ve had at Brewery Bar II have been refreshing, flavorful and just intoxicating enough, I\\'ve also had a few off-balance duds. \r\rGood thing there\\'s plenty of cold beer on tap, and tequila for shots. \r\rNow that there\\'s no smoking allowed, this is an easy once-a- week supper for families with kids. You\\'ll fill \\'em up for next to nothing and it\\'s better than the drive-thru. \r\rThe truth is, most of Denver\\'s so-called finest restaurants could (and do) exist in mirror images in cities all across America. While delicious, there is nothing uniquely Denver about roasted burrata or lobster macaroni and cheese, and while fun, nothing inherently Denver about a 75-drink \"\\'tini\" menu or a bar full of imported beers. This is the stuff of Anytown, U.S.A. \r\rBut the Brewery Bar II, from the Broncos-speculation on the TV screen to the green chile on the combo plates, belongs only here. \r\rIt is wholly Denver. \r\r(Note: Brewery Bar also has two additional locations, but only the Kalamath Street location was visited for this review.) \r\rDining critic Tucker Shaw can be reached at 303-954-1958 or at <a href=\"%5C'mailto:dining@denverpost.com%5C'\">dining@denverpost.com</a>. \r\r--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\r \r\rAtmosphere: Part sports bar, part Mexican restaurant.

It now represents perhaps the finest collection of Fine Art Photography between the East and West coasts of the United States. Hal brings a lifetime of experience with both commercial and fine art photography, and collecting. The Gallery has become a focus for learning and viewing by folks from all around the world (most of whom \\'discovered\\' the Gallery and return to gaze upon walls with images, or to acquire the best collectables of both classical and emerging artists).\r\rIt\\'s reputation is evidenced by the contingent of volunteers who help Hal keep the Gallery vibrant with new shows, and with publication of the PFA Newsletter authored by Hal and his associate, Loretta Young-Gautier, which is distributed to thousands of art lovers and collectors worldwide. It can be said that the images visible on the 2500 square feet of wall space are but the \\'tip of the iceberg\\', with hundreds of images filed in drawers and closets and on tables in framing areas. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.cameraobscuragallery.com%5C'\">www.cameraobscuragallery.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wqtyqd7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.990257,39.737056]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cameron Church","description":"Posted by Baobot1600 S Pearl St, Denver, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wnonl1j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.980456,39.68747]}},{"properties":{"name":"Camille's Sidewalk CafÃ©","description":"Posted by Baobot4004 Red Cedar Drive C-4, Highlands Ranch, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wt1mtcs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.941427,39.524623]}},{"properties":{"name":"Campo de Fiori","description":"Posted by Baobot300 Fillmore St., Denver, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wt6zx7f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.953416,39.721087]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cannon Mine","description":"Posted by Baobot210 S.

New York-themed images, from taxicabs to skylines, hang from the walls. Even the bathrooms are painted to look like they\\'ve been tagged by graffiti artists. \r\rOn the menu, dotted with primary-color subway icons, you\\'ll find Yankee clubhouse sandwiches, Bronx Bomber potato skins and Big Apple pie a la mode. \r\rAnd New York this place is, in its way. After all, it was started by transplanted New Yorkers, and many of their ingredients come from the famous Carnegie Deli, a longtime midtown Manhattan institution. \r\rBut these days, the real Carnegie Deli, packed with kitschy New York City chazerai, serves its delicious but ridiculously gargantuan sandwiches mostly to tourists looking for the New York they\\'ve seen on the Travel Channel or Food Network. \rMost Manhattanites (at least when I lived there) get their pastrami fixes from neighborhood joints like Eisenberg\\'s or Sarge\\'s or Ben\\'s. On special occasions, they\\'ll hop the F-train to the ancient but kitsch-resistant Katz\\'s, or, until recently, to the now-defunct 2nd Avenue Deli, which used to make the best kasha varnishkes on the planet before shuttering over a lease dispute early this year. \r\rBut this is all just for knowing. Because if you brush aside the trippy trappings of New York \"authenticity\" and just focus on the food, Deli Tech (like the Carnegie itself) serves evocative New York City fare. \rBreakfast comes in many forms at Deli Tech, from challah French toast to bagels with cream cheese and lox to corned beef hash with fried eggs on top. \r\rMe, I\\'ll grab the paper and take a matzo brei scramble: Delectable bits of unleavened matzo, soaked and scrambled with eggs and served with applesauce alongside. \r\rLunch is prime time at Deli Tech. Suits and their assistants compete with jocks from the fitness club across the lot to wait for tables to open up. (It\\'s never a long wait; tables turn over fairly quickly. This is the Tech Center, after all. There\\'s money to be made!) \r\rSalads and burgers are offered, but deli sandwiches are the kings of the menu. Bread is fresh and fillings are generous. \r\rMy favorite sandwich was a double-decker combo of corned beef and brisket on rye, served \"N.Y. Style,\" with cole slaw and Russian dressing. The sour-salty-savory layers of briny corned beef and slow-cooked brisket worked well with the sweet tang of the slaw and gooiness of the dressing. All that was missing was a puckery, crunchy pickle, but sadly, Deli Tech\\'s were limp and dull. \rMy second favorite sandwich was a pastrami reuben, also on rye (deli sandwiches are almost best on rye, although seedless rye or pumpernickel will do), this one served hot and piled with pastrami, sauerkraut, Russian dressing and melty Swiss cheese. The pastrami was spicy and smoky and a beautiful ruby-red, with plenty of old-country flavor. \r\rChopped liver and egg salad were both simple, clear and flavorful, but both needed salt and pepper at the table. Whitefish and sable were ocean-y, not fishy. Tongue tasted of, well, tongue, which is its own unique gamey, dusty, livery, not-for-everyone flavor. \r\rOn the side? Simple, filling kasha varnishkes (bowtie pasta tossed with buckwheat) or light, ungreasy latkes (potato pancakes). \r\rDisappointing was the cold borscht, or beet soup, which was anemic and watery, with very little body or beet flavor. Also confounding, chicken noodle and matzo ball soup, which was overflowing with noodles but much too sparse on broth. The version with kreplach dumplings was also too loaded with stuff. Both would have been better without the noodles. \r\rSuppertime at the Deli Tech is less crowded, which means you can dine on liver and onions or a brisket platter (served with vegetables, potatoes, and soup or salad) in peace. Skip the stuffed cabbage, which was soggy and bland. \r\rThere are a (very) few wines on offer, but here\\'s one nice thing about the list: Everything on it comes in a half-bottle, perfect for two (or one, if you\\'re thirsty and aren\\'t driving). Otherwise, have a spritzy old-style egg cream soda. \r\rA proper deli meal calls for a proper deli dessert, and if we\\'re talking New York, we\\'re talking cheesecake. Deli Tech\\'s is sweet but not sugary, rich but not deadening, and plenty big. Stick with the basic one here, and forget the chocolate or marbled versions. \r\rAlso good for sweets, rugelach and mandlebroit (a crispy almond cookie), which can also be taken to go. But don\\'t bother with the linzer cookie tart, which was chewy and sticky. \r\rActually, anything at Deli Tech can also be taken to go, but that would mean that you\\'ll miss out on the good-humored, but no-nonsense intra-staff banter that characterizes the service here. Like at any good deli, the servers are a crew of wise-cracking pros who call you \"hon\" and won\\'t mess up your order, no matter how chaotic the place is. \r\rOne way Deli Tech is authentically New York is its opening hours: This place is open for business three meals a day, every day of the year, Christmas and Thanksgiving included. \r\rI suppose Deli Tech is New York, in its way. And even if it\\'s a closer reflection of the glitzy, sparkly, be-a-part-of-it New York that New Yorkers roll out for tourists than the real-life neighborhood New York that New Yorkers actually live in, the pastrami doesn\\'t taste any less authentic. \r\rDining critic Tucker Shaw can be reached at 303-954-1958 or at <a href=\"%5C'mailto:dining@denverpost.com%5C'\">dining@denverpost.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a></a>","id":"a64u0wyhr0g5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.894003,39.624196]}},{"properties":{"name":"Deluxe","description":"Posted by Baobot30 S.

Swartz was a great lover of Shakespeare and as part of his treatment regime began to read aloud from the Bard\\'s works. His family would gather to hear him in the evenings and as time passed so did growing circle of friends and curious neighbors. When he began to build his new house on Hooker Street, he designed a theater in the basement to accommodate his growing audience.\r\rFinished in 1911, the Bungalow Theater included a miniature proscenium with terraced seating and benches along the walls. There was also an open orchestra pit that is now covered by the stage apron. It is in many ways the original home theater! With the help of his family and friends, Swartz was able to stage all of Shakespeare\\'s plays and local legend has it that the Bungalow was the first theater west of the Mississippi to have done so.\r\rAfter Swartz\\'s death in 1937, the building was served as a meeting space for various organizations. It housed the local Church of Latter Days Saints congregation from 1944 -1954 and was later used as meeting space by the Girl Scouts.\r\rIn 1956 the theater was once again reestablished with the arrival of Paul Willet. Renamed the Gaslight in 1964, under Willet\\'s direction, the venue would gain national attention for its regional premieres of Equus, Slow Dance on the Killing Ground and Arthur Miller\\'s The Price.\r\rWillet was the creative director until his death in 1984. During the next two decades the theater was renamed the Denver Victorian Playhouse and passed through various hands. It was closed in 2000 and in May of 2005 was purchased by Wade and Lorraine Wood.

Under the curation of Evergreen Arts Center and Arts Council Acting Director Kimberly Moore, this show of more than 70 artists presents self-portraits from the provocative to the beautiful. Participating in the show are well-known artists Kim English, Michelle Torrez, Raj Chaudhuri, JR Eason and Suk Shugli. Opening Reception, run of the show.\r\rThe Evergreen Arts Center is broadening its vision and presenting some art exhibits that are, for it, fairly groundbreaking. Under the curation of Acting Director Kimberly Moore, the Center has planned more educational and thought provoking shows for the new year. The first is the âPortrait of Self-Expression Show, 2007â, a self-portrait show to which 66 artists responded. Most often, explains Kimberly, a self-portrait is an image the artist makes using him- or herself as the subject. It is typically drawn or painted from a reflection in a mirror. The Arts Centerâs prospectus asked artists for âthe self-portrait that represents you, however you decide to express your own image.â \r\rWhat they got were paintings, bronzes, collages, photographs, and sculptured images in bronze, clay, terra cotta and papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, in every style from traditional to modernistic. The entries were so compelling that Kimberly decided to produce a 2007 Self Portrait Calendar with images from 24 of the artists. Some of the more renowned artists in the show and calendar include Kim English, Michelle Torrez, Raj Chaudhuri, JR Eason and Suk Shugli. The Calendars are on sale now at the Evergreen Arts Center for 5.\r\râThe entries were fascinating,â said Kimberly. â[Award-winning collage artist] Ann Bunn took stamps she had collected from her travels all over the world and a piece of painting she did when she was 5 years old and incorporated them into her collage. Evelyn Martinez painted a scene of a catholic church with an ominous, dark storm rolling in off the plains of Texas. One person took X-rays of themselves and painted over them. It was just amazing.â\r\rThere are many area artists of some renown in the show as well, like Don Sahli and susiehyer. All have outdone themselves by presenting provocative and stunning art. \r\rDonât Forget â The Portrait of Self-Expression Show opens on First Thursday, January 4, with a reception from 5 to 8, and runs through the end of January. The artists will be present to talk about their work and explain, for example, how a picture of a bunny with a broken paintbrush in its mouth becomes a self-portrait. Pick up a Self-Portrait calendar while youâre there!\r\rThe Evergreen Arts Center is located next to the Buchanan Park Recreation Center in Evergreen, 32003B Ellingwood Trail (Highway 74 and Squaw Pass Road), and is open Noon to 5pm Tuesday through Sunday.\r\rThe Evergreen Arts Council is a non profit 501 C3 Tax Id No. 84 0718563.\r\rFor further information please call the Evergreen Arts Center at 303-674-0<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wwsjsci"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.364758,39.604585]}},{"properties":{"name":"Evergreen High School","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 29300 Buffalo Park Road, Evergreen, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wxsl63a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.335314,39.622302]}},{"properties":{"name":"Evergreen Lake House","description":"Posted by Baobot29614 Upper Bear Creek Road, Evergreen, CO, United StatesCenter includes:\ra Great Room with a large stone fireplace and an Octagon room.\r\rEvergreen Lake Park includes:\ra 40 acre lake, 1 acre park with picnic tables and grills, wetlands, an observation boardwalk, a 1.3 mile long trail, a historical boat/warming house.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wsjkt5x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.333652,39.633079]}},{"properties":{"name":"Evergreen Lutheran Church","description":"Posted by Baobot5980 Highway 73, Evergreen, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wolcodh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.324234,39.623617]}},{"properties":{"name":"Everyday Joe's","description":"Posted by Baobot144 S.

The ownership record is nearly as convoluted as the list of business occupants. The property was sold in April 1926 by William Beach to Adrian G. Diez, who constructed the building. He sold it in May 1927 to the Curran-Isis Theatres Company (Frank Ricketson and associates). They sold in 1930 to the Fox Colorado Theatre Group, who in turn sold it in 1933 to the Fox Colorado Theatre Company. A quitclaim deed in 1935 resulted with the Boulder K &amp; F Realty Company as the new owner. They sold it in 1946 to the Isis Theatre Company (also Fox Intermountain Theaters). County Assessor??s records are not available until a transaction in 1978, when the building was sold by the National General Theaters to the Mann Theaters Corporation. This company sold the property in 1988 to Cinamerica Theaters. In 1994, the present owner, Celtic Properties, purchased the building at 1135 13th Street.\r\rRecent newspaper articles state that the Rialto was originally a vaudeville theater, but earlier newspaper reports seem to indicate that it was a movie theater. After Diez sold the Rialto to the Curran-Isis Theatres Company, they operated it for only a few months before it ??closed for lack of business.? It is possible that the Rialto was purchased and closed down so as not to compete with the other entertainment theaters operated by the group, which included the Isis, or that vaudeville theaters had reached the end of their usefulness. By 1932, the building was still listed in the city directories as ??vacant.?\r\rIn 1938, Buffalo Club Dancing occupied the building, and was there through at least 1940, but in 1943, the building was again vacant. That year, another business started up. The Anchorage opened on April 9, 1943 (although the Boulder Daily Camera article lists the address as 1155 13th Street). The manager, John Hart, had been rejected for military service and turned his attention to developing a recreation center on University Hill for students, sailors, and townspeople. Hart states, ??I have been encouraged to open the building as a club by persons who recognize the shortage of entertainment places in Boulder. There has been an increasing demand since the destruction of Canon Park. I intend to run a first class place and although I have been handicapped in getting ready for the opening through an inability to get sufficient help, The Anchorage will be ready for the opening.?\r\rMusic for dancing was provided every Friday and Saturday night, and jukeboxes located in the balcony provided music for dancing on other occasions. Just four months later, however, City Manger H.C. McClintock closed the Anchorage, referred to as a ??soft drink and dancing place,? for a week as a penalty for a liquor party. Referred to variously as the Anchorage Bar &amp; Grill, it was located here at least through 1949.\r\rWhen Fox Intermountain purchased the building in 1946, there was initially discussion of converting the building back into a theater. Those plans never materialized, however, and a building permit was issued to the Fox Theatre Company in 1951 to remodel the building into a cafeteria. Although an advertisement in the Daily Camera noted that Ted??s Buff Caf?? &amp; Cafeteria was opening on November 9, 1954, it appeared in the city directories in 1953. The Buff Caf?? was advertised as ??Boulder??s most modern eating house.? It operated from 6:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., and re-opened in the afternoon from 4:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.\r\rThe Fox Theater, located at 2022 14th Street in downtown Boulder, was destroyed by fire on April 18, 1960. In July of that year, the Fox Intermountain Amusement Corporation applied for a permit to remodel the subject building into a movie theater. They had been denied a permit to erect a 373 square foot marquee, but reapplied for a 230 square foot marquee. A sign permit application was filed for the Fox Theatre by Boulder Sign Ideas in January 1961. The plans included the ??Fox? sign, as well as the lighted marquee. The marquee was 42?? 8? wide, 5?? tall, and 51/2?? wide at the base. The new Fox Theatre was opened on July 7, 1961. Present at the formal opening was the president of Fox Inter-Mountain Theatres, Robert Selig. Besides the sign and metal screen covering the front fa??ade, another alteration to the building at this time was the installation of a 36 x 18?? screen which was ??designed to accommodate all sizes of motion pictures, including the spectacular cinemascope process, developed by 20th Century Fox.? The Theatre was designed by Mel Glatz, Fox construction engineer, and assisted by Les Newkirk, the manager of Fox Theatres in Boulder. There were 500 seats for persons, with the arrangement assuring ??each patron spacious leg room between the American Bodiform chairs.? A stereophonic sound system, new lobby with concession stand, specially built cooling system, and new rest rooms rounded out the changes to the building. For the opening night, only one show was scheduled, but afterwards it operated on continuous showings beginning at 1:30pm.\r\rIn 1991, the Pyramid Group, Inc. leased the 450-seat building from the Mann Theatres and received a liquor license from the City, with plans to turn the building into a concert hall. The interior of the building was altered for the new use, including seating for approximately 500 people. The music hall focused on national concerts.\r\rThe addresses for all of the businesses located in the building have varied from 1133 through 1141 13th Street. When the building was first constructed in 1926, it also included two small shops, which flanked the central entrance to the theater. In 1936, Al??s Shine Parlor was one of the enterprises that were located in these smaller shops throughout the years. Other smaller businesses have included: Albert D?? Elai, Barber and Penny Arcade in 1956; D?? Elai and Security Mutual Life Insurance in 1959; Buff??s Shoe Shop in 1966; Boulder??s House of Flowers in 1969; and Door of Perception Electronic Equipment and Carousel Beauty Salon in 1972.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.foxtheatre.com%5C'\">www.foxtheatre.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wtce4gs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2762,40.007666]}},{"properties":{"name":"Foxhole Lounge","description":"Posted by Baobot2936 Fox St, Denver, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0ws18tys"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.995393,39.759013]}},{"properties":{"name":"Foxnut Asian Fusion &amp; Sushi","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 122 The Plaza, Beaver Creek, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wq05raq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.518479,39.633189]}},{"properties":{"name":"Framed Image","description":"Posted by Baobot5066 E.

Joining us from Kenya, Sammy Leseita was born in a village called Naserian, near Samburu Game Reserve in Northern Kenya. As a child, Sammy aspired to be a safari guide. At the age of four he managed typical children duties in his Samburu tribe as a herdâs boy, tending kids and lambs, and then graduated to tending goats, sheep and cattle at the age of ten. \r\rWhen Sammy was about ten years of age, a manager from a neighboring camp in the Samburu Game Reserve approached the tribe to ask for permission to bring tourists into their community to learn about and experience the Samburu way of life.  The villagers agreed and tourists began visiting Sammy and his village.\r\rOne frequent visitor to the village decided to sponsor Sammy to go to school. After completing his education in Kenya, Sammy started the career he always dreamed of as a safari guide. Sammy has since worked as a safari guide, providing clients with first-hand information on his tribe, giving lectures on both the Northern Kenyan ecosystems as well as the tribes living in these areas. His appreciation and knowledge of the local wildlife and ecosystems is extraordinary.\r\rSammy will be speaking about this journey to become a safari guide. The Heritage Hotels portfolio will also be presented, featuring permanent safari-style luxury tented camps in some of the most famous game parks in East Africa.\r\rPlease RSVP today to: <a href=\"%5C'mailto:Sarah@FazendinPortfolio.com%5C'\">Sarah@FazendinPortfolio.com</a> or 1.303.895.9583 to be eligible for exciting prize giveaw<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wy38x98"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.998611,39.72832]}},{"properties":{"name":"Front Range CrossFit","description":"Posted by Baobot2171 South Trenton Way Suite 219, Denver, CO, United StatesCome in to Front Range CrossFit and see what CrossFit can do for you.

Ed Schreiber, 303-692-8535 \r\rAdditional Detail:\rDrawing a Line Between Church and State\r\rMike Keefe, Denver Post Editorial Cartoonist\r\rAfter a stretch in the Marine Corps and, while working on a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Missouri at Kansas City, Mike Keefe\rbegan drawing editorial cartoons for the campus newspaper. The Vietnam War was winding down and Watergate was heating up. With material this\rrich, Keefe was fooled into believing that cartooning would always be easy. He gave up math and was hired by the Denver Post where he still\rworks today.\r\rHis cartoons have appeared in Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report, The New Republic, The New York Times, Business Week, The\rWashington Post and are syndicated in hundreds of other newspapers and magazines.\r\rWith varying degrees of success, Keefe has dabbled in cartoon strips, animation, short stories and plays.\r\rKeefe served as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists and is a former John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford\rUniversity. Among other honors, he\\'s won the National Headliner\\'s Award, Sigma Delta Chi Distinguished Service Award, The Best of the West\rJournalism contest, and the Fischetti Cartoon Competition. Keefe served as a Pulitzer Prize juror in 1997 and 98.\r\rOn the internet his cartoons can be seen at <a href=\"%5C'http://www.intoon.com%5C'\">www.intoon.com</a>.\r\rKeefe, a son of Santa Rosa, California and a product of the St. Louis, Missouri public school system, now lives in Evergreen, Colorado, at\r8,000 feet above sea level. He is married with two children. And like most cartoonists he knows, Keefe plays in a rock band on the weekends.\r\rIn October 2006 he received a \"Freethought in the Media: Tell It Like It Is\" Award form the Freedom From Religion Foundation (<a href=\"%5C'http://www.ffrf.org%5C'\">www.ffrf.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wm9fnkt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.023026,39.762012]}},{"properties":{"name":"Garfield County Fairgrounds","description":"Posted by Baobot1001 Railroad Avenue, Rifle, CO, United States2007 Garfield County Fair - Concert, CPRA Rodeo, Junior Rodeo, Parade, 4H &amp; FFA, Open Show, Livestock Competition &amp; Auction, Food, Fun &amp; Entertainment for everyone.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wlu010a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.783334,39.538891]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gargaroâs Italian Bakery","description":"Posted by Baobot5058 Marshall St., Arvada, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wk77qgo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.068709,39.789792]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gelmanâs Gourmet Market","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 2911 W. 38th Ave., Denver, CO, United StatesWHY WE LOVE IT: With a straightforward menu leaning heavily on sandwiches, this casual North Denver spot is best enjoyed at lunch, when light pours in the windows and bakers bustle behind the counter.

Broadway, Denver, COThe History of the glorious Gothic Theatre began in the roaring Twenties when magnificent movie palaces were the center of entertainment in society. The theatreâs grand art deco style awed the thousands of Denver residents who came to view the classic movies of the period. Its importance to the area may never be fully understood by those who were not there at the time. Generations of families spent hours of their lives within the theatreâs famous walls dreaming, laughing, crying, being entertained, and most importantly, creating memories. The theatres place in Denverâs history was cemented when the Gothic became the first in the city to show talking movies. Talk about blowing minds.\rIt is hard to imagine but as time passed the fate of the Gothic began to change. With changes in ownership came changes in the architecture and look of the beautiful building. In the 1940âs the front faÃ§ade was radically altered to keep pace with more modern tastes. Luckily the interior art deco finishes were left untouched. The rounded walls and wonderful recessed coves remain to this day. This atmosphere helps the building retain its connection with the historical past.\rAt one time the theatre was graced with an entire Chinese village painted on its walls and a very large dragon looming from the ceiling. What fun that would have been to see! But time continued to march on and the theatre went from showing first run movies to struggling to survive. Different owners tried different things with little success.\rIn 1998 the Gothic was reborn when two friends who love music and love to dream purchased the building out of bankruptcy, saving it from the venerable wrecking ball. Retaining the art deco, accents the new owners remodeled and rebuilt the theatre from the foundation to the roof.\rBringing in artists and designers who shared their passion and understood their vision, the two transformed the theatre into one of the premier music venues in the world.\rIt is truly one of a kind. From the incredible interior paint scheme to the newly created wrap-around balcony to the refurbished original marquee no detail has been overlooked. The brand-new state of the art sound and light system was simply icing on the proverbial cake.\rOn June 23, 1999, when the very appropriate legends of New Orleans, The Rebirth Brass Band, took the stage, the glorious Gothic was back in the business of making memories.\r\rThe Gothic Theatre is located in the City of Englewood so we are not affected by the recent change in Denver liquor license policy regarding all age concerts.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.gothictheatre.com%5C'\">www.gothictheatre.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wk1in8t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.987585,39.774738]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gotta Dance!

Always comedies, always wonderful entertainment for the entire family, and always, the audience plays an integral part of any production at the Music Hall. An evening at our theater is filled with an incredible diversity of music. You might hear turn-of-the-century ragtime, 1940\\'s swing, contemporary country or rock and roll.\r\rIt is our wish that each person that enters our theater is made to feel like part of our Music Hall family, and so is treated like a treasured family member. Many of our repeat customers have formed close friendships with the entire Music Hall staff. Our multi-talented cast, most of whom have been performing at the Music Hall since \"our early days,\" often meet and visit with customers after the show.\r\rThe same cast performs in our Children\\'s Theatre every Saturday and scheduled week days. Since 1991, the Music Hall has provided fine quality children\\'s entertainment. We present interactive plays and music that brings fun and laughter to children and parents alike.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.hsmusichall.com%5C'\">www.hsmusichall.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wkisdtn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.20759,39.71499]}},{"properties":{"name":"Herman's Hideaway","description":"Posted by Baobot1578 S.

A waitress delivered hot cups of soup to us, free. Mushrooms floated in the clear, lemongrass-perfumed, vegetarian broth. It warmed all of us - my wife, Annie, and my two young daughters - instantly. \r\rYou\\'ve probably passed this moss-green place, at the bottom of a hill on Broadway Street in the heart of the University of Colorado\\'s student swarm. \r\rKhow Thai Cafe, which routinely wins awards for best Thai restaurant in Boulder County, is excellent. \r\rWe lean toward stir-fried rice dishes for the girls when we eat Asian. We went with Khow pad supparod, stir- \r\rfried rice with pineapple, raisins, cashews and egg. The dish was clean and clear - not drenched in soy sauce and sesame oil but speckled with cilantro and touched with ginger. The girls gorged on it. So did Annie and I. \r\rThe words \"pad Thai\" rarely fail to pass my lips after sitting down at a Thai restaurant, even though it\\'s a profoundly hit-or-miss affair. It\\'s probably the most popular Thai dish in America, and I\\'ve found restaurants either dumb it down with sugar for their American diners, or they make music with the entree. \r\rKhow Thai Cafe\\'s orchestra of noodles, egg, bean sprouts, ground peanuts, fish sauce, and seafood (shrimp, scallops, catfish and imitation crab) made wonderful harmonies, dabbed with sweet but not cloying, singed with heat but not volcanic, and nudged with sour lime and fermented fish sauce. \r\rThe waitress was extremely helpful, helping us navigate the restaurant\\'s six styles of curry. We decided upon the Masaman curry, which involved coconut milk, potatoes, onions and peanuts with a mild jolt of chile. We spooned the soupy curry over white rice and ate, barely pausing to make small talk. \r\rOur last dish was the most unusual. If you like lemon, and we do, then it\\'s worth ordering. Pad prik khing was red and green bell peppers and green beans stir-fried with lemon leaf and a spicy curry paste. \r\rThe lemon leaf dominated the sauce, and it almost verged on something infused with Pledge, the lemon-scented furniture polish. But fortunately it held back enough to remain in the food category. \r\rWith the cooks busy chopping and frying in the open kitchen, a bunch of graduate students talking about their classes, and the happy hippy music filling the air (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; Tracy Chapman; etc.), Annie sat back and studied the table full of plates. \r\r\"I was trying to find a favorite,\" she said, \"but I couldn\\'t.\" \r\r\"Me neither,\" I said. \"We\\'re coming back.\" \r\r\"No doubt.\" \r\rStaff Writer Douglas Brown can be reached at 303-954-1395 or <a href=\"%5C'mailto:djbrown@denverpost.com%5C'\">djbrown@denverpost.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a></a>","id":"a64u0wsm6utf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.278222,40.012987]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kim's Vietnamese and Chinese Cuisine","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1325 Broadway, Boulder, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wnnh8iv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.276419,40.009661]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kinderhut","description":"Posted by Baobot649 Village Road, Breckenridge, CO, United StatesThe staff at Kinderhut looks forward to helping you plan a great vacation.

Modeled after Venice\\'s famous Campanile in the Piazza San Marco, the Clocktower is an excellent example of the architectural style of the Italian Rennaissance.\r\rThe Daniels and Fisher Dry Goods Store was part of the Tower when it was first built, and occupied all of 16th Street between Arapahoe and Lawrence. In addition to serving the needs of the bustling downtown community, the store kindly accommodated the hundreds of visitors who wanted to stare in awe at the \"Purple Mountains Majesty\" from the Tower\\'s 21st Floor.\r\rListed in the National, Colorado, and Denver Historic Registers, the D&amp;F Tower is a timeless classic... and the perfect home for Lannie\\'s.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.lannies.com%5C'\">www.lannies.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0ww920d5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.995594,39.747962]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lapis Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 3971 Tennyson St., Denver, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wwlm6dp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.044017,39.772379]}},{"properties":{"name":"Larimer Lounge","description":"Posted by Baobot2721 Larimer Street, Denver, CO, United StatesThe Larimer Lounge first started as a concept amongst a group of music loving friends attending the University of Colorado at Boulder in the early 90??s. It was obvious at the time that there was no one catch-all club attempting to bring in all the different elements of the burgeoning independent rock scene that was going on in the country at that point in time. One case in point ?? when a friend wrote a letter to the amazing northwest based band Seaweed saying they should come play Denver sometime, the letter writer later received a phone call from the bands agent asking for help trying to find a show in Denver. Seaweed eventually did come, and played a show at ?? eh em, The Church along with Spell (the band whose members would later form The Geds).  After graduation, three guys from the circle of friends, Scott, Scott and Hans attempted to start their own club, but soon learned that their lack of experience was too large a barrier to facilitate the transition of making a venue from a dream into reality. One of these friends decided to book another club for years and was fortunate to have been part of many up and coming artists early shows in Denver, amongst them QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, THE WHITE STRIPES, BRIGHT EYES, THE SHINS, AND YOU WILL KNOW US BY THE TRAIL OF DEAD, FLOGGING MOLLY, DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, THE PROMISE RING, JIMMY EAT WORLD, THE RAPTURE and many more. In 2002 the pals finally got their own venue ?? The Larimer Lounge. They remain committed to providing a relaxed atmosphere where customers can have a good time while viewing live performances from the across the spectrum of independent rock that is currently going on in this country and around the wo<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wtzp4r1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.983843,39.759721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Larkspur Restaurant &amp; Bar","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 458 Vail Valley Drive, Vail, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wv7sr70"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.36856,39.639071]}},{"properties":{"name":"Las Cazuelas","description":"Posted by Baobot6757 W.

Lucile\\'s first chef received his training from the famous New Orleans restaurant, \"Commanders Palace.\" A breakfast and lunch restaurant serving a Creole theme had never been attempted before in Colorado.

Colfax Ave., Denver, CO, United StatesOpened in 1918, the Ogden Theatre was Denver??s leading vaudeville house before it transformed into a second-run movie theater, which it remained until closing in 1990. In 1993, Doug Kauffman of Nobody in Particular Presents re-opened the Ogden as a concert venue, forever fusing rock and roll with the theater??s storied history: In its eighty-eight year existence, the Ogden has hosted everyone from Harry Houdini to Iggy Pop, Jackson Brown to the Smashing Pumpkins. Now Nobody in Particular has revitalized the theater to ensure it thrives for another eight decades.\r\rDesigned by NIPP??s Steve Schalk, a Hollywood prop master who spearheaded the renovation of the Gothic Theater in 1999, the new Ogden features state-of-the art architectural elements that both preserve the building??s historical integrity and reintroduce it as a world-class concert venue, designed with the audience in mind. An intimate wrap-around balcony, enlarged stage and improved sight lines increase capacity and ensure there??s not a bad seat in the house. The sound system was entirely rebuilt by sound engineer Bret Dowlen of Dowlen Sound; recycled materials that line the floors improve the acoustics, making this one of the best sounding rooms in town. The new Ogden is a treat for the senses, as well, with ornamental steel rails, a beautiful, hand-crafted bar on the upper-tier balcony and a whimsical, color-saturated interior by decorative painter Karin Mirick, owner of Denver??s Create a Scene. Even the bathrooms have been remodeled. The theater??s original proscenium remains intact, however, as do many of the design flourishes built by the original architects.

The beautiful antique back bar was built in the 1880s by the Brunswick Company Factory in Dubuque, Iowa. It is a cherry wood, birch, and mahogany âDel Monteâ model, was cut-to-fit and constructed with no nails. The Brunswick bar spent about ten years in Leadville, Colorado. At the turn of the century this building was built and owned by E.J. Difrancia, who was Louisvilleâs agent for Tivoli Beer in Denver. Tivoli worked with him to bring the back bar to Louisville. It remains one of Coloradoâs two oldest antique bars and is a priceless treasure in our community. Due to dangerous gases in the coal mines, miners could not smoke, so most used chewing tobacco.

He was a visionary in the realms of publishing, politics, architecture and classic American life in the early 1900s. In 1926, Hearst commissioned the historic Warwick Hotel New York for his paramour, Marion Davis, to host their famous friends and colleagues from Hollywood and the world of theatre. The original Warwick captures the elegance and grace of European style, and its tradition and cachet is evident in each of the Warwick Hotels that have opened around the world since 1926.\r\rIn keeping with this tradition and building upon reputation, Randolph\\'s Restaurant &amp; Bar, named after Mr. Hearst, is located in the Warwick Denver Hotel. The restaurant serves contemporary American Cuisine and classic cocktails in a backdrop of comfortable elegance - reminiscent of the Warwick New York\\'s speak-easy spirit in the late 1920s. Chef Dave Oliveri offers a menu that is artful yet unpretentious. The menu changes seasonally and is complemented by an award-winning wine.\r\rRandolph\\'s houses three distinct spaces: the bar, the restaurant and the patio. Here, our patrons take pleasure in everything from wine tastings and wine dinners to happy hour, media networking events and business lunches. We offer something for everyone without compromising the stylish comfort that is Randolph\\'s hallmark.\r\r| Randolph\\'s Bar |\r\rAlso a must-visit for diversified and memorable cocktails. Named one of \"Denver\\'s Best Happy Hours\" by 5280 Magazine, Randolph\\'s bar is the perfect place to relax and end a long day with friends. Enjoy some classic cocktails in the shade of our terraced patio or on cooler nights enjoy the warm atmosphere at the bar. Original, vibrant, trendy, are just a few words that describe this stylish outlet.\r\r| Randolph\\'s Patio |\r\rIf the temperatures of spring, summer or fall are invited, enjoy the terraced patio, which provides not only alfresco happy hour, but also perfect views of the Colorado sunset reflected off the buildings of downtown Denver.

Sensors can report the realtime status of an engine in the bowels of a ship so that costly emergency shut-downs can be avoided. Data from your car can report your actual driving behavior and (hopefully) lower your insurance rates.\r\rFrom your home PC you can access air quality and other EPA ratings for your town, or take an aerial \"fly over\" of your neighborhood or just about anywhere in the world. Location-based cell phone blogging is taking hold.\r\rYou can even use your cell phone to check in for an airplane flight or, in the future, to take the place of a train ticket.\r\rAn information explosion is underway, giving rise to an era of extreme data and dramatic new applications.

Our present home is within two miles of the Denver Art Museum, the Performing Arts Center, and the 16th and 17th street shopping and business locales. Four years after our purchase of this building on Santa Fe Drive, the area has developed into a vibrant, thriving arts district with over a dozen galleries, a museum and a theater. In a Denver Post newspaper article the neighborhood was titled ??The Heart of Art.\" The community has given it that identity as well; hundreds of art viewers visit the Santa Fe Art District first Fridays of each month.\r\rIf there is a symbolic and spiritual reality, then various circumstances confirmed the appropriateness of the purchase of our building at 760 Santa Fe Drive. It was meant to be. In 1999, I discovered when reading the deed papers of our 1889 building, that it was once owned by Vance Kirkland, one of Denver??s internationally recognized painters. Further confirmation that we had bought the right place came when our contractor found a candle in the shape of an angel in the basement of the building and asked if I wanted to keep it. Having just lost our beloved daughter, Jodi, the angel, to me, represented her presence in the art world that so captivated her. The angel sits on my desk as a perpetual reminder of how fitting this building is as the gallery??s home.\r\rHaving 4800 square feet, the gallery is divided into a 2700 square foot exhibition space with moveable walls which create an ever changing backdrop for our shows. The back room is always open for perusal and contains a presentation area and hundreds of artworks: canvases, drawings, limited edition prints, sculptures, tapestries, photographs, furniture- a veritable banquet of art resources. Not only is our gallery a forum for our artists, but we have exhibited their work in art fairs in Chicago, New York, Miami and Seattle. In this way, the artists we so admire are exposed to a national audience.\r\rAlthough we represent many established artists of significant reputation, we take great pleasure in the career development of talented, emerging young artists. We have never limited our search for the stimulating and the innovative in art. Therefore, we have not restricted our stable of artists, which continues to grow.\r\rFrom the inception of the business, The Carson Group, Art Consultants has been a parallel arm to our gallery. As an advisory service, for our clients, it provides yet another means for collectors to acquire art and to explore the plethora of works in the art world. We streamline the process for them and reduce the overwhelming amount of information to a graspable selection of appropriate material. It is our purpose to provide art that is timeless in its visual statement. Art that piques the intellect as well as the emotions never loses its appeal. Uncrating or unwrapping the artwork for our next exhibit is like opening presents, a constant delight. Despite the numerous exhibits over the years, I am always energized when I see the new artwork. In an atmosphere of cordiality and informality, we are pleased to discuss and present the art that inhabits our building.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.sandycarsongallery.com%5C'\">www.sandycarsongallery.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wtd94xa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.998611,39.728264]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sangre de Cristo Arts &amp; Conference Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 210 N.

Yale Ave., Denver, COAsk anyone at Swallow Hill, and you will get a different answer. Defining Swallow Hill Music Association is almost as difficult as defining what folk music is! How would YOU describe it? Is is \"Denver\\'s home for folk, roots and acoustic music\"? A non-profit, 501c(3) organization dedicated to the preservation and presentation of folk music in the Rocky Mountain region? The oldest multicultural folk arts organization in the region? The only place of its kind between Freight &amp; Salvage in Berkeley and the Old Town School in Chicago?\r\rLike the story of the blind men and the elephant, each of us sees Swallow Hill from our own perspective. For some of us, Swallow Hill is a music school. We revel in the extensive selection of classes, jam sessions, clubs and incredible workshops with touring artists. Others celebrate it as a concert venue, where performers from all over the world come to play and sing, offering Denver a breadth and depth of talent that it would not have witnessed otherwise. For others, Swallow Hill is a coffee house, a cozy place where we can get together for an open stage or hear a great new songwriter. Many musicians know Swallow Hill as the home of the Sawtelle Recording Studio, while many in the arts community see us as a \"living museum,\" the protector of the folk spirit and legacy. Still others see Swallow Hill as a place to volunteer, to find camaraderie in working together to make a difference in the community.\r\rSwallow Hill is also a veritable grab-bag of sounds and styles: bluegrass, Celtic, cowboy swing, gospel spirituals, African-American rural blues, Jewish Klezmer, traditional Spanish, Cajun &amp; Zydeco, shape-note singing, to name but a few. And let\\'s not forget the other folk arts of dancing (Appalachian clogging, Ceili, contra dance...), storytelling, songwriting, and even music business basics (an arcane art to many). Swallow Hill\\'s accomplishments over the years are staggering. What began with a small group of volunteers has grown into one of the largest arts organizations in the region.\r\rSwallow Hill has won both the Mayor\\'s and Governor\\'s Awards for Excellence in the Arts, has been recognized by the North American Folk Alliance, has won countless Westword \"Best of Denver\" awards, has achieved SCFD Tier II status, and is one of the most sought-after venues by folk/roots artists in the country. But beyond the programs that Swallow Hill presents, beyond the lists of artists, teachers, instruments, styles and accomplishments, Swallow Hill is a community of people drawn together by a common love of music. This is the place where we connect with our \"musical family.\"\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.swallowhill.com%5C'\">www.swallowhill.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wyi9qfz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.986684,39.667693]}},{"properties":{"name":"Swansea Recreation Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2650 E 49th Ave, Denver, CO<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wtd51hl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.954573,39.784947]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sweet B.O.B.'s Bar-b-que","description":"Posted by Baobot1 Broadway, Denver, CO, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wy1zsyc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.987512,39.716675]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sweet Basilico CafÃ©","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 401 E.

Broadway, Denver, CO, United StatesTheatre Group began over 30 years ago as a community theatre program known as the Lakewood Players. With a strong base of community contributions from the theatre artists around Denver, Lakewood Players rapidly emerged as one of the stronger nonprofit community theatres in the state. In the mid??eighties, Lakewood Players later changed locations and underwent a name change, now known as Theatre On Broadway at 13 South Broadway.\r\rAt their new venue, Theatre Group made great strides forward in business and artistic value, and in our second season were securing the rights to Broadway and Off??Broadway plays premiering in Colorado. Subsequently, Theatre Group was awarded several Denver Drama Critics Circle Awards and received the highly coveted Best Season. Not only did Theatre Group become synonymous with artistic excellence(David Marlowe, OutFront Colorado Magazine) with the theatre??going public as a whole, but they also capture a large share of the Gay and Lesbian community as well. By 1996 TOB had become the preeminent gay theatre in the state with the acclaimed premiers of Jeffrey, Six Degrees of Separation, Howard Crabtree??s Whoop Dee Doo!, Poor Super Man, Love! Valour! Compassion!, and Corpus Christi.\r\rTheatre On Broadway has become successful, in great part, by addressing the entertainment and theatrical needs of a very loyal homosexual marketplace ???? audiences who crave quality gay??themed shows that would not otherwise be found outside New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.theatregroup.org%5C'\">www.theatregroup.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wk70jsd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.987508,39.716017]}},{"properties":{"name":"Theatre at Sinclair","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 300 W.

Alameda Ave., Lakewood, CO, United StatesItalians have always had a love affair with food.  They show it with its abundance, subtle flavors, freshness, simplicity, and consistency.  Only a true Italian could convey these tastes and emotions to others.  Only at Virgilio\\'s Pizzeria Napoletana could you experience all this as \"un membro della nostra famiglia\" -- a member of our family.\r\rVirgilio was born on the outskirts of Naples, Italy.  He came to the United States in 1966 with his parents and brother, settling in New Haven County, Connecticut, 60 miles outside of New York City.  Though âLâAmericaâ was their new home, the family took the best of Italy with them: the magical cuisine of their homeland. \r\rVirgilio learned to cook from his mother, who treated every meal as an event.  Cupboards were filled only with jars of vegetables, fruits and fresh herbs which were grown by the family.  Breads never came in a plastic bag, only from âmamaâsâ oven.  And each day, the sweet scent of garlic, parsley and sweet basil heating in olive oil filled the air as another fresh pot of tomato sauce was slowly simmering to perfection. \r\rIn addition to the world class ingredients used in making our pizza, the way in which it is cooked is purely Italian.  Brick ovens were first discovered among the ruins of ancient Pompeii.  The brick oven evokes a time when life was slower, and the food was simply better. It allows us to enjoy a style of cooking that is both authentic and enjoyable, and delivers unmatched results, which is why each and every pizza at Virgilio\\'s Pizzeria Napoletana is cooked in this age old manner.\r\rTo this very day, his family still grows their own tomatoes in their backyard garden, making every pot of tomato sauce from scratch!  There is simply no compromise when it comes to the quality of food on their table.  Just as Virgilioâs family carried that tradition from Italy to the United States, Virgilio now carries this timeless family tradition of freshness and uncompromising quality of the food served to our guests here at Virgilioâs Pizzeria Napoletana.\r\rMangia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64u0wnuxgrl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.085854,39.710937]}},{"properties":{"name":"Virginia Village Branch library","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 1500 S.
