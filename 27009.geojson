We hiked a mile in the snow with our gear. We reached the entrance and she freaked. She started crying and telling me she would do anything else I wanted as long as we didn\\'t go in that hole. I was annoyed, frustrated and pushed. No luck. So, we walked back in the rain and snow. As we drove off the car got stuck in snow. We sat for several hours during which time my mom peed on the tires thinking that would help melt the snow and free us from our misery. Eventually we dug ourselves out using a piece of plastic.\r\n\r\nA few years later my mom, her husband, my brother and I went back.

August 3 - 5, 2006\r\nThere website says: It all began in the 19th century when sausage found its way to Sheboygan through German Settlers.  Over the years the ancient Roman tradition of cooking them over an open flame has been kept alive by the people of Sheboygan.  Though no one will ever understand the phrase Ã¢ÂÂBrat FryÃ¢ÂÂ because they are grilled, brats continue to be the focal point of the community.\r\n\r\nThe first festival was held in 1953 in downtown Sheboygan.  Back then it was a common sight to see streets re-named Bratwurst Blvd., and Seemel-Strasse.  Horse drawn wagons were also seen in the annual parade.\r\n\r\nAfter holding it for more than 13 years, the decision was made to cancel it because the crowds had gotten too big for the cityÃ¢ÂÂs downtown to handle.\r\n\r\nIn 1978 the festival was revitalized!  Brat dayÃ¢ÂÂs is the largest fundraiser for the Sheboygan Jaycees.  All proceeds are given back to the community primarily through donations.  Past organizations that have received donations include the Field of Dreams (Sheboygan Recreation Department), Above and Beyond ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Museum, Jaycee Quarryview Park, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Area High School Scholarship Program, the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society.\r\n\r\nThis shows one of the many brat stands setup throughout downtown Sheboygan in the 1950\\'s.  At one time there were over 50 brat stands operated by different organizations and businesses.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6arffejl8g5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.727777,43.75204]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brooklyn School Park","description":"Posted by Kbeadle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/b4cc77850e709ae7524577729ec64bc6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/44d028272f9c03cfa31e379cd9d6ccde.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/44/120157156_01161a7f7b.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/55/120157465_83c6bf9195.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/53/120157266_8552ce2b9b.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Park with tennis courts and a nice place for dogs to run and play.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6arffhaih9f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.649972,45.494571]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe Castagna","description":"Posted by Kbeadle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1758 Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard, Portland, OR, 97214Cafe Castagna<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6arfffb4xt1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.647644,45.51204]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cannon Beach","description":"Posted by Kbeadle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6arffbnf8u2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.961916,45.88947]}},{"properties":{"name":"Casey Eye Institute","description":"Posted by Kbeadle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/home_right.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/pic29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/img_eh.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> 3375 S.W.

LEED™ is a national rating system and accreditation tool used to develop high performance, sustainable buildings. Buildings are awarded points and achieve a certain level of certification based on project procedures and design elements that are indicators of a \"green building.\" The library, opened in March 2004, was the first Multnomah County building to receive LEED™ certification, a goal established by Multnomah County officials when they approved the construction of the building. The City of Portland has adopted LEED™ as the basis of design for all of its new construction.\r\n\r\nAs a green building, Hillsdale Library offers many benefits, including: environmental protection (reduced air and water pollution, reduction in solid waste creation, and minimized depletion of natural resources); economic advantages (reduced operating costs and optimized economic performance over the life of the building); and health and safety benefits (better indoor air quality, decreased harmful pollutants indoors and out, and increased personal satisfaction). \r\n\r\nTo achieve LEED™ certification, Hillsdale Library incorporates many environmental design elements that significantly reduce or eliminate the building\\'s negative impact on the environment, while providing an inviting, friendly and comfortable place for library users of all ages. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6arffiabjq2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.693654,45.479109]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home of the Green Bay Packers","description":"Posted by Kbeadle<img src=\"http://www.buckleshop.com/images/sfb115l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/arc/image/0104/fan0104.jpg\"><img src=\"http://journal.packersnews.com/photogallery/fan/fan3/images/packer_fans1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 1265 Lombardi Avenue, Green Bay, WI 54304If you are from Wisconsin you are either a Packer fan or you know Packer fans.
