The modern ground slab of the building overlaid walls and deposits of 17th-19th century date while the eastern part of the site had been largely truncated by 19th century basements.  A chalk wall containing a number of Tudor bricks was recorded.  This may be part of the original walls of the Friary having been rebuilt after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.  Residual finds relating to the Friary included a piece of dressed limestone, ragstone and chalk nodules, and Flemish floor tiles (dated 1480-1580) displaying evidence of burning.  This may be the result of a late 15th-century fire at the Friary or another in 1575 which destroyed the adjacent Glasshouse.  Medieval dump layers and pits containing pottery of 11th-12th and 13th-15th century date.

A single-storey gate lodge and two-storey stables, originally outbuildings N of a country house, Fitzroy House, built c 1830, were retained when the house was demolished c 1870. The cellars of this house were incorporated in a new, larger house, Caen Wood Towers, documented as constructed 1870(71 for Edward Brooke, aniline dye manufacturer (architect, Edward Salomons). The principal rooms, to the S, were on two floors, and bedrooms and service rooms on three floors to the N. A four-storey tower rose over the main entrance, a turret contained a fire-proof strong-room, and a conservatory originally extended NW from the house. The exterior, faced in red brick with stone dressings, and prominent gables and chimneys, were in ‘Jacobethan’ style; the roofs were decoratively slated. A two-storey coach house, stables and laundry was built to the E, and a model farm (now ruinous) and a tower-folly to the S. A rustic veranda was added to the gate lodge. The surrounding gardens contained ornamental ponds, rockeries and specimen trees.Early in the 20th c a semicircular, domed bay was added to the S front. From 1919 to 1942, the house is documented as occupied by Sir Robert Waley-Cohen, managing director of Royal Dutch-Shell Oil Co. In both the First and Second World Wars the house was used as a military convalescent hospital. By 1945, a two-storey brick and concrete wing was added to the N, for nurses’ accommodation and training. The conservatory was demolished and replaced by a dining room and an orthopaedic exercise room. The hospital was made permanent after 1945, becoming a geriatric hospital probably after 1972, when the name changed. In the 1970s, accommodation for patients, nurses and doctors was added to the E, typically NHS system-built (demolished, with the other hospital additions, 2005(2006).<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2006&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a65i22tb5op0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1583814,51.5709053]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eton Manor Sports Ground, London E15","description":" Eton Manor Sports Ground, London E15  TQ 37656 85877 MoLAS/PCA (Nathalie Cohen) standing structure survey May 2006 London Development Agency OL-00906The structures examined consisted of two memorials, dedicated to Eton Manor sportsmen killed during World War II, which are set into the sandstone boundary wall of the site, and a 20th-century cottage, located in the northern-most corner of the site.  The construction style and form of the brick-built cottage suggests that the building dates to the early part of the last century.

Shaft F1 contained natural brickearth silts which were cut by a possible quarry pit or part of the extra-mural city ditch.  Shaft F2 was closer to the line of the city wall and late medieval City Ditch (thought to have been constructed by Mayor Joceline in 1477) had truncated the natural terrace gravels.  A fragment of a post-medieval redware pitcher, dated 1450-1600, was recovered from the bottom load of the sediment at the base of the ditch.  The ditch sediments were cut by a straight-sided, arched brick sewer of probable 17th-18th century date, which was one of the versions of the Irongate Sewer, which succeeded the City Ditch.

Natural orange brickearth overlying terrace gravels was observed. The centre of the site also contained an irregularly-shaped natural feature which had perhaps been utilised for water retrieval during the early Roman period.A north-south aligned early Roman clay-and-timber building was recorded along the Wood Street frontage. Its lower stratigraphy consisted of a beam slot lined with timbers with a brickearth wall above. On the internal face of this wall keyed plaster had survived to a maximum height of 0.45m. A series of stakeholes lined the beam slot cut and there was evidence that the first phase of the building had been destroyed by fire, leaving <em>in situ</em> burnt timbers, some faced with decayed plaster.  To the south were the remains of a second building, possibly a later phase of the example seen to the north. Metal working debris over a compacted gravel surface and stake-holes surrounding a well in the centre of the site also suggested some small scale industrial activity.To the west, a deep ditch lined with timber planks and running downhill (east-west) probably related to early drainage of the site.  To the south of the site along Cheapside, the main east-west Roman road, were clay-and-timber buildings and the remains of a north-south oriented brickearth wall.  In the southeast corner of the site the south-eastern corner of a mosaic floor was uncovered, consisting of a black and red border with white and grey tesserae decoration. This was set into a cemented <em>opus signinum</em> floor. Although the floor seems to be square, the mosaic appears to have been circular and extends beyond the limit of excavation.The early-mid 2nd century the buildings were levelled and dumping took place over them. There was no evidence of later rebuilding in this area.  The centre of the site was used for later Roman pitting and refuse disposal.  Overlying these layers was a deep deposit of black silt, probably deposited in the 3rd-4th centuries AD (as dated from pottery) and possibly used for agricultural purposes.Several deep Saxo-Norman pits were excavated, containing pottery including imported Ardenne wares, Stamford wares and early medieval sandy wares.  Later medieval remains consisted of large, deep, square-cut chalk and ragstone foundations, probably relating to buildings along Milk Street. There was also a set of greensand steps within chalk walls leading down to an unexcavated cellar against the eastern boundary of the site.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2006&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a65i22lffotr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0907900496596046,51.5140625586942]}},{"properties":{"name":"1-2 Kirby Street, 29-31 Grenville Street, EC1","description":"1-2 Kirby Street, 29-31 Grenville Street, EC1 TQ 31440 81775 MoLAS (David Sankey) watching brief June 2006 Summerpark Homes Ltd KYG06Geotechnical works were monitored.

CIP05Following work in 2005, three evaluation trial pits (TPs 1–3) and nine archaeological boreholes were excavated. The borehole evaluation indicated that a basement had removed all archaeological deposits within and along the north site limit. The trial pits were located within and along the west site limit in the north-west corner.TP1 was located on the south side of the existing car park ramp and revealed external Roman waste and levelling layers abutting or cut by a possible E–W aligned Roman wall. A substantial medieval chalk foundation truncated the Roman layers on what appeared to be the same alignment as the earlier wall. This chalk foundation was probably associated with the church of St Mary Magdalen, known to have been on this part of the site by 1275. Post-medieval features included a probable 18th century brick drain and culvert, both of which are likely to be associated with buildings fronting Cheapside. Two 19th century walls are probably associated with the public house and buildings seen to the south on the 1873 Ordnance Survey map, rather than the City of London School, which is slightly too far north.TP2 was located on the north side of the existing car park ramp. A deep backfilled foundation cut for the second level basement had removed the majority of the archaeology apart from a narrow strip on the western side. Re-deposited brickearth was recorded overlying natural brickearth. This deposit was truncated by a N–S line of postholes, probably representing an external fence-line or property boundary. The postholes were sealed by external Roman ground-raising dump layers and rubbish pits, below a sequence of Roman floor surfaces and a small fragment of ragstone wall. They were cut to the south by a later, probably, medieval cess or rubbish pit.TP3 was located in the single basement of the former Pizza Express restaurant. The foundation cut for the second level basement had also removed most of the archaeology in the pit, with the exception of a small triangular area in the NW corner. A small, shallow remnant of a possible beam slot truncated a layer of re-worked brickearth, which sealed the in situ natural ground. The beam slot was sealed by a sequence of Roman made ground or dumped deposits. Some of these layers were truncated on the south side by a later pit, probably also Roman though no dating evidence was recovered.A relatively small pottery assemblage dated the Roman sequences from the mid 1st to the late 3rd century AD.

The present building is of four storeys, with a brick built cellar below.  There are a series of additional structures to the rear and the south of the building, ranging in height from single to three storeys. The most recent is a single storey modern extension, however some of these structures, in particular those housing stairwells, (such as that at the north-east corner), may have been built contemporaneously or soon after the main body of the building.The remainder of the buildings on the site consist of structures used as factory and warehouse premises; originally however the buildings housed a billiards hall and a removals company. Most recently the site was used as the premises of the Commercial Colour Press. The use of the site for industrial purposes dates back to around 1940, and before the print works, a clothing factory and metal stamp works occupied the area.  Both the historic map evidence and the surviving structures show a gradual in-filling of the area associated with the industry on the site, with rear warehouses and the ranges of small warehouses around the yard area being the most recently constructed. The majority of the present buildings on the site have been recently re-roofed with corrugated asbestos sheets. Similarly many of the window frames of the buildings are of modern construction, presumably replacing the original wooden frames in the same apertures.Terrace gravels were recorded at between 9.64m OD and 9.96m OD in the southern area of the site within trench 1.  At the northern end of the site natural deposits recorded in evaluation trench 3, consisting of light grey and light orange clays, occurred at between 10.07m OD and 10.14m OD.

A watching brief was undertaken on smaller diameter piles.Natural orange terrace gravels were overlain by natural brickearth.  The earliest activity was the construction of a gravel road during the mid 1st century AD.  This ran NE-SW across the site, dividing it into two zones with occupation on the northern side towards the fort and amphitheatre, while the open area on the south side was used for pitting. This appears to have been a back road than a major thoroughfare. The metalled gravels were interspersed with silty deposits, indicating it had not been regularly maintained.Situated against the northern side of the road was a large Roman building constructed on deep cut stone foundations, although these and the internal surfaces had been robbed and truncated during the late 1st century AD.  The northern and southern external walls were excavated, allowing a reconstruction of the ground-plan.Later Roman activity consisted of clay-and-timber buildings constructed over the robbed remains of the large stone building. These were also oriented against the road and were later destroyed in a fire. During the 3rd-4th centuries the area was used for pits, from which a substantial amount of tesserae and building material from the large building were recovered.During the 12th century several buildings were constructed on the site, with gravel and chalk foundations representing ground plans of buildings that may have been constructed of timber above ground. Later medieval activity was centred around the northern side of the site with two largely intact ragstone and chalk built cellars relating to the Gresham Street frontage.These dated to the 14th century but included some reused Roman building material. The backfills contained many finds, including a leather scabbard decorated with a stamped <em>fleur de lys</em> pattern. Elsewhere other 14th century walls and foundations denoted the presence of other cess pits and buildings in the area. These can be related back to existing properties using documentary information.

It originally had an L-shaped plan and comprised a basement of reduced height extending under the hall, a ground floor and 1st floor. The exterior walls were constructed of dull pink bricks and lime mortar, covered externally with a cement render. There were three chimney stacks, one at the south end of the building and two to the north and the hipped roof was covered with slates. The front door was placed centrally and the windows arranged symmetrically; two on the ground floor and three on the 1st floor. The building had a central hall and staircase leading to the 1st floor and a scullery behind, one room south of the hall, and two to the north. Internal walls were constructed of timber studs and bracing with brick nogging, and except for the partition wall under the stairs, were covered with plaster. A later single storey kitchen extension was constructed in the south-west corner of the ground floor. The 1st floor plan was largely identical to that of the ground floor.

It has a central tower and friezes depicting Tudor roses, horse shoes and cherubs. Internally, the floors are supported by cast-iron beams, carried on load bearing walls. A two-storey brick extension was constructed at the rear of the building between 1875 and 1893, when the Horse Shoe Brewery Tap, south of the hotel, was demolished and a range of iron frame construction, outwardly matching that of 1875, was constructed. This incorporated a bar, staff accommodation and a kitchen on the 4th floor. The hotel was extended to the east in 1929, on the yard of the former Meux’s Horse Shoe Brewery. An iron framed red brick building comprising a basement, ground floor and two upper floors, was constructed. The ground and 1st floors contained a grill room and restaurant, and the 2nd floor housed the Masonic Temple, and its domed roof, the interior of which was decorated with stars.

Assessment of three buildings on the west bank of Wenlock Basin, south of the Regent’s Canal in Hackney, has found evidence for their construction, use and development during the 20th century. At the south end of the site, a three and four-storey factory and warehouse, mainly in brick, may be partly late 19th or early 20th-century in origin, but its western half was rebuilt in the late 1920s, replacing a public house called ‘Bridge House’, and both halves have been further modified since then. A central brick-clad steel-framed building was constructed in the late 1930s and functioned as a pharmaceutical factory until the 1970s. A third building in the north of the site was built in the early 1990s, partly on the site of a 19th-century coal depot and coke ovens. These buildings are typical of commercial, light industrial and, later, office buildings of their time, and are judged to be of relatively minor architectural and historic significance, insufficient to justify their statutory or local listing.A watching brief revealed horizontally truncated natural deposits comprising bedded layers of sands and gravels from the Hackney gravel terraces at c 17.5–18.0m OD across the site.

The results have refined the findings of the earlier excavations; The main density of quarry pits, at the bottom of the Roman sequence, was found in the central zone of the site, mid-way between Cheapside to the north and Watling Street to the south. Several quarry pits were found to have removed the natural gravel down to the London Clay at <em>c</em> 7.3m OD. The quarry pits appear to have been left open until being levelled on mass by a huge clearance dump, presumably from domestic properties to the north and south.Evidence for these properties consisted of beaten earth floors and hearths, and several possible beam slots and burnt in situ planking suggest the alignment of these buildings. Relatively large of glass waste suggest glass-working on the site although no furnaces had been positively identified. Other significant finds include a Venus figurine and a glass cameo depicting Hercules and Iolas, the only one of its type found in Britain.Whether the disuse of the properties and the levelling to the quarry pits to their rear is contemporary is yet to be proved, but the site does appear to have gone out of use by the third century AD. However pockets of later Roman material suggest a different land use rather than disuse. Further slots through the Roman road to the north of the site indicate it had a metalled ‘side-walk’ between the southern drainage ditch and the properties.It was previously thought there was no Saxon activity on the site but several pits at the Watling Street end of the site, contained loom weights, lava quernstones and bone combs, typical of Saxon activity.  Large chalk foundations of medieval properties that fronted on to Bow Churchyard were on the east side of the site. One building had extra deep foundations to compensate for the underlying soft ground caused by the backfill of the early Roman quarry pits.

A geophysical survey was undertaken in Bruce Castle Park to the north of Bruce Castle Museum which located a number of anomalies which were interpreted as the possible remains of a significant building and a possible kiln or furnace.  Two evaluation trenches were excavated, revealing only sterile subsoil overlying natural gravel and brickearth.Two further evaluation trenches were opened closer to the house, one at the front adjoining the free-standing Tudor round tower and one at the rear of the building.  The rear trench produced two brick culverted drains of probable 18th-century date and a small section of an earlier (medieval) chalk footing.  The front trench revealed a finds-rich dump of 19th-century domestic rubbish.  The subsequent Community Archaeology Project consisted of two trenches which enlarged on and incorporated the evaluation trenches.The trench at the front of the house was also designed to investigate a small section of the base of the Tudor tower, which curiously incorporated 7 (now largely buried) integral arches of uncertain function around its S and W sides.The rubbish deposit filled the upper levels of a massive and deep hollow which overlay the original construction cut around the south side of the tower - with finds including ruled writing slates, broken slate pencils, and even a toothbrush with its owner’s name – all legacy of a time when Bruce Castle was a boarding school. The owner, Sir Rowland Hill, had a teaching system that was unusual for its day, relying on rewards rather than punishments. Dozens of the tokens that he gave out for good work were also found during the dig.With the removal of the 19th-century fills, two of the buried arches at the base of the tower were exposed revealing narrow cruciform cross-loop windows in each opening neatly made out of chamfered bricks. These windows or vents confirmed that the tower had been purposely built to a much lower level than the rest of the house. It is clear that the tower would have originally been open to a considerable depth around its south and west sides - and the most logical explanation for this is that it was originally designed to be partly surrounded by water. The source of the water would undoubtedly have been the Moselle stream which runs about 100m to the west of the tower – on its course from Muswell Hill to the Lea. Given the investment both in time and labour in building the tower, it would seem unlikely that the water was not originally utilised as the supply for the house with the tower in effect being a water distribution point, possibly similar to the one shown on the medieval London Charterhouse waterworks plan. Interestingly, it is documented that in the mid-19th century near to the tower was a deep well connected by a pipe with an engine-pump under the tower, to feed a cistern above, from which the water was distributed about the mansion.The trench to the rear of the house revealed the south-east corner of a chalk founded medieval building - which had been truncated a complex system of 18th century brick drains which took waste water away from the house. These converged into a large brick soak-away (added in the 19th century) before continuing downhill, probably towards a pond on the estate boundary.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2006&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a65i22ikpose"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0741244,51.6002344]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chambers Wharf, Chambers Street, Bermondsey, London SE16","description":"Chambers Wharf, Chambers Street, Bermondsey, London SE16 TQ 34310 79740 MoLAS (Portia Askew) geoarchaeological evaluation Nov 2006 St Martins Property Corporation Limited CHJ06A total of ten geotechnical pits were monitored of which five, on the southern side of the site, reached a maximum depth five metres and revealed horizontally stratified waterlain clay, sand and silts (possible palaeochannel).

The grounds had been redesigned in the early 18th century to include a deer park with ha-ha (boundary ditch), a deer house, an ornamental ‘amphitheatre’, a temple modelled on the Pantheon in Rome, and a gate designed by Inigo Jones.In most of these pits, the ground surface had been truncated and earlier remains removed by the landscaping and even where earlier soils survived these had been reworked by root action.   Investigations also revealed a buried garden wall foundation on the west side of the Deer House and running perpendicular to the ha-ha (and thought to indicate part of the earlier garden layout).  The ha-ha wall was traced across the path north of the Inigo Jones gate, and the deer house was also discovered to be built on the line of the ha-ha.   All the foundations observed were constructed from bricks of Jacobean type, suggesting either reuse of earlier building material, or 17th/18th-century manufacture of this form of brick.Monitoring of geotechnical work on the French Drain on the south side of the Link Building revealed foundations of hard, dark-red brick and creamy lime mortar (both with added coal dust or ash).  These are consistent with the remains of the Wing Building that subsumed the Link Building in 1805.

Natural flood plain gravels, overlain by a pre-Roman organic soil horizon sealed by fluvial deposits, suggested the site was on high ground on the northern edge of a palaeo-channel.Late 1st-century clay-and-timber buildings were constructed over early Roman ground-raising dumps.  One building contained a silver snakes-head finger ring.  These buildings probably fronted the western side of Watling/Stane Street, and yard surfaces, a clay oven and a possible animal pen were recorded behind them.  The latest Roman feature was a rubbish pit dated 250-400AD.The medieval church was represented by truncated fragmentary masonry foundations, interpreted as elements of the original nave and chancel. The church was extended eastwards and a south chapel was added to the nave but apparently later demolished when two asymmetrical chapels/transepts were constructed.  Within the pre-1733 church were c.60 burials, while under the eastern portion were another 103 burials interpreted as part of an external medieval cemetery which probably remained in use until the 17th-century despite the eastward extension.A major rebuilding occurred pre-1733 and a date of 1629 is suggested by documentary evidence.  This appears to have incorporated the transept of the chapel on the south side of the medieval church and involved the rebuilding of the north aisle (represented by five chalk-rubble pier bases) and probably the eastward extension of the south aisle (evidenced by a single base). These confirm that the pre-1730s church was at least 22m long internally and aligned differently from the present church. Excavation of the pier bases also revealed fragments of moulded Tudor architectural terracotta believed to be reused material from the Duke of Suffolk’s London residence (Brandon or Suffolk Place) on the opposite side of Borough High Street.By 1732 the church was described as ‘ruinious’, and was rebuilt in brick in 1734-36.  A barrel-vaulted crypt was constructed under the central body of the church, with inhumations inserted into the north and south aisles.  The crypt was cleared in 1899 and probably at this time many coffins were placed in a large pit dug under the crypt floor.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2006&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a65i22xvog7s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0926917,51.5012958]}},{"properties":{"name":"City Bunhill Burial Ground, Golden Lane/Whitecross Street, EC1","description":"City Bunhill Burial Ground, Golden Lane/Whitecross Street, EC1 TQ 32390 82040 MoLAS (Adrian Miles) excavation April-July 2006 London Borough of Islington GDA06The excavated area consisted of part of the post-medieval burial ground which was occupied by graveyard burials.

Adjacent to the brick footing was a post-medieval brick and ceramic drain channel partially cut into an earlier greensand structure.The third pit contained modern cobbles and concrete over a large amount of randomly placed brick walls and infilling of uncoursed bricks.  This may have been foundations to support the former Cloister floor of tile or slabs and/or the remains of earlier kitchen buildings.  A greensand foundation mixed with yellow brick was recorded in the south-east side of the pit, suggesting that the stone has been reused or the wall has been rebuilt during the post-medieval period.  Below the walls was a possible crushed Caen stone rubble layer from which two tile fragments and a pot sherd of probable post-medieval date were recovered.The last test pit was excavated in the north-west corner of the court and revealed modern concrete over post-medieval drainage channels and probably contemporary brick walls.  One drain emerges from the west side of the test pit and empties into a larger channel which emerges from the north Cloister wall and runs south.  Brickwork beneath and parallel with the north side of the Cloister appears to be of a later date than the brickwork of the drains and may have been constructed to block the main drain channel exiting the cloister alley.

Another to the E, at 12 Dalston Lane, was converted into the entrance to a permanent circus, shortly after the latter was built on the former gardens of the villas, to the S. The circus building, designed by A Brandreth and opened in 1886 as the ‘N London Colosseum and National Hippodrome’, was a large rectangular brick shell, originally with an internal gallery around all four walls, round-arched windows above, doors to stables further to the S and another entrance to the W, on Roseberry Place. Villas to the W were replaced by terraced houses in the 1880s, and single-storey shop-fronts added to both houses and villas, replacing their front gardens. The circus was then rebuilt as a variety theatre, ‘Dalston Theatre’, designed by G B Wright and opened in 1898, using the existing brick shell, into which a proscenium arch was inserted with the stage to the E over a cellar; existing staircases in the NW and SW corners were rebuilt, blocking the stable doors to the S.The theatre was subsequently rebuilt as a ‘super-cinema’, ‘Dalston Picture House’, in 1919(21, one of the first of its type in London, to designs by F E Jones and R Cromie. The proscenium arch was cut back, ground level progressively reduced to the E to form raked stalls, the side-walls were raised and reinforced, and steel girders inserted, supporting a single upper tier of seats on a steel-reinforced concrete floor. The E wall was rebuilt and a screen painted on its internal face, above a narrow stage, stairs and passages were added to N and S in reinforced concrete, and two metal-truss hipped roofs constructed, that to the W at a higher level. The interior was lavishly decorated using classical Greek motifs. Under the upper tier, at 1st-floor level, was a tea-room. A plenum ventilation system was constructed in a basement to the W. An organ was added <em>c</em> 1927, after Gaumont acquired the cinema, and the screen, projection box and air-conditioning were enlarged in the 1950s. After the cinema closed in 1960 the tea-room and rear stalls were converted to night-clubs, ‘The Four Aces’ and ‘The Labyrinth’, but from the mid-1990s the building was disused and derelict.

Samples of material have also been taken from some of the boreholes for radiocarbon dating, which has provided a spread of dates ranging from the Late Glacial (12,000 years ago) to the Saxon period and these results are being used to place the models created into an archaeological timescale.

Other features located included later glassworks brick structures and later Victorian-era features. Excavation of the site followed directly from evaluation.Excavation opened up a single open area around the notable features and located an early set of kilns, associated floors, working surfaces and a brick well within which was found a well-preserved wicker basket. Large dumps of kiln waste covered much of these features. Later phases of activity were represented by substantial brick buildings, thought to be working areas were also uncovered with a series of kiln flues, brick floors and barrel-lined pits containing clay. The latest phase of the pottery kiln comprised a large surviving pottery kiln with associated flues, drains, cobbled and tiled yard surfaces.The demise of the kiln came in 1748-9 and an earthquake in March 1750 destroyed some of the extant structures. Later occupation included a small glass house which re-used some of the structures and left dumps of waste glass and glass working residues. The site continued to be used for light industrial use with the northern portion used for small industrial buildings; these are evident in the 18th and 19th century building foundations and deposits located. Evidence of wartime activities resulted in the discovery of a cache of arms and empty shells dated to World War Two, evidently left in situ.The remains discovered are an important addition to the local industrial usage of the local area from first development in the late 17th century through to the Victorian period, notably as pottery finds from the kilns can be related directly to the point of manufacture.

Two landscape zones (LZ’s) were identified across the site where a similar sequence of deposits with differing levels of palaeoenvironmental and archaeological potential exist.LZ 1 occurs towards the northern periphery of the site and consists of a sequence of Pleistocene gravels overlain by a series of fine gravels, clays and sands indicative of a Holocene channel. The sands and gravels represent the formation of channel bars, point bars and riffles and pools within the streambed. The channel appears to form a tributary of the Lea flowing roughly along an east to west orientation, and may represent a former course of the Dagenham brook.  Radiocarbon dating of organic material within these deposits produced two dates from the Neolithic period (c. 2800 BC). This suggested that the channel was active during the early Neolithic period, but may have become abandoned by the Bronze Age due to a high sediment load obstructing the flow of the channel.Although dry land occupation is unlikely to occur within this zone, exposed vegetated channel bars adjacent to the active channel may have provided suitable locations for Mesolithic hunter gatherer activity.Once the channel ceased to flow, alluvial clays deposited through overbank flooding inundated the site. These alluvial clays essentially formed a seasonally dry soil horizon. However, with rising river levels alluvial accumulation continued into the historic period with conditions becoming predominately wetter, with the development of a grass meadow environment across the site. Deposits of made ground measuring up to 3m in thickness buried the alluvial clays.Within LZ 2 the Pleistocene gravels were overlain by a fine grained deposit of a possible Pleistocene date. The deposit was probably deposited by fluvial processes with some input of wind blown material in a periglacial landscape. During the Holocene period this deposit formed a dry land surface suitable for occupation. Prehistoric features may be found to cut through this horizon down into the underlying gravels. The buried land surface was sealed by a sequence of alluvial clays contemporary and of the same nature as those identified within LZ 1.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2006&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a65i22vx7fyr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0243228,51.5645428]}},{"properties":{"name":"One New Change, London EC4","description":"One New Change, London EC4 TQ 32250 81130 MoLAS (Portia Askew) evaluation and geoarchaeological evaluation November 2006 Land Securities plc NCG05Following work in 2005, evaluation and window sampling was carried out.

Earlier in the burial sequence was a high-status Saxon burial, which contained a silver ring in the area of the left hand, a small green glass palm cup by the right foot and a copper hanging bowl by the left foot. The hanging bowl contained hazelnuts, a pagan symbol of rebirth.The backfill of an E-W linear cut in Area 4B contained items of jewellery, again dating to between the late 6th / early 7th-century AD.

The skeleton belonged to a man who died in his mid 40s and was about 5’6&amp;quot; in height. A radiocarbon date from the right femur gave a middle date of 410AD for the burial; this is contemporary with the tile kiln which was recorded during excavations in the South Terrace of the church in 2005.In Area 10, situated to the east of the church, a total of 88 coffin remains were recorded; this included lead name plates, iron coffin handles decorated with cherubs, copper alloy ornamental fittings and numerous copper alloy rivets. Two post-medieval brick-lined wells were also recorded.A number of Saxon pits were recorded in Area 10 and also during the concurrent watching brief of Area 3, which covered the northern and north-eastern areas of the churchyard.

Parts of the medieval cloister were exposed and protected within the landscaping (which includes a partial representation of the cloister and chapter house). Areas surviving to a higher level than had previously been exposed were protected within the foundation of new walls representing the cloister.Significant new details were added to observations made during the evaluation. These included the external threshold and the western range which had 3 long panels of diagonally laid Purbeck slabs, 2 slabs wide towards the outside, 1.5 in the centre and 1 slab wide to the inside. This contrasts with panels of equal thickness on the eastern range (1.5 slabs wide). Comparison of stone from the cloister wall with the Museum of London’s comparative collection indicated that the yellow limestone of which they were made came from Taynton (near Burford, Oxfordshire) rather than Caen. Detailed examination of the fabric of the masonry indicated reused material in the walls so their immediate source was probably buildings which stood nearby before the cloister was built. It is possible that the stone came from more than one source.A large stone and red brick curved foundation was also exposed.  This was possibly a temporary work for Inigo Jones’ or Wren’s St Paul's construction, measuring 1.8m by at least 9m. It has never before been recorded and its precise function is unknown although had it been a permanent structure some record of it might be expected.  Below it was a large red-brick culvert built by Wren. It is moot whether the foundation was built over the culvert (and was therefore later) or the culvert was tunnelled beneath the foundation.

The northernmost of these buildings being St Swithin’s House where Ivor Noël Hume undertook a limited watching brief in 1949 during which important ‘multi-period’ remains were recorded – although tragically the majority of the archaeology in this area was destroyed during the creation of new basements.  The evaluation confirmed that although all horizontal archaeology had been removed, although archaeological remains survived beneath the shallower basements of Walbrook House and Granite House and beneath an external E-W service road between these buildings and St Swithin’s House.The earliest features to be defined in this area during the subsequent excavation were a sequence of 4 closely aligned N-S ditches cut into the natural gravel on the east side of the site. The earliest of these both had ‘V-cut’ profiles, with the larger eastern ditch producing  an assemblage of late-Iron Age pottery – the first time that finds of this date have been found in a well-defined feature on an archaeological site in the City of London.  The unusually large size and profile of this ditch suggests that it represents the west side of the defences around a large fortified enclosure around a military zone established immediately after the Roman conquest in AD 43. The enclosed area could in effect represent the limits of the early Roman city, which was later to expand outwards in all directions in the rebuilding and expansion following the Boudican revolt of AD 60-61.In the rebuilding that took place after the Boudican revolt, a N-S aligned road was laid out across the site over three of the early ditches described above – with the full width of this road, its ditches and portions of the buildings along its edges being defined. The earliest buildings were clay and timber but were subsequently replaced by more robust stone-founded buildings – which had been laid out along both sides of the road by the late 1st-century – with the eastern range possibly incorporating a colonnade or open portico along its frontage. Although the majority of the internal floor surfaces were composed of brickearth, in the north-west corner of the building there was a section of carbonised timber flooring – which clearly represented floorboards and joists in two adjoining rooms. The burnt remains of this floor and the adjoining masonry walls of the building were sealed beneath layers of destruction debris – assumed to be fire debris derived from the Hadrianic fire of AD 120-130.The frontage wall of the west range of buildings was unusually deep due to the presence of a massive and poorly consolidated 1st-century quarry pit below it - which had been filled with a large assemblage of deliberately fragmented animal bone. The practice of pulverising animal bone in this way has been noted on other Roman sites, and it is thought that it was done in order that the bones could be boiled-up so that the grease and fats that they contained could be extracted – possibly for use in the treatment of harnesses or other leather goods.Unusually, no medieval masonry (wall foundations, wells or cesspit linings) was found in the excavated area although a large number of inter-cutting pits were present – especially in the western half of the area. The only walls to be found were post-medieval in date, with the best-surviving of these being a substantial east-west aligned brick wall and associated brick-lined cesspit – which was defined along the southern edge of the area. The final disuse fills in the cesspit produced a large assemblage of mid 18th-century domestic refuse – which included complete wine bottles, a diverse range of pottery and clay tobacco pipes.
