The area is a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe lake is 2,120 m long and 1,380 m wide, with a maximum depth of 30.6 metres. The lake is situated in a picturesque environment, surrounded by mountains and forests. A medieval castle stands above the lake on the north shore. The only natural island in Slovenia is situated on the lake. The island has several buildings, the main one being the Assumption of Mary\\'s Pilgrimage Church (Slovenian: Cerkev Marijinega vnebovzetja), built in the 15th century,<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal8iiowvy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.1095352173,46.3682527543]}},{"properties":{"name":"Budapest, Hungary","description":"Posted by Madcapfliesfree<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/12/2/Hungary_Budapest_Panorama.jpg\">With its multifarious and often embittered history, incredible architecture and rich cultural heritage, Hungary\\'s capital deserves its reputation as the \\'Paris of Central Europe\\'.

The booming tourist industry that was interrupted by war in the early 1990s has swept back in force, and visitors are flocking to its string of coastal and island resorts.\n\nThe aura of medieval Croatia endures in the cobbled streets of Rovinj and the recently restored other-worldliness of Dubrovnik\\'s Stari Grad. The country is also home to some of Europe\\'s finest Roman ruins, including the immense palace of Diocletian in Split and Pula\\'s amphitheatre.\n\nFrom the ruinous break-up of former Yugoslavia, Croatia emerged as an independent country composed of two contrasting cultures. The long stretch of coast that runs from Istria to Dalmatia bears a strong Italian influence, while the interior has a strong central European flavour. But it\\'s Croatia\\'s appeal as a sun \\'n\\' sea destination that lures millions of holidaymakers. The yachting crowd has sprinkled glitter on the islands of Hvar and Korčula while cruise lines have made Dubrovnik an essential port of call on their Mediterranean circuit.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal842l4c8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[18.091389,42.650555]}},{"properties":{"name":"Edinburgh, Scotalnd","description":"Posted by MadcapfliesfreeEdinburgh<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal87cp2eu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.18753,55.950152]}},{"properties":{"name":"Istanbul","description":"Posted by Madcapfliesfree<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal8ca43zx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.9736938477,41.0503595193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","description":"Posted by Madcapfliesfree<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> Karlovy Varyalso known as Carlsbad is the most important Czech spa with a 600-year-old tradition.

It\\'s also the biggest city in the country and the political, cultural and commercial centre. With a population of around 300,000 it has the intimacy of a small town mixed with the cultural heritage and cosmopolitan feel of a vibrant city.\n\nThe stunning old town is nestled between a hill topped with a castle and the gently flowing Ljubljanica river. The banks of the river and many other important buildings were designed by local architect, Jože Plečnik (1872-1957). When strolling through the streets of Ljubljana you can see the remains of the Roman settlement Emona, the medieval old town, the many works of Plečnik and modern buildings blended with parks and squares.\n\nThe history of the city begins some 5,000 years ago with \"marsh dwellers\" inhabiting the boggy barje (marsh lands) near the city, and continues through the time of Roman Emona, followed by the medieval city under the castle. Over the last century, Ljubljana has experienced its highest rate of growth, becoming more important as the political and educational centre of Slovenia. With Slovenia becoming independent in 1991, it has become one of the smallest capitals in Europe. \n\nSlovenia joined the European Union on May 1, 2004 and is set to transition to the Euro on January 1, 2007.\n\nYou can walk through the city in a couple of hours. If you have an entire day you can see almost all of the sights worth visiting. If you stay longer, Ljubljana is a great starting point to see the rest of Slovenia. Within a two hour drive you can see the Adriatic Sea, alpine mountains, the Karst (full of magical caves), the Panonian lowland, and a sub-alpine world of enormous beauty.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal8arepcd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.512939,46.050361]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mucha Museuem","description":"Posted by Madcapfliesfree<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Pranska Prague 1The world´s first Mucha Museum, dedicated to the life and work of the world-acclaimed Czech ART NOUVEAU artist Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939), is housed in the Baroque Kaunický Palace in the very heart of Prague.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal86cjjq9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.407886,50.079585]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palermo, Sicily","description":"Posted by MadcapfliesfreeHome!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal8ill6qs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.38135,38.13888]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris, France","description":"Posted by Madcapfliesfreeparis, franceIt\\'s Paris.

Either the person will stare at you with a blank look on their face that says they have no clue who or what a Slovenia is, or they will immediately break into a smile and tell you what a wonderful country Slovenia is these days.\n\nIt might be small and it might not be familiar to some, but those in the know are fully aware that Slovenia is one of Europe\\'s jewels. A country that used to be part of Yugoslavia, Slovenia largely escaped the bloodshed and destruction that most of us associate with the Balkans. While it was part of Yugoslavia, Slovenia was economically more prosperous than many parts of the region. Today, it is a well developed country that is firmly aligned with Western Europe. \n\nThe city where most that travel to Slovenia inevitably end up is Ljubljana, a splendid capital with a history that dates back before the Romans. In addition to being home to the world\\'s largest digital clock (you\\'ll have no excuse for being late!), Ljubljana has fascinating architecture which includes a castle overlooking the main city that has been around for centuries.\n\nAnother chief attraction for visitors to Slovenia is the mountains. The countryside is absolutely stunning and offers up some of the finest and most affordable skiing in all of Europe. In the summer months, you can get in some awesome hikes without the crowds you experience in other parts of the Alps. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aal8826ek5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.995463,46.151241]}},{"properties":{"name":"Switzerland","description":"Posted by MadcapfliesfreeSwitzerland may be neutral but it is certainly not flavourless.
