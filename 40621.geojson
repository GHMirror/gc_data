The Portus Project is a continuation of a successful research collaboration between the University of Southampton, the British School at Rome (BSR), the University of Cambridge and the Soprintendenza di Beni Archeologici di Ostia.\nThe Portus Project includes multiple seasons of survey in the land lying to the south of the port, as well as the excavation of a central area within the port itself, in order to provide answers to a number of key questions about Portus\\' character and development, its regional context and relationship to Ostia, and its connections to other ports in Italy and the Mediterranean.\nThe excavation will apply an integrated suite of techniques not generally used on complex Mediterranean sites with major structural remains, including digital recording and visualization. This exceptionally rich and challenging site provides young academics and students with experience and training in site and survey techniques, electronic data-capture and in the identification and analysis of artefacts, fauna and botanical remains.
