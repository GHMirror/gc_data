My wife and a friend and I swam out about a half-mile into the Pacific to snorkel over a reef. \n\nI noticed, at first with nervousness, and later with alarm, that the sharp rocks of the reef were coming within inches of my stomach. I also noticed I was so out of breath that I started hyperventilating. I couldn\\'t go vertical to get my head above water because of the rocks, and then, of course, I lost a fin.

She was like water to a dying man. Two years into our relationship, she died in a plane crash, shortly before our scheduled trip to Ireland. \n\nCompletely distraught and beyond anguish, I sat here on the cliffs 200ft above the rocky ocean shore. Two things suddenly happened: I began to remember, in extreme detail, our every moment together, things I\\'d long forgotten, smells, places and her words to me. And then, clearly, I could HEAR HER VOICE above the crashing of the waves, calling to me. \n\nFor four hours or so, I sat staring at the rocks below, wind gusts pushing me forward and back, thinking that if I jumped, I\\'d see her much sooner. And that felt like a really, REALLY good idea. \n\nBut after considering my children and what their life would be like without me, I reluctantly climbed back down to start a new life without her in this new parallel universe in which she was dead and I\\'d never see her again.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byjkbkux98"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-10.4707,52.108139]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Hughes Family, 1850","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\" href=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\">Weave</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Dublin, IrelandEmigrants from Ireland gave me my high-tolerance liver and my sarcastic, joking outlook on life.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byjk5hf1qe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.266155,53.345223]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Itoman Family, 1900","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\" href=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\">Weave</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/10/13022864_a6677ec492_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Japanese fisherman also feature prominently in my family history...<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byjkabpkrg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[125.248947,24.935012]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Thompson Family, 1860","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\" href=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\">Weave</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Somerby, Leicestershire, EnglandYou know you\\'re English when one of your ancestors is named Thomas Thompson.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byjk7tacka"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.847492,52.686997]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Waber Family, 1600","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\" href=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\">Weave</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> oberdorfThe village of Oberdorf in Canton Basel is a tiny town of 3,000, nestled high in a mountain valley.
