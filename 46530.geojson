One Mardi Gras, I was standing with a group of friends and family on St. Charles Avenue, awaiting the start of a Carnival parade. At that location, the crowd was about 10-12 people deep, and while we were a bit loosely arranged, we had our spots to stand and we were somewhat territorial about them. The parade began to roll. Just as the first band swung around the corner, horns blaring, and the crowd pressed gently forward against the police barricade in anticipation, a deep voice from the back boomed out. \"Baby\\'s first Mardi Gras! Baby\\'s first Mardi Gras!\" An older black man with a small toddler girl sitting on his shoulders was making the announcement, and despite getting there early to stake out the choice spots, despite the way we\\'d all held our ground, the crowd--young and old, black and white, New Orleanian and tourist--parted like the Red Sea. \"Baby\\'s first Mardi Gras\"--without even verbalizing it, we all realized how sacred this was, and made way for the man and his baby granddaughter. As the band went by, I\\'m sure that little girl, all the way in the front row, was feeling the vibration of the drums in her chest, a sensation she would remember and treasure all her life.\n\nRev.

Friday became a very interesting day when Jay and I found ourselves on a balcony of Temptations strip club standing next to Opie and Anthony (from WNEW in the NY area). Mardi Gras was as always a great time with lots of great people. Dave, Kent and Eric, first timers, enjoyed thoroughly and got into the swing of what Mardi gras is about within 10 minutes of arrival.

The New Orleans, La., Police wants to remind revelers that an old Mardi Gras Carnival tradition -- throwing beads from balconies as a reward to women who bare their breasts -- is illegal on two counts. Tossing anything from a balcony is illegal, and has been since 1956, they say, and baring breasts is illegal under indecent exposure laws. The police decided to remind people of the laws after Playboy magazine \"encouraged illegal behavior\" by giving tips on how to get the best photos of flashing women. \"There\\'s no huge crackdown on Carnival fun,\" a police spokesman insisted, but \"it would be irresponsible of us not to respond to [the article]. After all, we are the police department.\" (Reuters, 2000)\n\nI was actually in New Orleans last week, for the last few days of Carnival &amp; Mardi Gras. On Mardi Gras night, I was on the corner of Conti and Bourbon Street, quite drunk and \"earning\" lots of beads. At one point I walked over to a cop who was \"stationed\" near where I was standing, and talked to him for a moment. He told me he was \"a little upset\" with me. When I asked him why, he said because I\\'d been flashing. He then told me he thought it would only be fair if I flashed for him. I told him I would, but I didn\\'t want to get arrested.

I was working my way trying to provide a living for myself, an invalid mother and a son while trying to obtain a degree in college. My job at the time was that of a limousine driver. I mostly drove for funerals (I know morbid; but it\\'s what kept me financially afloat--pun intended--while I worked on that degree) but every Carnival season, we had lot\\'s of what were called \"special loads\" which mostly consisted of debutantes and other members of the court and Krewe of a parade that always ended up at the municipal auditorium for their ball.\n\nI got my special load, and had no idea who it was; but I knew it was the night of Bacchus, and that instead of the Municipal Auditorium, the extravaganza always ended with a huge party held, at that time, in the Rivergate located at the foot of Canal Street, near the river. The special load I and a friend of mine who was another driver had to pick up that night turned out to be none other than that year\\'s king-- Perry Como! We were flabbergasted, to say the least; and the thrill didn\\'t end there. We were given free tickets to sit in the special reviewing stands for a view of this, (which was undisputedly at the time THE most famous parade of the New Orleans pre-Mardi Gras Carnival) unbelievable event. People pay small fortunes to garner this kind of seating in the otherwise sea of humanity that lined the streets dozens of people deep as far down as the eye could see. We were toasted, and the throws and doubloons rained on us like a springtime shower, and to top it all off, we got to drive into the Rivergate (the floats always did this as well back then--right into the huge convention complex) and got to spend one of the most memorable nights of my life amongst celebrities, champagne, great food and an incredible night of fun and revelry that went well into the wee hours of the morning.\n\nJust one of many; but for whatever reason, that one always stood out as a very special night and parade for yours truly.\n\nDMS\n\n(http://www.wunderground.com/blog/Tricia/comment.html?entrynum=3&amp;tstamp=200601)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x84740148"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.066175,29.951737]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel Intercontinental-- formerly the Academy of Music","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://carlnivale.theatricana.com/nivale_images/LydiaThompson.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 444 Saint Charles Ave New Orleans, LA 70130Via Proffesor Carl Nivale Academic-at-Large:\n\nThe Academy of Music, the theatre in which Lydia Thompson performed \"If Ever I Cease to Love\" from the play \"Bluebeard\" stood on the site now occupied by the Hotel Intercontinental, near the corner of St. Charles Avenue and Poydras St.  I refer you to this passage from The Compendium:\n \n1872 was a banner year for Mardi Gras, seeing the premieres of the Knights of Momus parade on New Year\\'s Eve, and the visit of genuine royalty to New Orleans.  Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff came to the city early in the year, inspiring the creation of the School of Design  (the official name of the Rex Organization).  The Grand Duke attended a performance of a popular operetta called  Bluebeard at the  Academy of Music on St. Charles Avenue (where the Hotel Intercontinental now stands).  In the show was a young lady named Lydia Thompson, whom the Grand Duke had met before his arrival in the city.  In the show, she sang an unusual melody entitled \" If Ever I Cease to Love\" that was assumed to be a favourite of the Duke\\'s.  Rumour had it that there had been a courtship between the Grand Duke and Miss Thompson, though such an assignation was never proven.  However, in the best traditions of Carnival, the romantic rumours soon became acknowledged \"fact\" and \" If Ever I Cease to Love\" was adopted as the official song of Mardi Gras.  The Grand Duke was also given the honour of selecting the official colours for Mardi Gras, and using the heraldic traditions, selected purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.  These are also the colours of the House of Romanoff.   Several other traditions were established that same year, including  the tradition of keeping the identity of Rex a secret until Mardi Gras Day, and Rex\\'s arrival by riverboat at the foot of Canal Street at sunset on Lundi Gras evening. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x842nat5r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.0703,29.950061]}},{"properties":{"name":"Investigating College Choices","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.inetours.com/New_Orleans/images/FQ/history/718_St_Peter.jpg\">Who knew that Pat O\\'Brien\\'s offered courses?I went to Mardi Gras my senior year in high school, when we were allow two days off from my school in Houston to \"investigate college choices.\" Who knew that Pat O\\'Brien\\'s offered courses?\n\nI remember the feeling of being picked up off my feet by the crowd, and carrying my first drink in a to-go box on the streetcar later.

Forty businessmen got together and founded the Krewe of Rex, mounting a daytime parade in the archduke\\'s honor. The city\\'s upper-crust folks, always socially ambitious, decided to adopt the Romanoff household colors -- purple (signifying justice), green (faith), and gold (power) -- as the official Carnival colors. The local gentry also learned that the Grand Duke Alexis\\'s favorite song was a regrettable ditty called \"If I Ever Cease To Love\" from the New York musical Bluebeard that starred Ms. Thompson.

It used to be exciting when I was younger, but in my early 20s, I got pretty tired of all the traffic, tourists, inflated prices, etc., so I stopped going to the parades. A couple of years ago, however, I\\'d gotten a bit of momentary carnival spirit and decided that I might actually like to go out on Fat Tuesday. While pondering which of my friends I thought I might like to go with, I decided it would be most fun to go with my buddy Paul. He always has a good time every year. No sooner had I considered him as an option, then I had a flash of him getting arrested for smoking pot in Pirate\\'s Alley - a narrow alley alongside St. Louis Cathedral in the French Quarter.\n\nNow, I\\'ve seen Paul smoke publicly before, and he\\'s never had any problems with the law, so I don\\'t even know why I had that thought. I decided it was just silly, and my Mardi Gras Spirit was gone again within minutes.\n\nI stayed home watching TV on the big day, and got in bed a little after midnight. Thirty minutes later, my phone rang. It was a collect call from prison, from Paul, asking me to bail him out. I asked him what on earth had happened, and he said he\\'d gotten busted for smoking. I asked where he was, and he said Pirate\\'s Alley.
