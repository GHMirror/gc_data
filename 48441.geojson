Westerly directions are also fairly good. It\\'s the closest spot to New York City which allows for good kiting conditions in a fairly safe environment. Directions: the parking lot is only accessible from the eastbound side of the Belt Parkway. The pull-out for the lot is between Exit 9 (Knapp Street) and Exit 11 (Flatbush Avenue). Look for the round maroon restroom facility. <img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6950.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6927.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6928.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6930.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6933.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6937.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6942.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/gilgo/IMG_6946.jpg\">Resources; www.tristatekites.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7a4cy1dt3y9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.91855,40.58256]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sandy Hook","description":"Posted by KiteboardingWater:\n\nSandy Hook is like a mini Hatteras. Murky but relatively clean. Okay wave riding on ocean side. Good shallow flat water condition on bay side.\t  \n\nBeach:\n\nWide beautiful beach on ocean side. The bay has a good launch area on the south end. Watch out for winsurfers, powerline and pier pilings on north end. Do not launch everywhere, since it can be very dangerous! No kiter should be launching from across parking lot C (where windsurfers launches) under conditions described. Experience kiters who know the area may be able to get away with it (walking out into the water, low tide permitting) with assisted launch. The problem is that many newbies see kiters launching there an assume it\\'s ok. The only time it is safe to launch from this spot is N wind (or easterly). Otherwise, launch from the sandbar across from parking lot B, barely any bathers/no windsurfers, not power line, and lots of open space.\n\nWeather:\n\nWinter is too cold. Wetsuit needed in spring and autumn. Summer can be without.\n\n\nWind:\n\nNorth:\tsideshore \n\nNorthwest:\tsideonshore\n\nWest:\tonshore\n\nSouthwest:\tsideonshore\n\nSouth:\tsideshore\n\nSoutheast:\tsideonshore\n\nEast:\tonshore\n\nNortheast:\tsideonshore\n\n\n\t Best wind is from the South. Easterly wind is onshore on ocean side and offshore on bay side. Westerly is the opposite. Avoid westerly wind if on bayside because of the turbulance from the cliff on the western side of the bay. Bay is considered very good for beginners with South or Southwest wind. Best wind is in spring and fall.\n\nHow to get there:\n\nFrom New York City, take New Jersey Turnpike south to Garden State Parkway (exit 11). Take GS Parkway south to exit 117. Take Route 36 east for ten miles. Cross bridge and stay on right lane for Sandy Hook. Ferry service from Manhattan to Highlands, NJ, is another option, then take cab to Sandy Hook. Car trip is 1 hr and ten minutes from Holland Tunnel, Jersey side. Summer charge of 0 per vehicle.\n\nRules &amp; Restrictions:\n\nUsually no restriction on the bayside. On ocean side, off limit in swim areas in the summer when lifeguards are on duty. Easy parking if not on summer weekends. Awesome for downwinder with either South or North wind. there is an unwritten rule that restricts access to kitesurfers on the ocean side from memorial day to labour day. This rule has gained further credence with piping plovers that have decided to nest on the beach the last few seasons. If lifeguards don\\'t boot you, you are likely to get a summons from park rangers, who i\\'ve even seen pull kiters out of the water mid session. Given the fact that Sandy Hook is the premier kiting spot in close proximity to NYC and the Tri-State burbs, and because it works on most wind directions, the kiting crew is paranoid of any incidents or mishaps that could endanger access. As far as access on the bay most kiters and windsurfers launch from the 2nd parking lot after entering, parking lot C. In South and Southeast winds it is possible to park in the first parking lot and follow a sand path that may require wading though a shallow channel to a sandy spit of land that just out at the start of the park and marks the entrance of the Shrewsbury river. Bear in mind that on Southeast winds the conditions will be slightly side off so don\\'t go too far out and mark your point of exit at the far end of the beach or you could end up in NYC harbour. The advantage of this launch on Southerly wind directions is that it will place you up wind of the windsurfers who can number 20-30 on a good summers day. On Northwest park in lot C and make sure you launch upwind of the winsurfers but BEWARE OF A SEAWALL that can be submerged at high tide and is marked by buoys. The beach is pretty tight but there is a 50-100 foot buffer between the windsurfers and seawall which is clearly visible at low tide and can lurk inches submerged at high tide. Please make sure you face the bay when launching at C to avoid being dragged toward the powerlines that line the road next to the beach if you are lofted or lose your footing. If you can\\'t stay upwind you will go downwind through windsurfers, who are normally cool. Please give them right of way and make sure you have your exit point marked out on the spit of land at the south side of the park. If your kite crashes near the beach or you end up down wind pack it up and walk back. PLEASE don\\'t try to walk upwind or launch close to the rocks in low tide as any lofting or body drag will land you in the powerlines. At high tide if you end up down wind, parts of the shoreline will be rocky, so tread carefully. Avoid this beach on West or East winds as these are either directly onshore or offshore.\n\nSandy Hook - Best winds are NW (a bit gusty but the best location in Northern NJ for this common spring/fall wind direction) and Southerly winds. The summer SW thermal flow tends to become a S/SE steady breeze in this location which makes it for perfect side shore conditions both on the bay and on the ocean. During the summer weekend access can be problematic so consider getting there early as access is shot off once the parking lots are full.\n\n\nThis is a very popular site for windsurfers. Stay out of their way. Stay out of from coming to close to beach! There are power lines within 30 feet of the beach very close to the launch area that some people chose! If you can, use the ocean which is sometime restricted.\n Directions: Take exits 117 or 105 off the Garden State Parkway onto Route 36 south. Take 36 north to Highland Beach Road and continue to Gateway National Park. Enter Park and go to Lot C.\n<img src=\"http://www.newind.org/2006/Hook%26Barnegat%20May%206-7/IMG_0798.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7a4cxx51r36"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.98112,40.41039]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sandy Hook Slick","description":"Posted by KiteboardingSuper Flat water sheltered by tall grass.

However Robert Moses is a State Park and therefore launching and access is fairly regulated by State Rangers. During the summer season it is important to keep kiters away from all swimming dedicated areas which are patrolled by life guards. Once on the island go to the western most parking lot (it\\'s #2) and make sure you walk at least 1/4 mile west on the beach to distant yourself from the swimming area. Dominant wind direction is SW which is 40-50 degrees on shore direction this is the main reason why you\\'ll have to be extra careful choosing the proper launch area since SW winds will have you kite pretty much along the beach and therefore close to the swimming area. If you are a beginner and have problem staying upwind we recommend you walk an extra few hundred yards upwind. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7a4cxnb4vck"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.28792,40.62159]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/95079","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kiteboarding","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kiteboarding","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/95079","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=95079,platial:user=kiteboarding","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48441}
