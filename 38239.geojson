Not completely; academics are still great, and the community is still very close knit. But the spirits are falling with every new mass of mud that seemingly springs up every single day across campus. Construction has to happen here, and the students know this. Sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better, and perhaps that\\'s what\\'s going on across campus. Sod can\\'t be put down because it\\'s too cold - roots won\\'t take hold. But you would figure paths would at least be made clean.\n\nValpo is now exclusively a mud university. You can\\'t get from one side of campus to the other, in many cases from one building to another, without having your feet soaked in mud. This tends to piss people off. Smiles have pretty much deteriorated across campus, replaced by grimaces. The students used to hold their heads up, observing the beauty of campus in all seasons. Now, they have to keep their heads down to make sure they don\\'t lose a shoe in the increasing mire.\n\nIt\\'s been a while since I\\'ve heard a student not complain about the mud situation. It is quickly becoming the hot topic on campus, more so than the VUPD...and that\\'s saying something. I think that if it was discovered that the VUPD was laying down mud over the paths, war would erupt on campus. \n\nWe could have it a lot worse. There could be refrigerators sitting by the side of the road, rotting with old food. Cars could be upside down, and dead bodies could be in attic. But it\\'s been a good long time since the citizens of Valparaiso, IN, specifically the students on campus, have seen a hurricane plow through the area, so it\\'s safe to say the mud is just about as bad as it gets.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beum2qzxb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03895,41.46481]}},{"properties":{"name":"Desire","description":"Posted by Clentz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beuivi4s6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.06071,41.46763]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dreaming of more than pizza...","description":"Posted by Clentz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beug5hbl7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.37318,39.47207]}},{"properties":{"name":"Exodus","description":"Posted by ClentzDespite the amount of bashing I give Valparaiso for being a boring, dull, and ultimately a douldrom of a place, sometimes I find myself wondering what makes it so bad. According to my friends, the problem about Valpo is the lack of decent parties and girls \"who put out,\" to which I always say, \"Lame!\" There is more to college than parties and sex. Sometimes I don\\'t think half of the men here know that. Neveretheless, I can\\'t seem to stop the mass exodus to other campuses of men AND women on the weekends.\n\nI was talking to a couple friends the other day when they mentioned that they weren\\'t drinking in Valpo anymore, not going to any parties. \"It\\'s all the same,\" they said. \"The themes can change, the music can change, the places can change, but it\\'s still the same people.\" Their remedy: other colleges.\n\nMore than three quarters of my friends have been to Northern Illinois to party on the weekend. I\\'d venture to say just a little under that number have been to Illinois. A much smaller portion head to Southern Illinois in Carbondale, then there\\'s Illinois State, Notre Dame, and the occassional visit to Bloomington, IN to party at IU and Indianapolis for Butler. They go to these places, they drink, they have a good time for a weekend, then they come back and talk about leaving again.\n\nWe have been talking for weeks about place, specifically this area of Indiana and Valparaiso, on platial.com. Some positive remarks pop their heads out of the hiding places, but that\\'s rare. Most everyone seems to be caught up in the drudgery of this place, the level of boredom it can cause.\n\nBut have we pinpointed just why Valpo is the way it is?\n\nI\\'m not sure we have. We have discussed it in class, on this website, but it continues to remain elusive to me. Every weekend, it is as if the Valpo Hebrews escape the claws of the University Egyptians and head off to the promise land of Alcohol-Sex. Some of them make it and achieve what they were looking for. Some of them make it and don\\'t. Some just talk about it and never go. \n\nBut they all come back.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beufy9pxl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.11609,41.43037]}},{"properties":{"name":"Goodbye to Greenery","description":"Posted by ClentzBetween the Valparaiso University Center for the Arts (VUCA), Neils Science Center, the Chapel and Huegli Hall, there used to be a relatively large central space of green. It was by no means perfect; as you can tell from the photo grass had trouble growing up from the rocky Valparaiso soil sometimes. However, the important thing, at least to me, was that there was a large open space on campus other than the sky that wasn\\'t covered by a building, asphalt, or cement. My friends and I would play games of football and ultimate frisbee there. Sometimes we would go over to the open field snuggled in the intersection of Sturdy and Morthland. Where there was green grass, there was peace for me.\n\nNow, the green spaces are gone. The corner green is a massive parking space, and the green at the center of campus is quickly becoming a mudfest that, at some point in time, is supposed to become the new Union. I agree that development is necessary, that some sacrifices must be made. But I must admit, saying goodbye to greenery and hello to more mud, asphalt, and concrete takes away a lot of the color and cleanliness that made Valparaiso University so appealing to me when I visited and decided to enroll. When the green from our campus was taken away, a part of me was taken with it. The mud rolled over my happiness with the first chunk of earth that a bulldozer tore out in preparation for the new Union. The price of advancement was peace, in my eyes.

They are among my closest friends. My old roommate lives there, and my four best friends that don\\'t live at my fraternity\\'s house call Brandt home in rooms next to each other. We spend a lot of time talking, a lot of time playing Halo, and a lot of time watching television.\n\nWe don\\'t do this because this is THE thing to do. We do this because there is nothing better to do, especially in the dead of this year\\'s winter. It is so bitterly cold, we don\\'t like to go outside. One of my friends, Kris, who rooms with my old roommate, Mark, had a car that simply froze. The engine doesn\\'t work anymore. There isn\\'t anywhere to go. This plight isn\\'t restricted to us (meaning my friends) - from what I hear, it\\'s a problem among most students at Valparaiso University. A common answer is found at the bottom of a bottle for many. I won\\'t deny the same solution has been used among us, but we have come up with a different solution: nights.\n\nSaturday nights are Monopoly nights. Friday nights are King Gyro nights. We\\'re working on creating an official Halo night to get all of the old crew together. I recently became a Monopoly night convert and played for the first time, enjoying every moment of it. Monopoly isn\\'t exactly a thrilling game, not one of pumping adrenile and bone-crushing plays that usually mark subjects of masculine interest; we find ways to enjoy it.\n\nAll of this boils down to the drudgery of the area. We wouldn\\'t have to invent nights if there was more to do, but you can\\'t help the weather. You must find things to do. Some people go sledding, some people have drinking games. Some people play sports, and some people study. My friends and I have Monopoly nights, King Gyro nights, and we\\'re working on Halo nights.

It is farmland, covered mostly in soybean fields with the occasional corn. The land is dry, possibly in the first stages of desertification. The soil crumbles if you hold it in your hand, and the only flowing water is a small (ten feet wide at the most) drainage ditch that used to be a flowing river. \n\tBefore farmers, namely Caucasians, came to this area of northern Indiana and drained the massive wetlands that used to be where the farms are today, the land was considered sacred to the Native Americans in the area, a paradise of sorts. If ever there was a Garden of Eden, there’s a good chance it was in northern Indiana. Believe it or not, there used to be bears that lived up here, mountain lions, and more bird species than you could probably count. The wetlands used to be a major stopping point for birds migrating north. When the wetlands were drained, the wildlife left. I can’t remember the exact number, but the draining of the Kankakee Marsh drove an unfathomable number of avian species to complete extinction.\n\tThe marsh used to be a favorite hunting place of Theodore Roosevelt. The old, derelict lodge that he used to be a common patron still stands near what remains of the Kankakee River a few miles from the dry fields. It stands as a testament to the fact that Roosevelt failed in his attempt to make the Kankakee Marsh one of the great National Parks of the United States; his lodge has fallen apart with the marshes. \n\tWhen people pass through this part of the state, many are quick to notice the flat, rural landscape, completely ignorant to the fact that there used to be a massive wetlands covering a good percentage of the area. This land was sacred…the livelihood of Native Americans and wildlife. It was paradise. Now, it is farmland, concrete highways, and industrial buildings. If you want to talk about the destruction of place, the abomination that is what used to be the great Kankakee Marsh is a prime example to center discussion around. You want to talk man destroying beauty, here you have it. You want to talk about the loss of the sacred, literally throwing life down the train for the sake of agricultural wealth…look at the farms around here. How can you do this and not be disgusted.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beubqodmd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.16827,41.52503]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans Through A Camera","description":"Posted by ClentzMardis Gras is important to the people of New Orleans. One does not need to take a class about the city to understand that. The event is known across the country, and has inspired an infinite amount of party and prom themes. However, I never really knew what made the event so special in New Orleans.\n     After hearing St. Germain\\'s discussion about New Orleans, in which the negative aspects of the city were placed on the table in a way I had yet to see, the pictures in the 2nd floor of the VUCA took on a whole dimension that brought into view the life of the people.\n     Before Katrina: Here, on the streets, were men in drag despite age. Costumes ranged from none to Popeye to the absurd (two masked men in naked man suits). Here is a time where the downsides of the city take a back seat to smiles and good natured fun. Everyone in the pictures, even those completely unaware they are having their shots taken (in the background) seem to have smiles on their face. In a city where violence seems to be ever constant, this wouldn\\'t be the norm.\n     After Katrina: There are still smiles and an upbeat attitude, but the costumes seem to have died down. Where there was once countless drag (still being some but not nearly as much) there are people in blue tarps with the letters FEMA written across them. A man and a women sport red horns and shirts that say, \"Insurance Adjusters From Hell.\" One man has a poster that states, \"Bush Is An Idiot!\" Outside of New Orleans, one might find such costumes to be in bad taste. From inside the city, however, the pictures tell a different story.\n     The smiles on film are evidence that people still see Mardis Gras as a time of celebration, a time to have fun and smile. However, where there was once random colorful (and sometimes disturbing) outfits, there is now a collection of politically charged regala. One man in blue drag is covered in bugs and holds a fly swatter, a testament to the bug problems the city has with the decay of unused food and abandoned refrigerators. Sarcasm seems to have replaced random absurdity in the minds of New Orleanians; but nothing seems to have replaced their view of Mardis Gras. Look at the smiles in the pictures. Look at the outfits and the usually-depressing-turned-comical motifs, and it is evident that Mardis Gras is important to a city riddled with anger, depression, racism, and violence.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beunbxry6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04008,41.46398]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old jobs, same problems...","description":"Posted by Clentz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beuj5nccf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.43025,39.42341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steak 'n Shake convo.","description":"Posted by Clentz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beuio3f4j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.41322,39.4353]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Denny's delegation...","description":"Posted by Clentz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beudjd8g4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.41529,39.42567]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Falling Of Angels","description":"Posted by ClentzAngels are falling...\n\nThat\\'s all I could think about while my eyes followed millions of snowflakes as they fell to the ground. Once one hit and melted with countless others, my gaze turned skyward and I followed another on its dead-end journey. Nastasha was driving with her eyes focused on the road, intent on arriving back to my dorm room. We had been in a wreck a few weeks before that had totalled her previous car, something I still blame on the dampness of the roads that night.\n\nAngels are falling...\n\nI used to love snow, and I still do when I\\'m fairly close to my home in Terre Haute. But something about the way snow interacts with the landscape up here gives me an uneasy feeling. The flakes fall so fast with the wind, and the descent gives me the strangest feeling of vertigo when the backdrop are the flat fields, emptied of all vegetation by the cold of winter. At my home, there are lots of evergreens that catch the wind, and the flakes fall ever so slowly. They are angels to me that grace the ground with their presence. In my mind, the sing as they fall into each others\\' arms on the cold ground: beauty in the dead of winter.\n\nAs we drove, the angels were screaming in mortal despair. They smashed into the ground and were promptly run over by passing automobiles. Visions of jumpers on September 11th passed through my head. I tried to change the channels upstairs, but the same replays over and over again.\n\nBlack ice was becoming more and more visible on the road. Red and blue flashing lights were scattered between Merrillville and Valparaiso while police officers helped those who had run off the road. Some music was playing, but neither my girlfriend or I were paying attention. We moved slowly, rarely over 25 mph, towards VU.

The people of northwestern Indiana conform to the landscape: rigid stature, business-like, somewhat uptight. Matt Giguere is much more of person of flow than of rigidness, visibly not from the area. Being from the northeast, specifically Massachusetts, and used to the hills and winding roads, he was quick to point out that the areas are all based on a grid system.\n\nWindy roads, fluid people; gridded out roads, rigid people. The difference is one of those differences that you don\\'t notice until you dive a little deeper into the area. At first, Matt appears to be another guy in the midwest. But once certain inevitable truths appear (the area is flat...Massachusetts isn\\'t) then some differences can be made.\n\nPerhaps it is just the artist in me, or something else entirely, but when I see the grids of the area on the map, I see the people. Straightforward, unwavering, deceiving in few ways. When people try too hard to get away from that, you get a something like the sidewalk system of Valparaiso University (a pretty much failed experiment). The winding roads of Massachusetts seem to give rise to a more fluid way of life. Perhaps the rigid roads of this area, as Matt described it, restrict that fluidity into straight form.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65beuet9a3w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03766,41.46418]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237272","metadata":null,"contact_name":"clentz","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:clentz","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237272","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":27,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237272,platial:user=clentz","published":"2010-04-23T16:00:00Z","id":38239}
