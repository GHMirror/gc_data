It was one of the deadliest concentration camps during the war. Right away women and babies were killed by the gas chambers and then thrown into the fire to be burned. \r\nMillions were killed by starvation, injuries and many were killed by Nazi soldiers. It was the most miserable place to be. Although many survived or escaped it will forever be burned into the minds of the victims. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ic612l6e8w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[8.710003,49.561937]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grand Canyon","description":"Posted by Kaley14<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/000_0134.JPG\">Grand CanyonAbout two summers ago my family went to the Grand Canyon. We had a reall good time. The Grand Canyon is basically a big hole in the ground. I wasn\\'t very excited at first but when we got there it was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nWe were there for like two hours. The rocks have a unique look to them and are in a variety of hundreds of colors smeared across them.

In 1909 Helen Plane decided to honor General Robert E. Lee by carving a side of the mountain. The first artist contacted was Gutzon Borglum along with 750 men. he began in 1923 and left the project and state in 1925 beacuse of the charges of the project.\r\n\r\nAugustus Lukeman was the second artis to attempt to carve the mountain. He removed what Borglum began and focused on four central figures, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and a color bearer. Lukeman ran out of time in 1928 because the lease to finish the carving ran out.\r\n\r\nAfter the state purchased the land in 1958 Walker Hancock started to carve the mountain again in 1963. in 1970 Spiro Agnew dedicated the carving. It was finally completed in 1972!\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ic61b4hp87"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"big ben","description":"Posted by Kaley14<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3071/2296239846_f3b71990ba.jpg\">parisBig Ben was completed in 1858 and stands at 316 feet.

There were over 700 people to choose from to disgn the Eiffel tower but the lucky winner was Alexandre Gustave Eiffel and was assisted by many engineers. However there were many issues that arose during the designing of the Eiffel tower. Nature lovers thought it woul interfere with the birds over Paris no one else really cared. \r\nThe tower was almost torn down in 1909 because its 20 year lease was up but it was saved.  It became useful for television and radio and in 1960 it became a main focus for semioligist Roland Barthes. Over the years it has become a main tourist sight for people all over the world and is useful still for many things in Paris. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ic616nza7b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.351019,48.856662]}},{"properties":{"name":"world trade center site","description":"Posted by Kaley14<img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2302/2076311197_d22f959486.jpg\">new york cityEveryone knows what happened on September 11 in New York at the World Trade Center so i don\\'t need to go into detail. Two years ago i went to New York and got to see the memorial site. There is basically nothing there. But as you can see in the pic there is a cross. I think some of the fireman took what was left and built a memorial for all the lives that were lost.

The canyon was absolutely beautiful. It was really green and amazing. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ic619b2yv0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.547029,39.499762]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/286783","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kaley14","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kaley14","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/286783","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=286783,platial:user=kaley14","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48688}
