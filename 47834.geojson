You\\'d expect that a prominent airline like Jet Blue would invest some of the money we give wisely.  Wisely enough to put up some alternative energy source or energy saving devices.  The new terminal should be an example of how corp. America can change the way we do business.  Efficiency should be their main focus.

Proposed \ntechniques include solar panels to produce electricity \nand hot water; construction techniques that minimize \nwaste and encourage recycling; extensive use of natural \ndaylighting; enhanced indoor environmental quality; \nand the use of sustainable construction materials. The \nuse of green technology combined with the installation \nof more energy-efficient HVAC equipment is estimated \nto reduce terminal operating and maintenance costs by \nas much as .00 per square foot per year. \n\nIn addition to this new design concept the airport has already implemented a recycling program that seems pretty nice.  The quick hand dryers in the bathrooms need to be located better so that they are easier to use.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlr9hwhoni"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.128948,43.113463]}},{"properties":{"name":"US sugar land","description":"Posted by Ecocritique<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlr9kuexr9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.9143066406,26.752968348]}},{"properties":{"name":"new york","description":"Posted by Ecocritique<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlr9c2t91x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.41015625,42.4234565179]}},{"properties":{"name":"prairie creek","description":"Posted by Ecocritique<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> nice creek with light current down stream from the lake.  meandering along you will see deer, gator, turtles, and a large variety of birds.  creek is murky but seems to be mostly clean the further from the road you get.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlr9ghtc9v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.2481155396,29.6065211546]}},{"properties":{"name":"stu's house","description":"Posted by Ecocritique<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 64 albion street 02143<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlr9hi9czc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.0,64.0]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/746758","metadata":null,"contact_name":"ecocritique","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:ecocritique","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/746758","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=746758,platial:user=ecocritique","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47834}
