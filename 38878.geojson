The United States calls the killing in Darfur \"genocide.\"\n\nEnter Blackwater, a private military company that says it can help keep peace in Darfur. Doug Brooks runs an association of private military firms, which includes Blackwater. He says his members can help where governments have failed.\n\n\"What we\\'ve seen is the West has largely abrogated any responsibility to put their own people on the ground in places they don\\'t care about,\" says Brooks. \"It\\'s willing to authorize these missions, but it\\'s not willing to put boots on the ground. The private sector can step in. It can fill that gap.\"\n\nThe United Nations, which hopes to deploy in Darfur this fall, opposes the outsourcing of force.\n\nThe peacekeeping pitch sounds great, but has all kinds of problems, says Peter Singer, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of Corporate Warriors.\n\nFor one thing, he says, there\\'s little accountability. If contractors misbehave -- as they did at Iraq\\'s Abu Ghraib prison -- they rarely face charges. Singer says private military firms are focusing on peacekeeping, in part, to improve their image.\n\n\"It\\'s a wonderful way to put a very nice face onto an industry that faces a pretty big question of legitimacy,\" says Singer. \"Because, at the end of the day, it\\'s the corporate evolution of the mercenary trade.\"\n\nAt Blackwater\\'s headquarters in North Carolina, the airy, glass atrium seems more Fortune Magazine than Soldier of Fortune. The company\\'s training center covers an area about half the size of Manhattan. Facilities include a mock-up of a motel for assault training and several miles of track where trainees are taught how to drive in dangerous conditions.\n\nChris Taylor, head of strategy for Blackwater, says his company has a database of thousands of former police and military officers for security assignments. He says Blackwater personnel could set up perimeters and guard Darfurian villages and refugee camp in support of the U.N. Blackwater officials say it would not take many men to fend off the Janjaweed, a militia that is supported by the Sudanese government and attacks villages on camelback.\n\n\"Any sort of intervention would have to be done by nation-state militaries,\" Taylor says. \"What we seek to do first is be the best deterrent we could possibly be.\"\n\nBut Taylor acknowledges that the political hurdles to such a contract are huge. Nations are often reluctant to allow in U.N. peacekeepers, let alone private soldiers. Many African nations would be especially resistant, given the continent\\'s bad history with white mercenaries.\n\nJean-Marie Guehenno, under-secretary general for peacekeeping at the U.N., says the international community shouldn\\'t be allowed to dump its responsibilities on the private sector.\n\n\"If you want to have peace, it\\'s not just a technical issue, it\\'s a political issue,\" he says. \"So, I don\\'t think states can get off the hook by committing to tragic situations by just handing over the job to private companies.\"\n\nIn fact, private military firms already provide services to peacekeepers. They\\'ve flown African soldiers around Darfur. In Congo and Liberia, they\\'ve protected U.N. food convoys, warehouses and personnel.\n\nThe private military industry took off at the end of the Cold War as armies downsized, but conflicts flared in regions like the Balkans. The industry now makes billions of dollars each year. Firms provide everything from fighter jets to bodyguards in more than 50 countries.\n\nSinger, the military analyst, says the security companies are looking to peacekeeping because they expect work in Iraq will begin to dry up when the United States pulls back.\n\n\"There are a lot of crises in the world,\" says Singer, \"so if they can get their foot in the door, it potentially opens up an entire new business sector.\"\n\nDeborah Avant, a professor at George Washington University and author of The Market for Force, says she thinks that someday, somewhere, private firms will be hired to defend civilians.\n\n\"I think that\\'s probably something that will unfold in the next five years,\" she says. \"Ultimately, it\\'s a political failure of states and yet an increasing sense among the rather diffuse, international community that something must be done.\"\n\nFor now, private bids to do peacekeeping are going nowhere. And in Darfur, a fragile peace agreement is fraying. In an interview with NPR, Jan Egeland, the U.N.\\'s chief aid coordinator, said U.N. trucks are attacked every week. He said some humanitarian organizations have already left Darfur and others are debating whether to go.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6e5zzwleuac"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[24.0,13.4]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blackwater/Backup in Post Falls","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/79847196@N00/834296918/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1099/834296918_2f03489bf4.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Post Falls, IdahoNow comes news that Post Falls-based The Backup Training Corporation is changing hands.\n\nAnd the new owner?\n\nBlackwater USA, the mercenary outfit at the heart of scandals from Iraq to New Orleans.\n\nThe Backup Training Corporation, based in Post Falls, Idaho, provides training to law enforcement and other use-of-force practitioners, including mercenaries.

Some of the mercenaries say they have been \"deputized\" by the Louisiana governor; indeed some are wearing gold Louisiana state law enforcement badges on their chests and Blackwater photo identification cards on their arms. They say they are on contract with the Department of Homeland Security and have been given the authority to use lethal force. Several mercenaries we spoke with said they had served in Iraq on the personal security details of the former head of the U.S. occupation, L. Paul Bremer and the former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, John Negroponte.\n\n\"This is a totally new thing to have guys like us working CONUS (Continental United States),\" a heavily armed Blackwater mercenary told us as we stood on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. \"We\\'re much better equipped to deal with the situation in Iraq.\"\n\nBlackwater mercenaries are some of the most feared professional killers in the world and they are accustomed to operating without worry of legal consequences. Their presence on the streets of New Orleans should be a cause for serious concern for the remaining residents of the city and raises alarming questions about why the government would allow men trained to kill with impunity in places like Iraq and Afghanistan to operate here. Some of the men now patrolling the streets of New Orleans returned from Iraq as recently as two weeks ago.\n\nWhat is most disturbing is the claim of several Blackwater mercenaries we spoke with that they are here under contract from the federal government and the state of Louisiana. Blackwater is one of the leading private security firms servicing the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. It has several U.S. government contracts and has provided security for many senior U.S. diplomats, foreign dignitaries and corporations. The company rose to international prominence after four of its men were killed in Fallujah and two of their charred bodies were hung from a bridge in March 2004. Those killings sparked the massive U.S. retaliation against the civilian population of Fallujah that resulted in scores of deaths and tens of thousands of refugees.\n\nWho Sent In the Mercs?\n\nAs the threat of forced evictions now looms in New Orleans and the city confiscates even legally registered weapons from civilians, the private mercenaries of Blackwater patrol the streets openly wielding M-16s and other assault weapons. This despite Police Commissioner Eddie Compass\\' claim that, \"Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons.\"\n\nOfficially, Blackwater says its forces are in New Orleans to \"join the Hurricane relief effort.\" A statement on the company\\'s website, dated Sept. 1, advertises airlift services, security services and crowd control. The company, according to news reports, has since begun taking private contracts to guard hotels, businesses and other properties. But what has not been publicly acknowledged is the claim, made to us by two Blackwater mercenaries, that they are actually engaged in general law enforcement activities including \"securing neighborhoods\" and \"confronting criminals.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6e5zztda05w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.075,29.954444]}},{"properties":{"name":"Potrero Locals Oppose Blackwater","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/Picture_451.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> potrero, CAPOTRERO, Oct. 7, 2007 (KABC-TV) - Blackwater U.S.A., which provides security to U.S. diplomats in Iraq, has been found guilty by Iraqi investigators in the death of 17 Iraqi civilians. In Southern California, residents are fighting back against a proposed new training ground for the company.\n\nBlackwater U.S.A. has its sights set on a piece of land 45 miles east of San Diego. The security firm wants to build a training complex called \"Blackwater West.\" Its private armed security guards, police and military personnel would use the facility, but many residents in the town of Potrero do not want the controversial company to be their new neighbor.\n\nWhere there is farmland as far as the eye can see, a plan is in the works to build a 220-acre training facility for Blackwater U.S.A., the security firm that Iraqi officials say is responsible for the deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians in September.\n\nEnvironmental groups, anti-war activists and residents of the town of Potrero are joining forces to keep Blackwater out of their back yard.\n\n\"Especially with what has happened in Iraq, this will make us a terrorist target,\" said Jan Hedlun, a local resident who opposes Blackwater\\'s training facility.\n\nBlackwater\\'s plans are under environmental review by San Diego County planners. The facility would include administrative buildings, an armory and firing ranges. Some residents do not want gunshots to take away their peace and quiet.\n\n\"I think that traffic will be drastically increased,\" said Carl Meyers, a resident opposed to the proposed facility. \"I think there will be noise.\"\n\n\"[There will be] noise from the students firing on a 3,000-foot-long firing range,\" said Hedlun.\n\nThis week the FBI begins investigating Blackwater\\'s operations in Iraq. ABC News obtained exclusive video of the explosion that Blackwater says started the incident.\n\nGuards say some of their attackers were wearing Iraqi police uniforms, but Iraqi investigators say the Blackwater guards opened fire without coming under threat.\n\nBlackwater opponents in Potrero say the guards\\' actions show the company sees itself as being above the law.\n\nA recall movement is now underway to remove members of the Potrero Planning Committee who support bringing Blackwater to their town.\n\nIt could be months before the plan goes to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. Meantime, in Baghdad, Iraqi officials say the shootings of the Iraqi civilians there were deliberate crimes, and the government is recommending the Blackwater guards involved face trial. <a
