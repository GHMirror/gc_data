Go Fish! is an odd little restaurant whose specialty is sandwiches in the shape of fish, containing no fish-derived products (hence, \"no fish\").\n\nHOWEVER, the real appeal of No Fish! Go Fish! is the unique event they hold every Friday night:  Strip Jeopardy.\n\nStrip Jeopardy is just like real Jeopardy:  Three contestants who must answer in the form of a question, a host, an audience.  But in strip jeopardy, if a contestant answers a question wrong, they have to remove an article of clothing.  If they fail to answer in the form of a question, they lose another article of clothing.  Get a daily double, and answer right?  The contestant can choose one of their competitors, who must then lose a garment.  And there are also situations where the host takes off clothes, or audience members too.\n\nStrip Jeopardy starts at 10 p.m. every Friday night.  And yes, people get naked.  One of our hostel staff lost early when he played, and ended up sitting in front of the restaurant wearing nothing but a funny hat for 40 minutes.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bqfo6igcqo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.622043,45.511891]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palio Dessert &amp; Espresso House","description":"Posted by Hawthornehostel<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/586004xl.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 1996 SE Ladd Ave, portland<b>Staff Picks:  Favorite Coffee Shop</b>\n\"Great coffee.
