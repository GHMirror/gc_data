They complimented each other as songwriter and pianist. Eventually, Gamble and Huff became members of a local band, the Romeos, along with Thom Bell, who later became a famous songwriter and producer.\n\nKenny Gamble and Leon Huff collaborated on a number of earlier R&amp;B songs, but the pop hits did not arrive until 1966 with the Intruders and Soul Survivors\\' We\\'ll Be United, Together, Cowboys To Girls, and Expressway To Your Heart among others. They also wrote and produced Atlantic hits for Archie Bell &amp; the Drells and Wilson Pickett. But most of all, they were instrumental in reviving the career of ex-VeeJay singer, Jerry Butler in 1967 with hits like Only The Strong Survive, What\\'s The Use Of Breaking Up and Hey Western Union Man on the Mercury record label. These Jerry Butler records really set the scene for what was to come: silk voices singing in high register, a tight rhythm section and lush string arrangements. Gamble got the entrepreneurial bug and started his own record company in 1967, but it folded due to distribution and collection issues common to small record labels. He next tried his hand co-founding Neptune Records with Huff in 1969. Wiser from the first experience he signed a national distribution deal with Chess Records.\n\nIn 1969, the Neptune label was founded and distributed through Chess Records. Although Neptune released only 4 albums, it marked the starting point for Gamble and Huff\\'s collaboration. Upon recommendation by the Intruders, they also brought in the O\\'Jays. And in 1970, Thom Bell joined the label as an arranger, writer, producer and musician. By 1971, Chess Records involvement with Soul Music declined, so Gamble and Huff signed a national distribution, music catalog and financial deal with CBS Records, then changed the company name to Philadelphia International Records (PIR). Though no longer an independent record label, with distribution and financial issues behind them, PIR was now free to go in the positive message artistic directions it desired. \n\nIn the 1970s, Gamble and Huff puzzled together dance rhythms, orchestral arrangements, and positive topical lyrics that established a musical signature having sophisticated soulful orchestration. It was lovingly called, The Sound Of Philadelphia. Recording most of The Sound Of Philadelphia at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, PIR was finally prepared for lift-off.\n\nThe O\\'Jays finally hit it big in 1972 with Back Stabbers. The O\\'Jays continued rolling out the hits with Love Train and For the Love of Money in the 1970s. Other prominent acts on the PIR label were Billy Paul (Me and Mrs Jones) and Harold Melvin And The Blue Notes (If You Don\\'t Know Me By Now and The Love I Lost), Blue Magic, The Spinners, Jean Carn, The Spinners (Could it Be That I\\'m Falling in Love), Stylistics (Betcha by Golly, Wow) and Delfonics (Didn\\'t I Blow Your Mind This Time). Philadelphia International Records soon became a force in the Soul Music market and even drew praise from musical rivals.\n\nAs PIR rolled out the hits, Stax Records imploded and Motown\\'s record identity tarnished a bit after moving from Detroit to LA. Soon it became easier for PIR to attract top artists like The Jacksons, Jerry Butler, Lou Rawls and Phyllis Hyman. They nearly signed the Temptations after they left Motown in 1976.\n\nAble to anticipate market trends, PIR helped create the disco craze when it introduced The Hustle by Van McCoy in 1974. They also had good karma. Producer and songwriter Richard Barrett is credited with bringing the Three Degrees to PIR in 1973. A short time later, Don Cornelius, producer and host of Soul Train asked the Three Degrees to do vocals for the show\\'s new theme track, with instrumentals by MFSB. Thus, The Sound Of Philadelphia) became a huge disco hit in 1974 and known the world over as Soul Train\\'s theme song.\n\nStorm clouds came their way. In 1975, charges were brought against Huff for offering Payola in exchange for airplay. The charges were dropped in 1976, but Gamble was fined ,500 in related matters, which tarnished the record company\\'s reputation. It’s unclear why they were singled out, particularly since Payola, often non-monetary, was common in the industry. Then in 1982, mega-star sex symbol Teddy Pendergrass smashed his car into a highway divider, paralyzing him from the waist down and body slamming his recording career.\n\nThere was a bit of good news. In 1983 Patti LaBelle released the I\\'m in Love Again album and it reached gold status. Unfortunately, it was the last PIR album to reach gold.\n\nBy 1985, the hits ebbed and Philadelphia International Records switched its distribution to Manhattan (a Capitol subsidiary). Still struggling to get more radio airtime, publicity and record store shelf space, they switched to BMG in 1991 -- again without much success. The 1990s were not kind to most record labels, so no one should be surprised at the difficulties PIR encountered.\n\nThe prominence of PIR was usurped by a new generation of record labels. Nevertheless, PIR set benchmarks for community relations and style as Gamble and Huff maintained a Philadelphia record label rather than move to LA or New York. Gamble-Huff Music, the successor company to PIR, has a well-earned place on Philadelphia’s Avenue of the Arts and Philly loves them back. The renowned Philadanco Dance Company recently presented a new work set to vintage music from Philadelphia International Records. \n\nCourtesy Soulofamerica.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b63qgn8fvs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.166967,39.937188]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tangiers, Morocco","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.chrissipe.com\" href=\"http://blog.chrissipe.com\">Chrissipe</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/grand_socco.jpg\">Tangiers, Morocco<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b63q9tdut5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.811253,35.787045]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/56b3841dba87834da415ff5e0e008337.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> A History Lesson from USF: But when I saw the sacred house of Artemis that towers to the clouds, the [other Wonders] were placed in the shade, for the Sun himself has never looked upon its equal outside Olympus.\n\nAntipater of Sidon\n\nIs it simply a temple? How could it take its place among other unique structures such as the Pyramid, the Hanging Gardens, and the Colossus of Rhodes? For the people who actually visited it, the answer was simple.

That was the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.\nLocation\n\nThe ancient city of Ephesus near the modern town of Selcuk, about 50 km south of Izmir (Smyrna) in Turkey.\nHistory\n\nAlthough the foundation of the temple dates back to the seventh century BC, the structure that earned a spot in the list of Wonders was built around 550 BC. Referred to as the great marble temple, or temple D, it was sponsored by the Lydian king Croesus and was designed by the Greek architect Chersiphron. The Temple was decorated with bronze statues sculpted by the most skilled artists of their time: Pheidias, Polycleitus, Kresilas, and Phradmon.\n\nThe temple served as both a marketplace and a religious institution. For years, the sanctuary was visited by merchants, tourists, artisans, and kings who paid homage to the goddess by sharing their profits with her. Recent archeological excavations at the site revealed gifts from pilgrims including statuettes of Artemis made of gold and ivory... earrings, bracelets, and necklaces... artifacts from as far as Persia and India.\n\nOn the night of 21 July 356 BC, a man named Herostratus burned the temple to ground in an attempt to immortalize his name, which he did indeed. Oddly enough, Alexander the Great was born the same night. The historian Plutarch later wrote that the goddess was \"too busy taking care of the birth of Alexander to send help to her threatened templ<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b63qh9evhs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.355957,37.961523]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tokyo Bay Bird Park 東京港野鳥公園","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kclama/\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kclama/\">Kclama</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/4/8789777_492c98d772_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B8140.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B8061a.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B8053.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B8012a.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7963.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7781a.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7763.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7445a.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7611.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7512.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7451.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/100B7710.JPG\">My other <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kclama/search/tags:japan/\">photos</a> at Japan.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b63qf5p6w4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.760846,35.584002]}},{"properties":{"name":"Toledo, Spain","description":"Posted by Citycyclist<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/7catedr.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> Toledo, SpainEver since seeing El Greco\\'s painting, I\\'ve wanted to visit this town.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b63qeqnpcv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.03,39.86]}},{"properties":{"name":"Turner Field","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/image06.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner70.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner_field1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner_field2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAHome of the Braves. It was the Olympic Stadium built for the Centennial Olympic Games in 1996. Ironically, baseball, which was the only Olympic event that I got to see, was played at the old AFC Stadium. Last summer, my brother-in-law took me to a game, and since his friend\\'s grandmother knows Henry Aaron, we were somehow able to get Aaron\\'s seats. We ended up sitting literally behind homeplate. I don\\'t mean a couple rows back or so, I mean it was us, then the wall, then the umpire\\'s butt. Best seats I\\'ve ever had. They played the Cubs that night, and after a rain delay of 1.5 hours with some bad lightning, they ended up winning the game. \r\n\r\nThe first game I got to see here was a playoff game against Florida in 1997. We won the game, but of course we lost that series because the Marlins went on to win their first World Series that year. \r\n\r\nI miss the memories of A-FC Stadium, but this ballpark has better seats and is more stylish. It\\'s truly a stadium built for baseball whereas A-FC was designed to save money by utilizing the generic, bland, coliseum style stadium for multiple sports, of course, mainly baseball and football. Ironically, Turner Field was originally that Olympic Stadium, which had that same bland coliseum shape. They just tore out some pieces in order to shape it how it is today.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b63q23vzq1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.389634,33.735279]}},{"properties":{"name":"l Arche de la défense","description":"Posted by Chinsishe<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/Pano_Arche01.jpg\">La Defense\nParis, Frence<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b63q9e5t3v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.236018,48.892825]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/37269","metadata":null,"contact_name":"mariekou","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:mariekou","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/37269","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":27,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=37269,platial:user=mariekou","published":"2010-04-23T16:00:00Z","id":38312}
