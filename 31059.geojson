Sea is beautiful, air is soft. No houses to live except two Cottage. Far away there are small villages. ANZAC Forces start to deploy here. They died here too. They died near beaches and Turkish Forces died near Mountains, an unfortunate and bloody war but friendship was there. Lots of people died; Turks, Kurds, Arabs, New Zealanders, Australians, Indians, Irish, British, Canadians.\n\nWhen you visit few cemeteries there If It\\'s Turkish every graves head to South (to Saudi Arabia, because Holy Place for Muslims) and ANZACs head to Sea(They came from there) but some ANZACs head to Saudi Arabia too becuase they were Muslim Indians.
