Drinking arsenic contaminated water over a long period leads to arsenic poisoning (arsenicosis), resulting in a myriad of health problems such as cancers and skin problems. In recent years, severe and widespread contamination of groundwater and drinking water by arsenic has been found in rural and sub-urban areas in and around the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi. This has prompted an urgent need to develop simple, affordable and sustainable techniques for lowering arsenic concentrations in drinking water. Responding to this need, Lien Institute For the Environment (LIFE) has developed a household level arsenic treatment system. A pilot project was implemented at Van Mon and Phuong Tien Villages. These two villages are located in the Red River Delta, some 50 km from Hanoi. Lien Foundation-NTU Environmental Endeavour was overall responsible for the project.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64grr6tgc1i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.977369308,22.7942237689]}},{"properties":{"name":"Siddhipur","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://washlink.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://washlink.wordpress.com/\">Washlink</a><img src=\"http://www.eawag.ch/organisation/abteilungen/sandec/publikationen/stun/pic3\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\">  The STUN project, operated in co-operation with UN-HABITAT Nepal, examines the feasibility of converting source-separated urine into a dry fertilizer product called ‘struvite’. Struvite (often called MAP for magnesium ammonium phosphate: MgNH4PO4.6H2O) is a safe, bioavailable fertilizer which can be precipitated from urine with only the addition of magnesium.\n\nWorking in the Kathmandu Valley, with the community of Siddhipur, the STUN project has assessed the social, economic, and technical feasibility of producing struvite at the community level. By producing struvite from urine, we hope to promote improved sanitation, local food security, and nutrient independence as Nepal must import all of its fertilizer at prices which are not always affordable for subsistence farmers.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64grr08qnr8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[84.0622329712,28.2133568903]}},{"properties":{"name":"Victoria Falls - the starting point of a water story","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://washlink.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://washlink.wordpress.com/\">Washlink</a><img src=\"http://www.ifrc.org/common/images/includes_images/ifrc-1.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> The video in  the link shows the International Federation Global Water and Sanitation Initiative (GWSI) in action at a Zambia Red Cross Society “Rural Water Supply Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Project” … It show how a Zambia clean water project comes  hand in hand with sanitation and hygiene education Its starts at the falls and then goes several Km north to where water is like gold.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64grqxsd7by"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.8589839935,-17.9254143465]}},{"properties":{"name":"enviroventures biosolids in the US","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://washlink.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://washlink.wordpress.com/\">Washlink</a><img src=\"http://washlink.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/sanitation.jpg?w=60&amp;h=60\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> washlink notes:\n(click on satellite option for best view)\nWhile reuse  of human biowaste/ biosolids (along the lines urine feces) for fertilizing is generating great excitement in the developing world, the United States is cautious in its embrace.\n\nbio-solids\n\nThe following excerpt  is  from great story that explores this.\nIt is by SANDY LONG of the River Reporter addressing some of the concerns  as she explores an honest mans adventure in making a lively-hood collecting the content of septic systems, processing it and them applying to the growing fields.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64grqx1td8k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.0262355804,41.5932361457]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/736959","metadata":null,"contact_name":"washlink","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:washlink","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/736959","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=736959,platial:user=washlink","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":50316}
