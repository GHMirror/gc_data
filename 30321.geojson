SECOORA coordinates coastal and ocean observing activities and facilitates dialogue among stakeholders so that the benefits from the sustained operation of a coastal and ocean observing system can be realized. SECOORA is one of 11 Regional Associations established nationwide through the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS®). IOOS is a multi-agency, cooperative effort based on a continuously operating network of buoys, ships, satellites, underwater vehicles, and other platforms that routinely collect real-time data and manage historical information. These data are needed for rapid detection and timely prediction of changes in our nation’s ocean and coastal waters.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"title":"carocoops CAP2 buoy Latest observations","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/15 11:00:01 -0400","original":"Tue Jun 15 11:00:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/15 11:00:00 -0400"},"description":"air temperature:28.9celsius84.0fahrenheitwind from direction:162degrees_truewind speed:1.8m_s-14.0mphwind gust:2.5m_s-15.6mphair pressure:1014.3mbrelative humidity:90percentwater temperature:27.46celsius81.4fahrenheitsalinity:34.29psuchl concentration:15.4ug_L-1","link":"http://nautilus.baruch.sc.edu/carocoops_website/buoy_detail.php?buoy=buoy4","id":"a62d751uoata"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.62,32.8]}}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"http://secoora.org/scgeorss/","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"SECORRA","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://secoora.org/scgeorss/","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"coast,secoora,water","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":30321}
