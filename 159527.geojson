The station will work bring viewers together with its partners through education, outreach, a monthly magazine show on-air, online, in print and social networking opportunities. \"Live Green and Prosper\" aims to not only help keep small and medium farms afloat, but also to help lower the current unemployment rate of 12.7%.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/br&gt;","id":"78"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.5073665,36.1776655]}},{"properties":{"name":"WMHT","description":"&lt;div&gt;4 Global View&lt;br&gt;Troy, NY 12180&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Response Grants (CPB Funded)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Awarded to WMHT and WCNY.
