[Google Maps] shows it as Disputed Territory ( with Dash lines) and [Google Ditu] shows it altogether as part of China!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So, that got me unruffled and to question validity of both these sources. How does Ditu differ from Google maps? Whats association between the two and does Ditu has autonomy to change the boundary of the maps as per its wish.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh\"&gt;Arunachal Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; is a border region between China and India &amp;#8211; with 70% of the land being claimed by the Chinese as South Tibet. The border in question was decided in 1914 and called the McMahon Line, but never agreed upon by the Chinese. The &lt;a href=\"http://ditu.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;amp;sll=38.89788,-77.087224&amp;amp;sspn=0.009252,0.019419&amp;amp;brcurrent=3,0x3761317e9c4a2cc1:0x1fc12c628413da99,0%3B5,0,0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;amp;ll=28.241489,95.114136&amp;amp;spn=2.680778,2.878418&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=8\"&gt;Google Ditu&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;amp;sll=24.20689,87.033691&amp;amp;sspn=11.088655,11.513672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;amp;ll=28.401065,93.768311&amp;amp;spn=5.352484,9.942627&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=7\"&gt;Google Map&lt;/a&gt; views.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4156297169/\" title=\"Google Maps vs. Google Ditu by Andrew Turner, on Flickr\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2748/4156297169_e472fdbedb.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"291\" alt=\"Google Maps vs. Google Ditu\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align: justify;\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;i&gt;Comparing Google Maps (background) with Google Ditu (foreground tinted red)&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4156297169/\" title=\"Google Maps vs. Google Ditu by Andrew Turner, on Flickr\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Territorial disputes are definitely not a new thing &amp;#8211; however what is perhaps alarming is that there are two different representations of reality from the same vendor and data providers. So this is entirely a representational decision that is most likely driven by business and government pressures.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s particularly interesting here is that primarily these definitions of boundaries derive from the data providers. You can look in the bottom right corner for who the data providers are. For both versions the providers are the same: TerraMetrics, Mapabc, and Europa Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So it seems that the cartographic designers at Google Ditu have decided to represent it a certain way. Unfortunately, the map has no additional metadata. As broad consumption of maps increases, there is a commensurate interest in the why and what behind them. Who said these are the boundaries, when were they set, and why are they shown in this language?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#8217;t mean the long reams of unreadable metadata that are the current standards in the geospatial community, I mean human understandable descriptions of the various aspects of the data, while allowing additional discovery to deeper data.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One place that you can look at the data behind the source of the map is in &lt;a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=28.03&amp;amp;lon=94.5&amp;amp;zoom=7&amp;amp;layers=B000FTF\"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;. Arunachal Pradesh is shown similar to Google Maps version, and a user could optionally download the data to see the attributes, edit history and sources. Alternatively I can look in GeoCommons for the &lt;a href=\"http://finder.geocommons.com/overlays/1301\"&gt;GADM Admin boundaries of India&lt;/a&gt; and see pertinent data on who provided the data, sources, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boundary disputes in a bi-directional medium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The representation of boundaries is obviously a very contentious issue in mapping. Maps are perceived, and often do inform, territory. There is a long history of map representation being used to influence, coerce, and force land rights.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even in a &amp;#8220;Web2.0&amp;#8243; world of bi-directional sharing and collaboration, with maps we&amp;#8217;re still often forced to accept a particular viewpoint. They have on-the-ground meaning and political impact. A well known example of this were the first &amp;#8220;edit wars&amp;#8221; in OpenStreetMap with the names of places in Cyprus. The resolution was to by default abide by the on the ground signage, but also store both versions and allow users to provide their own personalized perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding, awareness, and discussion about these issues is the reason for projects like OpenStreetMap or GeoCommons where you can download the information, build and share your own maps that represent your perspective.There&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t an easy answer here &amp;#8211; with companies such as Google there are obviously market, and government, forces that direct how to represent contentious issues. The best solution is to offer background, open data, and alternative perspectives. Without a voice, citizens are relegated to discussions by officials they may, or may not, have elected &amp;#8211; and no meaningful way to illustrate their interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/2nXFtf9Dz_s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/&gt;","summary":"I received an email the other day from a reader of my blog with a very interesting question:\n\nI was looking at a certain area in North East part of India ( State called “Arunachal Pradesh”) which is integral part of India.\nBoth URL’s have different take.

Overall, it&amp;#8217;s clear that the practice of geospatial data publication and sharing in a web oriented way is still very nascent but getting better at the same time it becomes more mainstream. More data is being created and published in web-oriented ways that make it more consumable and usable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Too often standards and tools are being by domain experts and technologists that lead to overly complex, and irrelevant formats that become a burden and introduce as many problems as they are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What they&amp;#8217;re often not considering are the end user experiences. Who are the users, what are they trying to achieve, and how can these formats make for better, and easier utilization of these tools.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, there are expert users. People who really want to make intricately related, projected, spatially and spectrally bounded queries into data and utilize them in advanced analytics engines. But these are not the majority and they&amp;#8217;re not what is driving the long-term demand on the GeoWeb (you can use &amp;#8216;long-tail&amp;#8217; here if you would like). Who are the users that want to engage with this information on a daily basis in their personal lives, businesses, family, safety, governance, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Grassroots is an option&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a very big fan of grassroots organization and emergent structures. The needs tend to grow from real demand, and solutions are built through actual demonstrated benefit and impact. They are agile, evolutionary, and garner broad support amongst users and developers. These are all aspects that are beneficial to achieving standards that meet the needs of end users and provide good experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, it is not the only solution. Grassroots tends to look at the immediate needs and may not incorporate more distant issues and expected needs. They seek for broad appeal, and &amp;#8220;good enough&amp;#8221; rather than totally encompassing all potential aspects of all interested domains. Top-down, industry derived, committee driven standards provide more directed needs and objectives that can serve different types of users.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So the solution is a hybrid &amp;#8211; where grassroots solutions are encouraged as demonstrators and emergent needs &amp;#8211; that are then accepted and supported by more formal organizations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Conversation is required&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But we also need to open up the conversation beyond just technologists and experts. We need to be engaging and understanding users &amp;#8211; and not merely from the &amp;#8220;how do I sell them more of my coffee&amp;#8221;, but &amp;#8220;what can I do to make their lives better&amp;#8221;? And actually asking and engaging with them in dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This technique of user stories, and engagement is not new or unused. However it appears to be missing from the GeoWeb standards developments. We&amp;#8217;ve been designing standards for ourselves first, and then foisting these upon others. Instead, we need to understand their needs and issues, and then apply our expert knowledge in how to approach solutions properly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Other articles in the GeoWeb Standards series:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-intro//\" title=\"HighEarthOrbit: GeoWeb standards, where we are\"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-where-we-are/\" title=\"HighEarthOrbit: GeoWeb standards, where we are\"&gt;Where We Are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-current-problems/\"&gt;Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-where-we-need-to-go/\"&gt;Where We Need to Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-discoverability/\"&gt;Solutions: Discoverability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/3F5tnLzXkv0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/&gt;","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-where-we-need-to-go/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2009/08/28 03:58:35 -0400","original":"Fri Aug 28 07:58:34 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/08/28 03:58:34 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~3/9CBadDLPsmU/","title":"Geography Week and GIS Day at UVA","published":{"end_time":"2009/11/17 11:42:10 -0500","original":"Tue Nov 17 16:42:09 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/11/17 11:42:09 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/geography-week-and-gis-day-at-uva/#comments","id":"6","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/LawnMap.jpg\" width=\"185\" height=\"126\" alt=\"UVA Academical Village Map\" style=\"float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;\" /&gt;This week is National &lt;a href=\"http://www.mywonderfulworld.org/gaw.html\" title=\"My Wonderful World - Geography Awareness Week\"&gt;Geography Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt;.

Users are more easily able to publish data through collaborative sites, or find and download data that they can use to remix, reapply, reuse, and extend. The trajectory of open data sharing and utilization parallels the development of open-source, where the potential magnified impact of open sharing and collaboration yields far great outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, unlike the open source world, the legal and cultural frameworks in which to share data have not yet emerged. In code, there are a gamut of well known and widely used licenses: &lt;a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\" title=\"The GNU General Public License - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)\"&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\" title=\"The FreeBSD Project\"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt;, MIT, &lt;a href=\"http://www.apache.org/\" title=\"Welcome! - The Apache Software Foundation\"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, and more. While each has unique characteristics, their overall meaning and implications are easily understood by developers and comply with business operations that wish to use open-source software. The licenses are each unique, and can sometimes be confusing, yet there is a small vocabulary of regular licenses that developers can easily picked and choose.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the media world, &lt;a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\" title=\"Creative Commons\"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; developed an ingenious mechanism of licenses with clear verbage and branding that makes it readily accessible by nearly anyone. With miscible license options such as &amp;#8220;Share-Alike&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;No-Derivatives&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;Non-Commercial&amp;#8221;, media producers and consumers can clearly mark appropriate uses of their works. The impact is most clearly seen on content sharing sites such as Flickr and Slideshare where users can choose from a very small list of licenses to publish information, or search for information under certain terms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Because of these attractive features of understandability, small set, and branding, Creative Commons is increasingly utilized to openly share data. However, the Creative Commons apply only to creative works: stories, songs, photographs, and other media and as such are not truly valid when applied to databases.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the current landscape of data licenses are all completely unique, incompatible, and difficult to understand. This situation is further complicated by the existing data business ecosystem that thrives on charging large amounts of money to write, verify, and mix unique data licenses and prescribe legal uses of multiple combined data sources.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The implications are that the situation persists and groups that would like to share, or use, open data are relegated to complex, and expensive, legal counsel, or must accept risk and hope they remain within compliance, or at least outside of notice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are currently only two potential solutions currently in development. Creative Commons has developed &lt;a href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ\" title=\"CC0 FAQ - CC Wiki\"&gt;CC0&lt;/a&gt;, (&amp;#8221;C, C, Zero&amp;#8221;) &amp;#8211; which essentially removes all copyright from a work or data. Flickr utilizes the CC0 license for their derived boundary datasets.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The other upcoming option is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\" title=\"Open Data Commons » Open Database License (ODbL)\"&gt;Open Database License&lt;/a&gt; (ODbL), which is being put forth by the &lt;a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; community in order to create the equivalent Creative Commons, By-Attribution, Share-Alike (CC-BY-SA) for databases.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, even these two licenses have problems. CC0 is drastic in that it removes all copyright from the data, and so may not work with anything less than full, global release of data. Alternatively the ODbL is criticized for being &amp;#8220;too left&amp;#8221;, where there is an unclear potential that any utilization of data such as from OpenStreetMap would subsequently have to be released. This is similar to the GPL licenses, or &amp;#8220;viral&amp;#8221; licenses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What is missing is a clear set of data applicable open licenses that would allow anyone to easily demarcate the terms of the data they are releasing, and provide confidence to data consumers that they are in compliance with the data rights. The effect will be to allow data to more easily and justifiably be made available as well as tools to interact with this data. It will also address the many questions around collective, or combined, databases and derivative works, such as when deriving vector data from satellite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I spoke on a panel at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.opengeospatial.org/event/091007ets\" title=\"Emerging Technology Summit V: Spatial Law | OGC®\"&gt;OGC Summit on Spatial Law and Policy&lt;/a&gt;, which is one effort to build a community of developers, companies, data providers, and legal experts to address just such a need. In particular times of disaster response illuminate the immediacy of clear data sharing, which was the focus of the panel, but also more long term use of such data, and derivative works such as in rebuilding and recovery after an event.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/does-the-opendatabase-license-need-cc-style-modules/\"&gt;discussed the pitfalls of licensing and Creative-Commons style modules&lt;/a&gt; before, which raised some initial questions. But in the year since then nothing has really changed towards this broader vocabulary. Will Creative Commons merely become the de-facto, if non-applicable, licensing?

I went down Saturday afternoon and captured the locations and names of all the buildings and paths that will be up for the week. These are then loaded into OpenStreetMap with &lt;code&gt;start_date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end_date&lt;/code&gt; tags that notify the renderer when the features should be visible. It&amp;#8217;s a similar model to how Burning Man is mapped year after year as it walks along the Black Rock Desert.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s ephemeral mapping &amp;#8211; objects that exist in real place, but just for small slices of time. Important as any other building, yet typically relegated to flyers or verbal descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The fascinating part of projects like this is that OpenStreetMap allowed me to create a map that was useful and immediate. Within minutes of uploading the data, it was available as rendered tiles, vector data, and downloadable to GPS units and iPhones. People on the mall could immediately view the local map with this new information.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a nice demonstration of how community projects like &lt;a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; will continue to innovate faster, and more openly, then &lt;a href=\"http://www.tomtom.com/page/mapshare\" title=\"TomTom, portable GPS car navigation systems - mapshare\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8216;crowd-sourcing&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=\"http://www.google.com/mapmaker\" title=\"Google Map Maker\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/RBCNuMCZc0Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/&gt;","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/temporary-mapping-solar-decathlon/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2009/10/13 08:52:23 -0400","original":"Tue Oct 13 12:52:22 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/10/13 08:52:22 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~3/RBwC8UU5R5s/","title":"Haiti Mapping","published":{"end_time":"2010/01/15 07:56:10 -0500","original":"Fri Jan 15 12:56:09 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/15 07:56:09 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/haiti-mapping/#comments","id":"19","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Haiti-Earthquake-Relief-Maps.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Haiti-Earthquake-Relief-Maps-tm.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"304\" alt=\"Haiti Earthquake Relief Maps.jpg\" style=\"float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The last 2 days have been filled with coordinating various efforts in gathering information and volunteers responding to the massive Haiti earthquakes of January 12.

The conference, held in DC but led by O&amp;#8217;Reilly and TechWeb saw the convergence of technorati with government agencies, and beltway consultants. There was Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey sitting next to Vint Cerf &amp;#8211; old and new, talking about government leveraging social and internet tools &amp;#8211; and then the White House&amp;#8217;s Macon Phillips, Aneesh Chopra and Vivek Kundra talking about revolutions within the agencies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to &lt;a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/where20gov20-gov20-summit\" title=\"Where2.0+Gov2.0 - Gov2.0 Summit\"&gt;share my thoughts&lt;/a&gt; and our work with various agencies and their ability to leverage location and geospatial tools as a common collaboration point between citizens and government agencies and municipalities.

Data and information must freely flow between sources, analysts, consumers, observers, and archiving. In addition, there are definitely costs to retraining and maintenance that affects changing or introducing new software.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, the majority of reasons provided by the solicitation point to legacy decisions, old implementations, academic education of specific vendors (&lt;a href=\"http://www.mathworks.co.uk/programs/academia_cd/techkit_academia.html\" title=\"The MathWorks United Kingdom - Free MATLAB &amp;amp; Simulink in Academia CD Offer\"&gt;definitely&lt;/a&gt; not &lt;a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;amp;sid=aR2VjQFEqpew\"&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;), and the bold closing statement that the data from these software packages is not usable in any other tools.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s that last particular point that should be the most disturbing to the administration. Apparently all geospatial data being developed and utilized by the USAFA would be unusable without a sole software vendor. This causes concern over broader interoperability with other agencies and organizations, access to important national information, and archivability and retrievability.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The fault here isn&amp;#8217;t on ESRI. They offer an &lt;a href=\"http://www.esri.com/software/standards/index.html\" title=\"GIS and IT Standards Overview\"&gt;interoperability suite&lt;/a&gt; that supports OGC, ISO, and other standards that agencies could utilize. The fault lies with the government contracting that justifies this type of reasoning of renewal and continuation &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of single-vendor lockin.

Address Book, Mail, and iCal all &lt;a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/mail-ical-address-book.html\" title=\"Apple - Mac OS X - What is Mac OS X - Mail, iCal, Address Book\"&gt;detect addresses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://macbiblioblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/apple-data-detectors-are-so-useful.html\" title=\"The Macintosh Biblioblog: Apple Data Detectors Are So Useful\"&gt;provide links&lt;/a&gt; to maps. iPhoto and Aperture understand coordinate tags and can provide maps as well. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS\" title=\"iPhone OS - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"&gt;CoreLocation&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone, and now in Snow Leopard, allow any developer to get the location of the device via a cascading order of geolocation: GPS, Wifi, IP, etc. Apple themselves developed the &amp;#8220;Google Maps&amp;#8221; iPhone application &amp;#8211; just utilizing the Google API for tiles, location and routing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;More recently, Apple has provided for &lt;a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mobileme/whats-new/\" title=\"Apple - New features make MobileMe the ultimate iPhone accessory.\"&gt;&amp;#8220;lost iPhone&amp;#8221; tracking via MobileMe&lt;/a&gt;. Enterprising uses and developers have used this for friend and family tracking services.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, it&amp;#8217;s clear that Apple sees the important potential of location to support and augment almost all of their applications and platforms. Like any good business, the less dependent a company can be on third-party&amp;#8217;s for core functionality, the better. Therefore, it makes sense that Apple would investigate ways to own and control this key component.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And beyond pure business and strategy, there is a lot to gain by Apple controlling it&amp;#8217;s own location and &lt;a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps\" title=\"A List Apart: Articles: Take Control of Your Maps\"&gt;mapping stack&lt;/a&gt;. Apple obviously focuses on providing exquisitely crafted experiences. This should permeate through their maps as well. Look at the maps to your local Apple store for an example of how the cartography can fit into the look and feel of the Apple.com store interface. This same customization can exist throughout their product line. Maps applications and API can provide customized interfaces and styling.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Apple-Pirate-Map-tm.jpg\" width=\"159\" height=\"184\" alt=\"Apple Pirate Map.jpg\" style=\"float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And consider that Apple can also build out a MobileMe friend finding and family tracking service. There is now an inherent trust in Apple tools: easy to use, virus free, great for kids. These translate over to trust in sharing my location through my phone to my private family sharing portal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So in the end, what this signals is a major shift to provide broad, consumer facing compelling geospatial technologies in a well executed interface. Apple is already responsible for enabling location-based services to &lt;em&gt;cross the chasm&lt;/em&gt;, and is inducing the broad emergence of augmented reality. It makes perfect sense for them to ensure they control and can craft the entire experience. I&amp;#8217;m personally glad they have someone as expert as Jaron on the team.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/XnYOmWJLdY0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/&gt;","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/apple-geo/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"1969/12/31 19:00:01 -0500","original":"Fri Oct 02 15:28:03 UTC 2009","granularity":"usec","time":"1969/12/31 19:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~3/Ys-NiszKnPU/","title":"GeoWeb Standards – Discoverability","published":{"end_time":"2009/08/28 12:55:50 -0400","original":"Fri Aug 28 16:55:49 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/08/28 12:55:49 -0400"},"id":"25","link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-discoverability/#comments","summary":"We have a rich history of geography, cartography and GIS that is currently tucked away in top drawers, intranets, and repositories that may not stay online when we most need the data.

How do we expose these huge troves of data in a way that can be utilized across various domains. The GeoWeb is all part of the same web, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web\" title=\"Semantic Web - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"&gt;semantic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_Web\" title=\"Sensor Web - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"&gt;sensor&lt;/a&gt;, social, (and &lt;a href=\"http://www.interplanetaryweb.com/\" title=\"Home of Interplanetary Web\"&gt;interplanetary&lt;/a&gt;). So it is vital at the GeoWeb align itself with the web and the multitude of sources and endpoints that the web is reaching into.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are many possible solutions, and a few that are within easy grasp that we can build our tools to encompass, and develop practices that encourage utilization of these solutions while still moving forward onto better ones as the GeoWeb matures. So we&amp;#8217;ll take a few articles to look at specific solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Discoverability&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most prevalent issue, and the one that is most easily addressable, is the findability and discovery of geodata on the web. &lt;a href=\"http://randommarkers.blogspot.com/2009/07/thoughts-on-geoweb-standards.html\" title=\"Random Markers: Thoughts on GeoWeb Standards\"&gt;Mano Marks&lt;/a&gt; reflected this same sentiment in his blog post on standards.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In thinking about discoverability, there are several primary use cases to consider: Machine crawling, Human discovery, and Tool discovery. Providing data via just a single mechanism means that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get utilized and consumed to it&amp;#8217;s potential and so somewhere along the chain of utilization it will be a burden to actually incorporate into a workflow.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Think of the machines&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Machine crawling is the ability for any spider to walk links, find data, metadata, and formats automatically. It&amp;#8217;s what Google, or &lt;a href=\"http://geonetwork-opensource.org/\" title=\"GeoNetwork opensource\"&gt;GeoNetwork&lt;/a&gt; does to find and register data sources.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There was recently a discussion on &lt;a href=\"http://geowanking.org/pipermail/geowanking_geowanking.org/2009-August/024645.html\" title=\"[Geowanking] Better auto-discovery in the Geo-Web through \"&gt;auto-discovery in the GeoWeb&lt;/a&gt; suggesting the use of robots.txt, sitemaps, or embedded META tags in HTML pages.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Link-to-Data-1.jpg\" width=\"415\" height=\"323\" alt=\"Link to Data-1.jpg\" style=\"float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px;\" /&gt;Consider how a spider would get to a site: it follows a link to a geospatial portal from some blog, resource, or directly entered as a good place to get data. It does a GET request on the root homepage, &amp;#8220;/&amp;#8221; which most likely returns the index.html equivalent. The program then parses through that for links or additional information.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If the spider knows about them, then it may ask for a sitemap.xml or robots.txt. But nothing in the original page request noted that this potentially very complete listing of data was there. This problem is the equivalent of an application having to know that it needs to ask for a &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service\" title=\"Web Feature Service - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"&gt;GetCapabilities&lt;/a&gt; or other method to even discover what is available. Too much implicit knowledge of the specification is required for a program to easily discover new data and services.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What the program does see are these links that can contain information such as a link to a list of available resources. The simplest is a link to the Atom or RSS feed that can simply be a paginated list of all the resources available to the application. Within Atom, there is then the ability to link to various representations of that data in different formats. So applications are able to take the most appropriate format based on what they can consume.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I first &lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/a-proposal-georss-kml/\" title=\"A Proposal – GeoRSS &amp;amp; KML :: High Earth Orbit\"&gt;proposed how KML and GeoRSS&lt;/a&gt; could easily support one another via cross-links and with HTML documents. Atom has very nice &lt;code&gt;rel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; attributes that allow for linking to all sorts of different representations. You can even &lt;a href=\"http://blog.mapufacture.com/2007/08/14/kml-modules-services/\" title=\"KML Modules: Services :: mapufacture blog\"&gt;link to OGC services&lt;/a&gt; like WMS and WFS using atom links.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest here are looking at the currently approved list of &lt;a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header-06#section-6.2\" title=\"draft-nottingham-http-link-header-06 - Web Linking\"&gt;Atom link relation types&lt;/a&gt; that provide basic semantics for telling you how what this link means. Is it another page? just related? It&amp;#8217;s a limited set, but one that covers an approachable majority case for developers to begin using.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For example, mechanisms like &lt;a href=\"http://www.opensearch.org/\" title=\"Home - OpenSearch\"&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/a&gt;, specified in a &lt;code&gt;rel=\"search\"&lt;/code&gt;, simply notify the application that here is a service that it can query to get at additional resources. And with &lt;a href=\"http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft_1\" title=\"Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft 1 - OpenSearch\"&gt;OpenSearch-Geo&lt;/a&gt;, a geoweb crawler can query information within a specific location or bounding area.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Humans need data too&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Crawlers are great, they provide a say to pull together information into various other sites and tools to provide customized interfaces to users. However, within any site or tool, how should we expose geodata in a way that humans can easily use for whatever purposes the may have.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Again, links have become a very well understood concept on the Web. That underlined blue line states &amp;#8220;beyond me lies an unspecified amount of information about &lt;u&gt;this topic&lt;/u&gt;&amp;#8220;. However, these links typically imply that they will open another human readable HTML page in the browser. A problem caused by links to media such as geospatial data is that the content behind a link may not be just text, it could be an image, audio, movie, KML, database, or a service. Clicking on that link relies on the browser interpreting the MIME-type (remember the point about how vital mime-types are?) and opening the application the user has specified, or left as default.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So consider what this means for generic media. Clicking open a link to an image probably just opens the image in your browser, or opening a movie loads an embedded video player. Geodata browsers, however, probably doesn&amp;#8217;t have the same install base as say, Quicktime. Except perhaps GoogleEarth. The Web has become much more comfortable with clicking on a KML link and seeing Google Earth open up and show the data on a globe.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But something very vital often exists with a link to KML data &amp;#8211; a recognizable icon that notifies the user (as they learn) that it is a file that will open in Google Earth, or another KML viewer. This is the same as the very widely used RSS icon.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I discussed this idea before about the &lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geotag-icon/\" title=\"Geotag Icon :: High Earth Orbit\" rel=\"me\"&gt;geotag icon&lt;/a&gt; showing various other formats &amp;#8211; and now sites like &lt;a href=\"http://www.data.gov/catalog/raw/category/0/agency/0/filter/Environment/type/xcke/sort//page/1/count/25\" title=\"Data.gov - Raw Data Catalog\"&gt;Data.gov&lt;/a&gt; actually show the various data format options.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Data.gov-Raw-Data-Catalog-1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Data.gov-Raw-Data-Catalog-1-tm.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"46\" alt=\"Data.gov - Raw Data Catalog-1.jpg\" style=\"padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So what we need for GeoWeb standards are some visual representation to people that they are can clink on &lt;u&gt;this link&lt;/u&gt; and open a spatial relational database, or an OGC service, and perhaps have some confidence that there is an application that will provide them a useful way to access the data. (and I&amp;#8217;m still waiting for &lt;a href=\"http://sgillies.net/blog/\" title=\"Sean Gillies Blog\"&gt;Sean Gillies&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; ISO and Dublin Core icons)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, we should also employ emergent interfaces that show users the type of data links that are appropriate for them based on their profile or registered MIME-type handlers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Man-Machine hybrids&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So we have discovery links for machine crawlers to register and harvest geodata, and links for humans to click on to follow to data and within data. However, this can easily become overwhelming to need to click through to every link. Imagine if browsing Flickr through lynx.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Browsers already do a lot to assist users in finding relevant extra pieces of data in a page. RSS autodisovery links show up in URL bars notifying our feed readers that we can subscribe to this page. OpenSearch allows someone to embed this search into their browsers (most of them at least) to easily search the repository later.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;The decreasing cost of links&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These various approaches for different needs and use cases are all very well aligned. They don&amp;#8217;t rely on additional external files that we need to make sure stay up to date or that tools are built to &lt;em&gt;just know&lt;/em&gt; that the file can be found at a pre-defined location. Links cost next to nothing, mostly measured in bandwidth sizes, but provide a wealth of accessibility and discovery of geospatial data. Especially data in formats that make sense depending on the tools and use cases for different problems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, links alone don&amp;#8217;t address all the needs of the evolving GeoWeb, they merely provide for the integration of geospatial data with the rest of the web. An important, necessary, but not entirely sufficient first step. We need to consider the actual uses and interfaces of these standards, archival, synchronization, conflation and more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-intro//\" title=\"HighEarthOrbit: GeoWeb standards, where we are\"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-where-we-are/\" title=\"HighEarthOrbit: GeoWeb standards, where we are\"&gt;Where We Are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-current-problems/\"&gt;Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-where-we-need-to-go/\"&gt;Where We Need to Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-discoverability/\"&gt;Solutions: Discoverability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/Ys-NiszKnPU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/&gt;","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-discoverability/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"1969/12/31 19:00:01 -0500","original":"Fri Aug 28 07:58:39 UTC 2009","granularity":"usec","time":"1969/12/31 19:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~3/aLPyRjFAGyw/","title":"Data Dissemination to the Haiti Government","published":{"end_time":"2010/02/05 13:00:51 -0500","original":"Fri Feb 05 18:00:50 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/02/05 13:00:50 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/data-dissemination-to-the-haiti-government/#comments","id":"26","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4329833501/\" title=\"Haiti Data Dissemination Project by Andrew Turner, on Flickr\" style=\"float:right\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2701/4329833501_12fe004dd0_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Haiti Data Dissemination Project\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In a joint project with the World Bank, USAID, and numerous other partners, there are now 6 TB hard drives on the ground in Haiti with mapping tools and satellite and remote imagery data being shared with the Haitian government.

Within 3 days of an idea a small group of people helped coordinate and run a series of CrisisCamp Haiti code-a-thons across 5+ cities, over 400 participants, and at least 20 continuous hours of work. At least 6 projects were started, and many more existing projects added people to their community, taught new skills, and built out new features.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In general, the last week has involved a &lt;a href=\"http://wiki.crisiscommons.org\" title=\"CrisisCommons Wiki\"&gt;whirlwind of grassroots organization&lt;/a&gt; and development of numerous projects. This change of realtime engagement and response by volunteers and non-traditional organizations through internet has no doubt raised the hackles, or at least the concern, of traditional responders, agencies, and government. There are often voiced considerations of causing confusion, providing technology that will have no use, and lack of organization and hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Even within these grassroots participants there are calls for centralization, and building chains of responsibility that are somewhat antithesis to the very mechanism by which the project started and how it acts. Many of these projects formulated from simple ideas, growth through passion, an aligned community, and freedom to explore ideas and vet these within the organization. Over time the best ideas crystalize and become part of the long term project and others spin out to new projects.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&amp;#8217;s about the Mindshare and Multiplied Resources&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of a Crisis response there is an intense desire for people to engage and provide some type of resource: money, time, guidance, knowledge, contacts. At the same time, there is the alternate side of organizations seeking these vast, and limited, resources. Aid agencies put out SMS shortcodes for donations, PayPal links, matching funds. First responders need time, physical labor, and fortitude. Technology projects seek knowledge, translation, testing, documentation, data, integration.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps uniquely, technology has the possibility of multiplying any individuals efforts. By providing code, or data, and aggregating that data out, my contribution can feed into numerous other projects &amp;#8211; whereas time or money is nominally a single use resource. It can buy water, or work for an hour moving rubble, and that&amp;#8217;s all that resource can do for that time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So a perceived problem is in bifurcation and redundancy of efforts and confusion. This can largely be mitigated by open collaboration, and easily sharing data through interchanges. Projects like the People Finder is slowly converging on this type of solution through the use of &lt;a href=\"http://zesty.ca/pfif/\" title=\"People Finder Interchange Format\"&gt;PFIF exchange&lt;/a&gt; and common aggregation points with API&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re working on improving the CrisisCommons.org site and wiki in order to track active projects, aggregate similar efforts and point volunteers to project homes to join their individual communities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/bHOw9HmzsPA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/&gt;","summary":"On Saturday, CrisisCamp Haiti was a revolutionary step that was indubitably a success.

Perhaps its the long holidays and copious amounts of food, family and fun, or seeing a magic new number on the calendar that makes it feel like &amp;#8220;The Future!&amp;#8221;, or just a desire to take advantage of an allowed re-emergence of self and goal setting. Of course, time isn&amp;#8217;t discontinous, so 2010 isn&amp;#8217;t disconnected from the current continuum of development and trends &amp;#8211; but it&amp;#8217;s still worthwhile to take the time to step back and consider where we are and where we&amp;#8217;re going.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/12/31/2010-location-predictions/\" title=\"Location, Location, Location: 5 Big Predictions for 2010\"&gt;Mashable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/\" title=\"James Fee GIS Blog\" rel=\"met\"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, amongst many others, have excellent predictions &lt;a href=\"http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2009/12/31/5-predictions-geo-for-2010-and-5-things-that-wont-happen/\" title=\"James Fee GIS Blog » Blog Archive » 5 predictions Geo for 2010 and 5 things that won’t happen\"&gt;that will and won&amp;#8217;t happen&lt;/a&gt; in 2010. Generally they are good insight into trends in the geo and mobile space, although I will take up counterpoint to some of his suppositions on File Formats, Interfaces, OpenStreetMap and Augmented Reality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;File Formats and Interfaces&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Geo is definitely becoming mainstream &amp;#8211; everyone in my family has a PND, uses Google Maps, and are asking about various location sharing applications. In the next year we&amp;#8217;ll see geo become part of the assumed infrastructure, like the timestamp on a post or article, the location will be embedded.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think &lt;abbr title=\"Twitter, Apple, Google\"&gt;TAG&lt;/abbr&gt; (Twitter, Apple Google), as James puts it, will be the only location sharing services. They, along with even more used Facebook, will definitely be the general public interface to location query and sharing &amp;#8211; but just because of this reason alone they will have to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; generic, leaving room for specialized location based services to still thrive in niches. &lt;a href=\"http://foursquare.com\" title=\"FourSquare\"&gt;FourSquare&lt;/a&gt; offers &amp;#8216;gaming&amp;#8217; or Flickr visual media, and others for music, drinking, sight-seeing, and house finding. They will leverage TAG, or at least TG.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Apple is like the Nintendo of consumer technology &amp;#8211; more interested in providing an integrated, compelling experience, and privacy, before full open-ness and engaging with the developer or geek. They&amp;#8217;ll still have API&amp;#8217;s, but not something like OpenSocial, GeoRSS, or FireEagle integration.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The iPhone, and to lesser extent Android, have been revolutionizing mobile devices. They are truly providing windows into the rest of the web of data combined with the real world. It&amp;#8217;s natural for geopatial tools to move into these interfaces, but like any good user experience it won&amp;#8217;t be the same capabilities you find on a desktop or browser application. The utilities will be specialized for the small screens, finger inputs, and out-and-about tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For file formats, the Shapefile, unfortunately, isn&amp;#8217;t near &lt;abbr title=\"End of Life\"&gt;EOL&lt;/abbr&gt;. Too many tools only speak shapefile, and there is numerous legacy data that is still only available in Shapefile. Sites like &lt;a href=\"http://geocommons.com\"&gt;GeoCommons&lt;/a&gt; offer alternate formats for all the data, but that still won&amp;#8217;t remove this basic format. Only when there is a truly &lt;strong&gt;open&lt;/strong&gt;, license free, API to File GeoDatabases (FGDB), and every off the shelf tool can talk that API or Spatialite, will Shapefiles begin disappearing out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;GeoRSS and/or KML, on the other hand, will be in every service that does anything Geo. Looking at any iPhone App review that includes KML (or doesn&amp;#8217;t) brings up this point. Near enough everyone has Google Earth on their desktop, and Google is making big pushes in the utilization of Google Earth Plugin for in-browser virtual globes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Visualization Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To date, we&amp;#8217;ve been stuck with either Flash or JavaScript DOM magic (and yes, Silverlight is out there too) in order to do data and geospatial visualization in the browser. As I mentioned, Google has been pushing Google Earth Browser, but also more generally they released &lt;a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/o3d/\" title=\"O3D API - Google Code\"&gt;O3D&lt;/a&gt;, a modern incarnation of X3D, providing for more general capabilities for creating 3D browser experiences. VRML lives!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;More recently, there has been a resurgence in vector graphics that don&amp;#8217;t rely on proprietary technologies or additional plugins. SVG and Canvas support is pretty widely supported except in the infamous Internet Explorer (which I hear is still being used even today). Examples such as &lt;a href=\"http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/\" title=\"Protovis\"&gt;ProtoVis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://cartagen.org/\" title=\"Cartagen\"&gt;Cartagen&lt;/a&gt; and Tom Carden&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/misc/unemployment/\" title=\"Unemployment in the United States\"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; definitely demonstrate that SVG is just on the cusp of being able to do a majority of compelling visualizations capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another driver for alternative visualization platforms is the drive to mobile device integration. I don&amp;#8217;t see Apple allowing Adobe onto the iPhone anytime soon, and even Android doesn&amp;#8217;t have support. What types of visualization make sense is still a very open question &amp;#8211; but whatever they are will be done with something like SVG.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Geo Data Skirmishes&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;James suggests that OpenStreetMap &amp;#8220;won&amp;#8217;t dominate&amp;#8221;. While it won&amp;#8217;t dominate, I disagree that it won&amp;#8217;t continue to be extremely successful.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Google has recently moved to gathering their own data. They still have a long way to go, with many, many errors in roads, areas, addresses, and businesses and they&amp;#8217;re using the crowd to help clean it up. Google is in fact &lt;em&gt;proving&lt;/em&gt; the crowd-sourced model. It will be successful. Google is doing it with Google&amp;#8217;s data, so there is no positive external benefit to that work &amp;#8211; so to the industry it just looks like another data provider. However, with this proven model OpenStreetMap will succeed since any effort built into OSM has a positive benefit to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, there is a major difference in the trajectory OpenStreetMap is taking in the United States compared with Europe and other regions. In most other countries, the governments had very draconian licensing and as such OpenStreetMap was creating data from blank areas &amp;#8211; starting from scratch, and building a community of volunteers along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;By contrast, in the US a vast majority of the data is free, and becoming more available everyday under the new administration. Therefore the US has a broad coverage of decent data without having first built the user community. So the difficulty here is both in building out community, as well as engaging companies that can do the same thing on their own while retaining proprietary rights to the data.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s fascinating, and what signals the ultimate long term success of OpenStreetMap, is that US state, local, and federal government agencies themselves are engaging with OpenStreetMap. They are investigating how to put their data directly into OSM, and possibly even re-incorporate updates and modifications back to their own infrastructures. Some are even considering using OSM toolset &lt;strong&gt;as&lt;/strong&gt; their infrastructure. OpenStreetMap is going through some growing pains with respect to licensing, maintenance, and community &amp;#8211; but all necessary steps in moving from a small cadre of hackers to a global, public project.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As we see an increase in open government, specifically driven by the US Administration&amp;#8217;s directives, as well as other initiatives such as INSPIRE, this embrace and utilization of open platforms, and repositories, for sharing, federation, and syncronization of data will increase.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And as for augmented reality, it won&amp;#8217;t be as big as you think&amp;#8230; yet.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/w_9wNzNTXaE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/&gt;","summary":"As always, each new year brings a refreshed feeling of excitement.

Enterprising uses and developers have used this for friend and family tracking services.\nLooking forward, it’s clear that Apple sees the important potential of location to support and augment almost all of their applications and platforms. Like any good business, the less dependent a company can be on third-party’s for core functionality, the better. Therefore, it makes sense that Apple would investigate ways to own and control this key component.\nAnd beyond pure business and strategy, there is a lot to gain by Apple controlling it’s own location and <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps\" title=\"A List Apart: Articles: Take Control of Your Maps\">mapping stack</a>. Apple obviously focuses on providing exquisitely crafted experiences. This should permeate through their maps as well. Look at the maps to your local Apple store for an example of how the cartography can fit into the look and feel of the Apple.com store interface. This same customization can exist throughout their product line. Maps applications and API can provide customized interfaces and styling.\n<img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Apple-Pirate-Map-tm.jpg\" width=\"159\" height=\"184\" alt=\"Apple Pirate Map.jpg\">\nAnd consider that Apple can also build out a MobileMe friend finding and family tracking service. There is now an inherent trust in Apple tools: easy to use, virus free, great for kids. These translate over to trust in sharing my location through my phone to my private family sharing portal.\nSo in the end, what this signals is a major shift to provide broad, consumer facing compelling geospatial technologies in a well executed interface. Apple is already responsible for enabling location-based services to <em>cross the chasm</em>, and is inducing the broad emergence of augmented reality. It makes perfect sense for them to ensure they control and can craft the entire experience.

Perhaps its the long holidays and copious amounts of food, family and fun, or seeing a magic new number on the calendar that makes it feel like “The Future!”, or just a desire to take advantage of an allowed re-emergence of self and goal setting. Of course, time isn’t discontinous, so 2010 isn’t disconnected from the current continuum of development and trends – but it’s still worthwhile to take the time to step back and consider where we are and where we’re going.\n<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/12/31/2010-location-predictions/\" title=\"Location, Location, Location: 5 Big Predictions for 2010\">Mashable</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/\" title=\"James Fee GIS Blog\">James</a>, amongst many others, have excellent predictions <a href=\"http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2009/12/31/5-predictions-geo-for-2010-and-5-things-that-wont-happen/\" title=\"James Fee GIS Blog » Blog Archive » 5 predictions Geo for 2010 and 5 things that won’t happen\">that will and won’t happen</a> in 2010. Generally they are good insight into trends in the geo and mobile space, although I will take up counterpoint to some of his suppositions on File Formats, Interfaces, OpenStreetMap and Augmented Reality.\nFile Formats and Interfaces\nGeo is definitely becoming mainstream – everyone in my family has a PND, uses Google Maps, and are asking about various location sharing applications. In the next year we’ll see geo become part of the assumed infrastructure, like the timestamp on a post or article, the location will be embedded.\nI don’t think TAG (Twitter, Apple Google), as James puts it, will be the only location sharing services. They, along with even more used Facebook, will definitely be the general public interface to location query and sharing – but just because of this reason alone they will have to be <em>very</em> generic, leaving room for specialized location based services to still thrive in niches. <a href=\"http://foursquare.com\" title=\"FourSquare\">FourSquare</a> offers ‘gaming’ or Flickr visual media, and others for music, drinking, sight-seeing, and house finding. They will leverage TAG, or at least TG.\nApple is like the Nintendo of consumer technology – more interested in providing an integrated, compelling experience, and privacy, before full open-ness and engaging with the developer or geek. They’ll still have API’s, but not something like OpenSocial, GeoRSS, or FireEagle integration.\nThe iPhone, and to lesser extent Android, have been revolutionizing mobile devices. They are truly providing windows into the rest of the web of data combined with the real world. It’s natural for geopatial tools to move into these interfaces, but like any good user experience it won’t be the same capabilities you find on a desktop or browser application. The utilities will be specialized for the small screens, finger inputs, and out-and-about tasks.\nFor file formats, the Shapefile, unfortunately, isn’t near EOL. Too many tools only speak shapefile, and there is numerous legacy data that is still only available in Shapefile. Sites like <a href=\"http://geocommons.com\">GeoCommons</a> offer alternate formats for all the data, but that still won’t remove this basic format. Only when there is a truly open, license free, API to File GeoDatabases (FGDB), and every off the shelf tool can talk that API or Spatialite, will Shapefiles begin disappearing out.\nGeoRSS and/or KML, on the other hand, will be in every service that does anything Geo. Looking at any iPhone App review that includes KML (or doesn’t) brings up this point. Near enough everyone has Google Earth on their desktop, and Google is making big pushes in the utilization of Google Earth Plugin for in-browser virtual globes.\nVisualization Technologies\nTo date, we’ve been stuck with either Flash or JavaScript DOM magic (and yes, Silverlight is out there too) in order to do data and geospatial visualization in the browser. As I mentioned, Google has been pushing Google Earth Browser, but also more generally they released <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/o3d/\" title=\"O3D API - Google Code\">O3D</a>, a modern incarnation of X3D, providing for more general capabilities for creating 3D browser experiences. VRML lives!\nMore recently, there has been a resurgence in vector graphics that don’t rely on proprietary technologies or additional plugins. SVG and Canvas support is pretty widely supported except in the infamous Internet Explorer (which I hear is still being used even today). Examples such as <a href=\"http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/\" title=\"Protovis\">ProtoVis</a>, <a href=\"http://cartagen.org/\" title=\"Cartagen\">Cartagen</a> and Tom Carden’s <a href=\"http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/misc/unemployment/\" title=\"Unemployment in the United States\">experiments</a> definitely demonstrate that SVG is just on the cusp of being able to do a majority of compelling visualizations capabilities.\nAnother driver for alternative visualization platforms is the drive to mobile device integration. I don’t see Apple allowing Adobe onto the iPhone anytime soon, and even Android doesn’t have support. What types of visualization make sense is still a very open question – but whatever they are will be done with something like SVG.\nGeo Data Skirmishes\nJames suggests that OpenStreetMap “won’t dominate”. While it won’t dominate, I disagree that it won’t continue to be extremely successful.\nGoogle has recently moved to gathering their own data. They still have a long way to go, with many, many errors in roads, areas, addresses, and businesses and they’re using the crowd to help clean it up. Google is in fact <em>proving</em> the crowd-sourced model. It will be successful. Google is doing it with Google’s data, so there is no positive external benefit to that work – so to the industry it just looks like another data provider. However, with this proven model OpenStreetMap will succeed since any effort built into OSM has a positive benefit to anyone else.\nHowever, there is a major difference in the trajectory OpenStreetMap is taking in the United States compared with Europe and other regions. In most other countries, the governments had very draconian licensing and as such OpenStreetMap was creating data from blank areas – starting from scratch, and building a community of volunteers along the way.\nBy contrast, in the US a vast majority of the data is free, and becoming more available everyday under the new administration. Therefore the US has a broad coverage of decent data without having first built the user community. So the difficulty here is both in building out community, as well as engaging companies that can do the same thing on their own while retaining proprietary rights to the data.\nWhat’s fascinating, and what signals the ultimate long term success of OpenStreetMap, is that US state, local, and federal government agencies themselves are engaging with OpenStreetMap. They are investigating how to put their data directly into OSM, and possibly even re-incorporate updates and modifications back to their own infrastructures. Some are even considering using OSM toolset as their infrastructure. OpenStreetMap is going through some growing pains with respect to licensing, maintenance, and community – but all necessary steps in moving from a small cadre of hackers to a global, public project.\nAs we see an increase in open government, specifically driven by the US Administration’s directives, as well as other initiatives such as INSPIRE, this embrace and utilization of open platforms, and repositories, for sharing, federation, and syncronization of data will increase.\nAnd as for augmented reality, it won’t be as big as you think… yet.\n","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/excited-about-in-2010/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2010/01/07 08:20:03 -0500","original":"Thu Jan 07 13:20:02 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/07 08:20:02 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.086294,38.89051]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/geography-week-and-gis-day-at-uva/","title":"Geography Week and GIS Day at UVA","published":{"end_time":"2009/11/17 11:42:10 -0500","original":"Tue Nov 17 16:42:09 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/11/17 11:42:09 -0500"},"id":"36","link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/geography-week-and-gis-day-at-uva/#comments","summary":"This week is National Geography Awareness Week.

So I’m excited to say that there will be a <a href=\"http://crisiscommonsgita.eventbrite.com/\" title=\"Online Event Registration – Sell Tickets Online with Eventbrite\">CrisisCamp in Phoenix</a>, Arizona on the Sunday, April 25th before the conference at the convention center.

It’s a great opportunity to look at some of the possible integration of the crowd-sourced data and community tools into more traditional, and analytic, platforms. In CrisisCampDC, volunteers such as Scott Broo did a slope analysis of LIDAR data in analyzing IDP camp placement and potential flood areas. How would GIS experts coordinate with the larger CrisisCommons community to identify and support these types of efforts. What are the other potential uses of LIDAR, remote imaging, surveying, mobile reported data, field analysis and paper map printing.

Within 3 days of an idea a small group of people helped coordinate and run a series of CrisisCamp Haiti code-a-thons across 5+ cities, over 400 participants, and at least 20 continuous hours of work. At least 6 projects were started, and many more existing projects added people to their community, taught new skills, and built out new features.\nIn general, the last week has involved a <a href=\"http://wiki.crisiscommons.org\" title=\"CrisisCommons Wiki\">whirlwind of grassroots organization</a> and development of numerous projects. This change of realtime engagement and response by volunteers and non-traditional organizations through internet has no doubt raised the hackles, or at least the concern, of traditional responders, agencies, and government. There are often voiced considerations of causing confusion, providing technology that will have no use, and lack of organization and hierarchy.\nEven within these grassroots participants there are calls for centralization, and building chains of responsibility that are somewhat antithesis to the very mechanism by which the project started and how it acts. Many of these projects formulated from simple ideas, growth through passion, an aligned community, and freedom to explore ideas and vet these within the organization. Over time the best ideas crystalize and become part of the long term project and others spin out to new projects.\n<i>It’s about the Mindshare and Multiplied Resources</i>\nIn the beginning of a Crisis response there is an intense desire for people to engage and provide some type of resource: money, time, guidance, knowledge, contacts. At the same time, there is the alternate side of organizations seeking these vast, and limited, resources. Aid agencies put out SMS shortcodes for donations, PayPal links, matching funds. First responders need time, physical labor, and fortitude. Technology projects seek knowledge, translation, testing, documentation, data, integration.\nPerhaps uniquely, technology has the possibility of multiplying any individuals efforts. By providing code, or data, and aggregating that data out, my contribution can feed into numerous other projects – whereas time or money is nominally a single use resource. It can buy water, or work for an hour moving rubble, and that’s all that resource can do for that time.\nSo a perceived problem is in bifurcation and redundancy of efforts and confusion. This can largely be mitigated by open collaboration, and easily sharing data through interchanges. Projects like the People Finder is slowly converging on this type of solution through the use of <a href=\"http://zesty.ca/pfif/\" title=\"People Finder Interchange Format\">PFIF exchange</a> and common aggregation points with API’s.\nWe’re working on improving the CrisisCommons.org site and wiki in order to track active projects, aggregate similar efforts and point volunteers to project homes to join their individual communities.","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/grassroots-crisis-development-organization/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2010/01/18 14:21:21 -0500","original":"Mon Jan 18 19:21:20 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/18 14:21:20 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/haiti-mapping/","title":"Haiti Mapping","published":{"end_time":"2010/01/15 07:56:10 -0500","original":"Fri Jan 15 12:56:09 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/01/15 07:56:09 -0500"},"id":"39","link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/haiti-mapping/#comments","summary":"The last 2 days have been filled with coordinating various efforts in gathering information and volunteers responding to the massive Haiti earthquakes of January 12.

Utilizing the increasingly popular GoogleMaps platform they made it clear that people were going to engage in new and comfortable ways with geospatial technology.\nI remember being impressed by <a href=\"http://platial.com/\" title=\"Platial.com - Who and What's Nearby\">Platial</a> and the goal of providing a way for anyone to easily annotate places that mattered to them.When I originally pitched the idea of a <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/catalog/neogeography\">“Neogeography” book</a> to O’Reilly it was with the inspiration of Di-Ann’s drive to citizen access to geospatial tools that I considered how people should be able to map their genealogy and share their trips.\nAs <a href=\"http://brainoff.com\" title=\"Mikel Maron's Blog\">Mikel</a> and I built <a href=\"http://blog.mapufacture.com/\" title=\"mapufacture blog\">Mapufacture</a>, we partnered with Platial on several projects. Platial had attempted to make a local information aggregator that never really took off, and so we discussed how to utilize the geospatial data aggregation platform in Mapufacture to provide and aggregate content for Platial. I even helped build and test the Platial developer API using the first iterations of AtomPub and OpenSearch, the results of which can now be seen in Mapufacture’s and <a href=\"http://core.geocommons.com/help/Developer_API\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoCommons’ APIs</a>.\nIn looking at specifically the GeoWeb landscape, Platial definitely provided a necessary capability of easily allowing people to annotate and share locations. It is the more explicit version of more recent location-sharing tools such as FourSquare, BrightKite, or Latitude that merely ask where you are, not what’s important to you. When Mapufacture was acquired by <a href=\"http://www.fortiusone.com/\" title=\"FortiusOne Visual Intelligence Solutions | Visual Intelligence, Smarter Decisions\">FortiusOne</a>, the combination of the large head of geographic data in <a href=\"http://geocommons.com/\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoCommons</a>, combined with the very long-tail of aggregated sensor and streaming information provided for mixing disparate datasources and understanding of context and relevance.

Location is being integrated across all platforms and recognized as a primary component of any data. What differs is the means by which users will interact, create, and use this information depending on their needs, context, and capabilities.\nAs has been <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/01/social-mapping-startup-platial-finds-its-way-to-the-deadpool/\" title=\"Social Mapping Startup Platial Finds Its Way To The Deadpool\">widely</a> <a href=\"http://www.englishlearner.com/tests/reported_speech_quiz_1.shtml\" title=\"Reported Speech 1\">reported</a> by the <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2010/03/01/interview-why-platial-shut-down-and-what-that-means-for-geo/?utm_source=gigaom&amp;utm_medium=navigation\" title=\"Interview: Why Platial Shut Down and What That Means for Geo – GigaOM\">news</a>, GeoCommons is archiving the Platial user data and maps.

I went down Saturday afternoon and captured the locations and names of all the buildings and paths that will be up for the week. These are then loaded into OpenStreetMap with start_date and end_date tags that notify the renderer when the features should be visible. It’s a similar model to how Burning Man is mapped year after year as it walks along the Black Rock Desert.\nIt’s ephemeral mapping – objects that exist in real place, but just for small slices of time. Important as any other building, yet typically relegated to flyers or verbal descriptions.\nThe fascinating part of projects like this is that OpenStreetMap allowed me to create a map that was useful and immediate. Within minutes of uploading the data, it was available as rendered tiles, vector data, and downloadable to GPS units and iPhones. People on the mall could immediately view the local map with this new information.\nIt’s a nice demonstration of how community projects like <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\">OpenStreetMap</a> will continue to innovate faster, and more openly, then <a href=\"http://www.tomtom.com/page/mapshare\" title=\"TomTom, portable GPS car navigation systems - mapshare\">other</a> ‘crowd-sourcing’ <a href=\"http://www.google.com/mapmaker\" title=\"Google Map Maker\">options</a>.","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/temporary-mapping-solar-decathlon/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2009/10/13 08:52:23 -0400","original":"Tue Oct 13 12:52:22 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/10/13 08:52:22 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/the-need-for-clear-data-licenses/","title":"The need for clear data licenses","published":{"end_time":"2009/10/23 14:05:51 -0400","original":"Fri Oct 23 18:05:50 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/10/23 14:05:50 -0400"},"id":"46","link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/the-need-for-clear-data-licenses/#comments","summary":"There is clearly a movement to openly share data from numerous data sources: governments, organizations, Web sites, individuals, and devices.

Users are more easily able to publish data through collaborative sites, or find and download data that they can use to remix, reapply, reuse, and extend. The trajectory of open data sharing and utilization parallels the development of open-source, where the potential magnified impact of open sharing and collaboration yields far great outcomes.  \nHowever, unlike the open source world, the legal and cultural frameworks in which to share data have not yet emerged. In code, there are a gamut of well known and widely used licenses: <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\" title=\"The GNU General Public License - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)\">GPL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\" title=\"The FreeBSD Project\">BSD</a>, MIT, <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/\" title=\"Welcome! - The Apache Software Foundation\">Apache</a>, and more. While each has unique characteristics, their overall meaning and implications are easily understood by developers and comply with business operations that wish to use open-source software. The licenses are each unique, and can sometimes be confusing, yet there is a small vocabulary of regular licenses that developers can easily picked and choose.\nIn the media world, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\" title=\"Creative Commons\">Creative Commons</a> developed an ingenious mechanism of licenses with clear verbage and branding that makes it readily accessible by nearly anyone. With miscible license options such as “Share-Alike”, “No-Derivatives”, and “Non-Commercial”, media producers and consumers can clearly mark appropriate uses of their works. The impact is most clearly seen on content sharing sites such as Flickr and Slideshare where users can choose from a very small list of licenses to publish information, or search for information under certain terms.\nBecause of these attractive features of understandability, small set, and branding, Creative Commons is increasingly utilized to openly share data. However, the Creative Commons apply only to creative works: stories, songs, photographs, and other media and as such are not truly valid when applied to databases.\nInstead, the current landscape of data licenses are all completely unique, incompatible, and difficult to understand. This situation is further complicated by the existing data business ecosystem that thrives on charging large amounts of money to write, verify, and mix unique data licenses and prescribe legal uses of multiple combined data sources.\nThe implications are that the situation persists and groups that would like to share, or use, open data are relegated to complex, and expensive, legal counsel, or must accept risk and hope they remain within compliance, or at least outside of notice.\nThere are currently only two potential solutions currently in development. Creative Commons has developed <a href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ\" title=\"CC0 FAQ - CC Wiki\">CC0</a>, (”C, C, Zero”) – which essentially removes all copyright from a work or data. Flickr utilizes the CC0 license for their derived boundary datasets.\nThe other upcoming option is the <a href=\"http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\" title=\"Open Data Commons » Open Database License (ODbL)\">Open Database License</a> (ODbL), which is being put forth by the <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\">OpenStreetMap</a> community in order to create the equivalent Creative Commons, By-Attribution, Share-Alike (CC-BY-SA) for databases.\nHowever, even these two licenses have problems. CC0 is drastic in that it removes all copyright from the data, and so may not work with anything less than full, global release of data. Alternatively the ODbL is criticized for being “too left”, where there is an unclear potential that any utilization of data such as from OpenStreetMap would subsequently have to be released. This is similar to the GPL licenses, or “viral” licenses.\nWhat is missing is a clear set of data applicable open licenses that would allow anyone to easily demarcate the terms of the data they are releasing, and provide confidence to data consumers that they are in compliance with the data rights. The effect will be to allow data to more easily and justifiably be made available as well as tools to interact with this data. It will also address the many questions around collective, or combined, databases and derivative works, such as when deriving vector data from satellite imagery.\nA few weeks ago I spoke on a panel at the <a href=\"http://www.opengeospatial.org/event/091007ets\" title=\"Emerging Technology Summit V: Spatial Law | OGC®\">OGC Summit on Spatial Law and Policy</a>, which is one effort to build a community of developers, companies, data providers, and legal experts to address just such a need. In particular times of disaster response illuminate the immediacy of clear data sharing, which was the focus of the panel, but also more long term use of such data, and derivative works such as in rebuilding and recovery after an event.\nI’ve <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/does-the-opendatabase-license-need-cc-style-modules/\">discussed the pitfalls of licensing and Creative-Commons style modules</a> before, which raised some initial questions. But in the year since then nothing has really changed towards this broader vocabulary. Will Creative Commons merely become the de-facto, if non-applicable, licensing? For example, the Ordnance Survey <a href=\"http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/\">just released data</a> under <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/uk/\">Creative Commons-Attribution 2.0 UK</a>. I would be interested to hear more about other efforts that are seeking to create a simple, clear set of data licenses. In addition, how else have you dealt with confusing, and complicated data licensing issues in building new datasets, applications, or use cases?","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/the-need-for-clear-data-licenses/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2009/10/23 14:10:08 -0400","original":"Fri Oct 23 18:10:07 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/10/23 14:10:07 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/updates-from-haiti/","title":"Updates from Haiti","published":{"end_time":"2010/02/18 13:03:23 -0500","original":"Thu Feb 18 18:03:22 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/02/18 13:03:22 -0500"},"id":"47","link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/updates-from-haiti/#comments","summary":"Tom and Schuyler are wrapping up their first deploy with the World Bank to Haiti.

The community and ecosystem of Where2.0 continues to utilize cutting-edge technology to provide consumer and business services and needs. You can locate activities, friends, stores, media and more and have it integrated into mobile lives and online personas.\nThese are all great advancements, and are blurring the lines between the online digital data and our interaction with the real world. However it’s vital that we realize the real potential application of these technologies and what our legacy is on the entire world. How can we engage with global citizens, understand their needs and desires, and collaborate on building channels of information and tools that serve our individual and collective goals.\n\n  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/where2-that-matters\" title=\"Where2.0 That Matters\">Where2.0 That Matters</a>\n\nAlmost two years ago <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/mapufacture-joins-with-fortiusone/\" title=\"Mapufacture joins with FortiusOne  ::  High Earth Orbit\">I moved</a> from Michigan, with stints in California, to Washington, DC. I moved at an auspicious time in our nation as the highly contentious presidential election approached at the same time concerns on transparent monitoring of democratic elections and process loomed. Social media and streams such as twitter, smartphones, voice technology and visualization provided the components to demonstrate how we can enable citizens to share their experiences, their problems, and for us to openly see problems and victories as they occurred.\nThis same concept applies just a well around the world. Open platforms such as Ushahidi have helped bring citizen reporting in elections in India, Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan – each to different outcomes – but still in a way that harbinges a more open and transparent government process.\nNow through my experiences with <a href=\"http://crisiscommons.org/\" title=\"Crisis Commons\">CrisisCommons</a>, working with multinational organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations, and the federal and local governments, it’s clear to see how the leading edge of the <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/where2010\" title=\"Where 2.0 Conference 2010 - O'Reilly Conferences, March 30 - April 01, 2010, San Jose, CA\">Where2.0</a> community can have an amazing and unparalleled impact in providing understanding and change in global and local issues: Environment change, food security, humanitarian development, education, and disaster response.\nIn looking at the various open government initiatives, the questions arise in looking past the press release to the realized value of sharing data with businesses and citizens. I was struck my the foresight of the <a href=\"http://www.gis.state.ar.us/\">Arkansas AGIO</a> team in the realization of how sharing data as broad and wide as possibly helps mitigate their vulnerability to disaster by enabling responders open access to vital information that would assist in response.\nThis concept is apparent in how <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\">OpenStreetMap</a> was successful in Haiti. With the lack of official, government supplied data the best solution was to crowd-source the information from varied sources and rebuild the national data infrastructure, external to the government itself. While it has been unpredictably successful, the value continues to be the open access of the data by any and all organizations, and the eventual adoption by the government itself in rebuilding its capacity. The hope is that the government continues to openly collaborate with the global community in managing and maintaining this data so that the situation doesn’t need to reoccur.\nIn summary, the community is making a difference. The tools we develop in <a href=\"http://wherecamp.org\">WhereCamp</a>, IRC, <a href=\"http://osgeo.org\">open-source communities</a>, and from companies are changing the capabilities of crisis response and development. My message is to urge the larger community to continue to think how their solutions can have a more broad impact.\nIf your technology can help a consumer find a great $4 latte, that’s good for your business. If it can also help a child find clean water near their village, that’s good for the world.\n","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/where2-0-that-matters/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2010/03/31 14:41:54 -0400","original":"Wed Mar 31 18:41:53 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/03/31 14:41:53 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.885794,37.338475]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/who-owns-arunachal-pradesh/","title":"Who owns Arunachal Pradesh?","published":{"end_time":"2009/12/04 08:12:24 -0500","original":"Fri Dec 04 13:12:23 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/12/04 08:12:23 -0500"},"id":"50","link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/who-owns-arunachal-pradesh/#comments","summary":"I received an email the other day from a reader of my blog with a very interesting question:\n\nI was looking at a certain area in North East part of India ( State called “Arunachal Pradesh”) which is integral part of India.\nBoth URL’s have different take.

[Google Maps] shows it as Disputed Territory ( with Dash lines) and [Google Ditu] shows it altogether as part of China!\nSo, that got me unruffled and to question validity of both these sources. How does Ditu differ from Google maps? Whats association between the two and does Ditu has autonomy to change the boundary of the maps as per its wish.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh\">Arunachal Pradesh</a> is a border region between China and India – with 70% of the land being claimed by the Chinese as South Tibet. The border in question was decided in 1914 and called the McMahon Line, but never agreed upon by the Chinese. The <a href=\"http://ditu.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;sll=38.89788,-77.087224&amp;sspn=0.009252,0.019419&amp;brcurrent=3,0x3761317e9c4a2cc1:0x1fc12c628413da99,0%3B5,0,0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;ll=28.241489,95.114136&amp;spn=2.680778,2.878418&amp;t=h&amp;z=8\">Google Ditu</a> vs. <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;sll=24.20689,87.033691&amp;sspn=11.088655,11.513672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Arunachal+Pradesh&amp;ll=28.401065,93.768311&amp;spn=5.352484,9.942627&amp;t=h&amp;z=7\">Google Map</a> views.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4156297169/\" title=\"Google Maps vs. Google Ditu by Andrew Turner, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2748/4156297169_e472fdbedb.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"291\" alt=\"Google Maps vs. Google Ditu\"></a>\n\n  <i>Comparing Google Maps (background) with Google Ditu (foreground tinted red)</i>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4156297169/\" title=\"Google Maps vs. Google Ditu by Andrew Turner, on Flickr\"></a>\nTerritorial disputes are definitely not a new thing – however what is perhaps alarming is that there are two different representations of reality from the same vendor and data providers. So this is entirely a representational decision that is most likely driven by business and government pressures.\nWhat’s particularly interesting here is that primarily these definitions of boundaries derive from the data providers. You can look in the bottom right corner for who the data providers are. For both versions the providers are the same: TerraMetrics, Mapabc, and Europa Technologies.\nSo it seems that the cartographic designers at Google Ditu have decided to represent it a certain way. Unfortunately, the map has no additional metadata. As broad consumption of maps increases, there is a commensurate interest in the why and what behind them. Who said these are the boundaries, when were they set, and why are they shown in this language?\nAnd I don’t mean the long reams of unreadable metadata that are the current standards in the geospatial community, I mean human understandable descriptions of the various aspects of the data, while allowing additional discovery to deeper data.\nOne place that you can look at the data behind the source of the map is in <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=28.03&amp;lon=94.5&amp;zoom=7&amp;layers=B000FTF\">OpenStreetMap</a>. Arunachal Pradesh is shown similar to Google Maps version, and a user could optionally download the data to see the attributes, edit history and sources. Alternatively I can look in GeoCommons for the <a href=\"http://finder.geocommons.com/overlays/1301\">GADM Admin boundaries of India</a> and see pertinent data on who provided the data, sources, and so on.\n<b>Boundary disputes in a bi-directional medium</b>\nThe representation of boundaries is obviously a very contentious issue in mapping. Maps are perceived, and often do inform, territory. There is a long history of map representation being used to influence, coerce, and force land rights.\nUnfortunately, even in a “Web2.0″ world of bi-directional sharing and collaboration, with maps we’re still often forced to accept a particular viewpoint. They have on-the-ground meaning and political impact. A well known example of this were the first “edit wars” in OpenStreetMap with the names of places in Cyprus. The resolution was to by default abide by the on the ground signage, but also store both versions and allow users to provide their own personalized perspective.\nUnderstanding, awareness, and discussion about these issues is the reason for projects like OpenStreetMap or GeoCommons where you can download the information, build and share your own maps that represent your perspective.There\nThere isn’t an easy answer here – with companies such as Google there are obviously market, and government, forces that direct how to represent contentious issues. The best solution is to offer background, open data, and alternative perspectives. Without a voice, citizens are relegated to discussions by officials they may, or may not, have elected – and no meaningful way to illustrate their interpretation.\n","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://highearthorbit.com/who-owns-arunachal-pradesh/feed/atom/","updated":{"end_time":"2009/12/04 08:12:24 -0500","original":"Fri Dec 04 13:12:23 UTC 2009","granularity":"sec","time":"2009/12/04 08:12:23 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[94.485168,28.044319]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/world-bank-data-released/","title":"World Bank Data released","published":{"end_time":"2010/04/20 09:05:11 -0400","original":"Tue Apr 20 13:05:10 UTC 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/04/20 09:05:10 -0400"},"id":"51","link:replies (text/html)":"http://highearthorbit.com/world-bank-data-released/#comments","summary":"Announced today, the World Bank is openly releasing all of their indicator data.

The concept is definitely interesting as it provides a way to rapidly generate road data over the entire globe without need of manual tracing.\r\nHowever, I remarked that it was particularly interesting that Steve was working on this. Several years ago, when <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\">OpenStreetMap</a> was still an ambitious but unproven concept many people argued that road detection was a useful, and perhaps necessary, mechanism for actually capturing all the road data. Steve was quite adamant that while it was possible – and he demonstrated it – it wouldn’t work for other reasons.\r\nOpenStreetMap is more than just a set of lines that render to nice maps. It is a topologically connected, classified and attributed, labeled network of geographic entities. Each road consists of intersections, road classifications, names, speed limits, overpasses, and lanes. OpenStreetMap has provided a very rich set of linked, geographic data.\r\nAnd beyond the data, it has built a community of invested members that careful capture, annotate, and cultivate the data in OpenStreetMap. This means that the data is captured, but also updated and maintained (ideally) with new information, changes, and other entities such as parks, buildings, bus stops and more.\r\nSo Steve convincingly pointed out that automatic road identification was interesting, it would circumvent these other benefits of what OpenStreetMap was working on: rich connected data, and a community of volunteers that would build and maintain the dataset. Road detection has a tendency to generate a large amount of data in an area that no one is actively working on the data. So you can gain what appears to be good coverage but limited local knowledge on intersections, names, and other metadata.\r\nI don’t think that these are insurmountable problems. The act of capturing GPS data can be tedious, inaccurate, or not readily possible in remote areas. Road detection can provide this data and users can work afterwards to improve the data, either remotely or using even simpler mobile devices that a user can annotate features without having to capture the entire geographic road line.\r\nSo my comment the other day was about pointing out an interesting change in message and strategy. I applaud the work of Steve and the Bing team in developing new tools, but there are many other pieces that warrant consideration. Steve even asked often if the bulk import of the TIGER/Line data was good or bad for the US community. In the end, I believe it was the right thing as it provided a canvas of data using open data that provided a validity to skeptics that OpenStreetMap was viable and valuable.\r\nNow that OpenStreetMap has become increasingly adopted by the world’s largest providers and users of data it is time to evaluate new tactics for gathering and maintaining data. However this can’t be at the expense of what made OpenStreetMap a success for the past 5+ years.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/pDFEz1vscr4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"Yesterday Steve Coast announced that Bing had released a new tool for doing automatic road detection using satellite imagery.

In playing with the interface, I noticed how MapQuest added a tab at some point for showing and hiding the sidebar of search results and other associated design choices and differences.\r\nMapQuest uses an “Outie” tab (highlighted in the screenshot below). The design choice was clearly to make it very explicit for users to show and hide the sidebar as it protrudes into the map interface. The pan and zoom controls are on the right-hand side, so when you toggle the sidebar, the controls stay in the same location. Another interesting aspect is how the map resizes. In MapQuest, the same geographic center and extents remain in the screen center – so as the sidebar closes the map shifts to the left and expands slightly.\r\n<a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Search-Results-Mapquest-2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Search-Results-Mapquest-2-tm.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" alt=\"Search Results | Mapquest-2.jpg\"></a>  <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Search-Results-Mapquest-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Search-Results-Mapquest-1-tm.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" alt=\"Search Results | Mapquest-1.jpg\"></a>\r\n\r\nCurious about how this varies, I checked in Google Maps. They chose to be much more subtle about their sidebar toggle. It is an “innie” that is subtly hidden within the header. Closing the sidebar turns the selection to an “outie”, but still remains out of the way in the header. A particularly interesting decision is that the map remains in the same location – so the zoom pan controls move but new areas of the map are exposed. So while the user doesn’t have a context shift (points on the map remain in the same area of the screen) the map now needs to be recentered so that the focus area can be kept in the center.\r\n<a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Zoo-Washington-DC-Google-Maps-2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Zoo-Washington-DC-Google-Maps-2-tm.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" alt=\"Zoo, Washington, DC - Google Maps-2.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Zoo-Washington-DC-Google-Maps-1-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Zoo-Washington-DC-Google-Maps-1-1-tm.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" alt=\"Zoo, Washington, DC - Google Maps-1-1.jpg\"></a>  \r\n\r\nLastly, looking at Bing maps it’s a bit of a hybrid between the two. The sidebar tab is in the header like Google, but hiding the sidebar re-centers the map like MapQuest. The controls in Bing are in the header, so they don’t need to shift when the sidebar is toggled. What’s perhaps a little confusing is there is also an “X” close button next to the sidebar tab that clears the search results. It’s not really clear why you would want to clear results – and instead there should be an option to go back to the “table of contents” or similar concept that shows simple links for directions and more.\r\n<a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Bing-Maps.jpg\"><img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Bing-Maps-tm.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" alt=\"Bing Maps.jpg\"></a>\r\n\r\nMuch like the emergence of Pan-Zoom bars have become the defacto standard in web mapping interfaces – the sidebar has also become nearly ubiquitous. So it’s interesting to see the slight variations as interaction designers experiment with what users will find easy to understand.\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/1rKNusvfQFw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"This morning MapQuest launched their US support of OpenStreetMap at open.mapquest.com.

Focused primarily on the role of logistics in response activities, organizations such as DHS/FEMA, UPS, US Coast Guard, American Red Cross, and academic institutions like LSU and Michigan State University shared their experiences in supporting the emergent, dynamic, and chaotic operations of distributing resources. The topics for this workshop primarily focused on Demand Signal Visibility – who needs what, where?\r\nI found the world of crisis supply chain operations fascinating in the complexities of moving something like tents to remote areas of China or even locally like Louisiana. There is a very complex landscape of Federal, State, and Local government, VOADs (Voluntary Organizations Acting in Disaster) such as Red Cross, FBOs (Faith Based Organizations) such as Salvation Army, and the Military. And that’s not even considering the complex organizational and operational processes within these organizations. Clearly the effect is a working, but highly inefficient and potential fragile operational capacity in responding to disasters. The flood of unwanted in-kind donations (as high as 90% of donated goods need to be discarded because they are unusable), competing interests, conflicting operations, and communications issues result in frustration and a concern that in a catastrophic disaster – particularly within the United States – that we would be ill-prepared to respond effectively.\r\nHowever, these organizations are very interested in understanding how they can better coordinate and collaborate. There is a clear realization of the need to put in place better plans before a disaster occurs. The entire purpose of the workshop was to convene the different communities of government, military, NGO, private industry, and academia in order to share difficulties and brainstorm solutions.\r\nEmerging Trends\r\nIn particular, my talk shared the emerging drivers, trends, and issues in information sharing and collaboration in humanitarian activities. Major events from Katrina, through Haiti earthquake and reconstruction have highlighted that citizen engagement through digital media is dramatically changing the on-the-ground needs sharing and response capabilities. Traditional crisis response organizations currently utilize a very top-down approach, be that at the “local” level of first responders in the country or region – but also through national efforts led by FEMA – that is being faced with these trends but currently not clear on how to incorporate the data. “Social Media” is currently primarily supported through external affairs and is considered a publicity mechanism. However, as was made clear in the recent American Red Cross Survey, 74% of the polled adults <i>expect</i> less than a 1-hour response to their need when published through a service such as Twitter or Facebook.\r\nOpen Sharing\r\nThe internet has provided a global, connected network that dramatically lowers the barrier to free exchange of data. Administrative policies focused on open-government, combined with general acceptance that shared data improves the quality and grows value is leading organizations to more readily share their data – particularly with open-standards.\r\nRealtime Data\r\nInexpensive, connected, and prevalent mobile devices are dramatically increasing the number of ’sensor nodes’ that are publishing data continuously to the web. Social media, resource tracking, news, weather and climate sensors are all providing continous streams of data that have a huge value in providing situational awareness and communications.\r\nAnalytics\r\nIn order to understand the deluge of information, analysis tools are being put closer to users – particularly domain experts and locally situated groups that\r\nSocial Networks\r\nPeople are connecting and collaborating through online networks, bridging social, family, professional and local communities. They’re able to communicate in real-time about issues they care about.\r\nCrisis Crowds\r\nAround any crisis, communities of interest – diaspora, family, and general good will – is causing people to want to actively participate in helping the survivors.\r\nNew sensor platforms\r\nMobile phones, Texting, broadband internet allow anyone, anywhere to be sharing data and providing information and feedback. In addition, inexpensive digital devices are allowing people to build ad-hoc balloon imaging and other sensing platforms.\r\n‘Citizen’ Engagement\r\nCombined, all of these capabilities are actually allowing the local, affected populations to have an immediate, positive impact on their response. Neighbors and communities are able to assist one another and coordinate with official response organizations.\r\nWork we’re doing\r\nGroups like CrisisCommons have a lot to offer as it combines members of these response organizations with technologists, private industry, and citizens in developing agile and supportive capabilities. In the workshop it became clear of the potential and growing need to utilize digital media as part of operational support and not just as public outreach. Integrating aggregation, analysis, and curation tools of the huge flows of data are vital to organizations so that they can understand their own operational picture as well as the broader ‘common operating picture’ across the entire disaster.\r\nAt FortiusOne, we’ve built GeoIQ to integrate dynamic data such as Twitter and Flickr with logistics information of shelters, hospitals and other infrastructure to provide these common operating pictures both within organizations as well as on the ground through field-deployed systems. GeoCommons has served as a tremendous repository of data and information analysis that augments these operations by providing to the general public the capability to contribute and share these analyses.\r\nDisaster response is changing quickly – information technology playing a key role in quickly augmenting local and remote capabilities. The future is in combining these with actual logistics of materials through the international and national responders to be more effective and supportive.\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/FqA9m2Z9RSQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"This week I attended and spoke at the Humanitarian Disaster Coordination workshop held at UVA’s Darden School of Business.

Since Spring of this year, the engineering team at FortiusOne has been very hard at work writing a major refactor of GeoIQ, the underlying platform behind <a href=\"http://geocommons.com/\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoCommons</a>. Originally, GeoIQ was actually three web applications that communicated to one another over HTTP REST interfaces. In many ways it was an elegant solution but also an element of pre-mature architecture. HTTP is not a good medium for very high-rate communications and we found a lot of redundant code in the corresponding Finder, Maker, and Core applications. Besides this, the separation of functionality was a decent user experience detriment. Besides the plaform refactoring we also had a major refactoring of the visualization of (the app formerly known as) Maker.\r\nThe end result is a much more streamlined, and maintainable platform. On Sunday we deployed this update to <a href=\"http://geocommons.com\">GeoCommons</a> and already you can see an improvement. In addition, implemented a number of new capabilities that we’ll be rolling out over the next few weeks. The first one we’ve released is temporal visualization. Similar to spatial panning of the geographic area, you can now pan and animate through time as well. We’ve extended the brewer process to ask users to let us know which attributes to use in the visualization. More on that to come.\r\nAnother major effort of our work in relaunching the GeoIQ platform was sharing an early edition of the <a href=\"http://geocommons.com/help/Developer_API\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoIQ API</a>. <a href=\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/09/29/geoiq-relaunches-with-first-location-analytics-platform/\" title=\"GeoIQ Relaunches with First Location Analytics Platform\">ProgrammableWeb</a> covered the news and highlighted the data management, thematic visualization, and analysis methods that are available. It is all based on REST so should be straight-forward for developers to dive in and start building applications. We’ve also completely wrapped the Map visualization with a JavaScript interface for control on the interactivity and styling of the map and controls. You can now programmatically create your choropleth maps with animated twitter streams – or whatever you want – in a few lines of code.\r\nWe already have a number of clients building on our API, so we thought the rest of the World should too. You’ll start seeing some <em>major</em> organizations launching GeoIQ enabled sites and tools in the next few months – prepare for an onslaught of open geodata and collaboration.\r\nGive the new <a href=\"http://geocommons.com/\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoCommons</a> a try.

Surrounded by open internet luminaries such as <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/\" title=\"Clay Shirky's Internet Writings\">Clay Shirky</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/\" title=\"Joho the Blog\">Dave Weinberger</a>, <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com\" title=\"Worldchanging: Bright Green\">Ethan Zuckerman</a>, and many others, we shared our experiences in creating CrisisCamp and growing the CrisisCommons. Our purpose was to gain insight into what has become apparent as a yet unmet, but highly desired role of a volunteer crowd advocate to crisis response organizations.\r\nCrisisCamps emerged and have been successful by having connected with the inherent desire for humans to help one another – and preferring to do so in a way that is more meaningful than just donating $5. They want to give of their time, expertise, and capabilities. The last two decades have additionally provided a global information network that has embraced open communication, open source, and open information. The CrisisCamps were venues that hosted people that were willing to spend their spare time, and many times take time off of work, to contribute to the larger community response.\r\nAlong the way, we learned many lessons. CrisisCommons was created as a way to capture the knowledge and relationships that were passing through the various response and volunteer communities. We’ve held events such as <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/crisiscommons-and-congress/\">CrisisCongress</a> to convene the many leaders of the local groups. Together we identified the successes, failures, and gaps in our approach. The goal was to identify what the potential role and methods of CrisisCommons and CrisisCamps should embrace.\r\nInsight Redoubled\r\nWhile presenting this history at the Berkman Center, the room of normally very <i>loquacious</i> individuals sat in focused attention. Some with knowing and understanding looks, and others with new interest and inquisitiveness. As we stopped to ask for questions we were urged that we had spent much more time thinking about the problem and were providing valuable knowledge on the current response and volunteer landscape and potential to the audience. Where we had sought to get immediate feedback we were providing new information and insight to this experienced group.\r\nOf course, after we had shared the history, evolution, and current plans for the future the audience was ready to share their own experiences (see <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/011551.html\" title=\"Worldchanging: Bright Green: Crisis Commons, and the Challenges of Distributed Disaster Response\">Ethan’s thoughts</a>)- many summarized as “You’ve done amazing work – and have seen the issues I’ve noticed during my career but have deftly avoided some of the larger pitfalls.”\r\nA major issue that was discussed revolved around the specific role CrisisCommons has with respect to Volunteer Technical Communities (VTC) and Crisis Response Organizations (CRO). Is CrisisCommons an advocate of VTC’s, or is it more of a CRO that has relationships and responsibility with official organizations and also the ability to effectively communicate with VTC’s.\r\n<img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Final-Draft-Sloan-Presentation1.png\" width=\"507\" height=\"177\" alt=\"Final Draft - Sloan Presentation.png\">\r\nCrisisCommons needs to find a way to act and be perceived as a member of the major organizations without quelling the grassroots and emergent behavior that have made CrisisCamps successful and effective. Yet with more process and research, CrisisCommons can provide real guidance and shepherding of CrisisCamp and VTC efforts that would affect both real, needed, innovation to unmet problems as well as adoption and reliability of developed solutions.\r\nToday we are headed to the Sloan Foundation to share our work and lessons learned. The Sloan Foundation provided funding to support the research and meetings such as CrisisCongress that brought all the active leaders to one place to discuss these larger issues and set a direction forward. We’re truly grateful for their support and look forward to learning what they see as the future of CrisisCommons.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/s5i7WZ8ypHE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"Last week, Noel, Heather, Chiara and I traveled to Cambridge to speak at the Harvard Berkman Center.

Through our work on GeoCommons, OpenStreetMap, and deployments of data sharing to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Haiti and how citizens with organizations need to engage together in dicussing the need for data, methods for collectively gathering, and ways to open share and capture feedback in order to improve the overall quality as well as impact of open data.\r\nOpenStreetMap has understood this from the beginning in promoting through “<a href=\"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_Weekend_Howto\">mapping parties</a>“. These parties had the explicit goal of mapping a region and training new mappers, but implicitly they created a community of like-minded local citizens that self-identified their desire to spend time and energy in working together to gather and open data. It is basic initiatives like this that are vital at the local and regional levels.\r\nIf you’re near Atlanta, or can come by to the conference, hope to see you there. And regardless, think about how you can connect within your community of interest to start a dialogue and collaboration around open data.\r\nTags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/openstreetmap\" title=\"See the Technorati tag page for 'openstreetmap'.\">openstreetmap</a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/uOyfanlpkp0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"Unfortunately I missed State of the Map in Girona, Spain this year.

Amongst my friends they considered an interesting, but quirky idea to only have a cellphone. Today <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless201005.htm\" title=\"Products - Early Release - Wireless Substitution - July-December 2009\">one in four households in the US</a> are strictly wireless.\r\nSo back to media. Why should I pay a 200% cost to view media on a fixed schedule – even though I have a cable DVR for an additional $15/month that still adheres to an antiquated idea of recording only when a program is shown. I have the ability to access on demand, mobile, high-quality media when and where I choose to watch it, free of time constraints.\r\nIn addressing this potential, the concept of carrying forward the <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1657\" title=\"iTunes Store: Movie Rental Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\">“rental” model</a>, in both price and usage restrictions, is laughable. If I can’t sell or lend the media, why not just stream it to me on demand and ensure that your licensing costs are met on volume.\r\nOf course, my options on what I can subscribe to are limited. Through NetFlix I can watch movies and some television series – Hulu has another set of programs and Hulu Plus will make older archives more available through more devices. But as we approach the Fall season and popular US based sports start – <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn3/\" title=\"Watch Live Streaming Sports Online - ESPN3\">ESPN allows me</a> to watch some sporting events online – but will they start charging? Will home cooking shows, or other nice networks start their own online subscriptions – each for $10 per month?\r\nWe could quickly end up paying much more in á la carte programming if we pay per subscription – something that “cable packages” tried to address by bundling together stations at a discount price. However they suffered from the choice to toss in the lesser watched channels to encourage the edge customers or beef up station count numbers for advertising.\r\nSo while we’re entering a time of on-demand, individualized stations we have the liklihood of higher overall costs. I already pay much more in internet access across all of my devices than I ever did for cable alone. But the improved access and enjoyment of that media will allow me to choose and indicate the value of accessing that media – when and how I choose to.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/Jt7J-SDvyiE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"In 2000 I cancelled my phone landline because I was carrying a cellular phone that antiquated my physically fixed, low-tech, voicemail-less and (at the time) expensive land-line.

At the time, we just wanted to pull together first responders, technologists, government, NGO, and interested citizens to discuss crisis mitigation, response, and humanitarian relief efforts. The two-day event was a complete success in connecting these communities in dialogue and projects that led to field deployed projects. In the last meeting of CrisisCampDC we discussed the potential future of these camps – and on a whim I registered <a href=\"http://crisiscommons.org\" title=\"crisiscommons.org\">crisiscommons.org</a>, installed MediaWiki and Mikel provided a logo.\r\nFor the next 9 months, side projects occured and interesting conversations continued, but without a single coherent focal point. What happened in early January completely changed how we thought about volunteer crisis response. In the hours and days following the Haitian earthquake thousands of volunteers around the world began brainstorming and contributing to projects that would hopefully have a positive benefit to the response and affected communities.\r\nCrisisCampHaiti\r\n<img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/CrisisCommons.jpg\" width=\"113\" height=\"126\" alt=\"CrisisCommons.jpg\">By Thursday we had decided to host a <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/grassroots-crisis-development-organization/\" title=\"\">CrisisCampHaiti in Washington DC</a> and very quickly similar groups decided to hold events in 4 other cities. The CrisisCamps provided a focused venue for developers, volunteers and organizations to coalesce and collaborate on developing needed solutions and information that would assist on the ground efforts.\r\nOpenStreetMap had already been identified as a key resource in the response – starting first with the use of unclassified 1990’s paper maps, and then increasingly with the availability of high-resolution and up-to-date commercial satellite imagery. This provided for a very simple task for general volunteers with a computer and internet connection to begin tracing road networks and infrastructure. Videos like <a href=\"http://imaphaiti.com\">iMapHaiti.com</a> got new volunteers up to speed and mapping within 10 minutes.\r\nThe technical expertise brought to bear was powerful. Mobile phone apps such as <a href=\"http://traduiapp.com/\" title=\"Tradui - Creole &amp; English Language Translator for iPhone and Android\">Tradui</a> for translating between Kreyol and English; <a href=\"http://www.wehaveweneed.org/\" title=\"we have we need\">We Have We Need</a>, a place where relief organizations can quickly post their most urgent needs and have them matched by generous donors during a time of crisis, and more.\r\nDevelopers conceptualized and created green field applications, others worked on adapting existing tools to new uses or connecting them together – such as an Ushahidi to OpenStreetMap bridge that would allow for people on the ground to send mobile messages that could update the actual map data.\r\nThe outpouring of effort was amazing. In essence, the realization was that people wanted to contribute. And instead of sending $5 via a text message they wanted to donate their even more valuable time and expertise to provide true value and support.\r\nCrisis Continuity\r\nThese efforts have been widely discussed, and the power of thousands of connected, capable, and caring technical and helpful people immediately pointed at a problem is compelling. However, what is not immediately apparent is that these efforts, tools, and communities are not completely ad-hoc and spontaneous. They have evolved through joint experiences, social networks, technical exchanges, and personal needs. The tools were developed around an initial kernel of a problem, and then modified, evolved, cajoled, and carried from one event and use to the next. <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jesserobbins/etech2008-disastertech-robbins-maron-20080305a\" title=\"ETech2008 DisasterTech Robbins Maron 20080305a\">Jesse &amp; Mikel have espoused</a> this concept before.\r\n<a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CrisisContinuity.png\"><img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CrisisContinuity-tm.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"147\" alt=\"CrisisContinuity.png\"></a>\r\nIt is this continuity through many experiences and efforts that forges the applications and organizations. Following the initial surge, a core component of the community continues to talk about lessons learned, how to expand the tool, integrating with other workflows. An interim solution in one event slowly becomes more integrated as part of a response with new features, languages, and capabilities along each step.\r\nThis is primarily possible through openness: open-source, open-data, open-collaboration. Open Source software means that any solution developed can be reapplied and improved upon as new requirements and capabilities are needed. Open data guarantees that there is a free flow of information before, and during an event that can reach to any and all responders and volunteers as appropriate. Unforeseen needs can be met by modification and analysis of the data. And finally Open Collaboration means that people freely exchange needs, solutions, and ideas that ensure best options are available.\r\nThe continuity is further expressed in the tools and data remaining in the affected areas for citizens and government to utilize. There is less of a vacuum remaining after organizations withdraw as local groups can take ownership of the tools as well as stay connected with the community to build capacity.\r\nCrisisCommons\r\nWhat has been missing is a community that provides support and coordination of these various efforts. New projects will start and be deployed. But how do NGO’s and response communities identify which tools are available, reliable, and meet their operational requirements? How do they work with the volunteer communities to identify needs, provide ideas and specifications and adopt these tools as they are developed, tested, and supported?\r\nA goal of CrisisCommons is to provide this role. Through international communities as well as local and regional organizations and camps that understand relevant risks and responses to provide for pertinent and continued support.\r\nOrganizations such as the World Bank, MapAction and others clearly have identified the potential of working with organizations such as CrisisCommons that can be an interface to the moving surges of volunteers, companies, and tools that they can leverage in reconstruction efforts.\r\nThere is a change in how the public is engaging and supporting in crisis response. They are able to augment capabilities and provide surge support. But it is necessary to recognize that the capability to respond and engage quickly and effectively occurs through continuous evolution. In preparation, prevention, and mitigation of disasters we can apply our tools and knowledge. In reconstruction we can modify and integrate the viable solutions into sustainable operations.\r\nCrisisCongress\r\nThere are still a number of questions that have yet to be answered about this type of model. This week the first international CrisisCongress is convening with individuals from around the world to discuss the models of volunteer crisis response and technology. Through our discussions, shared experiences and problem solving we will have a clearer vision for how to continue the successes we have had and grow the capability for people to respond and help in moments and places of crisis, whether across the globe or in their own community.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/THZ6ZYsstyE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"A little more than a year ago, a small group of volunteers coordinated to host the first CrisisCamp in Washington, DC.

There have been numerous great projects, collaborations, and work that have prevented me from taking the time to blog. As I’ve noted in the past, <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/twitter-means-reading-fewer-blogs/\">Twitter defuses just enough of idea sharing</a> that I don’t readily go to write articles. However, while these micro-messages relieve the immediate pressure of a concept they lack the general feeling of satisfaction that a more expressive and coherent article provides.\r\nIn quick summary of what I’ve been up to – as a means of providing a sort of excuse, preview, and immediate alleviating of the overwhelming feeling that “I haven’t posted in a while, so it’s difficult to start again”:\r\nBesides a <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/namste-from-india/\" title=\"Namste from India :: High Earth Orbit\">two week trip to India</a> with Corrie, I gave a plenary lecture at the Library of Congress on Neogeography and digital preservation of geospatial data that will soon be online, spoke at the UK Socio-Cultural workshop on the use of community and citizen generated geospatial data in crisis response and development work. There is also some hopefully soon news on new countries opening up data.\r\nAt <a href=\"http://fortiusone.com\" title=\"FortiusOne homepage\">FortiusOne</a> we’ve been fortunate to work with many great partners this Spring and Summer in providing open collaborative platforms that we’ll soon be able to share with everyone. In addition, we’ve been heads down building out a host of new features to GeoCommons that will really open the GeoWeb and provide more than just visualization. We also participated in the <a href=\"http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/requests/60\" title=\"OGC OWS-7 Request for Quotation\">OGC testbed</a> that experimented with the sharing and annotation of authoritative and crowd-sourced data, much of the lessons and capabilities that are already exemplar in <a href=\"http://geocommons.com\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoCommons</a>, but we’ll be adding more features to enhance the interoperability.\r\n<a href=\"http://greatergreaterwashington.org/\" title=\"Greater Greater Washington\">DC</a> continues to be an interesting place to live – and I’ve definitely had more exposure to government than I ever expected. The area is surprising in the innovation and connectedness that is definitely worth sharing.\r\nWhile we’re about to launch a number of new capabilities, I’m also able to come up for a bit more air. My aim over the next few months is to dramatically increase my posts. Consider this one as a way to poke through the shroud that will enable more regular posting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/JNXVDE_hpDY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"So far 2010 has been incredible, and hectic.

It’s a great opportunity to look at some of the possible integration of the crowd-sourced data and community tools into more traditional, and analytic, platforms. In CrisisCampDC, volunteers such as Scott Broo did a slope analysis of LIDAR data in analyzing IDP camp placement and potential flood areas. How would GIS experts coordinate with the larger CrisisCommons community to identify and support these types of efforts. What are the other potential uses of LIDAR, remote imaging, surveying, mobile reported data, field analysis and paper map printing. And beyond just maps, we’ll be picking up on the number of <a href=\"http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Projects\" title=\"Projects - CrisisCommons Wiki\">CrisisCommons projects</a> that continue to grow and evolve.

The community and ecosystem of Where2.0 continues to utilize cutting-edge technology to provide consumer and business services and needs. You can locate activities, friends, stores, media and more and have it integrated into mobile lives and online personas.\r\nThese are all great advancements, and are blurring the lines between the online digital data and our interaction with the real world. However it’s vital that we realize the real potential application of these technologies and what our legacy is on the entire world. How can we engage with global citizens, understand their needs and desires, and collaborate on building channels of information and tools that serve our individual and collective goals.\r\n\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/where2-that-matters\" title=\"Where2.0 That Matters\">Where2.0 That Matters</a>\r\n\r\nAlmost two years ago <a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/mapufacture-joins-with-fortiusone/\" title=\"Mapufacture joins with FortiusOne  ::  High Earth Orbit\">I moved</a> from Michigan, with stints in California, to Washington, DC. I moved at an auspicious time in our nation as the highly contentious presidential election approached at the same time concerns on transparent monitoring of democratic elections and process loomed. Social media and streams such as twitter, smartphones, voice technology and visualization provided the components to demonstrate how we can enable citizens to share their experiences, their problems, and for us to openly see problems and victories as they occurred.\r\nThis same concept applies just a well around the world. Open platforms such as Ushahidi have helped bring citizen reporting in elections in India, Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan – each to different outcomes – but still in a way that harbinges a more open and transparent government process.\r\nNow through my experiences with <a href=\"http://crisiscommons.org/\" title=\"Crisis Commons\">CrisisCommons</a>, working with multinational organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations, and the federal and local governments, it’s clear to see how the leading edge of the <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/where2010\" title=\"Where 2.0 Conference 2010 - O'Reilly Conferences, March 30 - April 01, 2010, San Jose, CA\">Where2.0</a> community can have an amazing and unparalleled impact in providing understanding and change in global and local issues: Environment change, food security, humanitarian development, education, and disaster response.\r\nIn looking at the various open government initiatives, the questions arise in looking past the press release to the realized value of sharing data with businesses and citizens. I was struck my the foresight of the <a href=\"http://www.gis.state.ar.us/\">Arkansas AGIO</a> team in the realization of how sharing data as broad and wide as possibly helps mitigate their vulnerability to disaster by enabling responders open access to vital information that would assist in response.\r\nThis concept is apparent in how <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\">OpenStreetMap</a> was successful in Haiti. With the lack of official, government supplied data the best solution was to crowd-source the information from varied sources and rebuild the national data infrastructure, external to the government itself. While it has been unpredictably successful, the value continues to be the open access of the data by any and all organizations, and the eventual adoption by the government itself in rebuilding its capacity. The hope is that the government continues to openly collaborate with the global community in managing and maintaining this data so that the situation doesn’t need to reoccur.\r\nIn summary, the community is making a difference. The tools we develop in <a href=\"http://wherecamp.org\">WhereCamp</a>, IRC, <a href=\"http://osgeo.org\">open-source communities</a>, and from companies are changing the capabilities of crisis response and development. My message is to urge the larger community to continue to think how their solutions can have a more broad impact.\r\nIf your technology can help a consumer find a great $4 latte, that’s good for your business. If it can also help a child find clean water near their village, that’s good for the world.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/highearthorbit/GSef/~4/NgtYM7ibvhA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">","summary":"Last night I spoke at Ignite Where2.0.

Utilizing the increasingly popular GoogleMaps platform they made it clear that people were going to engage in new and comfortable ways with geospatial technology.\r\nI remember being impressed by <a href=\"http://platial.com/\" title=\"Platial.com - Who and What's Nearby\">Platial</a> and the goal of providing a way for anyone to easily annotate places that mattered to them.When I originally pitched the idea of a <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/catalog/neogeography\">“Neogeography” book</a> to O’Reilly it was with the inspiration of Di-Ann’s drive to citizen access to geospatial tools that I considered how people should be able to map their genealogy and share their trips.\r\nAs <a href=\"http://brainoff.com\" title=\"Mikel Maron's Blog\">Mikel</a> and I built <a href=\"http://blog.mapufacture.com/\" title=\"mapufacture blog\">Mapufacture</a>, we partnered with Platial on several projects. Platial had attempted to make a local information aggregator that never really took off, and so we discussed how to utilize the geospatial data aggregation platform in Mapufacture to provide and aggregate content for Platial. I even helped build and test the Platial developer API using the first iterations of AtomPub and OpenSearch, the results of which can now be seen in Mapufacture’s and <a href=\"http://core.geocommons.com/help/Developer_API\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoCommons’ APIs</a>.\r\nIn looking at specifically the GeoWeb landscape, Platial definitely provided a necessary capability of easily allowing people to annotate and share locations. It is the more explicit version of more recent location-sharing tools such as FourSquare, BrightKite, or Latitude that merely ask where you are, not what’s important to you. When Mapufacture was acquired by <a href=\"http://www.fortiusone.com/\" title=\"FortiusOne Visual Intelligence Solutions | Visual Intelligence, Smarter Decisions\">FortiusOne</a>, the combination of the large head of geographic data in <a href=\"http://geocommons.com/\" title=\"GeoCommons\">GeoCommons</a>, combined with the very long-tail of aggregated sensor and streaming information provided for mixing disparate datasources and understanding of context and relevance. Users want to collaborate around all types of data, and share insights, find out relevant information, share this with friends, family, coworkers, and their government.\r\n<a href=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/GeoWeb-Landscape-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/GeoWeb-Landscape-1-tm.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"227\" alt=\"GeoWeb Landscape-1.jpg\"></a>\r\nClearly geographic data is not merely limited to traditional map sources or cartographic outputs. Location is being integrated across all platforms and recognized as a primary component of any data.
