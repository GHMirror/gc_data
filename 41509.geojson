The Geneva-based body has yet to confirm the latest death in Vietnam with laboratory tests.\n\nExperts fear the global death toll could rise sharply if the virus were to mutate and become easily transmissible between humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to kill millions.\n\nLast week WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said global bird flu cases appeared to have stabilized among humans but that several developing nations had not been able to stem its spread among poultry and domesticated birds.\n\n\"The number of human cases of bird flu appears to be stable when compared to the same period last year,\" Hartl said. \"In the northern hemisphere, the number of cases in summer has declined marginally from the winter.\n\n\"Human to human transmission are very rare. We think there have been three cases -- in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.

Hundreds of millions of birds have died or been slaughtered.\n\nThe H5N1 virus remains mainly a virus of birds, but experts fear it could change into a form easily transmitted from person to person and sweep the world, killing millions.\n\nSo far, most human cases can be traced to direct or indirect contact with infected birds.\n\nVietnam\\'s Animal Health Department said on Saturday that fresh bird flu cases had been found among chickens and ducks in two northern provinces and another in the central region this week.
