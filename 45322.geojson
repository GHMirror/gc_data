From the colonial period through the late 1800\\'s, several generations of the Houghton family farmed the area. \n\nThe swimming area is supervised by DCR lifeguards from late June through Labor Day, 7 days a week. The beach has a handicapped accessible ramp which leads to the water. All park visitors must follow the directions of the lifeguard staff at all times.

In part through generous gifts of land, the eastern became part of the park system. The western shores were never acquired and were subdivided into smaller house lots. Today the Mystic Lakes are popular for freshwater swimming at Sandy Beach. Special sailing programs are available at the Tufts University Boathouse. The Upper Mystic Lake is for non-powered boats only.
