Picked at random while waiting for a bus at Sydney Airport, but turned out to be a great choice. Central location, fairly quiet, good facilities and best of all, a roof terrace; ideal for BBQ\\'s and late night drinking. Only left the place as we had pre-booked another hostel for the Xmas/New Year\\'s period.\r\nBy the time I left Sydney this place had closed down. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrx0aw72j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.20923,-33.87011]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cricket","description":"Posted by KeenomanjaroBy being the most naturally gifted country on the planet when it comes to the world of sport, Australia set themselves up for a fall every time they step out onto a field of play. As much as I had great admiration for the Australian cricket side we were watching at the SCG in the VB one-day tri-nation tournament, I couldn\\'t help but want to see unfancied New Zealand put one over them. \r\nHaving no frame of reference with regards cricket grounds, I\\'ll just say that it was huge and had a great atmosphere; until the Aussies lost that is. Mexican waves abounded as did stupid costumes and world class banter.\r\nNon-alcoholic beer and a sunburnt centre parting aside, this was a quality day out, capped off by an impressive New Zealand victory, thanks to some shoddy middle order batting from the Australians.\r\nWe returned many months later, just before leaving the country to watch an Aussie Rules game here. \r\nSpent the first half of the game trying to figure out some rules, and the rest enjoying the sight of blokes kicking the crap out of each other. The game itself was suitably exciting, with Sydney scoring in the last minute to take the lead, only for Adelaide to pip them with the last kick of the match. Maybe this sort of thing happens in every game, but it was exciting enough for us.\r\nStill have no idea with regards the rules though.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwwodw4o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.22453,-33.89122]}},{"properties":{"name":"Darling Harbour","description":"Posted by KeenomanjaroAfter the obligatory Harbour Bridge and Opera House, this was one of the first things I did in Sydney and just kept coming back to it. \r\nRammed with tourist and not adverse to tourist pricing either, but always something happening and always something that you\\'d not spotted before.\r\nSpent a blisteringly hot afternoon there watching Chinese dragonboat racing as part of the Chinese New Years celebrations. On the flip side I managed to get down there just as the entire population of Sydney was leaving following the Australia Day fireworks, which I somehow managed to completely miss.\r\nI\\'m sure this would normally be the sort of place I\\'d see and never want to return to, but there was something about the atmosphere here that made you want to keep coming back. \r\nRubbish pubs mind you. Tourist attraction-wise, the aquarium and Chinese gardens were worth a look. \r\nOh, and there was a great pie shop, much to my delight.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwpsjptm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.20046,-33.8722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Extreme nightclub","description":"Posted by Keenomanjaro<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrx0anx6y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.86489,50.72285]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lytchett Minster School","description":"Posted by Keenomanjaro<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\">Â <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwuxyykq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.05959,50.74102]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Years Eve","description":"Posted by KeenomanjaroLocated virtually under the Harbour Bridge on the North side of the harbour, this was our chosen spot for the New Year\\'s fireworks display.\r\nIt goes without saying that on a night like this Circular Quay and the Rocks area would be rammed, so our plan was to get a sizable picnic together, purchase three four litre boxes of cheap wine and set up shop early on the North side. Amazingly it worked. Having stuffed ourselves with food, we could then enjoy the kids display at about 7pm, followed by vast amounts of wine, poured from boxes into plastic cups, as it should be, until the main display at midnight. The only drawback with regards this loaction was that we couldn\\'t see the firework on the bridge itself, whgich seemed to be an image of Ayers Rock, although this wasn\\'t confirmed until we saw TV replays the next morning. \r\nThe display was unforgettable and we had plenty of room still to sit on the grass and watch it, rather than standing cramped in a crowd, craning our necks.\r\nOne of the cheapest New Years Eve nights out ever, and probably one of the best.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwwbtgq2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.21247,-33.85074]}},{"properties":{"name":"Our House","description":"Posted by KeenomanjaroLanded on our feet when we found a house for rent in Woolloomooloo, a fairly quiet region in between the city centre and Kings Cross. \r\nLocation was an ideal base for us to start job hunting, although this proven to be a false dawn as none of the lads managed to do a single days work between them in the time we stayed there.\r\nHad nice enclosed back yard with small BBQ, and decent sized living room, which meant that we could easily entertain ourselves at home when we couldn\\'t be bothered with the short walk to Kings Cross and it\\'s assorted night-time offerings.\r\nDid have a rat problem though.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrx1dns32"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.21722,-33.87248]}},{"properties":{"name":"Poole Quay","description":"Posted by Keenomanjaro<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwruxaxm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.98531,50.71187]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Chequers - Lytchett Matravers","description":"Posted by Keenomanjaro<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwvr7qh1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.08513,50.75962]}},{"properties":{"name":"Worst hostel ever","description":"Posted by KeenomanjaroMoved here just before Xmas. Only bit of forward planning for the whole trip was to book somewhere to stay over the busy festive period.\r\nPlace was a dump. Shared window-less room with 13 other people yet no air-con in the middle of summer. Bedroom was thus fantastically hot. \r\nHostel staffed by psychopathic drug addict who burst into the room one morning accusing me of breaking into the hotel above and running around their roof terrace. \r\nVery small social area; enough for five or six to sit on each other laps watching choice picks from their poor VHS collection. Kitchen even smaller, enough room for one person to make toast. Well done to the guys who managed to make themselves a Christmas dinner in there.\r\nDid have a cheap and fairly decent bar though, but only if you fancied a quiet drink surrounded by destitutes.\r\nPut up with the place for a fortnight and was relieved to put it mildly when we managed to sort out our own house just after New Year\\'s.\r\nAvoid like the plague.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwq909oy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.20425,-33.88178]}},{"properties":{"name":"Xmas on the beach","description":"Posted by Keenomanjaro<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\">Â <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\">Â I never really fancied the idea of Xmas on the beach, mainly because I thought it wouldn\\'t feel like Xmas and therefore would defeat the whole point of such festivities.\r\nIt probably didn\\'t help that my preparation for the big day consisted of drinking vast amounts of VB in a backpacker bar until the early hours of Xmas Eve. \r\nSo armed only with tickets for a beach party that wasn\\'t on the beach and a hangover which five years later still ranks as one of the worst ever, I attempted an Englishman\\'s idea of an Australian Xmas. Needless to say, it was crap.\r\nAte a chicken burger (couldn\\'t find a turkey burger; couldn\\'t stomach anything else), drank only water and sat on a beach for several hours until a random punter decided to throw up about three metres from where we were sat. \r\nHaving been stung for beach party tickets, it seemed stupid not to make use of them just because the party wasn\\'t actually on the beach. Enjoyed what may well have been the greatest DJ set of all time, but to me just sounded like a series of noises put together to progressively make my head hurt more and more. Sat on the grass, drinking cocktails and wafting away ash from the forest fires which were clearly upwind of us.\r\nStill shouldn\\'t complain. Only had myself to blame and was back home moaning about the cold a year later.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gyrwsalyg7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.27642,-33.89236]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237340","metadata":null,"contact_name":"keenomanjaro","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:keenomanjaro","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237340","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237340,platial:user=keenomanjaro","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44597}
