It is unclear whether this includes supplying components for the weapon. Each BL755 comprises a main dispenser body and 147 submunitions with fragmenting warheads. The refurbished RBL755 is equipped with a radar proximity sensor for deployment from medium and high altitudes. The failure rate of the submunitions is the subject of debate with the MoD reporting a rate of 6%. It has been reported that the MoD has extended the use of BL755 - used in Yugoslavia and Iraq (1991 and 2003) - until 2006.\n\nINSYS has received recent contracts from MBDA and Celerg (a French rocket motor manufacturer) for Aster 15 and Aster 30 missile launchers, and from the Defence Procurement Agency to design, build and test a system demonstrator of a rocket artillery system for the UK Army.

Since then, the company has acquired 17 companies including Litton Industries and Newport News in 2001. In December 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW, the military and automotive group, for .7bn. Northrop sold TRW\\'s automotive business for .73bn and retained the space and advanced technologies businesses. Northrop Grumman has more than 300 locations worldwide and claims to employ people in 25 countries and all 50 US states.2\n\nWhat it makes\n\nNorthrop Grumman professes to be the world\\'s largest shipbuilder.3 It is also one of the three dominant contractors in military space and supplies nearly 60% of the US military\\'s airborne radar systems. 4\n\nWarships: Northrop owns Newport News, the US\\'s sole builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and one of only two companies, along with General Dynamics\\' Electric Boat, capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. It has a contract to build four Aegis guided-missile destroyers, a contract to design the US Navy\\'s DD (X) destroyer, and develops and produces missile launching and handling equipment for submarine and land-based weapons systems.\n\nFire control radar: Northrop Grumman makes fire control radar for fighter air-craft including Lockheed Martin\\'s F-16 as well as BAE Systems\\' Hawk 200 jet. In 2002, it was awarded a 87m contract to provide engineering services and technical support to the F-16\\'s fire-control system over a 23-year period. This covers not only the USAF, but also the F-16s of 16 other air forces. It is providing the radar for the JSF, under a joint venture with Lockheed Martin, and, also with Lockheed, has developed and produced Longbow multi-mode radar and the AGM-114L Hellfire missile for the Apache attack helicopter. 5\n\nB-2 stealth bomber: Northrop is the prime contractor for the B-2 Spirit high-altitude multi-role intercontinental stealth bomber. Each B-2 is reported to have cost .3bn. 6 There are 21 operational B-2s, each of which can carry 18,000kg of nuclear or conventional munitions. They were deployed in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nNuclear missiles and Ballistic Missile Defense: Northrop Grumman provides navigation systems for tactical missiles and nuclear-armed inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). In 1997, it was awarded a 15-year contract to be the ICBM Prime Integration Contractor. The company has involvement in a number of Ballistic Missile Defense projects, particularly since its acquisition of TRW.\n\nVinnell\n\nThe Virginia-based Vinnell Corp, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, \\'is a recognised leader in facilities operation and maintenance, military training, educational and vocational training and logistics support in the [US] and overseas\\'. 7 The company reports that \\'Vinnell has successfully completed projects on [five] continents in over 50 countries for a variety of government and commercial customers\\'. It is, in other words, a private military company - the officially sanctioned and sanitised face of mercenary operations.\n\nProtecting the House of Saud: In 1975, Vinnell received a 7m contract to train the Saudi National Guard, or SANG. This is a force of around 55,000 men that Jane\\'s Defence Weekly has described as \\'a kind of Praetorian Guard for the House of Saud, the royal family\\'s defence of last resort against internal opposition.\\' 8One report has alleged that \\'there is also circumstantial evidence to suggest that at times Vinnell employees in Riyadh want beyond training people to pull the triggers.\\'9In 1998 Vinnell received a follow-on 31m five-year contract for SANG training.\n\nIn November 1995, the SANG headquarters and an adjacent building complex housing Vinnell employees was bombed. This event killed five Americans and wounded 30 more, all Vinnell staff. In mid May 2003, in a series of bombings in Riyadh, at least nine employees of Vinnell were killed.\n\nA new Iraqi army: In late June 2003, Vinnell won a 8m contract to train the nucleus of a new Iraqi Army. Vinnell and its subcontractors began working at various locations on July 1st under this one-year contract. 10 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640os20af3a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13247,51.50835]}},{"properties":{"name":"Northrop Grumman, Burlington House, 118 Burlington Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640os3c7gye"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.24642,51.39891]}},{"properties":{"name":"Northrop Grumman, Peel Centre, Aerodrome Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640orsbnl7l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.24466,51.59504]}},{"properties":{"name":"Qatar","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a>Following the sale of a package of UK arms to Qatar in 1996, BAE paid a £7 million \"commission\" into three Jersey trust funds under the control of Qatar\\'s Foreign Minister.

The Qatari Foreign Minister denied any wrongdoing but agreed to pay Jersey £6 million for \"perceived damage\".

However, there are plenty more examples including Paveway bombs, Javelin anti-tank missiles, Joint Standoff Weapons, Sidewinder and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles and Maverick air-to-ground missiles. The Maverick guided missile has been in service with the US Air Force since 1972 and, according to Raytheon, \\'is the most widely used precision-guided missile in the free world\\'.\n\nSince 1999, both the Tomahawk cruise missile and the AGM-154A Joint Standoff Weapon have been used against Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and, most recently, Iraq. Both of these missiles can be equipped to deploy cluster submunitions.\n\nRadar and targeting: Raytheon also specialises in radar, surveillance and targeting systems. These are in use on most US-produced combat aircraft including the Special Forces AC-130U and AC-130H airborne gunships. One group of such systems is referred to as the \\'Terminator family of targeting systems\\' which is in use in the F-18 Hornet fighter and the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle.\n\nBallistic Missile Defense: Raytheon is one of the big four Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) companies and has extensive involvement in each of the four main segments of the programme (boost, mid-course, terminal and sensors). Its involvement includes production of the Standard Missile-3, being systems integrator for the (Patriot) PAC-3 system and prime contractor for the \\'Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle\\' and both the X-band and Upgraded Early Warning Radars.\n\nExports\n\nRaytheon exports billions of dollars worth of military equipment each year. In 2002 its total exports amounted to .6 billion. Its client list includes Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Singapore, Greece, Taiwan and South Korea. The AIM-120 air-to-air missile alone has been sold to more than 20 countries, including \\'recent controversial offers\\' to Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640os0xfrjt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.154548883438,51.5088092345]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rolls Royce PLC, 65 Buckingham Gate","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/DSC_0023.JPG\">HQ<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640ort9t6ec"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.135526657104,51.4978967844]}},{"properties":{"name":"Romania","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a>In June 2006, with the arrest of a BAE agent, it emerged that the 2003 sale of two ex-Royal navy frigates to Romania by BAE was under investigation by the SFo and  UK Ministry of Defence Police. £7 million in \"secret commissions\" was allegedly paid to clinch the £116 million deal.
