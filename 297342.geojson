Occasionally, this method will result in an estimate of infant mortality rate that is higher than the standard infant mortality rate. This happens when there are no live births under 500 grams but there are live births with unknown birth weight. This method creates an incongruous measure of infant mortality whenever all infant deaths occur in one sex and all births under 500 grams occur in the opposite sex, as occurred in Yukon in 2000. In that case, subtraction of the one female birth under 500 grams from the one male infant death generated a value of 0 for both sexes.","geography":"10","2009":null,"id":"aa6leeuuk38i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"birth weight":null,"characteristics":null,"sex":"Death refers to the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after a live birth has taken place.
