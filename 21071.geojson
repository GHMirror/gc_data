The next report will be issued on or around 13 January 2010.\n\nA powerful earthquake of 7.0 magnitude (USGS) on the Richter Scale affected Haiti on 12 January, at 16.53hrs local time (GMT 21.53hrs). The earthquake happened 17km south-west of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti (18.45N, 72.45W). Initial reports suggest a high number of casualties and widespread damage, with an urgent need for Search and Rescue.\nA United Nations Disaster and Assessment coordination Team (UNDAC) is being mobilized.                               II. Situation Overview\nOn Tuesday 12 January, at approximately 16.53hrs local time, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on the Richter\nScale, and less than 10 km deep, was recorded off the coast of Haiti, and only 17 km from the capital, Port-\nau-Prince. Aftershocks have been felt measuring 5.9 and 5.5 respectively. More aftershocks are expected in\nthe coming hours.\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective and\nprincipled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors.\nThe capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, has been severely affected including critical city infrastructure\ncomponents such as, electricity, water and phone services. Electricity is not available and communications\nare difficult. Initial reports indicate a large number of casualties and widespread damage.\nAt this stage there is very limited access because of debris and other obstacles on the roads. The airport of\nPort-au-Prince is reported to be closed. The Presidential Palace and Government buildings are reported to\nhave been seriously damaged. According to preliminary reports, several UN and well as other national\nbuildings have collapsed or have been damaged. Populations may also be affected in Carrefour and Jacmel. \nUnited Nations agencies, as well as the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society\nare preparing the deployment of teams and humanitarian assistance, notably from their regional hub in\nPanama. USAID/OFDA is sending a response team in addition to 2 USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) heavy\nteams.\nOCHA is mobilizing a United Nations Disaster and Assessment Coordination Team (UNDAC) and is\ndeploying staff from its Regional Office in Panama.\nThere has been no immediate report of damage in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Tsunami alerts were\nlifted, including for Haiti.\nIII. Humanitarian Needs and Response\nEvacuation of injured, medical supplies and expertise are needed. Also clean water may be urgently needed\nvery soon.\nIV. Funding\nAll humanitarian partners including donors and recipient agencies are encouraged to inform FTS of cash and\nin-kind contributions by sending an email to: fts@reliefweb.int.\nV.

This plate boundary is dominated by left-lateral strike slip motion and compression, and accommodates about 20 mm/y slip, with the Caribbean plate moving eastward with respect to the North America plate.\n\nHaiti occupies the western part of the island of Hispaniola, one of the Greater Antilles islands, situated between Puerto Rico and Cuba. At the longitude of the January 12 earthquake, motion between the Caribbean and North American plates is partitioned between two major east-west trending, strike-slip fault systems -- the Septentrional fault system in northern Haiti and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system in southern Haiti.\n\nThe location and focal mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with the event having occurred as left-lateral strike slip faulting on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system. This fault system accommodates about 7 mm/y, nearly half the overall motion between the Caribbean plate and North America plate.\n\nThe Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system has not produced a major earthquake in recent decades. The EPGFZ is the likely source of historical large earthquakes in 1860, 1770, 1761, 1751, 1684, 1673, and 1618, though none of these has been confirmed in the field as associated with this fault.","verified":"NO","longitude":-72.412499,"id":"a62035wxxauq","location":"Chauflard","incident date":"1/12/2010 4:53"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.412499,18.465589]}},{"properties":{"latitude":18.49652,"category":"6b.

There are 53 doctors on site\n&gt; now (Cuban doctors who were carrying on mobile clinics in Haiti prior\n&gt; to the earthquake and young Haitian doctors who recently finished\n&gt; their training in Cuba).  But no medical supplies left.  Both\n&gt; locations have large buildings and huge courtyard.  They are literally\n&gt; five minutes from the airport -- over a road that is passable (Blvd 15\n&gt; Octobre) in Tabarre.   There is also ample room to store supplies, and\n&gt; a disciplined staff to manage them.  Both sites have generators, but\n&gt; are running low on gas.  And are running out of water and food.\n&gt;\n&gt; My former colleagues at the Foundation got through a desperate plea to\n&gt; ask us to help from this end to see if we can get them supplies.
