They paid $ 7,2 Million, less than 2 cents an acre. In the beginning years this great land remote and unaccessible to all but a few hardy settlers remained a dark, frozen mystery to most people. Whaling and salmon fishing brought people and prosperity to Alaska. \r\n\r\nGold was discovered in the 1880s and soon many Gold rushes took place.

Denver, Governor of Kansas Territory, of which eastern Colorado was then a part. Other gold discoveries sparked a mass migration of some 100,000 in 1859-60, leading the federal government to establish Colorado Territory in 1861. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6at67v60fgd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.721679688,38.8910328265]}},{"properties":{"name":"france, nantes","description":"Posted by Danielzspace123<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/eiffel_tower_5_.jpg\">The Eiffel Tower was built for the International Exhibition of Paris of 1889 commemorating the centenary of the French Revolution.
