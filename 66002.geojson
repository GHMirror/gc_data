Fry's, Walmart, and Amazon actually have some stuff cheaper than them. Another reason I don't like Best Buys is cause they beat out Circuit City. IMO, Circuit City always had hella good deals going on. Anyways, this photo is heavily cropped. The store (Best Buy) is at least 30+feet away from where I was. I also wanted to crop out a lot of the cars in the parking lot while still leaving the seagull there. That seagull, btw, has a piece of bread in its mouth. Like all of my pictures, nothing is photoshopped in.

I will pay off all of my debts and then pay cash for everything that I need, and never carry a balance on a credit card again.  I will never again be controlled by debt.  Completed On: July 23, 2010\nI went through a bitter divorce in 1999, inheriting a mountain of debt in the midst of overwhelming heart break.  After the divorce I began racking up debts that just were about surviving for a while, but those led to irresponsible living.  I racked up $65,000 in debt between credit cards, music equipment, LASIK surgery, and just life.  It was a hard life, especially once I couldn’t pay the debts.\nMy financial world came crashing down in 2004… I had no means to pay minimum balances on things and I really didn’t have the money to even eat.  But I started fresh- got a new job that allowed endless over time.  I basically killed myself at that job and then switched over to United Healthcare where I began working my way up- paying off debts as I went along.\nI paid off the most notorious bank loan in May of 2008, and then my last Child Support payment (not included in the total debt) was paid last July.  It’s an awesome feeling to not owe anyone.  I am in school now but United Healthcare is paying for everything with that.  If I buy a car I plan to pay cash for it- I never want to charge anything because it’s a habit I don’t want to get into… ever again!\nThese cards represent most of the cards I had and paid off (or closed).  I keep them to remind me of where I never want to return again!","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/67522976@N00/5741140022/","id":"a623njc2a4b7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.57558,29.558834]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5728540959","title":"Vent Tube Ponies","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/16 23:33:29 -0400","original":"Mon, 16 May 2011 20:33:28 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/16 23:33:28 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/sidewayzphotography/\">ThatsAWrapPhotography</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sidewayzphotography/5728540959/\" title=\"Vent Tube Ponies\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5261/5728540959_f741b4a0a9_m.jpg\" width=\"192\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Vent Tube Ponies\"></a>\n\nOh the things you can find at work\nDay 224/365","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sidewayzphotography/5728540959/","id":"a623nj5wqnhp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.28585,43.604961]}}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"best,buy,electronics,flickr","published":"2014-08-10T19:14:35-04:00","id":66002}
