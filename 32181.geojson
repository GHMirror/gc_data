The Pasture Pig. Also known as a \"bacon pig\" vs a lard pig; longer and leaner. Perfect for small acerage, rated medium in size [still plenty big]. Excellent mothers, gentle dispostion, and they love to graze on pasture. \r\n\r\nGuernsey Cows: A Heritage Breed - listed as a Watch. Wonderful cows - make great family cows and nurse cows. Our first Guernsey cow raised 11 Jersey calves on her first freshening, averaging 4 at a time, for approx 4 months each. We also raise a couple Jersey cows for family milk cows.\r\n\r\nRomanov Sheep: Rare. Russian breed, a pure gene, great for crossing. Known for multiple births - as in 4 or 5 lambs/pregnancy. Easy lambing, no assistance required, great for the small farm. Crossbred daughters make perfect commercial ewes, as they will carry-on the multiple births with an average 2-3 lambs.\r\n\r\nWe milk one to two cows, to raise up our Jersey calves and weaner pigs. After weaning off the bottle or cow, the Jersey calves are given a couple more months of grain to ensure a strong foundation. At approximately 6 months they are put out on pasture. For the next 18 months or so, until approximately 2 years of age, they are entirely grass fed [or hay during winter]. The Jersey meat is a fine grained meat, allowing it to be very lean and very tender at the same time. \r\n\r\nThe sheep and lambs require a little grain, but are not \"fed out\" to fatten them artificially. They are primarily grass fed, and very sweet and mild tasting.\r\n\r\nOn our property, and the property we rent, we use no pesticides. We do buy conventional grains and feeds. We medicate only to save a life. We\\'ve found a worming program is necessary with our limited pasture set-up. \r\n\r\nOur customers rave about our meats. We are constantly gratified by their praises. So while we are not organic, our customers\\' verify time and again, that there is a significant difference in the taste and quality of small scale grass fed animals.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6tph50swulk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.84775,46.43975]}},{"properties":{"name":"Northwest Organic Farm","description":"Posted by Slowfoodswwa17713 NW 61st Ave., Ridgefield, WA, 98642, USAWe are a 7 acre certified organic farm near Portland, Oregon.
