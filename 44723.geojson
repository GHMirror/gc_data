Smoke still hangs heavy. The old guys that seem to be permanently attached to the stools are still there, one of them buys me my regular Budweiser. Of course no decorations have changed. The beer is still cheap and the music loud, the lineup of girls is still not what I would like it to be but when is it ever? All the same old rowdies are hanging out tonight. As I look around I see that not much has changed. It\\'s my first night back and I\\'m not working, so I have no choice but to drink myself into a coma while I recount all of the ridiculous things that have occured in the last ten days that I was away. By the time I get to retelling the Salt Lake City debacle I cant feel my lips and I am slurring my words. About the time that I should be telling teh story of Steven\\'s birthday all I can do is sway to the music with a cigarette hanging between my lips and mumble unintelligible things to myself. Around five thirty we finish the last of the beers and I pass out sitting up on my couch.

His fingers nimble. It is something that he has done so often that he doesn\\'t need to think or really concentrate anymore, like tying your shoes or brushing your teeth. He breaks up the weed and picks out the seeds as he inquires about my classes and work. He fills me in on the recent struggles in his love life as he splits the blunt and empties the guts into the trashcan. \"Shit that Jessica girl? Man she went all psycho on me like two weeks after you left man, we weren\\'t even dating and she starts telling me how she won\\'t cheat on me while she is away, and I was just like do what you want you think that I\\'m not going to enjoy myself. And she got all pissed off, so I just said fuck it and stopped talking to her.\" He sprinkles the ganja into the skin and deftly rolls an almost perfect blunt in the time it takes a normal person to button their fly. \"It\\'s good to see you again even though you are only in town for one night.\" He sparks the blunt and takes the first luxurious hit of the burning dank smoke.Then he passes the blunt.

I can think of a lot of ways to start a conversation with your mom than, what the hell are you wearing a coat for? Even if she is inside in the heat and wearing warm pajamas. What the hell are you wearing a coat for? That is not the question that you ask your mom who along with you Dad your sister and one of her friends has come up to the cabin for the final few days of your trip to celebrate your birthday. You don\\'t ask that even if it is your birthday. You especially don\\'t ask that if your mom just found out that you and your buddies sneaked you 16 year old sister and her 17 year old friend some of your alcohol; and your mom just found you helping your sister throw up in the bathroom. You know why you don\\'t ask that?

But he is a great guy. After calling people all the night before and the day of looking for someone that was willing to pick up three scraggly college guys loaded down with two weeks worth of luggage and a hangover to match; we got a hold of Kuiper. What a lifesaver, he didn\\'t even think about it just said I\\'ll be there. He didn\\'t complain when he had to drive around for an hour because there was no where to park and our plane got in late. He didn\\'t complain when we had him drive us all around Crown Point in search of the elusive Mary Jane(someone that I had personally had contact with only twice in the last nine days)to no avail; then back to my place for resin hits. He didn\\'t complain when we bought his beers later at the bar.

Joe and Wright have really made a great contribution to this trip and we only met them like twenty minutes ago. We Walked into the Royal Wolf Saloon ordered a pitcher of Pabst Blue Ribbon because that was the only beer in the budget, and sat down at the bar. Joe was the one that started the conversation, he was almost to drunk to walk and in one of those everybody is my best friend moods that people are sometimes lucky to fall into. He began to \"enthrall\" us with his stories of all the sweet skiing that he has done, and where he plans on going. He got up to leave asked us if we wanted to smoke This was our third day without smoke so when the offer was put on the table we jumped at the chance like three men who had been in the desert and were offered a drink. We all piled into Steven\\'s Suburban. Ass much as Joe was so gung ho about blazing most of the rest of their weed with strangers, Wright was obviously not as enthusiastic. Then suddenly things change. Jeremy asks the same question of everyone he meets when we get drunk. \"Where you in a frat?\" Wright then gives the anwser that gives Jeremy an immediate erection. \"Yeah I was a Phi Delt.\" That was it we were all best friends. We all went around doing the \"secret\" handshake and then sat and listened as Wright entertained us with his stories of being hazed by Eli Manning. Before we knew it the weed was gone. We said our goodbyes and parted ways. I have to say even though we were only with them about two hours Joe and Wright were the MVPs of the night.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65b6e3p91eu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.11252,43.72466]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sake Bombs","description":"Posted by Klieder\"I hope you two are happy, because that fucking hurt.\" Hilarious. \"Dude the sake didn\\'t make that hurt any less.\" Jeremy and Steven could not stop laughing. But why would they? After all they were hammered, and Lieder was moving. They had spent about an hour the previous night and the better part of the afternoon constructing a ski and snowboard jump on the hill next to Steven\\'s cabin in Alta, Wyoming. Following the day of shoveling and packing and shaping the snow into a jump requiring about twice the skill level that any of them possessed to successfully land it. Earlier in the day during their first run when it was warm and the snow was slow and slushy they had not been able to jump high enough so they built it bigger and waited until it dropped back below freezing that night so they could shoot down their icy launchpad to certain injury. They made a playlist of their favorite heavy metal and gangsta rapmusic then they bought a couple of bottles of sake and a thirty pack of beer. The procedure was simple. Pour a shot of sake, drop it in your beer and chug like your life depends on it. Continue until both beer and sake are finished. Once properly lubed up they proceeded to the launch area. Lieder for some reason had volunteered to go first. He stood at the top of the run looking at it, he then dropped in and made the short but icy trip to the ramp. Upon launch his board went straight up in the air along with his feet which were strapped in at the time. As he was making his descent with his feet above his head Lieder thought to himself \"This is not good.\" Needless to say the rest was not pretty.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65b6dpv37ma"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.03642,43.75399]}},{"properties":{"name":"Viva The Vegas","description":"Posted by KliederThey have to be funny to him. The bartender at the Tequila Bar in the Las Vegas airport. Sure he has seen it all before, this is Vegas baby! People come here to get fucked up let loose and just let it all hang out. People with every color of hair and skin and clothing imaginable have come through this town. He has seen drunker and funnier and dumber and louder and sexier and richer and crazier. On this morning though are two bleary eyed college kids that just stepped off a plane from Houston and are now guzzling the beers and shots of tequila he is putting in front of them like there is a fire in their stomachs they are trying to put out. He laughs as they react in horror when he tells them about his time spent in Utah and the fact that they only serve 3.2% beer and that you have to buy a ten dollar license at each bar to drink liquor. About this time the last member of this outrageous trio shows up and immediatley starts playing catch up as fast as he can. This goes on for about another hour and then it is time for the three to board their plane. The bartender probably thinks to himself I feel bad for whatever stewardess gets stuck with them.(little does he know that following two additional in flight beers one of the two lads from Houston puked all over himself.) Oh well they are gone now.

Up to this point I was getting pretty tired of being offered and then having to turn down offers to hit the crack pipe. I said lets go and we hopped in Steven\\'s Suburban to get some reefer before making the four and a half hour drive to Jackson Hole Wyoming. He said his name was Anthony. He was short wearing a black stocking cap,plain black T-shirt, ridiculously baggy black shorts and black socks and shoes. He was sporting some horribly done probably homemade tattoos, and carrying the filthiest old plastic Wal-Mart bag I had ever seen. I knew we were in for trouble when we had been in the car for less than two minutes and he already had a crack pipe out and started to smoke it. I looked at Jeremy and Steven and they had the same looks of shock and utter disbelief on their faces as I was sure was plastered across my face. Under normal circumstances we would have pulled over and kicked the guy out of the car or at least have made him put his piece away. This however was not normal circumstances. We needed enough ganja to make it nine days in Wyoming and right now this homeless crackhead was out only hope. While in route to the \"buy\" location our \"guide\" requested that we pull into a grocery store so that he could get a coke. We pull in, he goes into the store and returns in less than three minutes with a bottle of Boone\\'s Farm tucked into his oversized shorts. The drive from the store to our final destination takes about four minutes and in that time the little ratfink manages to swill teh entire bottle leaving his mouth bright orange. Now at the location I give him the 0 that we had agreed upon and he disappeared around the corner...and does not return. I had a feeling as soon as he shut the car door that my 0 was gone. Never the less we waited for fifteen minutes, he didn\\'t show. I get out of the car walk to the corner look both ways, of course he is long gone. I walk back to the Suburban and kick over some trash cans in disgust. Stupid trash cans, let that be a lesson.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65b6doup3i2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.83807,40.76598]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20769","metadata":null,"contact_name":"klieder","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:klieder","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20769","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":8,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20769,platial:user=klieder","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44723}
