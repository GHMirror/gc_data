I didn\\'t have a job when I moved to CA, so I sold plasma. Thank god, I found employment conducting research at a methadone clinic. The research was part of an ongoing national study done sponsored Johns Hopkins University. My first day of work I flew to Maryland for training. I didn\\'t know anyone, including my supervisors. I didn\\'t stay in Bakersfield very long, but I loved working with heroin addicts. I learned a lot about myself, people, and the research process. Actually, this is the only job I\\'ve had in which I\\'ve used the research/hard science aspects of my psychology degree.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6owq0af9aqk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.017778,35.373333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Caldwell, Idaho: Where it Begins, Where I Currently Am...

It was Grand. And Big too - just under 14,000 ft. To be honest, I had no business being there. But this was, and is, a remarkable accomplishment and one that I am exceedingly proud of. The photo on the left, is another area of the Tetons that is well worth the hike. Look out for bears. I have seen several bears on multiple trips and in multiple locations within the park, even around Jenny Lake, which is probably considered the most popular area in the park.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6owq03mvsbr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.536194,43.000035]}},{"properties":{"name":"Muffler Man","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\">Rosiedanger</a><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/29868510_726367f815_s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_photo_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6owq08gwzqw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.08718,37.67497]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nevada, Missouri (1993-1994)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\">Rosiedanger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/2/Cottey_College.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/2/Hornet_Spook_Light_2_.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/2/Truman__Outhouse.jpg\">Nevada, MissouriAfter graduating from high school with a class of 26 students, I high-tailed it to Missouri. I am still not sure why. Looking back, this required a considerable amount of balls. I had never been to Missouri. I did not know anyone. I  wanted away from the community I believed was choking me. Additionally, I chose to attend Cottey College. Cottey is a small (but at the time, big to me with 400+ students) ALL-WOMEN\\'S college. I hated it. But the experience was profound, as was the education. I met some fascinating people and made some great friends. It also prompted the beginning of my development as an individual apart from the influence of family and the small town I grew up in. \n\nThe picture of the Hornet Ghost (or Spook) Light represents a trip my roommates and I took to find said light. We ended up in the backwoods of Oklahoma, very lost and very scared - in a fun way. We talked to a man who had few teeth, but claimed to have seen the light. He gave very poor directions. This trip should have taken 2 or 3 hours, however, we returned after 8-10 hours. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6owq0efqrzg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.359055,37.842806]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salt Lake City, Utah (2000-2001)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\">Rosiedanger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/2/SLC_Wasatch_Skyline.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/2/Red_Butte.jpg\">salt lake cityLeft Bakersfield and moved to SLC, a beautiful place. I never felt at home in Salt Lake. I met some interesting people and discovered a counterculture that I had not been aware of before. I shared an apartment in an area that was strewn with homeless men drinking generic Nyquil and sleeping wherever they happened to land. This increased my awareness of the reality of poverty and the plight of the homeless. I still feel extremely grateful for having, and always having had, a home. SLC is really the only \"Big City\" I have lived in, not sure if Bakersfield counts. I worked at a day care for a short time then for a company that did drug testing, i.e. urinalyses. This was FASCINATING. It is amazing what people use to adulterate their samples. IT DOESN\\'T WORK, PEOPLE!!! There is nothing grosser than green or orange piss. Unless it also smells like glutaraldehyde (pumpkin, which I happen to love but cannot eat now without a reminder of pee!) or bleach. \n\nI did hike often at Red Butte Gardens - beautiful and very close to where I was living.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6owq03i4jxq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.890278,40.760833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spearfish, South Dakota (1994-1997; 1999-2000)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://rosiedanger.wordpress.com\">Rosiedanger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/2/PowWow.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.spearfish.com/canyon/dark.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.spearfish.com/canyon/bridal1.jpg\">South DakotaI lived in Spearfish, SD while attending (and eventually graduating from) Black Hills State University.

Spearfish, and South Dakota, instantly felt like home. I miss it there.\nIf you have never been to a Pow Wow, GO. NOW. Pow Wows are cool. I was actually paid to be a security guard at one.
