According to sources, 300 Maoists and Maoist supporters waiving red flags blocked the tracks and stopped the New Delhi-bound train between Jhargram and Sarna stations of the South Eastern Railway. Co-driver K. Govind Rao said he was forced to stop the train by applying the emergency brakes when a group of men, who stood on the track, waved a red flag. As soon as the train stopped, the group asked the passengers as well as the drivers to get down and switch off their mobiles. He, however, added that none of them was manhandled.  Driver K Ananth Rao and his assistant K G Rao claimed that the rebels climbed into the cabin and order them to disembark, they then took away cell phones and walkie-talkies form the drivers and railway guard BB Rao. They reported that some of the rebels started painting slogans demanding the release of Mahato, a rebel leader, on the compartments in red ink. The passengers were told to get off the train and sit on the platform. The rebels reportedly abducted the driver and assistant driver of the train, however, it was later clarified that they were only detained.  After nearly five hours of being held hostages, the passengers were released and the train was secured by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and state police. It was reported that  upon the arrival of the CRPF and state police that there was an exchange of fire between the rebels and the forces in which a police driver took a bullet in the arm. The rebels claimed that two passengers were killed when the police forces fired mortars at them. Police, however, refute the reports claiming there was no exchange of fire and that a civilian driver was injured by firing but there were no injuries to security personnel. Home minister P Chidambaram said the Centre has rushed a relief train to Orissa with doctors and relief supplies. Chidamabaram confirmed the drama ended five hours after the kidnapping. The train was reportedly detained by the Maoists to demand the release of a top rebel leader, Gandhy, who is in police custody after being arrested in New Delhi last month. Other reports suggested that the supporters of the Maoists, the PCPA, had demanded the release of their leader Chhatradhar Mahato. The reports on the Maoist supporters involved are sketchy, in which the Maoist-backed Police Santrash Birodhi Janasadharaner Committee (PSBJC)  and the armed cadres of People's Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) are indicated in the attack. The PCPA claimed responsibility for the attack stating that the train drivers had defied the bandh called to protest against alleged atrocities by security forces on villagers.","targetstatus":"OTHER","event title":"Train Seized By Rebel; 1, 200 Taken Hostage, West Bengal, India.","longitude":87.33333588,"id":"333","total deaths":0,"group":"Communist Party of India (Maoist) / Naxalites","total injuries":0,"state":"West Bengal"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[87.33333588,22.43333244]}},{"properties":{"city":"Gaya","responseinvolve2":"General Information","event type":"Hijacking","latitude":24.78333282,"attempted":"CarriedOut","event id":2970275,"region":"South Asia","total involved":0,"individual":"Vehicle","date":{"end_time":"2009/07/05 00:00:00 -0400","original":"7/4/2009","granularity":"day","time":"2009/07/04 00:00:00 -0400"},"country":"India","event summary":"07/04/2009: On Saturday, in Magra, Gaya, Bihar, India, assailants hijacked three buses belonging to the Maharani Transport Company, kidnapping three bus drivers and three bus conductors.
