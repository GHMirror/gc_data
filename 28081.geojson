They\\'re more likely to match the lampshade I will inevitably be wearing.\" \n~Betsy Dee\n\nSounds like the kind of friend you want to take to your office Christmas party, or rather skip your office Christmas party to go to a burlesque show with instead! Betsy Dee\\'s store inventory selection follows that same kind of party girl theme, with fun clothes in soft, feminine, plush fabrics and a hearty selection of unique artisan jewelry.\n\nThis is the place for petite/small women and women who like to wear their clothing reallyreallllly tight to buy sexy tops to go with favorite jeans (Anoname 9) and incredibly soft skirts to kick around with in those new red boots. I especially dug Momie\\'s skirts (see polka dot skirt photo shown with tank tops to the right), which sport great pockets featuring 50s-looking cocktail stencils and are made from interestingly oddly-matched soft soft soft cotton vintage fabrics. At 8 these skirts are reasonably priced given the feel, workmanship, and look. \n\nMany of the designers Betsy Dee carries are local, with a few from Los Angeles and the midwest, and she hires interns and local designers to work in the store. One of my favourite pieces, which, like Betsy Dee\\'s own \"Bad Pants\" label--a sizzling \"Sharon Stone\" kind of line--looks much better on a human than on the hanger, was a denim skirt with insets (see photo over there on the right hand side somewhere) designed by a student at San Francisco\\'s Art Institute in a student fashion show that Betsy sponsors called \"The Denim Invention.\" Some pieces created in that show are still available in the store, such as a sexy little jean-material corset.\n\nInteresting t-shirts that are lots more fun to wear than the standard plain Gap cotton number start at 5 and saucy little skirts that would be great with your stomper boots are 5-0something. I do wish designers would cover a wider range of sizes to suit the curvier and taller of us!\n\nBe sure to check out the well-made and not-as-pricey-as-you-might-think designer jewelry  in the cases lining the back of the store. Betsy Dee carries a better variety of jewelry than most mainly-clothing kind of stores. You never know where you might find the perfect signature piece for Fall.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ctdzfnzg4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444117,37.770413]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bigwheel Race down SF's Lombard - BYOBW","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/byobw6_slick3_lo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/byobw6_slick1_lo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/byobw_luke_turn3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/byobw_sergei_wipes_out.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> lombard st @ hyde, sf, caEvery Easter Sunday!

Shopping here puts me in mind of a reverse \"Needful Things\" by Steven King: Happily this one offers up needful things that bring only good fortune. \n\nFred Kirkbride and Tim Flint have created a wonderfully cluttered and darling little space for discovering treasures you never even knew you absolutely had to have in your collection. \n\nFor me, a leisurely Sunday in the City includes hooking up with friends for fruity drinkies at Cafe Luna Piena followed by knocking a couple upcoming birthday and wedding gifts off my list at Brand X. Anyone who is into antique jewels and special whimsical delights for the home would be thrilled to receive just about any delicacy Fred and Tim might offer up. \n\nFine antique jewelry, costume jewelry, paintings, art, erotic art, glassware, totchkes, miniatures, smoking memorabilia, a real mish-mash that could take hours to explore must be taken in quickly because you\\'re on sort of a one-horse track and there\\'s always someone shuffling close behind you. If you reallllllly like something, you\\'ll probably have to go \\'round the track a few times to get a good look, so remember which case it was in! \n\nSecret Erotic Cache: If you\\'re over 18, be sure to keep an eye out for blonde Elvis!\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ctdzm8fvv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.434937,37.759784]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carley ov Oakside Cafe","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/IMG_4927.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1195 Oak Street, San Francisco CA\nAdorable barista Carley maykeths ze mean mocha und nose ze joys ov subliminal advertising!

But my favorite items in the store at the moment has got to be those stash belts by Hipsterr SF (modeled by Marie at right), which are like old-west gun holsters of wonderfully crafted leather but instead of gun holsters you get pockets for all of your raver or just-plain-boring-old-daily needs. These are way hipper than the standard fanny-pack, that\\'s for damn sure, and I\\'ll bet no one ever broke up with/refused to go out with/beat up someone for wearing a Hipsterr. \n\nFurry playa coats by Simone Schulz and an interesting selection of jewlery by Gina Pfanz round out the offerings of a bit of each type of gear you might need for an overnight dance party or just a hard day of urban living.\n\nIf you\\'re wondering where the music comes in, Peter founded Ceiba Records in 1996 and produces psytrance, progressive trance, and downtempo ambient music; listen and buy in the back of the store or on the website. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65cte2cuagm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444744,37.770339]}},{"properties":{"name":"Christy Cote ov ze Mariposa Argentine Tango Club und Tango Con*Fusión","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/christy_und_fiends.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 2424 Mariposa Street, San Francisco CAI artroooooooly admire zeez saucy babe fur herr mad dancing skillllz, butt moistly fur herr charm und wit.

He\\'ll make you laugh even while advising you that the leopard print mumu makes your ass look, well, BIG.\n\nI popped in here just for a minute and ended up staying long enough to find a terrificly patterned set of 50s pajamas for 8 (this is a stellar set, I\\'d peg it at 5 or so if it were freshly laundered and pressed and presented in a tonier store) and a  red hoodie with a \"Sexy\" pull tag (in case anyone doesn\\'t notice immediately). \n\nAlley, dressed nattily in Clothes Contact finds (photos at right), advised buying lightweight clothes since Clothes Contact charges by the pound, but if things are extra heavy accommodations might be made to adjust the price. My pal bought a plush mauve velvet curtain to fashion into her reconstructed overalls and paid just 0--a good amount less than such a good piece of cloth might usually bring.

Anytime anyone gets close to his seaside attraction, Warren pokes his head through the round window of his plastic \"box office\" --housed just to the left of the lenslike door, and asks, \"Have you seen the camera obscura?\"\r\nWhat they\\'ll see, if they pay their dollar and open themselves up to Warren\\'s enthusiasm, is sheer magic. They\\'ll also get to know a man who loves what he does. \"Take a moment to let your eyes adjust,\" Warren tells his guests, once they\\'ve walked through the swinging doors into his world. He rests his hands on the white rail surrounding what looks like a satellite dish, pointed toward the sky, dominating the small room. Swimming across that dish is a scene that looks like a painting-- a painting in motion.\r\n\r\nDepending on where the camera obscura\\'s periscope like lens is pointed at the moment, the view on the dish is of the walls of the Cliff House, or of the man-made concrete cliffs across the street, or of the condos lining the Great Highway where Playland at the Beach to be or of the Seal Rocks and the Pacific. As people watch, birds fly across the screen, a surfer rides a wave, the sea lions stretch on the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"The camera takes six minutes to go all the way around, but you can stay as long as you like, \"Warren tells his guests. One man last week stayed six hours.\" At this point, Warren can put on a taped narration and go back into his box office, but more often than not, he stays around, just to watch the reactions and share the discovery. \"What you are seeing is a rotating picture of what\\'s happening outside at this very moment, \" Warren tells his small, rapt audience. \"It works on the principle of the periscope. It reflects eighteen degrees of the view from outside, through an optically flattened, front surface-finished mirror and a series of concave and convex lenses, on to a parabolic or curved screen.\r\n\r\n\"It was the first camera,\" Warren goes on to explain. \"The camera obscura was invented by Leonardo da Vinci in the sixteenth century. His neighbors thought it was the instrument of the devil. They thought he could predict the future, the past and the present. They banned the creation because they believed it was related to the super- natural. That\\'s because, \"Warren continues, in his soft voice, \"people would go in and then go out and see their friends and say, \"I saw you when I was in the camera obscura,\" and people would think they\\'d seen the future because they had no idea about projected image.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Warren, on the other hand, several centuries removed from da Vinci\\'s time, has a lot of ideas about the projected image and the camera obscura. There\\'s very little he can\\'t tell you about this rare device -- how Isaac Newton wrote about it, or Copernicus charted the stars with it, or Renaissance artists painted with it.\r\n\r\n\"I\\'ve been an artist all my life,\" he says, \"and vision and light and shadow are wondrous things to me. Inside you become entrenched, especially people into the visual arts or visual optics and light.\r\n\r\n\"The vision of your eye opens up in there,\" Warren says. \"You see things differently. Your optic nerve is being affected in a different way. It stimulates the chemical makeup and your emotions. It moves me to tears.\" As the camera swings around to capture the view across the street from the Cliff House, Warren tells his viewers, \"This is the old Playland at the Beach. If you are a registered voter, you can sign a petition as you go out to put something there other than more condominiums.\"\r\n\r\nThere\\'s a reason that the former site of Playland holds a special place in Warren\\'s heart. That\\'s where he first saw the camera obscura, when he was sixteen years old. As a young man, Warren had show business in his bones; he ran away with the carnival, he learned how to eat fire.\r\n\r\nThen Warren grew up. worked on his career as a salesman, and lost touch with his beloved camera. When things began to fall apart for him, he found it again.\r\n\r\n\"I ended up separated from my family,\" he says. \"My wife divorced me. I had five kids, and I went into a deep depression. How can you sell anything at that point?\r\n\r\nHe took up some of his old interests. He signed up for the docent\\'s course at the Exploratorium and began doing research on Playland at the Beach, Just as it was about to be torn down. He met Gene Turtle, one of the two men who had built the camera. As youngsters, Turtle and Floyd Jennings had discovered Leonardo\\'s plans by accident, thumbing through the Encyclopaedia Britannica for a science project. They showed their completed model to George Whitney, who owned the Cliff House and Playland.\r\n\r\nWhitney set up the camera at the Cliff House, but for the first few years it didn\\'t do well because no one knew what it was. Then Whitney got the idea to make it look like a giant camera. Though located at the Cliff House, the camera obscura was a Playland attraction until they tore the place down in 1972. Early in his career, photographer Ansel Adams hung around the camera so much that they quit charging him.\r\n\r\nWarren ran into Gene Turtle in the 1970\\'s and ended up doing a fire-eating demonstration at Turtle\\'s wife\\'s birthday party. In 1978, David Warren was perched on a ladder at the Balboa Theater, painting a mural on the side -it\\'s still there, with Marilyn Monroe as centerpiece, but that\\'s another story -- when Turtle approached him and asked whether he\\'d like to take over the operation of the camera obscura.\r\n\r\n\"I told him I\\'d do it as soon as I got down from the ladder,\" Warren recalls, \"and I\\'ve been doing it ever since.\"\r\n\r\nWarren proceeded to spend years trying to figure out how to get people in to see what the camera had to offer. \"It\\'s a wonderful thing,\" he says. \"You think you should be able to tell people what it is, But it\\'s a paradox. As a salesman, I knew that people would like to know about it, but I found out that you couldn\\'t tell them about it.\"\r\n\r\nHe finally hit upon a solution; tell them what it does, not what it is. Slowly, Warren has learned the tricks of wooing them in, has discovered where the magic line lies between those who come in and those who wander off. A few years ago, he added a pair of huge brass arrows, pointing to the entrance. \"Before, people would just walk by and start looking at the ocean,\" he says. \"Now, these get their attention.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the people come inside, Warren starts spilling his enthusiasm, as the camera obscura chugs quietly around on its motorized axis, panning the surf and the sea lions and the sinking sun. At one point, Warren says, there were three such cameras in San Francisco alone. Now, there are only a handful left in the world. Dave Warren can tell you where each one is and who if running it. That\\'s one of his projects -- forming an organization of all the camera obscura operators in the world, so they can share information.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun sinks low enough in the sky at the end of the day, the sun itself is captured on the rim of Warren\\'s satellitedish screen, a glowing ball of concentrated light. At that point, Warren will hold up a flat, white board, moving it into the field of projection so that he can show people the sunstorms around the edge of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"We always look for the sunspots,\" he says. \"It\\'s part of our show. We turn off the narration tape and do the sunset show in person. We see the green flash in here about twice a month. It\\'s caused by the spectrum of light being split by the atmosphere. The various colors of light are separated. When green comes along, it flashes, like the northern lights, just as the last rays of light leave.\" Warren can\\'t help himself; his voice fills with awe. \"It lasts only a tenth of a second, but it\\'s very beautiful. Liquid jade. When Jules Verne was writing, he said if there is a green in heaven, it\\'s surely this green.\"\r\n\r\nAs people leave, Warren nearly always seems to find some excuse to give them a free pass for another visit. (\"Next time, come back while it\\'s still light, so you can see the sea lions\" or \"Come back and bring a friend.\")\r\n\r\nThe camera never fails to surprise him. \"The most unusual thing happened just the other day,\" says Warren. \"We were watching a sunset, and all of a sudden there was a thud. The screen got black. I thought for sure a bird had hit the camera, Later, when I went up to close the hatch, I reached in, and there was a fish. A pelican probably dropped it,\" he says. \"He sure had good aim.\"\r\n\r\nBut even on more humdrum days, the object of his livelihood and his affections totally entrances David Warren. Someday, he\\'d like to create a mobile camera, on that he could haul up to Twin Peaks. \"Now that would be something,\" he says. Meanwhile, if you venture down the stairs that lead to the terrace below the Cliff House, you\\'ll find him, polishing the brass arrows or leaning out through the box office, trying to coax people over that invisible line. When someone gets within earshot, Warren is there, speaking softly. \"Have you seen the camera obscura?\"\r\n\r\n On a side note, Dave was the first “fire performer” and individual to light the burning man in the black rock desert.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65cte1ekwdc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.514215,37.778262]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delirious Shoes","description":"Posted by Fritz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/store.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 317 Connecticut St, San Francisco, CAThis pretty little Potrero shop carries unique designer shoes, handbags, and accessories.

Every time I\\'ve visited, there\\'s an affordable must-have I just can\\'t do without, last time it was a couple vintage Hamilton printer\\'s trays for only 0 each (I\\'ve seen pieces of much lesser interest and quality go for 0 and up). \n\nRestoration hardware for your Victorian lair can be found here at decent prices, and I bet if you peek in from time to time, you\\'ll eventually find exactly the right drawer handle to match the others on your rustic Mexican cabinet.\n\nRoy was working on sorting movie stills and other memorabilia during my visit and we discussed the ever-changing and broad selection of picture frames and collectible boxes available. Before you buy that 2006 0 cheap-o plastic frame at Walgreen\\'s, get yourself to Four Corners and for the same price see what a quality old frame can do for that sad K-Mart photographer\\'s photo of Cousin It and family that you\\'re morally obligated to display. \n\nMy favorite finds this visit were hand-painted baby cribs at only 5, a great hall desk for 0 (the stuff outside on the sidewalk is always interesting, useful, and priced to move), a Sawyer\\'s View Master complete with reels of Canadian and American tourist attractions at only  each. \n\nI enjoy browsing in the little backroom with the angora sweaters and tchotchkes first and then moving along slowly, taking in each display. I usually spend a little extra time in the vintage jewel cases up front at the end of my visit and I always try to remember to scout for old buttons to use in jewelry or gift projects. I guess I just wasn\\'t feeling like myself this visit because I passed on a  vintage button bracelet with loads of cute buttons sewn onto a strip of fabric like the old Victorian friend bracelets.

Later, a follow-up track \"Cheap Date\" was released on Teen Rebel Records.

Perhaps it’s the smelling, tasting and living with perfection that has influenced her cooking today. Or, perhaps it was training at Chez Panisse, or cooking in France, Italy or Thailand. But, most likely, her signature style reflects her own desire for perfection. She believes in purity of the food. French food is French Food, not French mixed with Italian or Thai. She’s said to make the perfect roasted chicken. After graduating from Stanford with an art degree, Rodgers went straight to work at Chez Panisse, cooked and traveled around the world, then in 1987 became a partner in Zuni Café. Her style is American cooking with deep flavors—a blend of haute cuisine and homey. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65cte0canrm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.420032,37.774567]}},{"properties":{"name":"Karizma: Beads, Crystals, &amp; Estate Jewelry","description":"Posted by Wendolyne<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_313.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_305.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_320.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_314.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_317.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_306.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_308.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_307.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_315.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_323.jpg\">213 Church Street, San Francisco CA \n\nKarizma\\'s proprietress, Maopei, has served all of my jewelry repair and design needs for the whole ten years her store has been in the Castro. If I had  for every bead she\\'s strung for me...well, I\\'d spend it all on another necklace! \n\nThis is the place to get your watch battery changed, your rings sized, and Granny\\'s engagement ring turned into a breastplate. Custom designs are available for any type of item including wedding rings or bridal party gifts and vintage jewelry repair jobs are welcomed. \n\nIf you\\'re a jewelry or clothing designer, Maopei has the connections to help with manufacturing and she will also help with design. She\\'s designed for the Nature Company and assists local designers in selecting beads and findings. This is a great place for creating your own masterpiece jewelry; even Saks Fifth Avenue designers purchase jewelry components here.  \n\nI was fascinated by Herkimer diamond crystals during my recent visit; Karizma\\'s ever-changing inventory always holds wonderful surprises and Maopei is always willing to help with a design and will string you up on the spot if she\\'s not too busy. During my recent visit she helped me bring my most recent fantasy choker to reality and over the years many of my signature pieces were built with Maopei\\'s assistance.\n\nHere you will discover crystals and carved gemstones for whatever ails you and for whatever doesn\\'t ail you. Many different shapes and sizes are available if you know what I mean (please refer to photos at right).\n\nPlaying with the revolving jewelry display case, the kind where you push the electric button and the trays go \\'round and round, reminds me of mooning over Troutman\\'s Drugstore jewelry case offerings back in my hometown. I would *love* to have one of those babies in my living room someday! Maopei has this one chock full of charms, talismans, and other magical-looking items which could amuse and bewilder even the most peculiar shoppers for hours.\n\nAs if all that isn\\'t enough to satisfy, Maopei also offers an impressive collection of stonework fetishes, fine vintage and estate jewelry, sterling and gold rings, and loose colored stones. Tibetan art and Japanese woodblocks hang throughout the store waiting for you to discover and purchase them while gentle fountains murmur softly that rose quartz would look great with your complexion. \n\nWile away an afternoon at Karizma soon!\n______________________\nTuesday-Sunday 12-7pm\nMonday 1-7pm\nkarizma1@att.net\n415.861.4515<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ctdwt2z4v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.428953,37.767171]}},{"properties":{"name":"Karla ov Cafe La Taza","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/platialmission2006_045.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/platialmission2006_046.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 470 Post Street, San Francisco CA 94102\nZe pulled pork panini wif chipotle mayonnaise eez ze way tou goose.

This time I was smitten with the dazzling array of sparkly brooches and couldn\\'t stop eyeing the impressive cotton skirt selection. Labels you\\'ll bump into here, many of them local, include Citron, CP Shades, Weston Wear, Michael Stars, and Haley Bob.\n\nMaybe it\\'s time to purge: Mary\\'s offers a 50/50 consignment deal: you leave items for 50 days, you split the selling price 50/50. Consignment drop-in hours are 12:15-3:30pm Sunday-Friday.  \n\nYou\\'ll also find new goods here.

What a fun collection! From the sassy green frock featured in the center of the store (photo at right) to autumn-hued trousers and delicately designed tanks (also shown at right),and bouncing over to the bouyant wine bottle cork halter top, Jennifer has a delightful way of redefining everyday fashion sense. \n\nMy visit found Jennifer busily at work creating a surplice wrap sweater dress. If you catch her at a slow time, she\\'ll tailor her designs for you on the spot! \n\nPorcelynne opened in February of 2006 and Jennifer, who attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and gave up the business for a couple years before committing to her design work, has recently left her day job to focus on her creations full-time. \n\nIf you are in the mood for a wardrobe update and want to support a local designer while looking different-than-most, here\\'s your place. Porcelynne also features the work of many local designers including Amy M. Cool\\'s highly touchable recycled fabric handbags and jewelry by 19 Moons and Tessa Poppe. I\\'m going to have to go back for the earrings created with Lite-Brites (photo at right).\n\nThe most intriguing of Porcelynne\\'s offerings is the \"Panty-A-Month\" club. You\\'ll get a new pair of stinkies designed by Jennifer every month--imagine how fun it could be to get this monthly offering from a lover in the subsequent months after breaking up--the turmoil the poor chump would go through knowing that you\\'ll be wearing the panties he bought you--he bought YOU--with your new lover. Oh, the possibilities!\n\nArt work in the gallery rotates; the current show features work created on heat-sensitive fax paper with a soldering iron (shown at right).

Sometimes your favorite look just can\\'t be found in a certain kind of pattern or color or size  and you\\'ve gotta do a little \"cheat.\" Can you guess which of the menswear coats in the photo showing two of them side-by-side in the column over there on the right is the real vintage and which is the new, vintage-inspired piece? \r\n\r\nVendima carries Classic Hardware jewelry, which looks and feels like old Bakelite (see photo at right), shoes, coats, dresses, skirts and menswear that are reminiscient of 40s and 50s styles. Some of the new retro offerings include designs by local peeps Brown Sound, Sailor Jerry (did you know he was a real tattoo artist in the 30s and 40s? Yep he was, and you can get stationery here with his tattoo art as well as menswear sort of bowling shirts), Lucky 13, Rock Steady, and beau bois. \r\n\r\nGraciela Ronconi moved to this primo spot (right next to Peasant Pies near the MUNI 24 bus line) and changed the store name to Vendima (which means \"vintage\" in Portugese) after 11 years at \"Guys and Dolls\" in a lesser-traveled Noe Valley location. She buys clothes from the public--you can call to set up an appointment to sell your duds--and from trade shows and wholesalers who scout and buy all over the country. \r\n\r\nWinona Ryder shops here and scouts from Louis Vuitton, Burberry, and Ralph Lauren regularly check out the offerings for inspiration. I was digging the partytime Jackie O. looking metallic-threaded tweedish dresses with matching coats and if I didn\\'t already have a couple sets from Aunt Esther I would have indulged.  \r\n\r\nIn the far back of the store you can find gifts and the ever-popular sales rack; a sweet selection of vintage plastic baby clothes hangers were going for .50 each and some lovely dresses were marked way down (see photos at right).\r\n\r\nGraciela is a gracious gal with a real vintage flair; let her style your vintage look. \r\n_______________\r\nMonday-Friday 11-7pm; Saturday/Sunday 11-6pm\r\nDon\\'t miss the end-of-season sales!\r\n(415) 285-7174 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65cteaqkyd4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.434229,37.751321]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vicki ov Vicki's Street Shop Boutique","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/platialjuly152006_021.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 603 Haight Street, San Francisco CA\nVicki eez ze eentaresting straight-talkin\\' hottie shopkeeper hoo donut mince weirds.

By the 1880s, it was  a fashionable residential district, and in 1903, the towering monument was added, topped by the bronze goddess Victory, modeled after Alma de Bretteville Spreckels, known for her enormous influence in the San Francisco art community.\"\n\nAnother <a href=\"http://www.unionsquareshop.com/History.html\">site\\'s</a> description, after describing Alma\\'s successful modeling career:\n\"With money to spend on stylish attire, and a growing local notoriety from her modeling ventures, Alma blossomed into a proper belle of San Francisco and attracted the affection of miner Charlie Anderson, whom she later successfully sued for \"personal defloweration\" in a breach of promise suit that made newspaper headlines. Local novelty became self-assured celebrity as Alma secured the position of model for sculptor Robert Aitken. His creation, a monument honoring naval hero Admiral Dewey and the recently assassinated president William McKinley, would feature the buxom temptress as a triumphant bronze libertine atop a granite pedestal, her right arm outstretched, holding the laurel wreath of peace towards the horizon, her left arm, raised above her head, valiantly pointing a trident to the heavens.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ctecc6vy9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40845,37.78833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yo, Four Eyes!","description":"Posted by Wendolyne<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_281_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_283_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_280_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/wendyangel.jpg\">1463 Haight Street, San Francisco CASomebody like me who\\'s been wearing glasses since the age of four doesn\\'t fool around when it comes to face jewelry. From my modern titanium (half the weight and twice the strength of steel!) frameless specs to my pointy vintage sparklers, I trust HyperOptics manager Chris Trethewey as my partner in vision. He\\'s been a great help in choosing  suitable frames over the years and he\\'s got a good eye (heh heh!) for style. \n\nThese guys aren\\'t afraid to put new lenses in my latest vintage cat-eye frame finds (SF Costume Party and Decades of Fashion are good hunting grounds) and they cheerfully replace screws and make adjustments when I stop in with the glasses I stepped on because I couldn\\'t see \\'em there without my glasses on (the floor is NEVER a good place to leave your glasses!).\n\nDuring this visit, which was for a quickie wing repair on the Queen Mother of all glasses--shiny silver metal engraved cat-eyes--Chris beguiled me with 49 retro-inspired Swarovski crystal Lafont frames (shown at right). These delectable frames feature a stunning row of embedded crystals lining the top rim of the glasses rather than the front so that when you\\'re looking down the crystals sparkle for the delight of your admirers. The price of these frames, combined with the ultra-lightweight, anti-reflective, thinnest possible lenses I prefer may someday end up costing me a cool grand. That Chris!\n\nFrankly though, a good optometrist is as important as a good facialist. If you\\'re a glasshead like me and don\\'t yet have a great team of eye people helping with your vision needs, I heartily recommend Dr. William Chantaduly and my friends at HyperOptics. They\\'re aces at navigating insurance quagmires, possess a broad knowledge of the latest frames and options in lenses, and, perhaps most importantly, they stock an ample and eclectic variety of frames.  \n\nCustomer service pros that they are, HyperOptics  can usually accommodate walk-ins or schedule same-day appointments. More information on  selection and services is available on their website or you can call 415-626-8686. Open Monday through Friday from 11:00am - 7:00pm\n\n\n\n...and HEY!
