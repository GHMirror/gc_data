It used to be fenced off, rarely visited by anybody. Then it became a homeless encampment. Now, the mounds of dirt, old rebar and chunks of concrete are overgrown with fennel and pampas grass, forming a haven for birds and lizards, a playground for unleashed dogs and an outdoor gallery for sculptors. The Bay Trail runs out to the end. Rough side trails lead to twisted found-object metal sculptures, a crazy little plaster house with a circular staircase, and cartoon-style paintings of uncertain theme, often favoring devils, fast-looking cars and flaming urban wreckage.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62j46g6ufap"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.325296,37.889486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bunker at Battery 129, below Hawk Hill.","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/marin.jpg\">Site of many Cacophony \"obscure\" walking tours…\r\n\r\n(Above &amp; below)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Each of these military strongholds were meant to serve a different purpose.

These Great Monuments are rhapsodized as the embodiment of American hopes and dreams, folly and failure, art and commerce, materialism and spiritualism. Professional authors and screenwriters know a pre-baked, easy-to-get symbol when they see it. Who are we to buck the trend? \r\n\r\n The Cadillac Ranch, located along the tatters of historic Route 66, was built in 1974, brainchild of Stanley Marsh 3, the helium millionaire who owns the dusty wheat field where it stands. Marsh and The Ant Farm, a San Francisco art collective, assembled used Cadillacs representing the \"Golden Age\" of American Automobiles (1949 through 1963). The ten graffiti-covered cars are half-buried, nose-down, facing west \"at the same angle as the Cheops\\' pyramids.\" \r\n\r\n In 1997, development creep forced Marsh to move the entire assemblage about two miles further west. The line of cars is far enough out in a field to allow for suitably bleak photography. The distance from any authority also encourages ever-mutating layers of painted graffiti, which Marsh doesn\\'t seem to mind. \r\n\r\nVisitors are encouraged 24/7 -- just don\\'t steal any of Stanley\\'s colorful signs. The 62-year old Marsh has had a few interesting run-ins with the law over his brand of enforcement. In 1994, he was accused of threatening an 18-year old with a hammer and penning him inside a chicken coop. He\\'s been sued by a family claiming Marsh tricks teens into working for him after catching them red-handed with one of his signs. \r\n\r\nSounds like Marsh is just adding an unexpected thrill around a ranch visit, but then we didn\\'t try to steal a sign. Other bits of Marsh art can be found in the vicinity. There is a pair of legs between Amarillo and Canyon, Texas. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62j46kd26bf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-101.987076,35.187243]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dooby Lane","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/7_doobie.jpg\">1 Guru Road, Gerlach, Nev.Dooby Lane or Guru Road is located on the edge of the Black Rock Desert just outside of Gerlach, Nev.

Dooby Lane is his legacy, a quirky diary made of words carved on stones and sculptures made of desert detritus chronicling life in Gerlach and the Black Rock Desert.

Elm St, Fort Bragg Ca.Glass Beach is one of the most unique beaches in the world, not because nature created it that way, but because time and the pounding surf have corrected one of man\\'s mistakes.\r\nBeginning in 1949, the area around Glass Beach became a public dump. It is hard to believe these days, but back then people dumped all kinds of refuse straight into the ocean, including old cars, and their household garbage, which of course included lots of glass. By the early sixties, some attempts were made to control what was dumped, and dumping of any toxic items was banned. Finally in 1967, the North Coast Water Quality Board realized what a mistake it was and plans were begun for a new dump away from the ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, over 30 years later, Mother Nature has reclaimed this beach. Years of pounding wave action have deposited tons of polished glass onto the beach. You\\'ll still see the occasional reminder of it earlier life, such as a rusted spark plug, but for the most part what you\\'ll see is millions of pieces of glass sparkling in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn addition to searching for and collecting glass, Glass Beach has a very interesting array of tide pools to explore. Crabs, mollusks, and many aquatic plants make their homes in these ever changing environments. It is very easy to spend your whole day poking aound the tide pools and watching the busy little worlds that go on inside each one.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62j46gae2or"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.813257,39.451968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ile de Batz - Embarcadere a maree haute","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.roscoff-quotidien.eu\" href=\"http://www.roscoff-quotidien.eu\">Piotr</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/iledebatz_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/batz_etoile_filante.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/roscoff_batz_3_.jpg\">Ile de Batz - Embarcadère - Marée haute\n\n\n\nAttention, selon le niveau de la maree, l\\'embarquement se fait soit sur le quai à maree haute, soit au bout de l estacade a maree basse ( longueur de l estacade environ 500 metres ).

Anything a visitor may seek, San Francisco can provide. Echoes of fun and amusement ring throughout the city from the cable cars atop Nob Hill to the sea lions barking at the wharf. \r\n\r\nTurning back the clock to the Depression, we find San Francisco bubbling as a haven of fun even then. \r\n\r\nThe place to go was a now-vanished amusement park, Playland-at-the-Beach. During the Depression and World War II, Playland thrived. Adults and children, families and couples on dates, sailors from all over the world went to Playland to ride bumper cars and roller coasters and explore the thrills of the Funhouse. For many San Franciscans, Playland was and still is their childhood, 33 years after its demolition. \r\n\r\nPlayland was located at Ocean Beach, just north of Golden Gate Park, below the point where the land rises to Sutro Heights. The attractions in this corner of the city had the added novelty of being where Western civilization meets the Pacific Ocean -- in a way, at the end of the world. \r\n\r\nFrom the mural-bedecked Beach Chalet at the western end of the park to Playland to the Cliff House and Sutro Baths, the recreational options lined up in a long row. Much of this ended up as part of the pleasure empire of the man called the Barnum of the Golden Gate, George Whitney. \r\n\r\nA little amusement area named Ocean Beach Pavilion had existed since 1884. In 1912, Arthur Looff and his partner, John Friedle, built Looff\\'s Hippodrome, housing a grand carousel built by Looff\\'s father. In 1922, the two added the Big Dipper roller coaster and the Chutes-at-the-Beach water ride. Whitney and his brother Leo came to town and opened a photofinishing concession booth in a smaller version of Playland. \r\n\r\nIn 1926, Whitney became general manager, and the park became Whitney\\'s Playland-at-the-Beach. He bought out shaky concessionaires during the Depression. By 1942, he owned everything from Sutro Baths to Fulton Street. \r\n\r\nWhitney\\'s Playland grew to more than three blocks of amusements next to the Great Highway. It included Topsy\\'s Roost Restaurant, which later became Skateland; a midway of games and vendors; a diving bell; and, of course, the Funhouse with long wooden slides, a human turntable that spun and threw people off if they didn\\'t hang on, distorting mirrors and air jets that blew women\\'s skirts up. \r\n\r\nPlayland was also the birthplace of the It\\'s-It, Whitney\\'s invention of ice cream sandwiched by two oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate. \r\n\r\nOnly the newly remodeled and now far more upscale Cliff House and Beach Chalet still stand. A condominium development erased any trace of Playland. \r\n\r\nBlue-collar times \r\n\r\nAnyone who remembers Playland is wistful, or maybe just nostalgic, for the gritty, blue-collar San Francisco. \"It wasn\\'t just toys for the rich. It was toys for everyone,\" said Dan Fontes, a muralist working in El Cerrito on a large rendering of Playland and the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nSan Francisco has changed. The blue-collar neighborhoods are mostly gone, and amusement is often more solitary than when the Playland fun house rang with screams and laughter. Still, Playland has not been lost. Anyone can find it. Its fragments are scattered all over the city. \r\n\r\nPlayland is best remembered by a laugh, the one that belonged to a huge mechanical woman who towered above the entry to the Funhouse from the 1940s until it closed in 1972 and she was auctioned off. \r\n\r\nHer name was Laughing Sal. \r\n\r\nAnyone walking down Playland\\'s Midway -- even nearby neighbors -- heard Sal\\'s bellowing laugh. She had devilish curly red hair and huge freckles all over her fat, terrifying visage. In the middle of it all was a gap-toothed smile that provided nightmare material for countless children. This was creepy, the same way a ventriloquist\\'s dummy is. \r\n\r\n\"She would stand there laughing and laughing, and you would stand there laughing and laughing, and you didn\\'t know why,\" said Sharon Jessup, a San Francisco native who grew up going to Playland. Sal\\'s continuous laugh was a drunken yelping guffaw, an evil cackle, the uninhibited outburst of someone going out of her mind. With arms extended, she heaved back and forth with a bit of a bobbing motion in her huge glass box. \r\n\r\nSal was constructed by the Old King Cole papier-mache company under commission to the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., maker of amusement park furnishings. Old King Cole started with a mechanical laughing department store Santa Claus. They fitted the Santa with a woman\\'s legs, breasts that jiggled on the end of springs and custom-made heads. With the addition of a 78 rpm recording of the most memorable laugh in the world, Laughing Sal was born. \r\n\r\nBy the 1960s, Playland was run down and a little seedy. Some say it started downhill when Whitney tore down the Big Dipper roller coaster in the late 1950s. Sutro Baths burned during its demolition in 1966, and Whitney stopped operating Playland in 1968. \r\n\r\nThe park took on a roving carnival feel, said Marvin Gold, who grew up nearby, going to sleep every night to the sound of Sal\\'s cackle. In 1972, Playland was put up for sale. When it closed on Sept. 4, 1972, Herb Caen wrote a column called, \"We\\'ll Never Go There Anymore.\" He reminisced over It\\'s-Its, Bull Pup enchiladas, a 40-cent corn dog and a ride on the carousel. \r\n\r\nToday, Playland is covered with housing. A Safeway stands on the site of the old diving bell. Gold said he remembers when workers came to smash the concrete foundation and heard a clang. They found the concrete lined with a steel tank, filled it in and built on top of it. \r\n\r\n\"One hundred years from now when they tear Safeway down, they\\'re going to find an old steel tank sitting there and have no idea what it was,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, and those slides, those beautiful wooden slides,\" he said of the long hardwood slides in the Funhouse. \"When I saw them cutting those slides into pieces ... I nearly cried. \r\n\r\n\"Playland was our second home.\" \r\n\r\nFor the next 30 years after Playland closed, people didn\\'t have to look far to find Laughing Sal. Although the main Funhouse Sal went to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk for 0,000, Playland\\'s back-up Sal found a home in the basement of the Cliff House, along with the penny arcade machines. They all were put into the Musee Mecanique, a collection that Ed Zelinsky he obtained from George Whitney. \r\n\r\nAll of the machines are still working, offering love tests, telling fortunes and showing the first silent films. Video games were added to a small arcade at the back -- early games like Pac Man and eventually the 3-D driving and shooting simulators we see now. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, the Musee was imperiled when the Cliff House was renovated. San Franciscans came to the rescue with a petition carrying more than 25,000 signatures. They were outraged that the National Park Service, which owns the Cliff House, hadn\\'t tried to find the historical Musee a new home. \r\n\r\nThanks to the public outcry, a home was found at Pier 45, where a row of crab stands leads to a building painted with a giant version of Laughing Sal\\'s face. Her missing tooth is the entry to Amusing America, which chronicles San Francisco\\'s place in the country\\'s cultural history of amusement parks. \r\n\r\nPlayland, Sutro Baths and the 1939 World\\'s Fair are all featured in interactive and informative displays, with the Musee Mecanique collection in the back. \r\n\r\nAnd at the door, as in her two previous homes, Sal is the greeter and gatekeeper who still bursts into laughter for a quarter. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at her luck, having survived the urban development that has put her into a museum version of a city that no longer exists. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at what amusement in San Francisco has become around her: a Fisherman\\'s Wharf that has become a commercial tourist center with many of the same type of attractions as Playland. \r\n\r\nDan Fontes, the muralist and a good source of history on Sutro Baths and Playland, says that when Playland was alive, \"Fisherman\\'s Wharf was a fisherman\\'s wharf, with fishermen.\" \r\n\r\nNow, it is the Playland of today, the city\\'s waterfront amusement center, even if it is there mostly for tourists. Playland\\'s remains are scattered elsewhere around the city, too. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s-It snacks are found in many grocery stores. \r\n\r\nCarousel in Yerba Buena \r\n\r\nThe marvelous carousel built by Charles I.D. Looff in 1906 and installed at Playland in 1912 eventually found its way back to San Francisco. Marianne Stevens, a preservationist, had bought it from Playland and restored it for a Long Beach mall. In 1998, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency bought it for  million and installed it in a beautiful glass pavilion at Yerba Buena Gardens. \r\n\r\nThe ocean wind even blew Playland\\'s ashes all the way to El Cerrito, where muralist Fontes and partner Ed Cassel are working with Playland collector Richard Tuck to create a tribute to that vanished beach area. \r\n\r\nThey\\'re creating a mural 32 feet long and 10 feet high depicting Playland, Sutro\\'s Baths and Museum and the Cliff House. Fontes said the reactions of former Playland visitors range from surprised delight to tears. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, on the very ground where Playland once stood, five ghosts of those bygone days arose. From a distance, the five 15-foot-high figures across the street from Safeway on 48th and Cabrillo look like ghostly black shadows. Up close, they\\'re monuments called Playland Revisited created by Ray Beldner, an artist who often visited Playland as a child. \r\n\r\nMade of perforated stainless steel, each tall, narrow sculpture represents a Playland icon.

In 1881, Adolph Sutro bought most of the western headlands of San Francisco and made his home there. Fifteen years later, Sutro Baths opened to a dazzled public at an estimated cost of over ,000,000. Spread over three acres, the Baths boasted impressive engineering and artistic detail. \r\n\r\nSwimming\r\n\r\nA classic Greek portal opened to a massive glass enclosure containing seven swimming pools of various temperatures. There were slides, trapezes, springboards and a high dive. Together the pools held 1.7 million gallons of water and could be filled in one hour by high tides. There were 20,000 bathing suits and 40,000 towels for rent. Balmy temperatures and abundant plants enhanced \"California’s Tropical Winter Garden.\" The Baths could accommodate 10,000 people at one time. \r\n\r\nEntertainment\r\n\r\nSutro’s dream was realized as San Franciscans streamed to the Baths on one of three railroads connected to the city. An amphitheater, seating up to 3,700 people, provided a variety of stage shows. Three restaurants could accommodate 1,000 people at a sitting. There were natural history exhibits, galleries of sculptures, paintings, tapestries and artifacts from Mexico, China, Asia, and the Middle East. \r\n\r\nThe Last Years\r\n\r\nFor all their glamour and excitement, the success of Sutro Baths was short lived. The Baths were not commercially successful and Sutro\\'s grandson converted part of the Baths into a skating rink in 1937, a task completed in the early 1950\\'s by new owner George Whitney. Sutro Baths never regained its popularity and the ice-skating revenue was not enough to maintain the enormous building. In 1964, developers who planned to replace the Baths with high-rise apartments bought the site. A fire in 1966 quickly finished the demolition work, but the apartment scheme was never realized. \r\n\r\nToday\r\n\r\nThe Baths became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1973. This area is popular today for the scenic and recreational values recognized by Adolph Sutro. Please use caution as you explore the remains of Sutro Baths and coastal rocks and try to imagine the elegance of life here over 100 years ago. \r\n\r\nFor more information call (415) 239-2366.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62j46myvh04"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.513834,37.780425]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Albion Castle","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/Albion_Castle_0290_L.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 881 Innes Avenue San Francisco Ca.The Albion Castle was built as a brewery in 1870.

The concept was developed by Peter Richards and was installed in collaboration with sculptor and master stone mason George Gonzales. Inspiration for the piece came from artist Bill Fontana\\'s recordings made of sounds emanating from a vent pipe of a floating concrete dock in Sydney, Australia. \r\nIn 1980, Richards (now a Senior Artist at the Exploratorium) received a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which enabled him to conduct an extensive period of investigation into the physicality of the Wave Organ phenomenon. The sculpture\\'s speaker horn and audio equipment were either built or acquired for use in some of the experiments of this period. \r\nA prototype, built at the same location, was presented as part of the New Music \\'81 Festival. Though very rudimentary in nature, it generated enthusiasm and support for a permanent work. Permit acquisition and fundraising efforts by Frank Oppenheimer, founding director of the Exploratorium, began soon after, but actual construction did not start until September of 1985, seven months after Oppenheimer\\'s death. The Wave Organ was completed in May of 1986 and was dedicated in June to the memory of Frank Oppenheimer. The Wave Organ is located on a jetty that forms the small Boat Harbor in the Marina district of San Francisco, walking distance from the Exploratorium. The jetty itself was constructed with material taken from a demolished cemetery, providing a wonderful assortment of carved granite and marble, which was used in the construction of this piece. The installation includes 25 organ pipes made of PVC and concrete located at various elevations within the site, allowing for the rise and fall of the tides. Sound is created by the impact of waves against the pipe ends and the subsequent movement of the water in and out of the pipes. The sound heard at the site is subtle, requiring visitors to become sensitized to its music, and at the same time to the music of the environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62j46ddojs8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.440259,37.808351]}},{"properties":{"name":"The White House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500Where it all goes down.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62j46lud9qy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036474,38.89859]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ze lost caves ov St. Louis und ze DeMenil Mansion","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/4/cherok2.jpg\">Broadway and Cherokee, St Louis MOCareful!
