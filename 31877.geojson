The Union, trying to maintain supremacy in this part of the state, sent four companies of the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry to Tompkinsville. They were led by Major Thomas Jefferson Jordan, had 230 soldiers, and contained a large supply train. Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan was launching his famous \"First Kentucky Raid\" and his first objective was the destruction of the Union forces in Tompkinsville. Morgan and his raiders left Celina, Tennessee on July 8th at 10:00 PM and marched all night to surprise his foe. The early morning of July 9, 1862, the peaceful little town of Tompkinsville was awakened by the thunder of cannon fire. At 5:00am the Confederate forces surprised and surrounded the Union garrison. The raiders positioned two cannons and fired into the camp, then carried it by a dashing charge. Within two hours the battle was over. The Confederates had captured the garrison and many Union soldiers, including Major Jordan.
