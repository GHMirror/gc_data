over three years since a business operated at 728 Prospect. The address most recently was home to The Waterhouse, but before that it housed Phil the Fire and Diamondback Brewery. If all goes as planned, the new tenant will be up and running by the time the Cavaliers host their home opener in late October. Described by its owner as a high-energy American saloon, RJ Boland’s will combine a sports bar design with upscale pub grub. Partner and executive chef Doug Fulton, opening chef of McCormick &amp; Schmick’s, says guests can expect familiar but high-quality food dished up in a casual environment. Minor cosmetic changes will be made to the space, including dark-wood accents and the addition of numerous flat-screen TVs. If the proposed “American saloon” décor sounds a bit like BlackFinn Saloon, a 10-shop chain destined for Cleveland, it is no coincidence. Boland’s owner Rossi Penney is a former operating partner with that organization. Down the road, locals can look forward to Martini Suite, an ultra lounge-style club with bottle service to be opened upstairs.","id":"a65jt9m3nf78"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.69325,41.49985]}},{"properties":{"name":"dean

Saint Clair Ave., 216/241-8463, dvinewinebar.com). “A lot of people are surprised to learn that we serve food,” he laments. “I definitely want to change that.” For his externship, Casey worked at the acclaimed Napa Valley eatery, Bouchon. He also spent a few years cooking at Lolita. He describes his style as “simple and clean, with a focus on American regional cuisine.” He intends to stick with the small-plate format, while upgrading quality, presentation and preparation. New items will include pork meatballs with buffalo mozzarella, grilled anchovies with fennel-apple ragu, and pan-fried perch with spaetzle.

The thing was as big as my forearm, and the server sliced it four times so my guests could sample the chunks that fell right off the bone onto the butcher paper.

You pay at the blackened cash register (bread comes free, onions, pickles, and peppers for pocket change), then reemerge into the dining area, where staff at a central counter sell sides and liquid offerings: vessels of potato salad and beans; hunks of yellow cheese; an array of beers, Big Red, IBC Root Beer.

The Kreuz name endured even after Edgar “Smitty” Schmidt bought the business, in 1948. It was still in use in 1999, when a dust-up among the late Edgar’s three children caused his son Rick to take the Kreuz name to a new building down the road (see page 126). Fortunately, daughter Nina Schmidt Sells and her son, John Fullilove, kept the fires burning and reopened under the current name. They made a few concessions to modernity, such as repainting the dining room and offering sauce (you have to ask for it).

The humble brick building off the courthouse square in Lockhart had turned out divine smoked meat since 1900. But just as churchgoers nowadays worship in larger halls, so too does the visitor to the new Kreuz Market, which opened in 1999 in a gigantic building at the edge of town. (The old building now houses Smitty’s.)\r\n\r\nKreuz (pronounced “Krites”) does 45 percent of its business on Saturday. The rest of the week it feels like some kind of meat monastery. You enter, footsteps ringing out in the vast, vacant space, and head down a long hall to the pit room, over which a thin haze of smoke perpetually hangs. Roy Perez, the pitmaster, who has not taken a day of vacation in 21 years, is likely to be tending the fires. The counterwomen are friendly, but solemnity pervades the transaction. The atmosphere is not convivial—you sit alone in a room, capacity 560, bent quietly over an array of absolutely beautiful meat, with no fork, sauce, or plate to disrupt the communion.\r\n\r\n“We do things the hard way,” explained owner Rick Schmidt, who samples his fare at least once a day, usually for breakfast. “We don’t use these auto pits, where you load some sticks in, set your thermometer, and come back in eight or nine hours. What we do takes attention. You’re constantly working the fire, and you need to know how the meat’s supposed to look and smell and sizzle. It’s all feel and sight. We don’t even have a thermometer.”\r\n\r\nThe product is simple and potent. The brisket’s so smoky you can imagine the tree. Swoon-inducing pork ribs are encrusted with huge chunks of black pepper. The pork chop is submissive and the jalapeño-cheese sausage addictive. A pleasant surprise is the sauerkraut, which goes so well with brisket it ought to be more of a barbecue standby. My only complaint was with the regular sausage, the filling of which was ground so fine it slid out of the casing without much encouragement.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Kreuz Market apart is its maniacal devotion to tradition. Noting the rise in the use of commercial smokers in Texas barbecue, Schmidt told me, “I call those things ‘no-brainer pits.’ What they do is give you consistent mediocrity. It’s easier.

Bobby George, president of the George Group of Lakewood, has a contract to buy the downtown Cort Shoe Building that housed the controversial nightspot. He hopes to lease part of a nearby parking lot and the back of the Bolton Pratt building on West Fourth Street to make enough room for a new tenant: the Barley House pub and restaurant. The restaurant, with outdoor seating and a basement lounge, will be modeled on Akron's popular Barley House, one of many eateries launched or owned by George's family. His father, Tony, is a prominent businessman who helped create sports bar chain Slam Jams and the Harry Buffalo bars, which serve buffalo meat.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;The George Group's other divisions include real estate investments and a sports marketing business that works with large corporations and professional athletes.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;Barley House will be Bobby George's first foray into the Warehouse District, but it might not be the last. The 27-year-old developer is pursuing the Liberty Textile Building, a rare vacant entertainment district property owned by James Kassouf.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\"We want to do the right thing for Cleveland,\" George said, \"and the right thing is to develop and grow.\"\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;Some downtown boosters are relieved to see Spy Bar giving way to a new business.

The space, at 2828 Clinton Avenue, was most recently Ilona Simon’s Budapest Blue; prior to that, it was home to Halite. And in its longest-lasting incarnation to date, it was the popular Italian restaurant, Traci’s.\r\n\r\nC-Notes caught up with Marc Lynn late last week as he prepared for the launch. While this is the first restaurant for the John Carroll University prof, it isn’t his first business. Among other enterprises, his resume includes the duo Jazz Etc., where he accompanies his wife Debora’s vocals on guitar. ...\r\n\r\nIf Lynn has his way, Jazz28 should shape up as a warm, intimate nightclub, featuring a mix of fine dining and live entertainment. He doesn’t bristle, either, when his concept is compared to the now-closed Club Isabella, one of his favorite former haunts. “Like they did, we want to provide a venue for talented musicians around the area to really show their stuff.”\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;As for the food factor, staffers include executive chef Jose Alvarado (formerly of Noggins), sous chef Grace Allenson (an ICASI grad), and long-time industry pro, Bill Bower, as GM, dishing out a tasty sounding roundup of small plates ($7-11), salads ($6-11), and entrees like prime New York strip steaks ($27), farm-raised Chilean sea bass ($23), and grilled pork chops ($15). The restaurant also offers a full bar, stocked with beer, wine, and cocktails.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;For now, hours are limited to 4:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Thursday, and 4:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
