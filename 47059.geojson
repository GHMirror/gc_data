In early 2000\\'s, a dozen illegals were found dead from exposure in the bushes along Hwy 86.  If you take Old Kane Spring road West by South West you\\'ll have BLM lands on the left and designated preserve land on the right (north).  4x4 preferred, but a 4x2 can make it if staying on the road. In 1999, 2 witnesses confirmed blue-black F-18\\'s without lights and subsequent UFO activity traversing from Coyote Mountains, over Superstition Hills, of an \"invisible\" craft heading East by SouthEast over US Navy proving grounds.  Totally dry. Water mandatory. Morning and evening haze can set in and confuse navigation. Bring a whistle if hiking in case separated from group.  If lost, go east towards Salton Sea and will eventually hit Hwy 86. Good rock hounding, lots of fossilized oyster shells. Several washes, (don\\'t camp in these!). This area documented as being the region where a Spanish Pearl Expedition from Mazatlan met its demise in the early 1600\\'s. Rumors and legends of Ghost Ship(s). Great place for bonfires and general noise making.

Patagonia, near the 45th parallel, has a near identical climate to the Pacific NW I love so much.  The difference though is that all the seasons are directly backward from the northern hemisphere and there is considerably less civilization there.  \nThe Falkland Islands appeal to me for entirely different reasons.  I just like the idea of a little Brittish, English-speaking society so totally isolated on an island group off the coast of Argentina.  Apparently the place is important enough that England and Argentina actually got into a war about who owned it.  I also love the fact that residents refer to anywhere on the island outside of Stanley (the biggest town there) \"Camp.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a655vbvniaeo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.916016,-48.632909]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tartaruga Maritima","description":"Posted by Edbogus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/acco_21.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> \"The tiny, tucked-away Tartaruga Maritima tent camp is in the extreme south, close to the South African border.
