Seventeen-year-old Jevan Wright was taken by a shark while surfing with friends at Black Point, near the town of Elliston, a location 200 kilometres to the south of the attack on Mr Bayes. The close proximity (both in time and place) of the two attacks suddenly focused public attention on the possibility of a ‘rogue’ shark, one that was specifically targeting humans, such as had been portrayed in the film Jaws. In response to the two attacks in South Australia there were calls for the shark to be hunted down and killed. So great was the hysteria that the writer of Jaws felt compelled to come to the defence of sharks. He stated that the feeding habits of sharks were much better understood than when Jaws was released in the 1970’, and that rogue sharks of the type shown in the film simply did not exist.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a620f4qox1tu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[134.824905,-33.631201]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ken Crew killed by Shark, 11/00","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/061100_attack.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Near Perth, AustraliaNovember 6, 2000\n\nTwo men fought desperately to hunt away a shark as it fatally mauled a friend off one of Perth\\'s most popular beaches today.\n\nLocal businessman and father-of-three Ken Crew, 49, died after having his leg ripped off by what fisheries officers believe to be a white pointer shark up to four metres long.\n\nMr Crew was returning from his daily swim when he was attacked about 30 metres off Cottesloe beach around 6.30am <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a620f4grg96t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.74028,-31.970221]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mark Thompson Killed by Shark 12/04","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/tigershark.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Opal Reef, AustraliaDecember 2004\n\nHe was in the water with a group of people about 15m from the boat when the shark struck, a police spokesman said.

Thinking it must be a dolphin, she photographed the distinctively angled fin of the great white shark and left.\n\nAbout 400 metres from shore Nick Peterson, 18, and his three best friends were messing around in a dinghy with a surfboard towed behind. One of them had been on the board but asked to be pulled back in.\n\nNick Peterson, a surfer and experienced water man, jumped off next and asked his friends to throw him the board. Within seconds a great white shark as long as the five-metre boat surfaced and grabbed Nick by the left arm. It dragged him along the length of the boat by the arm and back, playing with him before a second shark apparently joined the attack.\n\nThe boys, friends from Adelaide\\'s Sacred Heart College, tried to beat the sharks off with oars but Nick, who left school a year ago and was working as a paver, died quickly in front of them.\n\nAbout 3.15pm, Anna and Frank Criscitelli were preparing to put their boat to sea when the boys reached the shore and ran towards them yelling, \"Don\\'t go out, don\\'t go out, sharks, sharks.\"\n\nThe boys were in shock. \"Our friend has just been taken by a shark,\" they screamed.\n\nOver the next few hours Nick\\'s surfboard was washed up and some human remains were recovered.

But her friends on the beach ignored her screams.\n\n\"She went down in the water,\" said Peter Harding, a police inspector. \"After about five or six seconds the deceased came out of the water and screamed \\'Shark!\\'. Of course, people at the time thought she was only joking - until they saw the blood.\"\n\nMiss Whiley was pulled from the water by two local fishermen and dragged on to the beach.\n\nA local teenage girl, who tried to comfort the injured woman while she lay on the beach, said Miss Whiley was still conscious at that time. \"She kept on saying that she was going to die,\" said the girl, whose mother asked for her name to be withheld.\n\nTourist beaches on the eastern coast of Australian were closed yesterday as police divers hunted for the sharks responsible for the attack. They were hoping to retrieve the dead swimmer\\'s missing limbs - although they admit that this is a remote possibility.\n\nThey also hope to confirm the type of shark, and number, involved in the attack, which occurred in chest-high water at a popular swimming beach.\n\nBy a grim coincidence, the attack took place off Amity Beach - the same name as the fictional island setting of the Hollywood shark horror film Jaws.\n\nThe Queensland state government yesterday ordered an investigation into the incident. Amity Point, where the attack occurred, is protected by shark nets and drumlines - large baited hooks anchored to the seabed - which should keep swimmers safe.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a620f4f7j17h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[153.430939,-27.390059]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/6519","metadata":null,"contact_name":"bianca2000","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:bianca2000","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/6519","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=6519,platial:user=bianca2000","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":45982}
