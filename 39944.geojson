Excellent timing as we were staying in China Town. Venturing out alone one night I was soon swept up in the craziness that is chinese celebrations, from extravagant floats made entirely of flowers to the two main stages being less than 20 meters apart and facing each other! Meaning the sound from each was having a full on fight to be heard by the audience trapped between them, and the fight was loud! Somehow I managed to get myself interviewed by the MC on the bigger of the two stages, maybe it was because I\\'m tall with red hair, I think they picked me for a foreigner! Still didn\\'t get to see a Lion Dance, which has been a goal since arriving in Singapore (it\\'ll have to be next year I guess)\r\nPhotos:\r\nChinese Opera- Stage 2\r\nOfferings to the Gods, last night of Chinese New Year, I\\'m standing about half way along the table.

As with all the towns we have stayed in so far we are in China Town. \r\nHighlights: \r\nStummbling upon a Ganesh Temple and taking part in the bathing ceremony. Basically there is a whole lot of chanting, and food thrown into a fire. Then the staue of Ganesh gets a right royal bath in all sorts of good liquids, then they dress him up all pretty like, feed him and sing to him. Once he is all fat and sleepy and happy, the monks give out blessings and yummy food while the prayers give garlands.\r\n\r\nI got into the groove of the night market towards the end, especially when it was other peoples money!\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\nI\\'ll be your friendly tour guide\r\nDinner at the Night Market\r\nStorming KL\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00ojvicua"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[101.61907,3.11001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lampang","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3080336.JPG\">Two words and a sound to describe Lampang:\r\nThai Massage\r\nAhhhhhhhhhh\r\n\r\nOutside of Lampang we went to an Elepant Conservation Centre, which I am very tempted to return to and spend a few days there learning to ride and instruct the elephants. But it might be a bit far out of my budget unfortunately.\r\nIt took me a while to come to a decision about the ethics of elephant riding etc. but this place is incredible. The only elephant hospital in the world and given the reduction of natural habitat a safe haven for retired/sick working elephants. One where it is garunteed that the elephants are treated well and proceeds go to care of all elephants from Burma to Vietnam. \r\nIncredible place, check out the website: www.changthai.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00o6ggq24"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[99.32,18.16]}},{"properties":{"name":"Percy's apartment- Where I'm staying","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00oeu2xka"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.79372,1.3125]}},{"properties":{"name":"Port Kelang anchored","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00og4ghwr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[101.3,2.92163]}},{"properties":{"name":"Singapore Anchorage","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00od2rm7b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.85029,1.26154]}},{"properties":{"name":"Suka Suka- Malay Hideaway","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P2220048.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P2220052.JPG\">Suka Suka is just too devine for words. Well I\\'ve written about in my diary, but for the purposes of a quick update to you all, I don\\'t know where to begin! It was the first time out of a town, so I think my heart opened to it even before we arrived. Having to get there by boat across a picturesque lake helped and being welcomed by the family of three gentle Malay hosts sealed the deal. It was set up like a Bed and Breakfast, but it was run with intimacy and care so that I felt like I was a part of the family (and so did my 11 other travelling friends). We swam, we visited the nearby village, we walked to a secluded waterfall and we ate. We ate like it was the only thing we could do. Malay style is to feed your guest until they are full and then bring out more dishes. I did very well at embracing this custom I feel! We were there for two nights and I think I could have stayed for two months and not noticed the extended time frame.\r\nPhotos:\r\nThe Food!!!\r\nSuka Suka on approach<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00ocxzx40"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.95526,4.95996]}},{"properties":{"name":"The River","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00ofwsapm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.90521,-36.08887]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where it began","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/Rushcutters_Picnic.jpg\"> 1 MacDonald St, Paddington, NSW, Australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c00oghq52p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.223773,-33.881002]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/14599","metadata":null,"contact_name":"abaker","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:abaker","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/14599","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":22,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=14599,platial:user=abaker","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":39944}
