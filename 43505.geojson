Hidden gem in the heart of tourist area where no tourists dine - unless you ask the info booth person \"where do the locals eat around here?\". Anyway, I just saw Matt\\'s blog which details their new expansion - they\\'ll actually have a kitchen.

Service is consistently inconsistent, but the food is always great. Must get the spicy drunken chicken (you can get this in sandwich form at their sandwich shop - Baguette Box - in south Capitol Hill) and most of the vegetable dishes are good too (although we didn\\'t love the green beans). Whenever we see Eric we beg for him to put the seafood chow mein back on the dinner menu. We keep meaning to try their dim sum brunch.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a742wvd6nqe1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.307503,47.624632]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nishino","description":"Posted by Gshuey<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3130 East Madison Street, Seattle, WA, 98112Probably our favorite sushi restaurant in Seattle. Shiro\\'s is also good, but decor is pretty stark there - just a more comfortable/warm feeling here. However, we probably go more to Kisaku (in Tangletown) now purely due to convenience. Not surprising but be prepared to drop 0 per person. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a742wv62qrhg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.292057,47.626309]}},{"properties":{"name":"Osteria La Spiga","description":"Posted by Gshuey<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1429 12th ave e, 98122Our standby for Italian. Almost always get the tagliatelle al ragu. Recently moved into a great new spot, although it\\'s much larger so the feel is less intimate and I think they are still working out the kinks in terms of the staff/service of a larger place. Also, parking is now much more of a challenge. We just tried Tavolata and think that La Spiga now has a rival for Italian in Seattle.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a742wvasxcmg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.316817,47.613308]}},{"properties":{"name":"Portalis","description":"Posted by Gshuey<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 5205 Ballard Ave NW, 98107Really a wine bar with a little food.

Opened by Union chef Ethan Stowell after a few years of anticipation, but it was definitely worth the wait. Octopus salad and minestrone are amazing. Pastas are all great. Haven\\'t had the guts to try the veal brain ravioli. I\\'ve never seen donuts for desert in Italy, but hey they\\'re good.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a742wvdnbdd9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.345998,47.614225]}},{"properties":{"name":"Via Tribunali","description":"Posted by Gshuey<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 913 E Pike St, 98122Authentic italian pizza.
