The individual pages of the county atlas were cropped and georeferenced using ArcMap and the shapefile was then created off of that county-wide map. \nFor further analyses and commentary, please visit Cameron Ormsby's article &quot;Land Speculation in Fresno County: 1860-1891&quot; at the following address: http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=67\nSources: Fresno County Atlas (1891) created by Thomas H. Thompson\nMethodology: Each page of the county atlas was cropped in photoshop and then georeferenced in ArcMap with the historical township and range sections. The mines and mills were located and added to the shape file by hand.\nCredits:\nThe study was conducted at Stanford's Spatial History Lab (spatialhistory.stanford.edu).
