The types of structures collected are largely determined by the needs of disaster planning and emergency response, and homeland security organizations. Structures data are designed to be used in general mapping and in the analysis of structure related activities using geographic information system technology. The National Map structures data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as elevation, boundaries, and transportation, to produce general reference base maps.\r\n","permissions":[{"group_id":"everyone","permissions":{"download":true,"view":true}}],"classification":null,"published":"2015-08-29T13:05:24-04:00","extent":[-176.653,-14.3438,171.378,71.3247],"process_notes":"EPSG:4326,EPSG:4269,EPSG:4267,EPSG:54004,EPSG:54008,EPSG:3785,EPSG:102113,EPSG:102113,EPSG:3785,EPSG:3857,EPSG:102100,EPSG:102100,EPSG:3857,EPSG:102016,EPSG:102017,EPSG:3571,EPSG:3572,EPSG:3573,EPSG:3574,EPSG:3575,EPSG:3576,EPSG:3338,EPSG:102006","url_type":"wms","author":{"metadata":"http://services.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/services/structures/MapServer/WmsServer?","url":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t Email: ","contact_phone":"","source":"USGS"},"source":"","tags":"","contributor":{"url":"http://geocommons.com/users/104735","name":"markandersen"},"id":487414,"data_attributes":null,"calculation_params":null}
