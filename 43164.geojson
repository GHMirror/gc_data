I\\'d also never expected to meet someone so caring and romantic on top of all the other things (like funny, smart and hot) that I was looking for in a guy.  From making me macaroni in a non-existent kitchen for Valentine\\'s Day to being so patient with me as our relationship advanced, he was more than I could have asked for in a boyfriend.
