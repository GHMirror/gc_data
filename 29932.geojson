The refurbished RBL755 is equipped with a radar proximity sensor for deployment from medium and high altitudes. The failure rate of the submunitions is the subject of debate with the MoD reporting a rate of 6%.

Since then, the company has acquired 17 companies including Litton Industries and Newport News in 2001. In December 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW, the military and automotive group, for .7bn. Northrop sold TRW\\'s automotive business for .73bn and retained the space and advanced technologies businesses. Northrop Grumman has more than 300 locations worldwide and claims to employ people in 25 countries and all 50 US states.2\n\nWhat it makes\n\nNorthrop Grumman professes to be the world\\'s largest shipbuilder.3 It is also one of the three dominant contractors in military space and supplies nearly 60% of the US military\\'s airborne radar systems. 4\n\nWarships: Northrop owns Newport News, the US\\'s sole builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and one of only two companies, along with General Dynamics\\' Electric Boat, capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. It has a contract to build four Aegis guided-missile destroyers, a contract to design the US Navy\\'s DD (X) destroyer, and develops and produces missile launching and handling equipment for submarine and land-based weapons systems.\n\nFire control radar: Northrop Grumman makes fire control radar for fighter air-craft including Lockheed Martin\\'s F-16 as well as BAE Systems\\' Hawk 200 jet. In 2002, it was awarded a 87m contract to provide engineering services and technical support to the F-16\\'s fire-control system over a 23-year period. This covers not only the USAF, but also the F-16s of 16 other air forces. It is providing the radar for the JSF, under a joint venture with Lockheed Martin, and, also with Lockheed, has developed and produced Longbow multi-mode radar and the AGM-114L Hellfire missile for the Apache attack helicopter. 5\n\nB-2 stealth bomber: Northrop is the prime contractor for the B-2 Spirit high-altitude multi-role intercontinental stealth bomber. Each B-2 is reported to have cost .3bn. 6 There are 21 operational B-2s, each of which can carry 18,000kg of nuclear or conventional munitions. They were deployed in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nNuclear missiles and Ballistic Missile Defense: Northrop Grumman provides navigation systems for tactical missiles and nuclear-armed inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). In 1997, it was awarded a 15-year contract to be the ICBM Prime Integration Contractor. The company has involvement in a number of Ballistic Missile Defense projects, particularly since its acquisition of TRW.\n\nVinnell\n\nThe Virginia-based Vinnell Corp, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, \\'is a recognised leader in facilities operation and maintenance, military training, educational and vocational training and logistics support in the [US] and overseas\\'. 7 The company reports that \\'Vinnell has successfully completed projects on [five] continents in over 50 countries for a variety of government and commercial customers\\'. It is, in other words, a private military company - the officially sanctioned and sanitised face of mercenary operations.\n\nProtecting the House of Saud: In 1975, Vinnell received a 7m contract to train the Saudi National Guard, or SANG. This is a force of around 55,000 men that Jane\\'s Defence Weekly has described as \\'a kind of Praetorian Guard for the House of Saud, the royal family\\'s defence of last resort against internal opposition.\\' 8One report has alleged that \\'there is also circumstantial evidence to suggest that at times Vinnell employees in Riyadh want beyond training people to pull the triggers.\\'9In 1998 Vinnell received a follow-on 31m five-year contract for SANG training.\n\nIn November 1995, the SANG headquarters and an adjacent building complex housing Vinnell employees was bombed. This event killed five Americans and wounded 30 more, all Vinnell staff. In mid May 2003, in a series of bombings in Riyadh, at least nine employees of Vinnell were killed.\n\nA new Iraqi army: In late June 2003, Vinnell won a 8m contract to train the nucleus of a new Iraqi Army. Vinnell and its subcontractors began working at various locations on July 1st under this one-year contract. 10 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634epxtq8me"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13247,51.50835]}},{"properties":{"name":"Northrop Grumman, Burlington House, 118 Burlington Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634epx3jr6p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.24642,51.39891]}},{"properties":{"name":"Northrop Grumman, Peel Centre, Aerodrome Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634epu0133d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.24466,51.59504]}},{"properties":{"name":"QinetiQ, 2nd Floor, 85 Buckingham Gate","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\" href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk\">Caatlondon</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/DSC_0028.JPG\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634epxcblnn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.138423442841,51.49921924]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rafael, 3/5 Duke Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\">Boringlovechild</a>Israeli arms producer of Gill Spike Missiles, used in Palestine and Lebanon.

However, there are plenty more examples including Paveway bombs, Javelin anti-tank missiles, Joint Standoff Weapons, Sidewinder and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles and Maverick air-to-ground missiles. The Maverick guided missile has been in service with the US Air Force since 1972 and, according to Raytheon, \\'is the most widely used precision-guided missile in the free world\\'.\n\nSince 1999, both the Tomahawk cruise missile and the AGM-154A Joint Standoff Weapon have been used against Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and, most recently, Iraq. Both of these missiles can be equipped to deploy cluster submunitions.\n\nRadar and targeting: Raytheon also specialises in radar, surveillance and targeting systems. These are in use on most US-produced combat aircraft including the Special Forces AC-130U and AC-130H airborne gunships. One group of such systems is referred to as the \\'Terminator family of targeting systems\\' which is in use in the F-18 Hornet fighter and the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle.\n\nBallistic Missile Defense: Raytheon is one of the big four Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) companies and has extensive involvement in each of the four main segments of the programme (boost, mid-course, terminal and sensors). Its involvement includes production of the Standard Missile-3, being systems integrator for the (Patriot) PAC-3 system and prime contractor for the \\'Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle\\' and both the X-band and Upgraded Early Warning Radars.\n\nExports\n\nRaytheon exports billions of dollars worth of military equipment each year. In 2002 its total exports amounted to .6 billion. Its client list includes Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Singapore, Greece, Taiwan and South Korea. The AIM-120 air-to-air missile alone has been sold to more than 20 countries, including \\'recent controversial offers\\' to Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634epiqixvb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.154548883438,51.5088092345]}},{"properties":{"name":"Reed Elsevier, 1-3 Strand","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\">Boringlovechild</a>Reed Elsevier are the company responsible for organising the DSEi arms fair and other arms fairs around the world which help to faclitate the global arms trade.

SPEAR will focus on four areas of improvement in personal equipment from 1996 - 2005 including the Modular/Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH). The SPEAR MICH provides the SOF operator the flexibility to tailor ballistic/impact protection and communications to the mission using one modular system.\n\nMICH is a modular helmet system that provides ballistic, fragmentation, aural and impact protection, while being night vision, communications and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) equipment compatible. The MICH is intended to replace standard government and commercial helmets, communications and aural protection items currently in use. The MICH helmet and is compatible with standard and SOF-unique clothing and individual equipment.\n\nThe ballistic helmet provides 9mm (handgun) and fragmentation protection within the spectrum of environments (climatic, salt water, fresh water, POL, etc). The helmet allows maximum sensory awareness for the user, which includes unobstructed field of view and ambient hearing capabilities. It also allows mounting of night vision devices and oxygen masks. The helmet\\'s retention/suspension system provides maximum balance, stability and comfort, while providing the proper size, fit and ventilation. The pad suspension system provides adequate impact protection throughout all joint SOF operations, to include Static Line and Military Free Fall airborne operations. The ballistic helmet, retention system and pad suspension system may be worn with or without the communications subsystem.\n\nAlthough molded like the current, standard-issue Personnel Armor System, Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet in use since the early 1980s, the MICH trims away the edge for improved visibility, unobstructed hearing, reduced weight (less than 3 pounds without communication equipment) and easier integration with body armor.\n\nUntil the MICH, there had never been a helmet designed to stop bullets. The MICH uses a different version of Kevlar combined with different bonding techniques to form a shell capable of halting a submachine gun\\'s 9 mm round in addition to protecting against fragmentation. The PASGT Kevlar helmet only protects against fragmentation and at most can deflect bullets.\n\nThe communication subsystem is intended to provide aural protection as well as a dual channel communications capability. The subsystem provides aural protection, occluding and non-occluding communications, omni-directional hearing, ear-specific communications (dual channel), low profile microphone(s), microphone adapter for mask microphone, multiple radio and intercom adapters, and push-to-talk access. The headset may be worn alone or with the ballistic helmet retention system and pad suspension system.\n\nThe communications subsystem is designed to be included with the helmet, and because of its modularity, the MICH can be configured to each specific group with or without the added equipment. The subsystem is intended to provide aural protection and dual-channel communications capability. It offers features such as a low-profile microphone, microphone adapter for mask microphone, multiple radio and intercom adapters, and push-to-talk access. The headset may be worn alone or with the helmet.\n\nWhat would allow the wearer to stay conscious if hit is the innovative seven-pad suspension system. The current helmet uses a bolted-on nylon suspension with a leather headband that is fastened onto the inside headband. Many users would buy a circular pad to ease the weight stress on top of their heads.\n\nSuspension pads consist of a comfort foam and \"slow memory\" foam to absorb shock. The cloth covering wicks away moisture to keep users cooler. The MICH suspension pads are composed partly of comfort foam where the pads touch the head and mostly of \"slow-memory\" impact foam with the resilience of a wrestling mat. The foam is like a shock tling mat. The foam is like a shock absorber against a striking bullet.\n\nA black CoolMax cloth covering wicks moisture away and helps the user stay cooler. Lining the inside is a glued-on strip of Velcro fastener. Users can unhook and adjust the pads to create a custom fit. An improved strap attaches at four points on the helmet while retaining the chin pocket for a more secure fit.\n\nAlso remarkably different from the current helmet is the four-point instead of two-point chinstrap. The two-strap \"pocket\" at the chin remains the same, but instead of anchoring to the helmet over the ear, one strap in front and behind the ear on each side securely clamp down the MICH.\n\nAirborne operations are easier because the MICH requires no shock pad to prevent whiplash while descending or retention strap. Two features of the MICH reduce logistics. It\\'s made in medium and large with different sized pads used to account for the vast majority of sizes in between, and the helmet cover is reversible for woodland and desert camouflage. The PASGT helmet uses separate covers and is issued in five sizes.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634epp8s4d4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.147242546082,51.5115469545]}},{"properties":{"name":"Signature Industries, Tom Cribb Road, Thamesmead","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\">Boringlovechild</a>NATO Supply Classifications: Parachutes; Aerial Pick Up, Delivery, Recovery Systems; and Cargo Tie Down Equipment; Safety and Rescue Equipment; Miscellaneous Communication Equipment; <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634epvdszjh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.08081,51.4917]}},{"properties":{"name":"Smiths Aerospace, Vulcan Way, New Addington","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://watford-boy.blogspot.com\">Boringlovechild</a>Smiths Group, through its Aerospace business, is a first-tier supplier to UK and US aircraft and engine manufacturers.
