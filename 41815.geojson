We can control these high speed robots with some special real-time algorithms and a tricky robot control architecture which combines the algorithms with the robot hardware.\n\nKURT is a German acronym for experimental robot platform for sewerage inspection. It is the prototype of a wireless autonomous mobile robot.\n\nIt is equipped with a Panasonic tough-book (+4.2 kg, 800 MHz pentium 3) and a 3D laser range finder.  For indoor environements the front and rear wheels have no tread pattern to enhance rotating. KURT2 operates for about 4 hours with one battery charge. The core of the robot is a Pentium-III-600 MHz with 384 MB RAM and Real-Time Linux. An embedded 16-Bit CMOS microcontroller is used to control the motor and lower sensors (Phytec. Minimodul C167, inc. flash rom).

It is not feasible to alter houses or to remove the staircases. It is possible to design robots with stair-climbing attachments, but these are usually weak spots in the design. Providing a robot with the same locomotive structures as a human will ensure that it can certainly operate in any environment a human can operate in.
