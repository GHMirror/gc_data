This is the \"ultimate champagne source\" where \"champagnes can be discovered and enjoyed\", a perfect choice for any occasion. Since its premiere in spring of 1998, The Bubble Lounge continues to be one of the hottest night spots in all of the Bay Area for both natives and tourists, champagne connoisseurs and novices alike...\r\rThe Bubble Lounge\\'s decadent menu is mirrored by its luxurious interior décor. The entrance leads into an extravagant main room with high ceilings and the building\\'s original brick walls decorated with champagne collectibles and artwork. Ten inviting salons are furnished with satin couches, overstuffed chairs, rich mahogany, and marble tables - all under the soft, warm glow of candlelight. Downstairs is The Krug Room, an even more intimate space reminiscent of traditional champagne cellars with a private bar. The ambience is elegant, yet very comfortable, welcoming to a wide range of guests from the young professionals after work to the stylish and fashionable of late night. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.bubblelounge.com%5C'\">www.bubblelounge.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixbzgvjq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.403083,37.796024]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe Abir","description":"Posted by Ramaaysola<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 1300 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixcr0yld"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.438295,37.776916]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe Gratitude","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.happycow.net\" href=\"http://www.happycow.net\">Happycow</a><img src=\"http://www.withthecurrent.com/images/cafe_08.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2400 Harrison St, San Francisco, California, United States, North America100% VegetarianRestaurant<a href=\"%5C'http://happycow.net/reviews.php?id=3697%5C'\">Reviews</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixhv5dit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.41248,37.75903]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe La Vie","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.happycow.net\" href=\"http://www.happycow.net\">Happycow</a><img src=\"http://www.lavie.us/\"><img src=\"http://www.lavie.us/images/interior1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 429 Front St, Santa Cruz, California, United States, North America100% VegetarianRestaurant<a href=\"%5C'http://happycow.net/reviews.php?id=5768%5C'\">Reviews</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixd4pgrs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.02403,36.97103]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cascal","description":"Posted by Ramaaysola400 Castro Street Mountain View CAExcellent spanish restaurant with live music, wine, great atmosphere <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixfqczl5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.080717,37.391365]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chamberlain West Hollywood","description":"Posted by System1000 Westmount Dr, West Hollywood, CAChamberlain West Hollywood (310) 657-7400<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixe9s7j0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.379033,34.089637]}},{"properties":{"name":"Crustacean","description":"Posted by Ramaaysola1475 Polk St, San Francisco, CAGreat restaurant recommended by \"ourfounder\" user on Platial.  \nExcellent Salt-n-pepper crab.  noodles, great ambiance.  \n\n- Oriental sytyle food. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixkesw62"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.420775,37.790258]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dutch Goose","description":"Posted by Ramaaysoladeviled eggs<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hrixgcli9u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.20625,37.41435]}},{"properties":{"name":"Flex-Bar Party ALL night","description":"Posted by Ramaaysola<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Pazzanistraat 1, amsterdamOn the other end of the Westergasfabriek is Flex (Pazzanistraat 1; 31-20-486-2123; www.flexbar.nl), an intimate new two-room insider spot that features a mix of local and international D.J.\\'s.
