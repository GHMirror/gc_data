A housing unit is owner occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit. This data variable is included in Esri's Updated Demographics (2010/2015).\nThe map is designed to be displayed with 30–50 percent semi-transparency for overlay on other basemaps as noted in the map legend. A basemap with relatively few colors, such as the World Terrain Base, works well with this map when transparency is used.\n\nThe geography depicts States at greater than 25m scale, Counties at 1m to 25m scale, Census Tracts at 250k to 1m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 250k scale.\n\nEsri's Updated Demographics Data (2010/2015) – Population, age, income, sex, and race are among the variables included in the database. Each year, Esri's data development team employs its proven methodologies to update more than 2,000 demographic variables for a variety of geographies. See Updated Demographics for more information.\n\n\nScale Range: 1:591,657,528 down to 1:72,224\n\nCoordinate System: Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere (WKID 102100)\n\nTiling Scheme: Google Maps/Bing Maps \n\nMap Service Name: USA_Owner_Occupied_Housing\n\nDate: December 2010  Update Frequency: Once per year\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8f109aa9f37249e3b4017c31cbb7cbbf","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"ArcGIS.com","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8f109aa9f37249e3b4017c31cbb7cbbf","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"block,bureau,census,cloud,commerce,counties,demographics,department,doc,federal,groups,housing,maps,national,of,owner,population,states,tracts,us,usa","published":"2010-12-16T17:00:00Z","id":90200}
