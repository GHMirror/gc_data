 Travelling light with just the Sony NEX-5 and 2 manual focus nikon primes, a 28mm f2.8 and 50mm f1.8 is always fun and challenging to capture moments.\nI think the Madison/wacker detour made many people late as I saw quite a few people jogging around tonight.\nI was looking to make a shot when this guy ran towards me, as he passed I quickly racked the focus and grabbed this image.  The focus peaking of the NEX greatly helps in making shots with a moderate

July celebrations in Chicago. We staked out our spot on the edge of Belmont Harbor hoping to catch the Navy Pier  fireworks (on right) but ended up with a bonus. It so happened  that there was another fireworks display coming from nearby (maybe the Lincoln Park Zoo or Diversey Harbor) and we were treated to two shows at the same time. And the best part, it was not crowded at all. Had to crop out some heads at the bottom of the frame.<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=5912700910&amp;size=large\">View Large</a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/romeobanias/5912700910/","id":"a638aav328up"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.633293,41.942103]}},{"properties":{"title":"morning ride","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912148829","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 12:03:57 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 09:03:56 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 12:03:56 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/12021972@N04/\">63 Images</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12021972@N04/5912148829/\" title=\"morning ride\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5076/5912148829_a643f7c779_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"morning ride\"></a>\n\noak st beach, chicago il","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12021972@N04/5912148829/","id":"a638aatfneek"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.624385,41.904652]}},{"properties":{"title":"Wednesday Fireworks","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912025157","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 11:20:09 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 08:20:08 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 11:20:08 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/12243177@N05/\">1 Johnny</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12243177@N05/5912025157/\" title=\"Wednesday Fireworks \"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5311/5912025157_e6ac2d90c0_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Wednesday Fireworks \"></a>\n\nChicago, IL \n7-7-2011","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12243177@N05/5912025157/","id":"a638ab3f6wwj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.60292,41.892566]}},{"properties":{"title":"_0028023.JPG","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912013481","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 11:16:13 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 08:16:12 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 11:16:12 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/59651704@N00/\">Disguised as Meat</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/59651704@N00/5912013481/\" title=\"_0028023.JPG\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5040/5912013481_b880306b8c_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"_0028023.JPG\"></a>\n\nthis picture was uploaded directly from my camera, i guess that makes the camera a blogject <a href=\"http://www.goodfello.com\">read more about the project</a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/59651704@N00/5912013481/","id":"a638aaucxsk2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.640007,41.93275]}},{"properties":{"title":"XANAX IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE TINIEST PLANE TO OKC!!!!!","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912012421","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 11:15:53 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 08:15:52 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 11:15:52 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/dwciii/\">dwciii</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwciii/5912012421/\" title=\"XANAX IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE TINIEST PLANE TO OKC!!!!!\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5077/5912012421_c21a8d68c2_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" alt=\"XANAX IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE TINIEST PLANE TO OKC!!!!!\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwciii/5912012421/","id":"a638aathwnm4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.9044,41.97727]}},{"properties":{"title":"Summertime Street Life","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5880181642","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 11:11:03 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 08:11:02 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 11:11:02 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/light_seeker/\">Viewminder</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/light_seeker/5880181642/\" title=\"Summertime Street Life\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5228/5880181642_1200eeec0d_m.jpg\" width=\"159\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Summertime Street Life\"></a>\n\nIt's been the most awesome summer so far...\nMan...

There was a time that you NEEDED something like this, or perhaps one much larger if you are in a \"fringe\" area, far from the transmitters, out in the boonies (the place to be!)  if you were to see any TV programming.  \nNow that most TV is delivered to the home via coaxial cable, fiber optic, or satellite, these are being dismantled and tossed out, sadly.\nMost people find out the hard way that, when the cable is out, or the satellite doesn't work, their old rooftop antenna would still faithfully squeeze the millivolts of TV signals still available out there, floating in the air.\nThis is a fairly typical antenna for suburban Chicago.  The longer elements on the right side are arranged in what's called a \"log-periodic\" array (longer to shorter) and are used for the old VHF channels 2-13.  The smallest elements on the left are called the UHF \"corner reflector\" and are for channels 14-83 (this part will work extremely well for today's \"digital\" HDTV reception).  This one is pointed right at downtown Chicago, roughly 8 o'clock in this picture (northeast in real life).\nMore info than you ever needed I'm sure.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnhanna/5912794933/","id":"a638ab6cpgeh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.843667,41.838833]}},{"properties":{"title":"Headed home","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5913316706","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 15:39:59 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 12:39:58 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 15:39:58 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/rigib/\">Rigib</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rigib/5913316706/\" title=\"Headed home\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6050/5913316706_64973ffb30_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Headed home\"></a>\n\nWell, now .... wasn't this a fine challenge ... tabletop sunset ... <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/ourdailychallenge/discuss/72157627135915522/\"><b>Golden Hour</b></a> - Our Daily Challenge\n97# of 365","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rigib/5913316706/","id":"a638ab1wgkpe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809954,41.957128]}},{"properties":{"title":"Pond (2011-06-23 13-21-39)","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912690061","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 15:17:49 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 12:17:48 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 15:17:48 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/garysibio/\">garysibio</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/garysibio/5912690061/\" title=\"Pond (2011-06-23 13-21-39)\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6020/5912690061_b160f31458_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Pond (2011-06-23 13-21-39)\"></a>\n\nTaken at the Emily Oaks Nature Center, Skokie, Illinois.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/garysibio/5912690061/","id":"a638aayz6lxy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.745646,42.02247]}},{"properties":{"title":null,"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912650653","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 15:04:30 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 12:04:29 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 15:04:29 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/12081225@N04/\">COBALTSIXTY</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12081225@N04/5912650653/\" title=\" \"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6010/5912650653_0d177076d1_m.jpg\" width=\"179\" height=\"240\" alt=\" \"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12081225@N04/5912650653/","id":"a638ab47ctyk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.6645,41.889833]}},{"properties":{"title":"I Am Lost","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912634097","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 14:58:41 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 11:58:40 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 14:58:40 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/timo3k/\">Timo3K</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timo3k/5912634097/\" title=\"I Am Lost\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5159/5912634097_f2ebb76611_m.jpg\" width=\"186\" height=\"240\" alt=\"I Am Lost\"></a>\n\nTaken with my less than great LG cameraphone.

I wanted long shadows, a fuzzy horizon, a sun, orange sky. I knew the light had to be from the back from a previous challenge on backlighting so there are three lamps all pointing toward the orange paper away from Farmer Smurf. \nI tried using a bit of yellow paper, but it didn't work out so I ended up with just two sheets of orange, which are more orangey than this photo shows. The sun was created with a small flashlight. handheld just above Farmer Smurf's head but pointing at the same spot you see here.\nI used the Canon 60mm close-up lens (my favorite of all lens) set on f/2.8. I set the white balance to \"cloudy\" which gave it more orangeyness. I focused on Farmer Smurf's tail.

words they say\nWhich we won't understand\n\"Don't accept that what's happening\nIs just a case of others' suffering\nOr you'll find that you're joining in\nThe turning away\" \nIt's a sin that somehow\nLight is changing to shadow\nAnd casting it's shroud\nOver all we have known\nUnaware how the ranks have grown\nDriven on by a heart of stone\nWe could find that we're all alone\nIn the dream of the proud \nOn the wings of the night\nAs the daytime is stirring\nWhere the speechless unite\nIn a silent accord\nUsing words you will find are strange\nAnd mesmerised as they light the flame\nFeel the new wind of change\nOn the wings of the night \nNo more turning away\nFrom the weak and the weary\nNo more turning away\nFrom the coldness inside\nJust a world that we all must share\nIt's not enough just to stand and stare\nIs it only a dream that there'll be\nNo more turning away?<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX_Fu6JW0fM\">No More Turning Away</a>\nFaces on the

She likes everything fancy so fills her life with frills and lace and glamour. JoJo is Fancy Nancy's sister. For many, many books she wasn't even given a name. I love her bright face and happy smile. She stands next to the kitchen sink by my radio ... the only doll in the kitchen. She sees most of my photo taking, my cooking and dish washing, my eating, my Sudoku puzzling, my bill paying, my cat feeding, my tax preparing ... a great deal of my life. If I could only keep one doll, it would be JoJo.<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/ourdailychallenge/discuss/72157627143733550/\"><b>Portrait</b></a> - Our Daily Challenge\n98# of 365","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rigib/5915376396/","id":"a638ab0crmx9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809901,41.957152]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5915365516","title":"Water Play 2.","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/08 07:55:42 -0400","original":"Fri, 08 Jul 2011 04:55:41 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/08 07:55:41 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/afunkydamsel/\">afunkydamsel</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/afunkydamsel/5915365516/\" title=\"Water Play 2.\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6052/5915365516_8513fe4839_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Water Play 2.\"></a>\n\nFolks splashing around in the water at the Millennium Park fountains.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/afunkydamsel/5915365516/","id":"a638ab5avs9u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.622527,41.88267]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5914801237","title":"Source Material","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/08 07:52:40 -0400","original":"Fri, 08 Jul 2011 04:52:39 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/08 07:52:39 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/ktgeek/\">ktgeek</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktgeek/5914801237/\" title=\"Source Material\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6050/5914801237_5c93cc714c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Source Material\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktgeek/5914801237/","id":"a638aaut8uta"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.176361,41.971062]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5914787783","title":"Photoshoot on Photoshoot","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/08 07:44:03 -0400","original":"Fri, 08 Jul 2011 04:44:02 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/08 07:44:02 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/reneerk/\">Renee Rendler-Kaplan</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/reneerk/5914787783/\" title=\"Photoshoot on Photoshoot\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6029/5914787783_93e015c663_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"204\" alt=\"Photoshoot on Photoshoot\"></a>\n\nChicago Botanic Garden\nGlencoe, IL","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/reneerk/5914787783/","id":"a638ab5ume6m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.756103,42.134021]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5915293036","title":"the_fall_of_chrysallis","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/08 07:08:50 -0400","original":"Fri, 08 Jul 2011 04:08:49 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/08 07:08:49 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/francemalate/\">francemalate</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/francemalate/5915293036/\" title=\"the_fall_of_chrysallis\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6047/5915293036_ee08fd385d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"the_fall_of_chrysallis\"></a>\n\nafter the earth's destruction in 2012 a new utopic city emerged now known as Chrysallis.

We took a trip to Volo bog yesterday.  I had never been there, but had been wanting to for a while.  I'm glad we went.  I think that this was a green heron.  We saw at least one other when we were there.  We also saw multiple great egrets, blue heron, and two sandhill cranes.  We also saw plenty of frogs, dragonflies, and some butterflies.  Well worth a trip to Volo bog.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/65315936@N00/5915090641/","id":"a638aaxkwng7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.164573,42.325229]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5915633492","title":"The

The chain of events went something like this: I went downtown to Blicks Art Supplies after early service to look for a purple mat, but they hadn't opened yet.  I spotted some people with yellow t-shirts advertising the Gold Coast Art Fair in Grant Park, and decided to check it out.  If it weren't for the euchre tournament (which I co-won - I'm geeking out like Milhouse), I could have spent all afternoon at this art fair.
