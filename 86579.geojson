If you look at her ear you will see many full ticks... \nSeen A Piebald Deer Lately?\nMost of us have never laid eyes upon a piebald deer, and might not believe what we see if we see one. The animal is somewhat of a rarity, though a little more common than one might think. We usually associate the term piebald with horses, though we normally refer to such horses as pintos, paints, or Appaloosas. A piebald animal is one whose hair or fur has a spotted, rather than a solid color pattern.\nThere are 5 species of deer native to North America, the whitetail deer, the mule deer, the caribou, the elk and the moose. Most if not all sightings of piebald deer have involved the whitetail deer. Sightings have occurred in many parts of the United States and Canada, from the West coast to the East coast. Texas seems to have a particularly large concentration of piebald deer, if one can call once-in-a-lifetime sighting characteristic of a large concentration.\nMost whitetail deer, like the ones who like to play games running in front of speeding automobiles, are either reddish-brown or gray in color, or somewhere in between. Some whitetail are fairly light in color and some darker, but there are rare instances where deer have been observed that are either completely white or nearly black.\nAbnormal coloring in a deer is usually due to the presence of a defective gene. Consequently, some of these abnormally colored deer exhibit other abnormal characteristics as well. Piebald deer, together with some of the other odd color combinations are generally not as healthy as the whitetail deer having normal coloration.\nPiebald Deer - Most, if not all piebald deer have white legs and a white underbelly, while the rest of the body may be either completely or partially covered with patches or spots, usually reddish brown or gray on white. A few piebald deer are mostly, though usually not completely white, and may be mistaken at times for albino deer.<a

I watched about three or four Bluebirds flying and hovering around this nest box, but never going inside.. Even a pair of House Finches were getting in on the action.. Having seen a snake climbing this box before, I had a feeling that was the problem. Took a few shots of the birds flying around, but the snake just stayed inside.. A few minutes after the birds gave up, the snake emerged... Thought a composite of the two shots would make for a cool shot :)","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/delawarebill/5913653556/","id":"a64bb5g9w95l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.477354,39.258334]}},{"properties":{"title":"Mooching the image of #sunflower in the grocery store.
