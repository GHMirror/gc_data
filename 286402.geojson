It lives in the Mediterranean forest and mountainous areas covered in vegetation, like open forests. It is a smaller version of wild cats so it hunts smaller sized animals. The largest animal it preys on is the hare. It also preys on rodents, birds, reptiles and amphibians. It only hunts at twilight. Its main food source is the European rabbit. A male only needs to feed on one rabbit per day, but a female with cubs will eat up to three rabbits per day. However, this is a great characteristic because rabbits repopulate very quickly.It adapts well to the area because it dwells in the shrubs and grass, which provides a type of camouflage. It hunts at twilight, and it does this alone. It will wait for hours behind rocks and bushes to capture prey. Twilight keeps it hidden and that makes it safer from deadly situations, like poachers. It has tufts of hair on its ears to help it detect sounds.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Lynx\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Lynx</a>","id":"a9j6ebrhpijg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[6.416016,45.521744]}},{"properties":{"name":"Monk Seal","description":"<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/9096_-_Milano_-_Museo_storia_naturale_-_Diorama_-_Foca_Monaca_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto_22-Apr-2007.jpg\">The Monk Seal is found in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic waters, also around the Tropic of Cancer. It feeds on a variety of fish and mollusks. It mostly chooses octopus and squid to feed on. They eat up to 3 kilograms per day. The pups are born in black fur, with a special shaped white patch beneath that is used to identify them.Due to commercial hunting, fishermen, coastal urbanization and pollution , it has to adapt. However, it does adapt very slowly to these conditions. It has advantages of being able to emerge itself to depths of 150 to 230 feet. This keeps it protected from the human activities that are destroying its species. The newest adaptation would be having pups in coastal caves. The pups are usually born on land but since humans have populated the land they have to be born elsewhere. The caves are so hard to get to that even trained scuba divers do not go inside. It’s a safer place for the newborns to be born but after birth the caves are a very dangerous place for the pups to be.

They have broad heads, dark eyes, thick muzzles, large and pointy ears and black stripes. Their coat varies from gray to light brown. Their front legs are longer than their back legs. They have a mane of long hair that can be raised to make them look larger. They use this intimidation when they feel confronted or threatened. They have fluffy tails that grow over a foot long. Strangely, the females are larger than the males. They like to be around a water source, usually within six miles. They usually stay alone or with a dominant female. They feed on dead animals that other predators kill. They eat insects, small mammals, reptiles, eggs, fruit, and vegetables. Females have a gestation period of three months and will give birth to two or four young.The reason this species is endangered is because of loss of habitat and hunting.

They are small and vary in color\nfrom gray to dark brown. They have two sharp incisors on the top and\ntwo on the bottom that continuously grow. They have large ears and hind\nlegs, short, fluffy tails and long toes. Their toes are webbed to\nprevent them spreading apart as they hop around. They are very social\nwithin their species so they live together in medium-sized colonies.\nThey are mostly active around dusk and dawn. Grass is their primary\nfood source. Female rabbits have a gestation period of 29-35 days.\nEvery litter has from two to twelve rabbits! In a study, twenty-four\nrabbits multiplied to over 600 million rabbits in less than a century.\nThese rabbits alter the mixture of plants and structure of vegetation\nwhile through grazing and spreading the seeds over a wide area.\nThis helps preserve the plant species.

The upper edges of the wetlands, where they live, are filling in with water. Since they have nowhere else to go, its predators are plucking them off easily.

Without the beach, there can't be a neritic zone and without the oceanic zone, there actually wouldnt be a ocean. So, there are many landforms that are needed in order to have a neritic zone.     \"The continental shelf is really the neritic zone but in a different term, the shelf streaches out from the land to the ocean. The shelf isnt all of the ocean, it goes about miles out into the ocean but starts at the water's surface or where the water touches land. The continental shelf is what some countries use to call their territorial waters, this is where most countries that had water near them got their natural resources from like food, water and shelter. This is why the continental shelf is similiar to the neritic zone cause at both places is where alot of activity is being done.\"<img src=\"http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/po/gif/boating.jpg\">","id":"a9j6ed6aklio"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.662109,32.509762]}},{"properties":{"name":"Agriculture","description":"     There are many animals that live in the neritic zone that are grown by people like fish, different types of plants, coral reefs, and reptiles.

This reef is called the Great Barrier Reef. Reefs are not found above or below latitudes up to about 30 degrees. There is one exception to that; Bermuda (at 32 degrees north latitude) has coral reefs because it lies in the path of the Gulf Stream’s warming water. Coral must have sunlight to survive, so you can find coral reefs at depths of approximately 70 meters and up. That mean you will find little if any out in the middle of the ocean.  Coral reefs also make a good barrier for bigger waves because of storms ect. When a bigger wave comes in toured land the reef acts like a barrier and breaks up the wave. So when it hits the shoreline it is a little wave that has little affect. There are many programs out there to help build reefs for that reason.     Coral Reefs live in the tropical and semitropical climates. Found in the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic.

When that happens there are not enough predators to eat the other fish. Those fish over eat the plant/coral reefs which cases the coral reefs to die. The second way humans kill coral is by bleaching. Bleaching is used to stun fish to catch but also used to make the coral look better. Companies that own or have permission from the government to bleach a section of the ocean (mostly around coral reefs) do this so it makes the coral reefs look better for divers. <img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Coral-reef-bioerosion.jpg\">","id":"a9j6eehc9nih"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.141602,-10.228437]}},{"properties":{"name":"Agriculture","description":"     The coral reefs provide us with many things.
