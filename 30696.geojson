If only I’d lived earlier (and had a significant singing talent) then I could have been one of their amazing guests in their last concert “The Last Waltz”.

So many different areas to visit, each with a totally unique atmosphere. It also looks awesome…lots to photograph. Now that I think of it, it’s also where “The Last Waltz” was filmed.

I was lucky enough to see his production of the Mahabharata in 1990 when Glasgow was European City of Culture. It is the story of the Hindu religion, told in 9 hours, it completely blew me away. I think it was the first truly multi-cultural piece of theatre I had seen, it told a great story full of humanity, humour and more theatre spectacle than I believe I will ever see again. \n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS: \n…hard, there are too many places I haven’t seen and want to. As a child I always dreamed of diving off the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, I would still like to do this although fear for its destruction from tourism. I’d also like to travel across India. I love travel programmes.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6waxxs4ebbk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.27704,55.83461]}},{"properties":{"name":"North Edinburgh Arts Centre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\">Tagtheatre</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6waxxzpb563"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.25122,55.96872]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paisley Arts Centre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\">Tagtheatre</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6waxy03mamt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.42569,55.84451]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palace Theatre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\">Tagtheatre</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Kilmarnock<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6waxxypgwje"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.499217,55.609966]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, Skye","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\">Tagtheatre</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6waxxsrtgd8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.85365,57.11131]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steven McLeish (YOUNG Co.)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\">Tagtheatre</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/06/2/HollywoodSign.jpg\">I live in small town, Kilwinning and I have just finished college (HND Acting &amp; performance) and now I am an actor looking for work.\n\nAGE:19\n\nMY FAVOURITE THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD IS:\nActing, my friend, girlfriend and my family and having fun\n\nMY DREAM COLLABORATOR IS:\nWould be James Cagney because he is an amazing actor and I would like to learn how he got so good.\n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS:\nHollywood cause I think I would like the lifestyle and would love to work as a actor there.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6waxxutwvr7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.71076,55.6539]}},{"properties":{"name":"TAG's old base on Albion Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\">Tagtheatre</a>TAG was based in this wacky building for a number of years.
