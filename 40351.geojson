Views of the Pacific Ocean can be seen along the entire trail.\r\n\r\nYou start on the dirt path on the south side of the park. The first quarter mile is flat and offers great views inland of Saddleback Mountain and Aliso Viejo.\r\n\r\nPicnic tables can be found about every 100 feet - ideal spots for lunch or even a quiet place to read.\r\n\r\nPlaques along the trail also identify the local vegetation. Look for summer holly and laurel sumac along the way.\r\n\r\nThe trail seems to end at a concrete platform. A dirt trail to the left of the platform continues toward Aliso Peak. The trail drops down a steep hill with loose rocks and dirt along this ridge. Watch your step.\r\n\r\nAfter you scoot alongside a residential road and farther down the hill, you suddenly begin a short and steep climb toward Aliso Peak, which stands a not-so-towering 600 feet.\r\n\r\nThe final 20 feet to the peak is extremely steep. Hikers without hiking shoes can use the wooden steps on the right side of the trail.\r\n\r\nViews of South Laguna to the south and Aliso Beach and the Aliso Creek Golf Course to the immediate north are unadulterated, unlike the views from other coastal bluffs that are spoiled by cell-phone towers and power lines. A bench at the peak is a perfect place to sit and soak in the views of the ocean, or cuddle up for a special moment with your hiking partner.\r\n\r\nTime for the hard part - hiking back up 800 feet to your car.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jibm34rwkh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.73344,33.51152]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bench at the top of Chaparral Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> There\\'s a trail behind Bonita Canyon School, in Chaparral Park, that leads to the top of the hill.

Bommer Canyon is located off Shady Canyon, and is adjacent to the Turtle Rock Community Park and Nature Center. It’s an important preservation area for many local plants and wildlife, including several endangered species.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a volleyball court, horseshoe pit and fire ring, Bommer Canyon provides a picturesque surrounding for family outings. According to Amy Litton, senior naturalist and lead staff/coordinator for the holiday campouts, it’s a great time to be had by all.\r\n\r\n“We offer campers a safe, supervised experience close to home. Campers are invited to use the group barbecue (charcoal provided), participate in evening and morning hikes, create a craft, enjoy an Open Space slide show, and make S’mores by the campfire while singing campfire songs,” Litton said.\r\n\r\nAnd if campers don’t want to do any of the above, they may sit back and listen to the birds or play horseshoes or volleyball.\r\n\r\nFamilies may begin pitching their tents at 3 p.m. Saturday for an overnight adventure, complete with campfire songs and stories, docent-led nature walks, and a slideshow featuring native wildlife, plants and history of the camp.\r\n\r\nFor more info, call (949) 724-6738. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jiblzbgcdn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.79236,33.60871]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bridge at Bolsa Chica","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/quiet1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/P8111159.JPG\">PCH between Warner and Seacli, Huntington Beach, CAWhen you walk the wooden bridge over the saltwater marsh, you find yourself in the company of various bird species and folks who enjoy watching and photographing them.

The line stretches out the door of the little house practically from the minute they open until the pies are all gone. And let this be a warning: sometimes the pies are gone before closing. Get there before 5 p.m. if you want to take something home.\nOn the off-season, pies are made with Washington apples. During the fall harvest, all available local apples go into the pies too.\n\nThere are several tables inside the restaurant and a few outside, and all are in high demand. With your warm slice, ask for vanilla or cinnamon ice cream, cheddar cheese or whipped cream. There is also good coffee and hot chocolate for sale - just the thing ward off that seasonal nip in the air. - SignOn San Diego<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jibme1h2wo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.602748,33.078652]}},{"properties":{"name":"Laguna Coast Wilderness Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/card_laguna_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/lagunawilderness2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/lagunaroad.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/lagunawilderness_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 20101 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach, CA 92651 From wind-buffeted bluffs to challenging trails, Laguna Coast Wilderness Park offers a rich recreational menu for walker, hikers, mountain-bikers and equestrians.
