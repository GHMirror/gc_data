It was built from a Victorian Kit  in the Balloon Style (the vertical wall studs are 24ft long, from foundation to roof.)  The woman who lived here before had gathered a lot of great historical details about the work that had been done on it in the last 60 or so years.  We hope to keep up the tradition.  The Variety of fruit growing on the small plot is an amazing bonus, raspberries, 2 kinds of pear, the nieghborhood\\'s oldest living cherry tree, and a double apple tree (that doesn\\'t seem to get polinated).  The best part about this house are the 10 foot ceilings upstairs, the gigantic kitchen (maybe redone in the 60s?) and the 2 fireplaces!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mlgi47iq7w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.699663,45.529133]}},{"properties":{"name":"Child's Play Toystore","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/fdde1b93cd6b5ad07a18a61c9e31135d.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Great NW toys store, lots of quality stuff.

He threw a huge tantrum on the first day, so bad that we wondered if we were going to be able to keep making him go. It was infuriating. He kept saying that the camp was boring.\n\nOf course he ended up having a great time. The second day was a field trip to a huge park and the third day both the firemen and the zookeeper came to camp. The zookeeper brought a boa constrictor and a hedgehog, among other creatures. After that he really couldn\\'t keep insisting that camp was boring!\n\nThey also have a bouncy castle at this camp and went on a field trip to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.\n\nEmiko is at this camp with Vigo. The conselors say they are adorable together. Emiko is really into learning Hebrew and keeps educating us about it. \n\nThe camp counselors are an eclectic group of teenagers, all of whom seem really interesting and fun. They begin and end camp with a song circle, where one of the counselors plays guitar.\n\nYesterday, Vigo told me that he\\'s sad Jewish Center Camp is going to be over and he wishes he could keep going there. That\\'s a relief, since he cried and cried and cried every day the first week I dropped him off.\n\nWe haven\\'t had much experience with Vigo being so upset at drop off before. Now I know how it feels to leave your kid screaming your name at the door of the day camp while you drive off to work. It\\'s a crummy cocktail of anger, guilt, and sadness. Still, it\\'s interesting to go through new things and I know Vigo has been discovering new emotions in himself these past few weeks, too.\n\nI hope that the activity I have lined up for him next week will be easier for him to ease into.\n\nAugust 7-18, two-week adventure camp. \n65 both weeks total.\n\n9am-4pm\n\nswimming, crafts, etc.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mlgi0klp2t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.702476,45.476146]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kid Kamp ages 5-10, August 21-25","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/victory.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/DSC02874.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 2200 SW Cedar Hills Bvd Portland, OR503 646 4106\nask for Julia\n\n10 am- 6pm\n10/ wk non-members (30)\n85/wk members (55)\n\nAug 7-11 under sea\nAug 14-18 space\nAug 21-25 Australia\n\nswimming every day\ntennis lessons\nyoga\naerobics\ngroup swim lesson on fridays<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mlgi47m4cj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.800714,45.503839]}},{"properties":{"name":"Laurelhurst Park","description":"Posted by System<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55241410@N00/118579788/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/53/118579788_b129afef01_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63242143@N00/2113508/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/2/2113508_5f9b07636a_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> , , ORLaurelhurst Park <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mlgi0on4xa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.625277,45.520833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mio Gelato Moustache","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/193723160_da00cc33ae.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> nw 23rd and kearney, portland, orTabor eating gelato from the cup as if it were a cone.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mlgi6hbtij"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698491,45.529005]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oregon Zoo","description":"Posted by Lxk184<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/portlandzoo.jpg\">4001 Southwest Canyon Road, Portland, OR, 97221Every time I go to a new city, I try to visit the local zoo.  \\'Cause I\\'m cool like that.

Fun swimming lessons would have distracted him. On the last day of his resistance, he was even closing his eyes and plugging his ears to not be distracted by the fun happening so close to him. The second week was a lot better. He got in the pool most days and really, really enjoyed himself.
