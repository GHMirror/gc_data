We found a little hole in the wall place called Acropolis Pizza.  Kinda scary looking on the outside, but wonderful food and people on the inside.  \r\n\r\nPizza and Greek/Italian food.  We went in expecting to order pizza, ended up getting things like dolmas and spanikopita instead.  Everything was great.  \r\n\r\nAnd it was the kind of place where a regular would shout into the kitchen, \"Hey Mary, I\\'m actually ordering something off the menu for once!\"  We met the owners, Mary and (I think) George.  A nice married couple who go back to the old country every year or so.

We stumbled on an \"Art in the Park\" kind of festival, walked around, ate roasted corn on the cob, and watched the river for a while.  When we were ready to leave, we realized we kinda needed to get back home.  So we declared our honeymoon over, hopped on the interstate and headed back to Alabama.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcydvm88cg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.015686,33.449777]}},{"properties":{"name":"Charleston","description":"Posted by SreiszWe had thought about heading towards Georgia from Charlotte, but we saw how close we were to the coast and decided to head for Charleston instead.  If Charlotte was our one and only bust, Charleston was the unexpected surprise of the trip.  No end to the great food, great people, historic houses, nice walks and neat shops.  This is just a place holder until I can spend more time browsing the map and finding all the neat things we did there.\r\n\r\nWe have gone back to Charleston once since our honeymoon, and are planning another trip in the near future.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcye4guefk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.93412,32.778615]}},{"properties":{"name":"Charlotte","description":"Posted by SreiszNo offense to the folks in Charlotte, but for us, it was our one and only bust.\r\nI have no doubt that a place as big as Charlotte has plenty for the wandering tourist to see and do, but we somehow missed it all.

We realized we were within driving distance of one of the prettiest places in the Southeast.  Full of hiking trails, waterfalls, overlooks and the like.  And since the tent we brought was a 6\\'x9\\' canvas wedge, we got some odd looks from the other campers, but we also weren\\'t baked out of our tent at 6 in the morning<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcydvmwnad"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.338192,35.651717]}},{"properties":{"name":"Historic Jonesborough","description":"Posted by SreiszWe were headed to Johnson City, and realized we were going to go straight through the oldest permanent settlement in Tennessee.  So we absolutely had to stop.  We walked around all the old houses, each with a rich history of early American life.

There\\'s even some ancient Egyptian (I think) brick with some grafitti from someone in the Roman Legion.  \r\n\r\nAlso, a great restaurant called Cafe Pacific.  When we showed up, we realized that we were terribly underdressed, and that this was the kind of place that expects reservations.  But we explained that we were passing through and didn\\'t know they existed before today.  They were terribly nice, and the food was fantastic.\r\n\r\nMore on both when I have time to find them individually on the map<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcydtd6hnd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.372055,36.331722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Knoxville","description":"Posted by SreiszNot much to report here.
