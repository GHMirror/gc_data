There are loads of cities in Indiana named after foreign countries and cities. Same goes for Ohio, as it turns out. Why spend hundreds of dollars and sit on an airplane for 9 hours just to go to Poland? Poland was practically in my backyard. And even better, I could hit Poland, Cuba and Denmark all in the same day! With this impeccable logic, I headed out on my first trip around the world. But then I moved to Oregon. Nonetheless, this is a work in process. I still have a couple more photos to add and tons and tons of places. Perhaps someone out there could lend a hand and help me complete my project.

This particular Cuba is in Owen County, and is a bit of a ghost town. Actually, it probably never had much of a night life. Cuba was founded in 1851 and originally called Santa Fe. Later the same year it had its own post office under the Cuba name. In 1895, Cuba busted into the triple digits, with a population of 118. Sadly, by the look of things, those 118 took off or failed to procreate as I saw no inhabitants or houses at all. The post office closed in 1909. In any case, today there\\'s an old (though still active) Baptist Church, a cemetary, and some kind of shooting range compound (don\\'t know if still active - didn\\'t stick around to find out). \n\nThe distance between Cuba, Owen County, IN and Havana, Cuba, as the crow flies, is 1,149 miles.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a658xgdlsy6u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.800876,39.378165]}},{"properties":{"name":"Denmark","description":"Posted by Dweston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/bb56fc2c2850944343e87566b5a623bc.jpg\">Glorious Denmark.

They have a gas station, their own post office, a chapel (circa 1850), a cemetery, and a bat sanctuary. Local Poles informed me that the old Poland Hardware building (circa early 1900s) houses a large colony of a protected bat species. None of them could tell me what kind of bats they were, but one young man managed an excellent bat imitation.\n\nAside from bat talk, citizens of Poland seemed preoccupied with the activities of area police officers. When I walked up to Hillman\\'s Market, a small gas station/food shack, there was a sheriff and various cops on the porch talking to a group of teens. Something about someone reporting a woman driving around waving a shotgun. I later talked to an anonymous source who told me that the feuding Poles stir up a lot of trouble in Clay County. Travelers beware.\n\nBack in time: Poland was founded in 1841 and had a population of 178 in 1895. One of the locals I talked to estimated the current population at 250, though the state counts way more (6,500), including all the areas served by the Poland (Polish?) post office.\n\nThe distance between Poland, IN and Warsaw, Poland, as the crow flies, is 4,776 miles.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a658xg76whtj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.951394,39.444255]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/3348","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dweston","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dweston","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/3348","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":14,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=3348,platial:user=dweston","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44394}
