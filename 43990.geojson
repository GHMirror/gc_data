The two-room Peacock Suite (,260 for a monthlong stay), in particular, is so chock-full of over-the-top 1950s furniture it feels like Liberace’s guest house on steroids. This and other suites come stocked with a collection of vintage nightgowns, robes, boudoir slippers, costume jewelry, fur stoles and wigs so you can play dress-up and lounge about languidly, double martini in hand, as Perry Como serenades you on the vintage LP player.

So much like me, in fact, that we could start a girl-gang.  That\\'s what Beauty Sleep is essentially all about...  a private themed residence where you can feel pretty and safe.\nTHE PLACE:\nFormerly a huge house split up into 4 separate apartments. In the heart of Belmont/Hawthorne district and walking distance to everything. I\\'ve converted the main floor into common space that everyone can enjoy. So you get the best of both worlds - privacy, minimal sharing of bathrooms/kitchens, and lots of super-fun common space.  A room for your every whim, every inclination.  Why not sing, dance, hula-hoop and glue things to other things!  \nTHE ROOMS:\nEvery bedroom (and there are 4 for rent weekly, monthly,... whatever you desire) has a princess bed of one sort or another.  You deserve the canopy bed!  One is royal purple, another precious pink, the other ruby red, and then there\\'s sophisticated seafoam.  Your room is trimmed in gold with lots of big-eyed pictures and mirrors for you to look at and kiss.\n***COMMON SPACE***\nLadie\\'s Lounge, office/craft room, dancefloor with pro effects lights, tiki bar, music room/stage, theater with DLP projector. Space to sip wine and fold origami or knit and talk about boys.  A place to hang out while trying on vintage shoes or reading 1950\\'s Family Circle magazines.  Do anything your little golden heart desires.  Rates vary depending on length of your stay, the room, and other options.

A stately crystal chandelier hangs above the bar, imparting a sense of Old World elegance, while a suite of deconstructionist-chic chandeliers hangs nearby as a perfect counterbalance—clear Plexiglas and polished nickel glowing red on the inside. Designed by Italian maestro Bruno Rainaldi for the Florence-based design house Terzani, these ultra-cool chandeliers meld postmodern rigor with pure romantic whimsy. District’s designer, Bryce Amato, says: “The lighting is the whole inspiration for the space…. Combining old elements with new things adds character and brings up questions about memories and nostalgia.” If you want one of these Plexi beaut’s for your own lounge, Amato sells them for a ,250 a pop at <a href=\"http://amatojohnsondesign.com\">Amato Johnson Design.</a>)\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67rcpi5u6vc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.683195,45.524608]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dots Cafe","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.wweek.com\" href=\"http://www.wweek.com\">Willametteweek</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/08/2/11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> 2521 SE Clinton St, PORTLAND, OR, 97202-1238Sure, the black velvet paintings, multicolored pendant lights, and to-die-for Grilled Cheese Deluxe get most of the ink when we write about this quintessentially Portland bar-restaurant, but don’t forget about the wallpaper.

The origins of this sculpture are obscure, but its contours are hard to miss: a 15-foot forearm and hand, its fingers raised in the Vitarka Mudra position of Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Made out of fiberglass, the giant hand is simultaneously quaint and monumental—in a Burning Man kind of way. As you drive by during the middle of a stressful day, it seems to say: “Stop! Breathe!

Created 84 years ago by sculptor Emmanuel Fremiet, the old bronze girl looks all the more glamorous for her 24-karat gilding, which was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts as well as private and corporate donors. Is the bright luster decadent? Hell yeah! The economy has tanked, gas is through the ceiling, and we’ll all be lucky if we can afford a Thanksgiving turkey—which means the perfect aesthetic antidote is gold: oodles of it!

Architect Marvin Witt, 81, has been building commercial and industrial spaces in Portland since 1958, and he’s still working. Of the building’s signature steel gate, Witt says: “We were looking for something that would give the building a kind of recognition, and an entryway is important. How do you make an entry that says, ‘Come in, come through, right this way’? So we were looking for something decorative and interesting in that arched shape, and it just sort of happened.”\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67rcpghi9sy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.676892,45.49203]}},{"properties":{"name":"M Financial Plaza","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.wweek.com\" href=\"http://www.wweek.com\">Willametteweek</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/08/2/02.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Now this is corporate cool: Barcelona chairs and sofas by Mies van der Rohe set a sophisticated tone in the soaring lobby of mega-money firm M Financial Group HQ, just east of P.F.

Look up: Those are Artichoke Pendants by the late Danish designer Poul Henningsen dangling from the high ceilings. As the name suggests, the pendants resemble the unfolding leaves of an abstracted artichoke.

Just south of the downtown Safeway, the building, by Myhre Group Architects, glitters green, orange, and teal, its multicolored cubes stacked one atop the other. Gloriously Dutch-looking, this building is like a 21st-century vertical version of the classic Rietveld Schröder House in Utrecht.

The sliced conical sculpture that is its visual signature resembles an abstracted teepee. Local architecture firm StastnyBrun worked with Albuquerque architect David Sloan to combine Klickitat basket motifs in the center’s brick patterns with Long Narrows petroglyphs in the rusted steel columns. Outside the building’s west wing is a marker pole, designed by local treasures Lillian Pitt and Ken Mackintosh, which illustrates the life cycle of the salmon. In architecture at large, eclecticism all too often equals mishmash, but not here.
