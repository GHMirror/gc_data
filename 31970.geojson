In many ways the city has not recovered from the idea that this happened here in enlightened and progressive Portland. \r\nMulugeta Seraw was an Ethiopian student who went to the United States to attend college and was killed in 1988 in Portland, Oregon by a racist skinhead gang, which consisted of Ken \"Death\" Mieske, Kyle Brewster, and Steve Strasser, who were linked to White Aryan Resistance. Seraw was killed on Southeast 31st Avenue, near his apartment. \r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1988, a group of racists known as East Side White Pride brutally beat Seraw with a bat and left him in a puddle of his own blood. Seraw died in the early-morning hours of the following day. The murder was one of the most shocking crimes in Portland history. In response, hundreds of people turned out for rallies against racism. The three men who beat Seraw to death were arrested and, in 1990, Mieske was convicted of first-degree murder and Brewster and Strasser of manslaughter and assault. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64lf04v9u94"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.63304,45.5206]}},{"properties":{"name":"McDonalds I worked at during Summer of 98","description":"Posted by Gonzag80511 W 27th St, Scottsbluff, 69361 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64lf0146f8z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.670125,41.87385]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Zoo Structures Still Visable","description":"Posted by Gonzag80Dispite being removed to a far off section of the park 50 years ago, traces of the old zoo can be seen along this dirt trail above the roadway.
