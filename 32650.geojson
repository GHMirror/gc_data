Oh, and there\\'s some serious coffee being served at this modernesque interpretation of a coffee house. Your choice of kooky left or right-turn designs on your bum at the long shared table. The 4 seats pushed into the corner give you court-side seats to the busy barristas working the 4 bean grinding machines and spitting out fine grains to yield smooth brews that coat your mouth and tongue with alluring flavours. The granola trifle was very filling for a sunday morning, and the brownies are the temptation for a return visit.

No worries having spare time in hand, some well-brewed coffee will help pass your newspaper time. Fluffy croissants with cherry compote or orange jam, neither too buttery nor too soft. A solid veal sausage roll for .50 served with home-made tomato condiment.

It\\'s not too late but sufficiently dark enough not to want to walk into a proper sit-down restaurant. And you don\\'t have much cash left. Want a casual place? Try Dumplings Plus.\n\nDon\\'t worry, no fears and risk of food poisoning, this is no Shanghai Dumpling (Cammy\\'s). Right along Swanston St, pick any of the dumplings on the first page of their menu and you\\'re stomach will be filled good. Try the lamb wrap, or the red bean pancake to finish. They make a mean bowl of noodles, as well as a stir-fry 年糕. \n\nThey do dishes as well, but I have yet to try them. Stick with the tried and tested dumplings which I give one thumb up.

I was sufficiently impressed on my introductory lunch to have this pop into my mind when called for an early Sunday evening dinner. I\\'d recommend calling ahead for a reservation as there are more potential diners than there are seats. \n\nThis return visit was initially marked by by the nonchalant attitude of a single waiter who decided that 2 menus were sufficient for 4 separate diners on a share table. We decided that walking up and grabbing the menus ourselves were quicker. On this occasion, I over-ruled by annoyance and heeded my hunger by ordering the unmissable 小龙包. The skin wasn\\'t too thin such that it broke when you picked it up, it was of a consistent thickness, and steamed almost to perfection with juicy minced pork and tasty juices inside. On the down-side, the vinegar and ginger condiment was paltry and you\\'d probably need to ask for 3x the served amount. \n\nPassing on the pan-fried 锅帖 on this occasion,  the 云吞 in chilli dressing did not disappoint. Afterwhich, we had mapo tofu and black-pepper beef slice stir-fry with rice, the former being quite generous in portion.\n\nThis place isn\\'t associated with the price one would attached to dumpling houses. However, you get what you pay for in terms of non-greasy, more refined cooking. Perhaps the greatly-needing-improvement service and the cramped spacing provides some element of the traditional Cammy\\'s styled dumpling eatery.
