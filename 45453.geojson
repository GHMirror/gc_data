It was March 1992, and the experience proved fortuitous - I met a cute Columbia University grad student from Peru, and we wandered back to his place. It was never so easy to walk up to a stranger and buy him a beer, probably because I didn\\'t know any better. His name was Andreas, and I never saw him again.\r\n\r\nMy friend Bob had taken me to the bar, thinking I was straight and merely being a good sport to go with him. When I told Bob I was leaving with this new friend, he grabbed my shoulder in a panic and asked if I understood exactly *what* the guy had in mind. I assured Bob that I knew exactly what I was in for (or at least hoped I was in for), and so began my sordid life of gay-bar-hopping. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cbv4apo1at"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.976386,40.781186]}},{"properties":{"name":"Giant Rusty Water Tower","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Easy to climb till you get to the vertical ladder part and you\\'re already 75 feet up.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cbv4cxnbc5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.95848,40.728877]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gstaad","description":"Posted by System43 W 26th St, New York, NYGstaad (212) 683-1440<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cbv4f8ypn4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.989844,40.74431]}},{"properties":{"name":"Half sunk ships in Greek Harbor - (zoom in satellite view)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/38/113209304_b939d5a7f9_o.jpg\">GreeceThere tremendously large ships just seem to be sitting around waiting to sink.
