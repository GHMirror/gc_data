For a small fee, there\\'s a nice little parking lot to keep your car in that puts you right on the Jedediah Smith Rec. Trail. Theoretically, you could also park your car on a neighborhood street just a little farther away... Not that I\\'m suggesting that.\nAnyway, this may be the best place for Sacramento area birdwatching that I\\'ve been to. The river is beautiful, and depending on the season, you can sometimes travel on foot to wooded juts of land that are islands much of the time. This is also a good place for native plant study.\nIn the evening, this place is thick with deer.

It was blended smooth with ice and sweetened to perfection! The boba were chewy and sweet, just like they should be.\n\nAlso got the almond soy milk with boba... not my favorite. The artificial almond flavor didn\\'t sit well with me.\n\nI got some food while I was there, too. Luckily, there were plenty of vegan options for me. The sea weed salad with bean sprouts in garlic and vinegar sauce: fantastic! And the dry bean curd (slightly stinky tofu) with Chinese parsley (a.k.a. cilantro) and peanut? Ditto!
