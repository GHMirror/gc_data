I can\\'t remember exactly where I was, but it was around there..  Anyway, I was driving to get a friend of mine when I realized that there was a bunch of what looked like saran wrap wrapped from one sign two another on opposite sides of the road.  Since it was blocking the road, I had to stop..  At first I thought, what the hell?  And then I looked in the mirror and saw a few guys running up behind my car towards me.  I then realized that I was caught in the middle of quite a ridiculous and elaborate, yet incredibly unique car-jacking attempt.  Luckily I was able to back up quickly and get the hell out of there before they got to me.  But seriously, who would have thought of that idea?

The planning part of my move was not very strong: I had never been to Portland, I didn\\'t have a job in Portland, I had barely enough money to get there, there were concerns as to whether or not my car would make it, etc.  Anyhow, the point being that my plans were quite fragile.  Also at the time I didn\\'t have car insurance.  The fine for this is quite hefty (in excess of ,000 I believe), and they can tow your car if they really want to be mean about it.  When the cop pulled me over I thought my plans were done for, and I was pretty angry about it.  The first thing that cops usually do when they pull you over of course is, \"license/registration/proof of insurance.\"  This cop said, \"why did you run that red light?\"  me: \"i didnt.\"  her: \"yes you did.\"  me: \"no i didnt.\"  She then asked if I had been drinking, I said no.  Then she told me to be safe on the road and left.  She didn\\'t even ask for my driver\\'s license!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bo45mle04a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.994371,33.479563]}},{"properties":{"name":"Almost drove off a cliff here","description":"Posted by Wept<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/7088ac7515bbabaf4ca4bc443086a091.jpg\">near california/or borderI think these are called the siskiyou mountains.  I was driving up to Portland from Phoenix and once we hit these mountain ranges, it was unbelievably foggy.  I couldn\\'t see more than 2 to 3 feet in front of my car, if that.  All I could hear were the noises of trucks surrounding me.  I tried to follow the lines as best as I could see them in the road, but apparently I was following on the wrong side of the line.  I saw that I was about to run into a road sign, stopped, and realized that just after the road sign was a very steep drop off.  Thank god for road signs!  After a while we were able to make it back onto the road and I followed inbetween two trucks that I was able to find via sound and then via their brake lights, and they guided us down through the mountains.  It was very dark, very foggy, very scary, and I was very tired.  I would recommend not going through this mountain pass 1) during the winter 2) at night, in winter or otherwise, or 3) when you are tired.  Soon after you clear the mountains, you get around the Myrtle Beach area which is one of the most beautiful areas of Oregon in my opinion.  It is a nice consolation prize.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bo4583a9cr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.437134,41.446844]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bicyclist tried to break into my car and kill me","description":"Posted by Wept<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/d99df312055e306aa0f9486be45ed28f.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 6th &amp; spring, seattle, waI was at a red light, he rode his bike through traffic going the opposite way.
