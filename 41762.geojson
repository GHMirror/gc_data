Take two of my friends, who live in the same multi student house.  The one girl lives in Maryland, the boy\\'s grandmother lives not too far away.  For break, he wanted to go visit, and the girl offered him a ride.  I was also offered a ride to my house, which is halfway there.  This way, I got home, and they had  a free place to sleep overnight.  Well, the plans had been made for several weeks to do this.  The girl\\'s parents had figured out gas costs roundtrip, and had asked the boy if he would pitch in something, since he was just riding.  He agreed.  But when he was told what the girl\\'s parents had added up, he flipped.  They were only asking for 0 for gas roundtrip.  Considering gas prices, and that roundtrip was equivalent to a full 24 hours, plus the extra several hours the girl would have to go to take him to his grandmother\\'s, it wasn\\'t all that bad.  He was very mad about it, but he was still planning to come.  The plan was to leave friday before break, right after my last class of the day.  This was the plan until about noon that day.  He goes up to the girl while she is working, and says that he got a train ticket.  Just like that.  The very day of the trip, and he pulls out, to travel more expensively, and longer.  In what way does that make sense?  Now, since they still live in the same house, things are going to be ackward.  The girl doesn\\'t fully know why he pulled out, and now she is completely confused as to what he is going to do.  And it will be hard to avoid.

Megan and Her Frustrations at Wal-mart","description":"Posted by AndybrdIt is the first Sunday of Spring Break, and five friends are up and getting ready to drive down to Virginia for a week.  They are currently in Ohio.  They get up, have breakfast, dress, re-pack the car, and are ready to leave.  There are two cars.  The reason for this with only five people is that one of the girls, Megan, will be driving home to North Carolina for the second week, while the others, (Mike, Stephen, Andrea, and Katelyn), will be returning to the north in various places.  \n        At about nine in the morning, all the people are in the cars, ready to go.  There is a decent covering of snow on the ground, and all are hopeful for warmer weather.  The cars make it down one short and sloped road, and proceed up the other when the first car starts to skid.  The road is very snowy.  All three girls are riding together.  The two get out to try and push the car, as does the one boy who is not driving.  They manage to get the car up the hill, but notice something that is possibly devastating.  There is a flat tire!  Eventually the group manages to pull into a nearby church parking lot.  They were not even a mile down the road, and disaster had already struck.\n        Well, the tire had to be changed.  Megan, who owned the car, only had a donut, so a place had to be found to fix the tire.  Being Sunday, the only place open was a Wal-Mart.  So, Mike changed the tire while everyone watched, since only one other had ever changed a tire before (and it was not the other guy in the group), and then the group moved to the Wal-Mart, carefully and slowly. While Mike was changing the tire, he didn\\'t really listen to the others.  He said \"I know what I am doing,\" even though several of the people said \"You are putting the bolts on backwards.\"  Eventually he realized what he was doing wrong, listened to the smart people, and the group was on its way.\nOnce there, the group found out that the tire and brake place in this Super Wal-Mart had a long wait.  Not only had there been a flat tire, but also now the slightly irritated group had to wait an unknown number of hours. Megan also had a broken headlight.  With that, she broke.  Well, not entirely.  Her break down actually waited until she called her mother to tell her what happened.  While on the phone, her frustration sprung forth, and she cried.  Who better to vent to than one’s parents, after all.  Once that was done, the group tried to figure out how to keep themselves occupied, and tried to not worry about getting to Virginia before it was too late to check-in at the condo they would be staying in.  And when one is in a super shopping center, it is not all that hard to keep one’s self entertained.\n        Or is it?  This little group learned that there is only so much to look at when none are in the mood to shop.  Some looking around was accomplished, but little was bought.  There really seemed to be nothing to do.  Then again, it was Ohio.  Sometimes, there really isn’t anything to do there.  As a result, the group ended up teaching Stephen how to play rummy.  Eventually, three hours were wiled away, and the tire was fixed.  Megan was able to get over most of her frustration, and this sad little group once again spent precious college life hours in a Wal-Mart.  Just goes to show that you can’t really escape that store, even if it is a flat tire that takes you there.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ndde8bnx2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.7799,41.09798]}},{"properties":{"name":"2. Soap Box Woman","description":"Posted by AndybrdThe first day of the trip, and the group is in Colonial Williamsburg, the one time capital of the state of Virginia, and current site of a living history museum. Here they explore the town, and see what they can see. Much is interesting, but little is odd. Except for one woman. She is not dressed in period clothing, suggesting that she does not work there. She is right outside the old Capitol, the original building in which many governmental decisions were made. She stands there, wearing a bright blue jacket, talking to another person. Suddenly, she stands on a box, and though few people are around, and only one person is paying her any attention, she starts a speech. The voice with which she speaks carries across the field next to the building, authoritative and knowing. Yet no one was listening to her, except for the man with whom she had been speaking. Here she is, on top of her soapbox, and the group is just walking away, while many others simply ignore her. She doesn’t speak for long, which adds to the idea that she was just practicing, but for what, who knows? The place is full of history, with many people on soapboxes, and she may have been preparing to be another, though there was no point. Hearing her was just out of place, especially with the town and the reasons for which the group was there. There was no reason for a statement here, and yet she was preparing to make one. Guess that you never really know what to expect, especially in a living history museum.

Stephen's Driving Skills","description":"Posted by AndybrdIt is now the third full day of the trip. The group managed to make it to Virginia without further mishap, and with time to check into their rooms. A day was spent in Williamsburg, and another of random shopping and mini golf. Katelyn froze that night, since it was chilly, but she has a habit of being cold. Stephen, who had the better car, and no recent flat tires, had been driving all week. He really doesn’t mind. In fact, he preferred to drive over anyone else, since it was his car. He is a decent driver, though can sometimes enjoy going allover the place.\nThe day started kind of gray, but was not overly wet. A few good hours had been spent exploring Jamestown, and the fort that had once been there. Now the group had moved onto Yorktown, that historic battle-site that changed the course of history. The group arrived there, went into the  visitor’s center, and participated in a short walking tour of the immediate field. Here, they learned of a driving tour. It is one that people can take on their own, following signs to important parts of the battle field. All in the group became excited, and decided to do it. Everyone piled into the car, and started. The first stop had a sign, which Mike read, and a short drive area. No one knew what was done there.  \"Come on, Stephen, there might be something there to see.\" encouraged Megan. He had already partially turned around, but the others put in their voices with Megan\\'s, so he did a really quick loop, and slightly sped down it to find that it was just a turn around area. He turned around, and drove onto the next informative sign. The trail takes visitors through wooded areas, where the road in places is only one lane, and can be rather winding. Stephen, deciding to make things more interesting, drives somewhat erratically down parts of the road. He even did some of those irritating little stop-and-gos, where he just hit the break so that the car jerked.  It was nothing too seriously bad, but enough to make sure that we were awake. After enough \"acks!!\" and \"Stop that!\" from people, especially the three girls in the back, Stephen finally let up on the sudden stops, though his driving continued erratically in other ways.\nHe zoomed between the signs, allowing all to have their chance at the reading at first. At one point, when Andrea was reading, the entire group just laughed, because the sign was long, and it was just funny.  The sign was just about a soldier that had set up in that area, but it went on and on. She read everything. Even the small print, with the \"Information provided by the Historical Preservation Group of Virginia and Yorktown.\"  When she got to that, someone shouted \"drive!\" and the car took off, cutting her reading in the middle of a pointless sentence.\n There were many signs along the trail, so Stephen decided to zip between them.  He was in a hurry, mainly because he was running out of gas. The car that is, not him personally. He needed to find a gas station. At one point, a wrong turn was made. Eventually, the group finished the little tour. Then they decided to enter the actual town of Yorktown, mainly to try and find a gas station. The problem was, there wasn’t one to be found, and Stephen got a little lost. He was getting frantic, and his driving was getting a little more erratic. He was taking some corners rather sharply, and ended up taking a longer route to a gas station than was necessary. This let the others in the car see some of the local foliage as it rushed by the window. Eventually he found gas and calmed down, and his driving returned to normal.\nDriving with Stephen is always interesting. He will take the scenic route, but will start going faster once he is ready to be finished. His driving allowed the group to experience Yorktown in a quick paced and sometimes gut wrenching way. Perhaps he was trying to recreate the heart-pounding adrenaline rush of a battle, in his own little homage to the place. That and he really wanted gas. Whatever his reasons for his driving, he definitely made visiting this place of war an experience.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddnxbgpr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.51119,37.23265]}},{"properties":{"name":"Big Brother","description":"Posted by AndybrdThe government is always watching, especially in the seat of power.  Though maybe they aren’t watching as much as they claim to be.  Sometimes, it is amazing what people can get away with when given incentive.  They can create a bit of shock and humor with only a little bit of permanent marker.  And of course, with defacing public property.\n        Here it is, the fourth day of the trip, and the group is in Washington D.C., the capitol of our country.  The group doesn’t have much time here, so they all decide to just go to the Mall.  They get off the subway, walk up to the capitol, find they can’t really get in, and then decide to hit one of the Smithsonian buildings.  Of course, now they need to walk back down the Mall.  They have to cross a few streets to get to the museum that they decide to explore.  At one such road, they are stopped, since the light is green for the cars, and not for pedestrians.  At this stop, someone notices a camera, and a sign pointing out the camera.  The interesting thing about this is not that a traffic camera is being pointed out, but that someone has written graffiti on the sign.  Written in black marker is the famous line “Big Brother is Watching,” along with 1984. That someone actually had the guts to write what many people are thinking, and that it is still up there is rather amazing.  With a government that is greatly trampling the rights and freedoms of the people, there is a sign that openly criticizes it, located in its heart.  And no one had taken it down.  A total stranger, by writing on that sign, has caught at least five people’s attention, and made them think while on Spring Break.  Just proves that some people can still speak up, even if it is anonymously.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddl9cjie"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.02394,38.89023]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brick Town","description":"Posted by AndybrdDowntown Valparaiso: the place where the past tries to manifest itself in a yuppie/country town.  THe buildings all have an older facade that is found in many small town downtowns, but with many of those facades with a new look to them.  Brick is also everywhere.  It adorns all but a few of the smaller and most recent buildings, giving the place a sharp and hard edge.  THe roads appear wide, but are actually narrow, and often one way roads.  THe city tries for such tight control of the traffic, suggesting a need for order and power in those in charge.\n  In the center of the  town is a large older building that looks like a courthouse.  But is it?  This is hard to tell since there is little on the building to signify it as such.  There is another building that is a main government building that could be the courthouse.  This building is off to the side, on a corner about two streets away from the center and near roads taht the average traveler has no real reason to take.  The city hall is bricked similar to the rest of the town, and sits on a corner of the central square.  Other then the street signs, including the massive amount of Do Not Enter signs that are everywhere, and the overly long stop lights, actual signs of an active government are hard to find.  One gets the impression of a hiding government and law enforcement, giving way to the idea that they are trying to stay away from the people of their own town.\n   Of course, the nature is very properly cared for and neatly trimmed, suggesting more government involvement, but all this says is that the people want the place to look nice.\n    Most of the noticeable buildings actually hold stores, boutiques, cafes, and restaurants.  Those that hold alternative businesses are discreet, and not so easy to identify.  THe town caters to the middle class yuppie.  And the older citizen.  Few of the people to be seen appeared overly young or in the least bit without money.  And the vast majority of the people are white.  If looking for a very racially intermingled town, then a traveler has come to the wrong place.  Granted, the fact that it was a rainy day meant that not many people were out and about, but there were enough for a person to asume that there would be at least a few non-caucasians in this town, but that was not so.  Valparaiso is a very homogenized place, and the area screams small town country.\n   Granted, it is a decent looking little town, and it was being viewed on a grey and bleak day.  Those kind of days can damper anyone\\'s warm feelings towards a place.  But this town had a feeling of falseness.  Just moving beyond the main road, and on the other roads of the square, and walker can see the oldness of some of the buildings, and the neglect.  It also becomes quite obvious that all the facades on the buildings that are new and shiny were just placed over the original, decaying buildings.  The town is guilded, and while it is a decent and safe place to walk for and afternoon (provided the weather behaves), it is not a place where someone who is culturally and politically aware should linger.  The atmosphere of the town just brings a person down.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddmnvtz1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05996,41.46772]}},{"properties":{"name":"Car Inspection","description":"Posted by AndybrdOn the final day of the trip, the little group decides to head to Virginia Beach.  This way, they get to see the ocean, not something common in the Midwest.  Of course, there is only so much to be done on a beach in March.  Especially when the temperature is only in the low fifties.  Something else was needed to attract the little group to this place.  What could that be, but a lighthouse.  Actually two, to be exact.  Not far down Virginia Beach is Cape Henry, were the settlers of Jamestown first landed.  Right near here was built a lighthouse.  It is actually the first public works building in America, though definitely not the oldest lighthouse.  And right next to it is a more recently built lighthouse.  This is something exciting, especially since several of the travelers had never been in a lighthouse.  The decision is made to go there.  The only problem is that the lighthouses are in the middle of an army base.  That meant that all weapons of mass destruction had to be left behind.\n        Luckily, the group didn’t have any, and the base is actually pretty easy to get on.  That may or may not be a good thing.  To enter, i.d.’s must be presented, and then the car must be given an inspection.  This is done by a group of security officers, who can very easily give people a hard time.  Fortunately, these men where in a good mood.  They readily made jokes, and did not succeed in scaring the group.  The older of the inspectors talked easily, and was very relaxed.  He even mentioned his wife a few times.  Of course, some of what he said was funny, which made the group smile.  Then another inspector kept asking why the people were smiling so much.  Part of it was probably nerves; part was just because it was an interesting experience.  The inspector’s were good-hearted, showing that there is some relaxation, even on an army base, but they were thorough, and did their job well, demonstrating that the army is not lax, and takes care when anyone gets near the base.  Even in a time of war, army personnel still show that they are just more people, who know how to do their jobs.  They didn’t miss a beat, even when Megan confused them by saying \"don\\'t take the pudding!\" (the lunch was in the trunk).  The inspectors replied with \"What pudding?\" and \"What are you talking about?\", but still continued their search.  Even near a beach, the military still does its job.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddeyxa78"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.99586,36.91531]}},{"properties":{"name":"Changing Scenery","description":"Posted by AndybrdI have been attending Valpo for almost four years now.  At times it feels like I have been here for an eternity, and sometimes it feels like I am brand new to campus.  First, there is the construction.  It seems that I have not passed a year here without seeing large vehicles on campus, creating big holes.  But it has been in a different spot every time.  My first year, the old library was where I went for my research, and the new library was only half done.  Since then, the library has switched places, there is an addition to another building, a radar is now on campus, and there is one of the biggest holes I have seen up close smack in the middle of everything.  It changes, and yet at the same time doesn\\'t.\n  I have been in several different dorms now, though this year I find myself back in the freshman dorms.  Luckily, I am on the first floor.  I started here on the forth, and have since lived on several different floors.  Who I roomed with has changed, and even the decorations that I put up have changed.  But I still have the same bedspread, the mass of books on my desk, and the same wish to simply sleep a few more hours.  I even have some of the same plants, though those have grown.  I also killed the fish that I had my freshman year.  So he was alive, and then he changed to dead.  And he is still dead.  Though of course, that wouldn\\'t change.  Unless fish can be raised from the dead.  Hmm.\n   Another thing here that changes is the weather, though it is always the same four seasons.  The amount of snow that falls differs, but it is always cold.  The campus can look wonderful in any season, though have the time it has been raining and looks like crap.  (Well, actually like mud, but that is not the point). My point is that some things don\\'t, and some things do, no matter how long anyone lives anywhere.  This campus is no exception, and it is always remarkable to watch the two things exist side by side.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddk93hla"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04208,41.46405]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dinner contemplations","description":"Posted by AndybrdWehrenberg.  One of several places on campus to eat, and to sit and talk.  You walk in, maybe put your stuff down at an empty table, the fight the crowd to get some food.  But what to eat?  There are choices on the main line, which is the same food at the Union, (though here it is a little more watered-down), or go to the other side line.  This line has the grill area, and the special hot line, serving different foods from the main line (though not always).  Of course, there is the salad bar, and the desert line, as well as a sandwich line.  The problem is, that except for a few items, the food on campus is all the same.  And once you have eaten one thing there, you\\'ve eaten just about everything there.  Why does campus food have to be so bland, and so uniform.  After four years, a person gets quite sick of the food here.  Unfortunately, one finds it hard to eat off campus, partially due to cost, partially due to transportation.  You are forced to eat the food made here, the over-priced, under spiced, repetitive food.  A study should be done to determine if this is a mark of all campuses across the country, or just Valpo.

Most nights, they have just sat and played some games, but on this night, there was something that interested them all.  In Colonial Williamsburg, Ghost Tours are given at night.  Ghosts tend to prevail in old places, and sometimes it is fun to be spooked.  \n        On these tours, there is a guide that leads a group around a small area, carrying a lantern, and telling stories about the “ghosts” in Williamsburg.  Certain locations have different stories, and the whole thing is done in fun.  The stories are believed by some to be true, but are not told to try and convince people that ghosts actually exist.  The tour was hardly spooky, except for one thing that made a few people jump: the cat.\n        It is near the beginning of the tour.  The guide has is partially through her first story, telling of the odd occurrences that happened in a specific house.  A large group sits, listening to her stories in the night.  There is not much noise, when suddenly a little bell is heard.  It is not part of the story.  The noise is coming closer to the group, and closer, when suddenly a cat comes out of the darkness, straight for the group.  The bell is just the noise from its collar.  It comes straight up to the group, and just wants some attention.  It goes through the group several times, until it gets bored.  As the guide continues her stories in a humorously spooky voice, the cat goes into nearby bushes, when people aren’t watching, and suddenly shakes some of the branches.  The cat seems to do this at a few key moments in the story, lending some extra surprise to the tales.  \n        The guide finishes the stories in that spot, and the group moves on.  At another location, near an old church, she talks about two little boys, whose ghosts are often seen.  As she is telling how the boys are often seen playing in the one road, where they run along up to the church, one of the group members spots a grey blur out of the corner of her eye.  She wonders, and looks…and sees that it is only the cat following the group.  Or at least, that is what is thought. \"I think I just saw the cat again\" she whispers to Stephen.  \"I didn\\'t\" he replied, as did the others.  No one else seems to have seen the cat.  In a place and time where there is great talk of spirits and the dead, one can never be sure what he/she is seeing.

This is especially true when someone is not comfortable or happy.  Katelyn was the main example here.  At the beach it was windy, and cold, since it was still winter.  Still, the five ate lunch on a bench on the boardwalk.  The girls were cold, though none so much as Katelyn.  She was not happy as a result, and let it be known.  She refused to go onto the sand and near the water, and just wanted to get inside.  Everyone else partially ignored her, which just made her mood worse.  As a result, while three of the other’s were frolicking in the sand, she and Andrea started up the boardwalk, with her leading the charge in a hurried and angry huff.  Katelyn didn’t even want to tell the other’s were she was headed, she just wanted to go.  The two were also keeping hold of Stephen’s drink, which she called him on her cell, said \"Your drink is by the stairs.  See it?  Good.  Bye.\", and left it by some of the stairs leading to the sand. This made Stephen upset.  Her actions brought the tension levels up, and let the group learn a little more about her.  When she is unhappy, even in a nice location, she will let it be known.  In this place, the wind turned her mood sour, and let tensions build between her and Stephen that were taken out by both on another member of the group.

Even if they tear it down when the new Union is finished, it will still be one of the places that has the greatest hold on my memory, and one of the biggest, though more subtle, parts of my college existence.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddfjr244"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04376,41.46249]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nature Issues","description":"Posted by Andybrd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> When a person looks around this campus, they may notice a few things.  The construction for one, or that all the buildings share the brick wall motif.  Something that more observant people may notice are trees, or rather, the lack there of.  This campus does not seem to put much into having a good amount of trees, and it seems that whenever we have some, they get torn down for some new construction.  We do have some, but who knows how long they will last in this place?\n   This issue was brought to my attention recently during the in class interviews.  I was conversing with Chris, and asking his opinion on this area, and one of the biggest concerns for him is the lack of nature.  With no trees, this place is almost like a \"barren wasteland.\"  And that is becoming more apparent with each day of construction.  \n   The lack of nature has had one good impact, at least on Chris.  It has led him to \"appreciate what (he) used to think as crap.\"  This was in reference to the area he came from.  Before coming to this area, he never noticed the hills, nor the abundance of nature in his home area.  But here, where the winds come rushing at you over flat lands with little in the way of nature to create breakers, you learn to appreciate a place that had more change in landscape, where you could not see the same land extending infront of you for miles.  Instead of a hilly place where what is beyond creates a mysterious adventure, shaded in nature\\'s beauty, we get to see everything, which is more than we wanted, and to find that what we see greatly lacks in green.  While this area is not completely bad, the geography could truly use some help.  I say, keep your new buildings and parking lots, and give me the trees, my paradise.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddqqzest"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03767,41.46424]}},{"properties":{"name":"Protestation and the Amazing Spinning White House","description":"Posted by AndybrdLater that day, the group finds itself outside of the White House, home of the President.  Here, there are important decisions made, and many people gather.  Tourists go to see it, bird’s poop on it, and politicians want to be in it.  It is the place where the loudest voice of the people resides, and where that person is separated from the people by a large black fence, cops, and armed secret service men.  People cannot easily get in, though many want their voices heard.  Those who try the hardest are sometimes the ones most ignored by the place.  These are the protestors.  Not just those who come up for marches, but those who actually set up camp outside and stay there, trying to take a stand.  There is one particular person, who has been there for a very long time.  He stands there, with a tent.  He speaks to those who question him, and tells them what he waits for.  He protests the war, the crimes committed against people, and encourages peace.  He has signs that call for an end to the violence, and that list facts about the wars that the U.S. has been involved in over the last few decades, especially the recent ones.  \n        He is across the street from the front of the White House, the side that is closest to the road.  On this side, Megan uses her digital camera as a video, and records randomness, including turning it around to make the White House spin.  While she does this she narrates: \"There are the people, and now the White House is going to turn upside down.  Weeee.\"  She shows her silliness in this, and then her seriousness, as she goes to ask the man what he is there for.  He tells her that he lost someone in the war, and waits for when the government will finally pull out.  He prays for those that have been lost, and those that have suffered because of our politics.  He is one of the voices against Bush’s war, and actually does something about it.  He has been in this spot for over a year, rarely leaving it.  His peaceful protesting demonstrates what this country is about, more than the buildings, the museums, the memorials, and everything else that has built up in the seat of power.  Waiting there takes courage and willpower, and the ability to stand up and speak.  This man is America, more than that man in the White House, and proves the diversity of thought in any city.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ndde8lf0w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.03665,38.90038]}},{"properties":{"name":"Statement in Blues","description":"Posted by AndybrdThese images are spectacular.  Aimee is always good at capturing people with her camera.  Every one of those images tells a story.  In the pre-Katrina images, there seems to be just so much more.  There is so much variety of color, so many people, costumes, and feathers.  On the contrary, the post-Katrina pictures have less people, less simple joy and fun, but more blue.  The blue comes so greatly from the Fema tarps, and the creative ways people have chosen to mock the group.  It is amazing how weather can cause such a great change in a celebration.  In the earlier images, it is all about having fun.  There is a sense of carefree life and joy in the images, and of a no-holds-barred way of life.  As one goes along in time, the subject of the images takes a complete change.  Where once there extravagant costumes that changed a person into something other, there are now costumes that have a noticeable politicalness to them.  People are no longer dressing to become the opposite of themselves, now they are dressing up to give opinions, to criticize the government and agencies, and to show the world tragedy in a joyous manner.  It is not just a release; a way of expanding wanton energy before Lent.  Mardi Gras seems to have changed to something charged more by pain and turmoil, with a wish to truly escape, but being unable to do so.  The people cannot change the reality of Katrina, so they embrace it, and weave it in to the story of the parade.  The mood in the pictures becomes so much more somber.  It lets people know that something tragic happened here, and the people are never going to forget it.  And the prevalence of the blue only adds to the emotions.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddn7kcch"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03968,41.46395]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Haunting of the Arts &amp; Psycho Building","description":"Posted by Andybrd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Can a place actually be haunted?  Or is there no such thing as ghost?  Many places on campus are reputed to be haunted: the basement of Alumni and Brandt, to name a few.  One tha few know about, but that many would not be surprised at is the haunting of the Arts and Psychology Building, or the Art &amp; Psycho building.  This place is a somewhat twisted building, designed and built by engineering students in the fifties, it houses offices for the two majors, as well as the studios and the rat lab.  Rooms and doors exist everywhere, and on the art side, some of the rooms are cavernous.  Others just highly exposed.  \n  At night, the building is an unnerving place.  Anyone can come from anywhere.  When there alone, the feeling of being watched pervades every mind.  Perhaps overly imaginative brains with more than a hint of paranoia are at work, or maybe there is something more...\n  Some claim to have seen something there.  One profesor, Michele Corazzo, says that there is a ghost in the building, and has actually seen it on occassion.  THe ghost, named George, is a friendly ghost, but a ghost the same.  His rumored existence makes the building all that more spooky.  There are some places out there that just hold a sense of the paranormal, and make many wonder. Or, they are just really good at messing with people\\'s heads.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddatnlxq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04856,41.46227]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Trouble with Dorms","description":"Posted by Andybrd<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddl1jxxc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04185,41.4658]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Trouble with Dorms","description":"Posted by AndybrdWhen attending college, most students live in university housing, which most of the time means dorms.  These places are not overly bad, though a little small in some cases.  The freshmen dorms tend to be the worst, with upper classmen in better living spaces.  Living in these, students can quickly meet people, make new friends, and just hone social skills.  These are good, but there are problems.  The main problems are the people who are not your friends.  Not necessarily enemie, but now friends.  Just all the other people whom you are forced to live with.  Among this group, are those who never seem to realize that they have to live with other people.  They are the ones who reak havoc, make the most noise, and create the most fines for everyone who lives around them.  Everyone deals with them, but never entirely knows who they are.  Right now, in the one dorm, there are several people on the third floor who create all kinds of trouble.  They vandalized the lounge, set off all the fire extinguishers several times, pour water into someone\\'s room, and also steal all the shower curtains from the comunal problems.  How are students supposed to learn when surrounded by these types of morons, who care nothing for their own education, and seek to just have a laugh, often at the expense of others.  These are the people that make dorm life terrible, creating suffering and many sleepless nights.  If only there was a way to make dorms less open for holigans.  Unfortunately, the trouble with dorms is that anyone lives in them, as long as they attend the school  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66nddq3v10j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04185,41.4658]}},{"properties":{"name":"weather and walking","description":"Posted by AndybrdThis road is not the easiest one to walk down in the winter.  The sidewalks are horrible, even in some of the best weather, but now, there is such a great risk of falling and dying.  On McIntyre Court, they do not clean the sidewalks, unless the owners of the houses decide to do so.  Normally this would not be a reason to complain, but it is a busy walkway for students.  At least for those who have to go to LaPorte for some reason.  So many people walk on it, that the snow becomes slush, and since no one salts this, it freezes as soon as the temperature drops, and then you have to walk on ice, which gets covered in more snow.  The sidewalk here is definitely not the nicest possible walk.\r\nAt least the views are not bad.  The homes on this street are actually decent looking houses.  There is one house on this street that has some interesting bushes.  The plants wrap around the house in a solid line.  This also seems to be one of the only places that has a cleaned sidewalk in front.  It is a nice relief, even if it is so brief, to be able to walk without mincing your steps or risking falling and ending your struggling life.  Sigh.  The biggest problem is that I like winter.  I love the snow.  But around here, it seems to turn to ice in no time at all.  It makes me not want to walk anywhere.  Unfortunately, that is my main form of transportation right now, since my bike lock is frozen.  The time to unfreeze it would not be long, but I am just too lazy to do so when I have the time.  So I walk, and this road is one that I must travel.
