At that time, it was a scrapyard, where the Doctor lived. The first shot was of a policeman with a torch in the fog, poking around outside the scrapyard - tracking through the gates into the yard and up to the Tardis (which must have seemed odd at the time - seeing a Police call box in a scrapyard). It\\'s very close to the BBC, so I\\'m sure that\\'s why they chose it. At some point it was redeveloped into flats.\nYou can see a quick video I made of it a couple of weeks ago (on 1st night of new series) at:\nhttp://twittervlog.blip.tv/file/185137/\n/&gt; And the
