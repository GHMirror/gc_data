This picture, painted by William T. Kimber, the head moulder responsible for casting the bell, shows George Mears with his wife and daughter inspecting the casting prior to despatch. Big Ben was cast on Saturday 10th April 1858.\" Soon after it was built many people thought it was a bad idea to have a clock so high in the air with high winds and heavy rains. On many occasions it almost got tore down. But yet today it still stands. It is said to be the biggest clock ever made, but that is not a proven fact.\n\n\nhttp://www.whitechapelbellfoundry.co.uk/bigben.htm\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644guwzwrf1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eiffel Tower","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92<img src=\"http://middlezonemusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/eiffel-tower.jpg\">ParisIt was created by a French structural engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. Not only did he make the tower but he was also very bright with aerodynamics and he wrote a book called \"The Resistance of Air\" in 1913. Though many wanted the tower to get built, there was about 300 who signed a petition against the construction of the tower. \"We, the writers, painters, sculptors, architects and lovers of the beauty of Paris, do protest with all our vigour and all our indignation, in the name of French taste and endangered French art and history, against the useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower.\" But through it all it was eventually built. The tower stood for the great engineering and science  of its time. It is 984 ft. tall, 1.052 ft. including the antenna, weighs 7000 tons, has 15,000 iron pieces, 40 tons of paint, and 1,652 steps to the top. Today all of our skyscrapers are designed in the footsteps of the tower, Eiffel gave it such a strong base and skinny but heavy top it can withstand any amount of wind. The most it has ever and will ever sway is 4 and a half inches. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644gv2482rb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.351019,48.856662]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fort Dobbs","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92<img src=\"http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/05/56/51/fort-dobbs.jpg\">North CarolinaIn 1756 Fort Dobbs was made by soldiers in North Carolina preparing for the French and their Native American Allies. It was called the French and Indian war. It was nine years long and started in Ohio Valley and ended up spreading all over the world.  Its name was in honor of the governor of the colony, Arthur Dobbs. The fort was 53x40, and about 25 feet tall, with three different floors. It was made with oak logs about 16 inches thick. Today though we do not know exactly what Fort Dobbs looked like, they know exactly where it was located, and the grounds have know been turned into a historical landmark of North Carolina. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644guzyl4dq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.886101,35.228577]}},{"properties":{"name":"Great Wall of China","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92<img src=\"http://dl.nlb.gov.sg/digitalk/Great%20Wall%20of%20China.gif\">ChinaThe Great Wall of China is one of the worlds greatest wonders. It was built as a defense for Yan, Zhao, and Qin. It was mostly built by the Ming Dynasty. It took many years for it to become the \"Great\" Wall of China, before it was that it was more of a border through china. Until the Emperor Qin came along and connected the walls to keep the Huns from invading. Ever since then the Great Wall of China has not only been a significant part of China\\'s history but also a great piece of history to go and visit. Not only is the wall itself a huge piece history, but the way it was built it also. They had soldiers, locals, and criminals helped build it. For chinese working together and hard manpower stood for how great the workers wisdom and tenacity they had, and in China that is a huge compliment. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644gutnpdkp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jamestown","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92<img src=\"http://virginiagentleman.com/blog/uploaded_images/jamestown_ruins-794062.jpg\">Virgina\"June of 1606, King James granted a charter to a group of entrepreneurs, the Virginia Company, to establish a satellite English settlement in the Chesapeake region of North America. By December, 104 settlers sailed from London instructed to settle Virginia, find gold and a water route to the Orient. Some traditional scholars of early Jamestown history believe that those pioneers could not have been more ill-suited for the task. Because Captain John Smith identified about half of the group as \"gentlemen\", it was logical, indeed, for historians to assume that these gentry knew nothing of or thought it beneath their station to tame a wilderness. Recent historical and archaeological research at the site of Jamestown suggest that at least some of the gentlemen and certainly many of the artisans, craftsmen, and laborers that accompanied them all made every effort to make the colony succeed.\" And they did.\n\n\n-- from a 1907 Virginia guidebook\nhttp://www.apva.org/history/index.html\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644gutg307s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.566666,14.016666]}},{"properties":{"name":"Liberty Hall","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92<img src=\"http://www.townofbeulaville.com/cowfrt.jpg\">North CarolinaLiberty Hall is one of a few southern plantations that looks just like it did in the 1800s.

It was first discovered by Ponce de Leon in 1513. For about 200 years it was the Spanish center of power for North America. In 1763 the British gained control. For a brief period it was given back to the Spanish in 1784 because of the treaty of paris. Even today St. Augustine is very reflected on Spanish history. Some of the worlds most noted buildings are found there, The Basilica Cathedral of St. Augustine(1797), and Trinity Episcopal Church(1825). <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644gutl059s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.572,28.3931]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Grand Canyon","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92<img src=\"http://www.oursaviorchurch.org/school/faculty/gthorp/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/tour_grand_canyon_1.jpg\">CaliforniaThough there is no way to be sure, scientist think the grand canyon was formed by the Colorado River. Many think that it is impossible that water could have formed the canyon because it is now mostly desert, and if it at one time had enough water to form it. Then why is there hardly any water now? Another cause of the canyons formation is ice, a long time ago the winters at the canyon got very cold and snow got into the crevasses. As the hotter months came the rock split even, making the rock shift or come off all together.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644gur3rh2i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.245693,37.267666]}},{"properties":{"name":"Title or search term","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92Oregon<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644guv98ngx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.488888,44.125271]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valley of the Queens","description":"Posted by Ashleigh92<img src=\"http://photos.igougo.com/images/p169871-Luxor-Temple_and_The_Mountains.jpg\">EgyptThere are between 75 and 80 tombs in Biban al-Harim, or better known to us as the Valley of Queens.
