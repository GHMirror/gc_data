In 1854, a shoe factory was set up in the village but Fritz Bally left the fledgling business and Carl Franz Bally carried on under the corporate name \"C.F. Bally.\"\n\nBy the 1860s Bally employed more than 500 people. Within another decade it had built an international reputation for quality and design in both men\\'s and women\\'s shoes and expanded operations outside of Switzerland to Buenos Aires, Argentina, Montevideo, Uruguay, and Paris, France.\n\nCarl Franz Bally died in 1899 and his sons carried on with the business. Although the Bally family maintained voting control, in 1907 \"C.F. Bally &amp; Co. Ltd.\" went public, their shares listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange. The added capital allowed massive expansion for their much-in-demand shoes and by 1916 they employed more than 7,000 people.\n\nThe company survived the Great Depression of the 1930s and the difficulties of World War II to expand globally with great success in the post-War era including a successful entry into the North American market. In 1976 they added clothing, handbags, and other leather accessories. The following year, the Bally family sold their interest in the company. Numerous difficulties followed and the company struggled under poor management against a tide of low cost products from developing countries flooding the global market. In 1999, Bally was sold to the American investment fund Texas Pacific Group.\n\nToday the company is headquartered in Caslano, near Milan, Italy.\n\nBally shoes gained a popularity with rappers in the late 1980s (along with other high-end fashion lines such as Gucci) due to their luxury status. Bally shoes are specifically mentioned in songs by a wide array of rappers ranging from Jay-Z to Dana Dane. Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew (featuring MC Ricky D aka Slick Rick) may have been the first to mention Bally shoes in a rap when they put the line, \"Put on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks,\" into \"The Show/La Di Da Di\" (1985). Bally shoes are iconic of old-school hip hop.\n\n- from wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcpxqlzh9o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.250759,43.769647]}},{"properties":{"name":"BURBERRY","description":"Posted by Petershieh<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/burberry.gif\">Burberry is a UK-based outfitter, manufacturing clothing and other apparel.

It is run by the Central Park Conservancy, a private, non-profit organization that manages the park under a contract with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\nCentral Park is bordered on the north by West 110th Street, on the west by Central Park West, on the south by West 59th Street, and on the east by Fifth Avenue. Along the park\\'s borders, these streets are usually referred to as Central Park North, Central Park West, and Central Park South, respectively. (Fifth Avenue retains its name along the eastern border.)\n\nThe park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who later created Brooklyn\\'s Prospect Park. While much of the park looks natural, it is in fact almost entirely landscaped and contains several artificial lakes, extensive walking tracks, two ice-skating rinks, a wildlife sanctuary, and grassy areas used for various sporting pursuits, as well as playgrounds for children. The park is a popular oasis for migrating birds, and thus is popular with bird watchers. The 6-mile (10 km) road circling the park is popular with joggers, bicyclists and inline skaters, especially on weekends and in the evenings after 7:00 p.m., when automobile traffic is banned.\n\n- from wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcpxy1kf76"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.96563,40.7834]}},{"properties":{"name":"Columbia University","description":"Posted by Petershieh<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/columbia_university_01.jpg\">2960 Broadway, New York, NYColumbia University is a private university whose main campus lies in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of the Borough of Manhattan in New York City.

Constructed with funds raised by Il Progresso, an Italian-language newspaper, the monument consists of a marble statue of Columbus atop a 70-foot granite column decorated with bronze reliefs representing Columbus\\' ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa María. Its pedestal features an angel holding a globe. The monument is the point at which distances to and from New York City are officially measured.\n\nRenovations to the circle completed in 2005 included new water fountains (by WET Design, of Fountains of Bellagio fame), wooden benches, and plantings encircling the monument.

In 1978, Mario\\'s granddaughter Miuccia Prada inherited what was still a leather goods business from her mother, and led the company\\'s expansion into couture.\n\nPrada\\'s first prêt-à-porter, or \"ready-to-wear\" collection was designed by Miuccia Prada in the autumn/winter season of 1989.\n\nIn addition to the original Prada line, the company introduced the Miu Miu collection, a lower-priced line aimed at a younger audience, in 1992. The Miu Miu line, which shares Miuccia Prada\\'s nickname, emphasizes earthy colors and a less haute couture look, evoking an overall more bohemian style. In its advertising campaigns, waif-like models in \"home photo\" poses further the look. Miu Miu clothing is often simple, and evokes a continual image of high-end vintage items. It was followed by the Prada Sport \\'Linea Rossa\\' collection, which featured tennis shoes. The Prada line produces high-end ready-to-wear clothes and accessories for men and women in addition to a range of children\\'s clothes, fragrances and cosmetic products and home products, whilst the Prada Sport and Miu Miu lines produce clothes and accessories for men and women, including handbags, shoes, wallets, and sunglasses.\n\nPrada won a Council of Fashion Designers of America International Award for accessories in 1993 and currently Prada is considered one of the most influential clothes designers in the fashion industry. American Vogue editor Anna Wintour is a fan of Prada.\n\n- from wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcpxnr372t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.251365,43.771199]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rockefeller Center","description":"Posted by Petershieh<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/new_york_night_07.jpg\">Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 commercial buildings covering 22 acres between 48th and 51st Streets in New York. It is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning between Fifth Avenue and Seventh Avenue. It is the largest privately held complex of its kind in the world, and an international symbol of commerce and capitalism.

(The Time-Life Building and the News Corporation/Fox News Channel headquarters are part of the \"newer\" Rockefeller Center buildings.)\n\nThe entire Rockefeller Center complex was purchased by Mitsubishi Estate, a real estate company of the Mitsubishi Group, in 1989. In 2000, Jerry Speyer (a close friend of David Rockefeller), of Tishman Speyer Properties, L.P., together with the Lester Crown family of Chicago, bought out for .85 billion the previous owners: Goldman Sachs (which owned half the complex), the Giovanni Agnelli family, Stavros Niarchos and David Rockefeller.\n\n- from wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcpxtposwt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.97911,40.75813]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salvatore Ferragamo","description":"Posted by Petershieh<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/ferragamo.gif\">2, Via dei Tornabuoni, florence, italySalvatore Ferragamo (June 5, 1898 - August 7, 1960) was an Italian footwear designer of the 20th century, providing Hollywood\\'s glitterati and many others with unique hand-made designs and spawning an emporium of luxury consumer goods for men and women, with stores in some of the most important cities of the world.

One of more than 1,700 parks in New York City, Washington Square is, along with Central Park, one of the city\\'s most well-known parks. The 9.75 acre (39,000 m²) park is a major landmark in the Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village, as well as a popular meeting place and center for cultural activity. It is run and operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\nAn open space with a tradition of nonconformity, the park\\'s fountain area has long been one of the city\\'s popular spots for residents and tourists. Washington Square has been a center of the cultural life in New York since the middle of the 19th century. Artists of the Hudson River School, the country\\'s first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square at that time. Samuel Morse and Daniel Huntington were tenants of the old University Building. (New York University once rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Herman Melville and Walt Whitman contributed to the artistic climate, having notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, Washington Square Park area was nationally-recognized as a center for artistic and moral rebellion. Notable residents of that time include Eugene O\\'Neill, John Sloan and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning as well as the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square or the Village. From the 1960s on, Washington Square Park and the Village became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. Today it is still a popular tourist attraction and a venue for mimes, dancers, musicians, and hip-hop artists.\n\nIt is surrounded today by academic and residential halls belonging to New York University. The park is home to the university\\'s graduation ceremony, many school-related activities, and is considered the core of the school\\'s campus. Additionally, the park is home to children\\'s play areas, landscaped gardens, commemorative statuary and a dog park. With these additions, one can see how Washington Square Park has evolved from its once bohemian origins toward a more family- and student-oriented park. Washington Square Park is also a notable chess players\\' haven.\n\nThe park is policed heavily by the New York City Police Department and the New York University Department of Public Safety due to its high profile and location in New York City, which witnessed the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. The area is one of the lowest crime areas in the \"safest big city in the United States.\"\n\n- from wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hcpxpj0rhy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.997641,40.730804]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237144","metadata":null,"contact_name":"petershieh","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:petershieh","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237144","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":27,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237144,platial:user=petershieh","published":"2010-04-23T16:00:00Z","id":38269}
