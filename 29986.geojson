I believe a school philosophy is limited and open-ended. It doesn’t cover everything; it doesn’t mandate everything; it doesn’t ban everything. It is a coherent set of basic beliefs that acts as a compass that guides our daily practice. It is a starting point. \r\n\r\nEducational philosophy should be open to new insights and understandings about how people learn, how the brain works, how society works, how the particular child works.
