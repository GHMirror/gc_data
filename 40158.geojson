This area would be witness to numerous troop movements over the next century as the French and English fought for control of North America. The Indian trail on the Ridge became the roadway along which English troops under General John Prideaux marched against the French at Fort Niagara. Later this same trail would carry pioneers and settlers westward. The first permanent settlement was established in 1792 along the west side of the Genesee River at King\\'s Landing, later to be named Hanford Landing.\n\nWith the establishment of the Port of the Genesee by President Thomas Jefferson in 1805, trade from the Great Lakes began to pour in. With access to Lake Ontario, the Genesee River, Ridge Road and later the Erie Canal, the Town became a transportation hub and a major supplier of farm produce to the new and growing nation.\n\nOriginally called Northampton, the Town of Greece was established by the New York State Legislature on March 22, 1822. Its name was chosen because of the current wave of sympathy toward the Greeks who were then fighting for independence from Turkish rule. The Town seat was named Charlotte for the daughter of Colonel Troup, the land agent for an English estate which owned much of western New York at the time. Charlotte itself was incorporated as a village in 1869, and was part of Greece until 1916 when it was annexed to the City of Rochester as the 23rd Ward.\n\nAgriculture would remain the dominant enterprise in Greece until the twentieth century, when Eastman Kodak Company would become the major industrial employer in the region. Most of the Town\\'s growth has occurred after World War II with the population exceeding 94,000 in 2000. The character of Greece today is of a residential suburb with modern industry and commerce.\n\nThe official flag of the Town of Greece was adopted at a meeting of the Town Council on August 17, 1954. Centered in a field of white is a circular emblem, designed by J. S. Perticone depicting the old lighthouse at the mouth of the Genesee River which was built in 1822 - the same year the Town was established. The circle represents the shield of the warriors of the Ancient Greece and the border is of characteristic Greek design. Lightning flashes symbolize energy and strength and the colors - terra cotta, golden yellow and black - are those used in old Greek pottery and artistic decorations.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rumib3jclw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.695887,43.208129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Holland (Michigan)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/36561624@N00/441228469/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/204/441228469_6998772f21.jpg\"></a>The community was named by Dutch immigrants who settled here in 1847.
