He also founded the Portland Art Museum, directed the Portland Public Library, and was an influential member of Portland’s business and social elite. At the same time, Col. Wood thought of himself as a social anarchist and believed that American capitalism was an exploitative system. Therefore, in his second life, he was a vocal supporter of the IWW and defended Emma Goldman, Marie Equi, Tom Burns, and other IWW members, all for free. He was also a strong supporter of birth control, women’s rights, and civil rights. In fact, he quit the Oregon Bar Association in 1913, because it denied membership to an African American lawyer. He kept two different offices, reflecting his two different lives, but used the money he made from his business life to finance the radical causes he believed in. He left Portland in 1920 for Los Gatos, California, where he built an amazing house that still stands.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66sjnuuhs5x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675229,45.52662]}},{"properties":{"name":"City Hall (1935) - Red Flag Flying for May Day","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/SW_5th_&amp;_Main.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> SW 5th &amp; Main, portland, orOn May Day, 1935, a group of radicals raised a red flag at city hall and then broke the flag pole mechanism so that it could not be taken down.

Its main target was Stanley Moore, professor of Philosophy at Reed College. The Velde Commission relied heavily on Red Squad information in its interrogations. Although the Commission never made its case against Moore, the Reed College Board of Trustees decided to dismiss him nevertheless.

By the end of 1931, those in Portland had more than 3000 registered members. When efforts to work within the system failed, these councils often took direction action in defense of their members interests. For example, after some 400 unemployed stormed City Hall, the city agreed to provide housing and shelter for over 1000 unemployed working people.\n\nThe main council headquarters was the location for the infamous 1934 police raid at which Dirk DeJonge was arrested for violating the Criminal Syndicalism Law. Criminal syndicalism was defined as \"the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, sabotage or any unlawful acts or methods as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political change or revolution.\" DeJonge, once a Communist Party candidate for Mayor of Portland, was charged with engaging in criminal syndicalism for giving a speech at the council headquarters that charged the police with siding with the steamship and stevedoring companies in their effort to break the longshore strike. He was found guilty despite a lack of any evidence that he had violated the law. He appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court and in January 1937 he was cleared of all charges.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66sjnsnfj7g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673807,45.51844]}},{"properties":{"name":"White Eagle Tavern, 1906 raided by feds","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/2004May1_1906_WhiteEagleSaloon118.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 836 N.
