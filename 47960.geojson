Kennedy Space Center","description":"Posted by Superman66Since its inception in 1958, NASA has accomplished many great scientific and technological feats in air and space. NASA technology also has been adapted for many nonaerospace uses by the private sector. NASA remains a leading force in scientific research and in stimulating public interest in aerospace exploration, as well as science and technology in general. Perhaps more importantly, our exploration of space has taught us to view Earth, ourselves, and the universe in a new way. While the tremendous technical and scientific accomplishments of NASA demonstrate vividly that humans can achieve previously inconceivable feats, we also are humbled by the realization that Earth is just a tiny \"blue marble\" in the cosmos. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65lsx47zajn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.652008,28.585728]}},{"properties":{"name":"Liberty Bell","description":"Posted by Superman66<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Liberty.jpg\">PennsylvainiaA chime that changed the world occurred on July 8, 1776, when the Liberty Bell rang out from the tower of Independence Hall summoning citizens to hear the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence by Colonel John Nixon.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Assembly ordered the Bell in 1751 to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of William Penn\\'s 1701 Charter of Privileges.\r\n\r\nPenn\\'s charter, Pennsylvania\\'s original Constitution, speaks of the rights and freedoms valued by people the world over. Particularly forward thinking were Penn\\'s ideas on religious freedom, his liberal stance on Native American rights, and his inclusion of citizens in enacting laws.\r\nAs it was to commemorate the Charter\\'s golden anniversary, the quotation \"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof,\" from Leviticus 25:10, was particularly apt. For the line in the Bible immediately preceding \"proclaim liberty\" is, \"And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year.\" What better way to pay homage to Penn and hallow the 50th year than with a bell proclaiming liberty?\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65lsx3teko4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.604676,41.117936]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rome","description":"Posted by Superman66<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Coliseum.jpg\">The Coliseum, also known as \"Amphitheatre Flavio\", built on the order of the Imperator Vespasiano in the honour of the grandiosity of his empire, was inaugurated by his son 80 days after Christ with celebrations 100 days long.Although it is in a ruined condition due to  earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum has long been seen as a symbol of Rome.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65lsx86e90g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.49043,41.89231]}},{"properties":{"name":"War Memorial","description":"Posted by Superman66<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/WAr.jpg\">VirginaiThe Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a national war memorial located in Washington, D.C., that honors members of the U.S. armed forces who fought in the Vietnam War and who died in service or are still unaccounted for.The main part of the memorial was completed in 1982. in 1993 the wall was done. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65lsx4rd6ws"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.420926,38.003376]}},{"properties":{"name":"White House","description":"Posted by Superman66<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/whitehouse_back.jpg\">VirginiaThe White House, one of the most recognizable buildings in Washington, DC, was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born and-trained architect who won a competition organized by President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson in 1792.
