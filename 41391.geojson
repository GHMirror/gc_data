Eighth St. Holland, MI 49424Traditional German specialities in a beautiful setting. \n\nThe Alpenrose is not just a restaurant. It\\'s an idea: to bring an authentic taste of the Alps to downtown Holland. To the average passerby, \"the Alps\" probably sparks visions of lederhosen and oompah bands, but the famed European mountain range actually carves through countries as diverse as Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland--a cornucopia of cultures and cuisines which can all claim the title \"Alpen.\"\n\nYears before our 1991 opening, many of us who were involved in developing this idea called Alpenrose, began cultivating an ever-deepening affinity for the people and places of the region. We hope that our on-going love affair is reflected, not only in the food we prepare and the service we deliver, but throughout the Alpenrose facility itself. \n\nEntering the Alpenrose, it\\'s hard to image that this building once housed a run-of-the-mill discount store. The Alpenrose is wall-to-wall wood, even support columns and ceiling rafters display exquisite wooden carvings of the Alpenrose--a rhododendron type flower found throughout the Alps.\n\nOur dream of bringing Alpen charm to West Michigan is reflected in our multiple dining rooms as well. From our family-oriented Kitzbuhel ski lodge to the classical, fine-dining elegance of our Salzburg room to the tasteful banquets available in the Garmisch room,  Alpenrose is a magnificent microcosm of the many dining experiences available in the Alpen region.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a650r6kxcwer"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.106995,42.790166]}},{"properties":{"name":"BJ's Pizza, Grill &amp; Brewery","description":"Posted by Transfairusa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Portland craft brewery, Lloyd Center District<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a650r6x1onkc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.657161,45.53424]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boulder Beer","description":"Posted by Neuf<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2880 wilderness place, boulder, co 80301Started in \\'79, it\\'s Co.\\'s first micro. \n\nSomeone else can retype more from their site...<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a650r6y1e7kc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.248019,40.025954]}},{"properties":{"name":"BridgePort Brewery","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.bridgeportbrew.com/images/bp-brewery-01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1313 NW Marshall Street, Portland, ORMaking beer since 1984.
