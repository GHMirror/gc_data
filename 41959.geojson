I think this everyday when I have to walk 20 minutes to campus form my home and then another 20 minutes to get back.  What is even more annoying is that there is no possible shortcut to this problem as where I live and where the campus is are on opposite corners of a huge rectangle.  I don’t want to seem bitter about it, because I do enjoy the exercise – rain or sine.  However, by the time I have walked back and forth about a couple hundred times the variety of the scenery becomes muddled and all too familiar.\n\tTrying to mix up the pattern in this town is hopeless since each road is basically the same thing over and over again.   Some days I go the straight rout, sticking to the perimeter like some train tied to the tracks.  Other times I mix up the repetitive trails with a bit of zigzagging.  I may stick to the quite roads in the morning and then speed back with the noise and hustle of the traffic on Lincoln Way.  Yet no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try; it always takes me 20 minutes to get from one place to another.\n\tIt seems people out here feel safer in boxes.  Out East the idea of a grid shaped county, town, or city never really struck anyone as a good idea.  Some people when they come out to New England, for example, feel completely overwhelmed by the notion of having to drive through hills and woods on roads that stretch and coil for miles, hugging the curves of hills and ponds instead of blasting right through them. While everyone may feel safe here in this corner of Northwest Indiana in their squares and rectangles I wonder why they think curves are so bad for the place.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo2wi1k5f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04639,41.47129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Albert's Way","description":"Posted by MgiguereDriving down the winding roads of Massachusetts is an easy endeavor only to those who have lived in the area long enough.  There are few streets that follow a straight line from beginning to end.  Even in Boston the roads and avenues can take on the form of a horrific labyrinth of one way streets and rotaries that appear to be in a nice gridlock system until an out of state tourist traverses downtown.  It is a strange phenomenon on how people can drive under such conditions, but seeing how Albert Steadman navigated his white \\'96 Chevy on the same roads at night, while lighting up a joint, the twists and turns of the ride seemed less mysterious.\n\n\nThere isn\\'t much mystery to Albert, an out of school under the table worker who lives in Cambridge Mass just outside of Boston.  In a way he is very lucky where he is right now with an opportunity to head back to school later in the year.  “The past two years have been a real eye opener for me,” he said.  I think I have learned more than I did when I was learning jack shit at college.”\n\n\nAbout two and a half years ago in the summer of 2005, Albert was living at home with his mom in Pepperell Mass and was a commuter to Middlesex Community College about an hour away.  He had gone down to Daytona Florida for a few weeks to visit a friend, get high on whatever went past him, and enjoy the last moments of summer.  Back in Massachusetts though, his mom stumbled upon his hidden stash and grow room he had in his closet, something she had a hunch on but could never find proof.  It was from this chain of event that Albert was thrown out of his attic bedroom and forced to live on his own at the cost of four buddings of marijuana.\n\n\n“I was very lucky to have found a roommate in such a short time,” he said in between two big hits off the joint.  He taped out the roach and rolled the windows down to let in some fresh air.  Albert\\'s love of the weed may not be far off from what most Generation Nexters (Generation Y 18 to 25 year olds) think of the drug.  Even his hair cut, thick dreadlocks, shows how the generation that came of age in a post 9/11 world thinks about his society and his place in it.  By the days end though, he seems to be just happy with a job in a market that is struggling to keep up.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo30hjw48"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.59876,42.66906]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blythes","description":"Posted by MgiguereBlythes sporting good store on Calumet doesn’t catch any of the main road traffic unless you are searching for a place to pop a few .35 rounds and pass the time away.  Even people new to Valpo are taken aback when they hear of an indoor gun range located in town.  To be fair the entire town has a strange fascination with guns and gun laws.  For one, there is no licensing required to fire a weapon on an indoor range, just show up with your weapon of choice, a box of your favorite ammo (certain types such as high velocity ammo and bottle neck cartridges are prohibited), and 0 will get you in the back room for at least an hour of mindless target practice.  In some ways it reminds me of New Hampshire and their “Live Free or Die” state mantra.  Sometimes I keep thinking that Indian is in some ways a sister state or the bastard child of NH.\n\nThe whole store is filled to the ceiling with guns most of which are hunting rifles mixed with a few old fashion replicas of guns long retired.   There is ammo of almost every kind to be found to match what you need for the day whether it’s a Glock you fancy or a new Desert Eagle you want to try out.  All of this is present under the soft bangs and snaps coming from the back room, muffled by a wall of reinforced steel and concrete.  Compared to being in the back room and with ear plugs or some kind of hearing protection, it’s relatively quite in the actual store.  There are also many trophies on the wall that range from a small quail and other fowl to large deer heads and an even larger Bull Moose head that guards the exit.  The moose’s head is far up above the main door that, even for its massive size, it’s easy to miss on the way in. \n\nFor all of that, Blythes doesn’t seem too far out of place for Indiana.  Any other state in the country, aside from New Hampshire and parts of the South, would find it hard in this day to welcome such a loose and free place for passionate gun lovers.  And while there are many others like the store in the state, it seemed like a fun place to me.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo2xf74yk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0394,41.50276]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dan the Computer Wiz","description":"Posted by MgiguereMaybe it is the geek in him that draws Dan Pernoud to computers.  By the time he became a senior, he had gone through three computers, two of them he built by himself.  “It’s just a hobby I love to do.  It’s interesting and I love making them from scratch.  I don’t see how some people have a hard time making something when they have the parts to do it.”\n\nLike Dan, most of the kids in his generation grew up surrounded by the visual splendor that is computers which in no time surpassed the knowledge of many older people who were raised on using typewriters and library resources.  But what Dan does on his rig isn’t just the medical homework he has to complete for the day.  One of his greatest passions is playing video games when ever he has free time.\n\nMost of the time he can be seen leveling up his Night Elf Mage in World of Warcraft, an online role playing game that connects millions of other players from around the world to team up and battle against one another.  While many of the same players loose track of time and their duties, Dan knows how to balance his work and his hobbies as well spending time with his fiancé Lilly.\n\n“Sure it can be hard to pull so any things together at once, but it’s always a good feeling to get that feeling of accomplishment when I finish my homework or beat a boss in a dungeon,” he says in a proud tone.  If there is a chance to beat out the stereotypes of this generation that some say are way too lazy for their own good Dan seems to be a shining example of perseverance in them.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo2y0rhez"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05824,41.47322]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dining","description":"Posted by MgiguereEven more telling of how the Boomers care for their kids is what sacrifices they make to ensure their children have a future to do what they chose. As a member of Valparaiso University’s Dinning Services staff for over 20 years, Diane Krause continues to provide service to the university and its community that started when she wanted to provider her children with a full college experience. Joining Dinning Services in October of 1986, Krause had worked up to supervisor over the years and continues to work, showing no signs of slowing down.\n\n“I started at the bottom in the dish room and worked my way up to where I am now,” said Krause. She began her work part-time at what is now the student bookstore back in the time when it used to house students and a cafateria. From there she became a full time employee exclusively at the Student Union – then called Ye Old Grail. During the mid 90’s she was promoted to supervisor of Jesters where she works today providing the hordes of hungry students who eat there everyday.\n\nIt is interesting to see how the next generation will shape up to the self-sacrificing mentally of the Boomers. The time now is a far cry off when a generation came of age where their President asked them what they can do for their country. Hopefully sacrifices like these will mold the future into other’s that will give back to the opportunity that was given to them. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo30n9r55"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05772,41.47669]}},{"properties":{"name":"Flying","description":"Posted by MgiguereI peer down the edge of the dune that faces the woods; it doesn’t look so steep from the top.  Behind me I can feel the wind cut my hair and hit the nape of my neck.  The sun is hiding today, obscured by clouds and leaving the Indiana Dunes and Mount Baldy a shade of gray and the sand cold.  The wind picks up and the tree branches below hiss and crack as the sands of Baldy inch closer and closer.  One day the little wisps of sand will over take the forest below – it is the nature of one of the last living dunes in the area.\n\nI look down to my friend setting up his shot.  He signals me the okay.  All I need to do now is jump.  I mark in the sand where I\\'m supposed to launch so I won’t mess up his photo.  He tells me to wait a few seconds so that he will be ready.  I take one last look at Lake Michigan to the north, its waves slaves to the wind.  Chicago is visible on the horizon, hiding in the haze of dense air and small enough to fit in my hand.\n\nI turn around and start my sprint to the edge, my feet sink with every stride into Baldy as if it wants to eat me alive.  Gravity and the dune try to hold me back but in one final leap I break free.  The first time almost feels like flying.  It\\'s with me for a moment, the wind spreading my zip up hoodie into wings and my hair leaving a trail in the sky.  But as soon as the moment starts, it ends with a soft impact of sand under my feet and a tumble several feet towards the forest.  With sand now in my pants, pockets, and hair, I tell my friend I\\'m going for another so for another moment I feel like I own the sky.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo3abw8q3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.93016,41.70794]}},{"properties":{"name":"Housekeeping","description":"Posted by MgiguereThe Valparaiso University Housekeeping service is located far off on old campus that most people pass by without knowing what it is. The office building that headquarters Housekeeping Services is rather small two floored office that holds all the equipment and staff needs for all of campus. The one thing that stands out among all of the equipment and cleaning supplies are the stacks of paper and operational manuals.  In such a small two floored building, the clutter of papers takes on a mind of its own sometimes.\n\n“We have a policy for just about everything and we have a procedure for about everything,” said Dan Brooks, as he pointed to a massive three ring bound binder that had about 1000 pages in it alone. Everything, from the smallest detail of how to mop a floor to how to properly close a building is kept on file in some form or another. “I could tell you how much square feet are in a building,” he said with a smile.  Dan has worked at this job as supervisor for over twenty years, back to the time when there wasn\\'t even a VU Housekeeping Service.   Even after all of this time, his job involving more to do with papers than cleaning supplies, he still enjoys his work.   “We’re a service industry,” he says, “and out motto is ‘We’re Here to Serve.’”\n\nIt seems like a daunting task to clean one building on the Valparaiso University campus and then multiply that by about 20. The VU Housekeeping Services is responsible for cleaning every building on campus inside and out. It is a cycle that never truly ends but needs to be done not only for cleanliness but also personal reasons. “People just like to come into a clean office in the morning and that makes them feel better about themselves and the job they have to do.” This in turn makes the housekeepers feel good about the job they do as well, most of the time at least.\n\n“Once in a while we’ll get an acknowledgment, but not all the time. It’s like people think there are these invisible people that come in and clean the place at night,” one of Dan co-workers said as she passed by the office. There are many like Dan in these offices of cleaning supplies mixed in with the paper trails of catalogs and operating procedures. To Dan it’s important to be prideful and aware of the job that needs to be done for the day. Just a small acknowledgment on the job being done is enough to keep at it.  Just like their motto, they only want to serve and make other people\\'s day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo328nehg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04996,41.46662]}},{"properties":{"name":"Masks, Costumes, and Dresses.","description":"Posted by MgiguereThere\\'s something sad about the pictures; blue and gray tones present within half of them makes them feel lonely, a shocking different set  made up of drag costumes.

Yet there are still smiles in the crows, looking if they were fueled by their pride and dissatisfaction with the government.  There shots are all tight, most of the frame being used to fill it with shine and glitter off of the many masks.\n\nThe entire line up is crazy.

Soon there will be many new people heading to retirement, but due to the current situation involving Social Security and privatizing of many of the staples for many to survive on there is still a lot of uncertainty in how the future will hold.\n\nMary Giguere, a nurse at Lahey Hospital in Burlington Mass, has he doubt on how she can plan for a retirement with putting three kids through college as a single mother.  Like many Baby Boomers, Mary has been divorced for almost ten years when her ex husband William left.  Forced into a situation, she paid her way through Nursing school with the help of some friends and working in a social clinic.  Even with a paying job it is still hard to get by.  “Last week I lost most of my retirement funds in one of my stocks when the market plunged,” she said, commenting when the Dow lost over 400 points in a single day due to the sell off in Eastern markets.  “There are times when I worry how I will be able to get through retirement and how far I can go.”\n\nInstead of worrying over bills, Mary takes action.  On the same day she filed all of her and her children\\'s\\' taxes and federal loans forms, she took out a bank loan and placed into an account to gain interest on it.  Maybe one of the biggest differences in the two generations is the risks the Boomers are willing to take.  Many of the Ys are unsure of what their future plans are and a great number of them are staying back at their parents home right out of college for a longer time than past generations.\n\nEveryday Mary makes her hour long commute where she will sometimes work well over twelve hour days.  There are days when the work becomes too stressful to deal with the work at home and the house suffers from negligence (her high school daughter helps but she too is out of the house to often to help).\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo38pjy3z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.65069,42.66615]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Porch","description":"Posted by MgiguereJust on the corner of Chicago St. and Morgan Blvd. resides my current home.

That is why my favorite spot to sit at is the outside porch that over looks the busy street.\n\tIt’s not the prettiest porch in town; cigarette butts lie about the concrete floor and a disassembled desk is piled up in the corner.  The sofa under the massive window – the shades always hiding what goes on inside – is a wreck, holding together only by its seams. Even the porch swing has seen better days.\n\tFor all of this though, it is a great place to just lounge about.  The sun hits the area perfectly in the afternoon, bathing up the entire sofa in warm rays of sunshine, perfect for the cold days of winter.  In the fall the popcorn festival parade marches by with the height being just right to see about above the head of crowd.  And while the swing is too old for anyone over 250 pounds, I find no problem in sitting on it or having any fear of it breaking on me.\n\tThere are many other porches on the boulevard, some sweep out in massive arcs and have towering columns that look to be from the Roman era.  But while each of those may be special to who ever may own them, I am more than happy to have at one point in my life to have claim to my own porch.

You never know where you are when you need to go somewhere, and you can never find your way back once you get going.  The first week in Valpo I had a similar experience traveling the darken paths and roads in an attempt to find the sole Buffalo Wild Wings in town.\n\nI realize now that this all could have been solved by using a map search online, but when you’re in a group of students with BWW dollars and hunger cravings for some spicy wings it’s hard to use common sense.  At any rate, a group of use decided to take a shot at walking to downtown Valpo.  I though it would be a good idea to head down towards old campus and work our ways from there.\n\nThe place was booming with frat activity, the houses were lit with lights and shaking at the foundations from the music and cheers from all around the neighborhood.  It was tempting to check out the scene but each of us knew we were on a mission to find the where the buffalo roams.  Before long we had reached the train tracks, an area where the sounds of the parties died down to only muffled sounds in the background.  Very few houses were on the road and little light could be found to make our path.  Still we marched forward.\n\nJust ahead saw one house with a small porch and a single light illuminating the yard.  A voice then yelled out to us as we passed. “You boys better not be causing trouble,” it said.  I turned around to see where it came from.  Over on the porch, just under the light, sat a man in a rocking chair.  I couldn’t make out more than the long whiskers on his face telling me he was quite old.  We didn’t say anything to him as we passed by.  We just kept walking straight and faster towards the lights in the distance that we hoped were a signal for downtown.\n\nI can’t understand why I recall that old man on the porch.  Even to this day I have never seen him after that night.  Were we that freaked out by some old man on his porch?

On one end there is the old town where many of the banks and family owned stores reside.  This is also where many of the residents of the town live in standard gridlock systems of roads, many one way streets, and two floor houses.  Further down the main roads of Lincoln Way and Morgan Blvd is a separate business district, one encompassing all the needs of the residents of supplies and food.   Aside when the Popcorn Day Parade comes around, there is very little activity compared to the other side of Valpo.\n\nThe other side to Valpo is almost the complete opposite.  What were once open corn fields and farm land in the 70’s is now a complex of mini malls and plazas littering the zone between interstates 2, 30, and 49.  And what college community wouldn’t enjoy the comfort of a Wal-Mart, Target, or Menards?  It seems to start early on in the student’s college career.  The first day in Valpo is usually spent in the east end of the town at the local Target, or a little further south at the Super Wal-Mart (at some point the executive branch of Wal-Mart/Sam’s Club felt it was the best time to close the old one and build it better right next door).  Once the first day of supply shopping is over, the new side of town has you hooked right thereafter.  It is the familiar aspect of the stores I think that draws us in, a place that most Americans visit freely from day to day.

There were many nights like those in the 80’s; nights where bonfires would cut through the darkness and blaze into the early morning.

Like our good friend Albert Steadman (see Albert) he too is of the new generation of kids who will soon be unleashed upon the world of terrorism and a unstable job market in this country, but unlike Albert he has plans to head on to do graduate work later in the year so that one day he can work for Houston Space Command. It has been a long road so far for him and it seems to be even longer before he can reach that goal. “The work is tough and sometimes I have struggled to keep up with all of it,” he admits, “but I think in the long run it will be all worth it.”\n\nWe finally make a stop on Orange St. to a place called the Social. It\\'s a small bar and venue for local and indie bands to throw a show. The price is right too, only 5 a ticket gets you in and able to enjoy three bands preform. Tyler takes the opportunity to grab a drink and head to the front of the stage to see what he came here for, Horse the Band. After a lot a bad noise from the crowd and some warm up bands, the show is about to begin. No sooner than the lead singer arrived on stage in a drunken stager, the whole pit starts to flip out like a bunch of ninjas on speed. Tyler is there in the middle, head-banging to hardcore mix of guitars, drums, scream lyrics, and keyboard sounds that belong in a 80\\'s style Nintendo game.\n\nThe place is packed with Gen Nexters moshing and rocking to the sounds. To many of them, it\\'s the start of nice week break, a way to release all the pent up energy and angst that comes with high school and college.  Several guys in the pit start flailing their arms in wild movements and everyone around them are making room in their wake.  After the concert Tyler was furious at them for being such hogs.  “It\\'s bullshit man.  They take up such a large space with no concern for the others around them.  That\\'s not how you mosh in such a place.”\n\nThankfully to others around wanting to enjoy the music, these pit hogs can\\'t maintain their energy long enough for five seconds.  Tyler, on the other hand, just thrashes back and forth, going with the energy of the music.  This is the time to let loose and start a riot, something you can\\'t get away with in the outside world.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo35ztpga"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.36475,28.61346]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wandering Down Town, The Mural","description":"Posted by MgiguereWalking around downtown Valpo, somehow I found myself lost by an odd number of left turns I had made while wandering.  There is an odd vibe to the whole town; a patchwork of main roads and alleyways that can cause you to lose your sense of place.  It didn’t take me long to remember the familiar smell of baking pizza and neon lights of the sole Papa Johns in town.\n\nEven when the sky is gray and the air humid and cool there are many people about at 3 in the afternoon.  Some wear business suits, probably coming from the town hall or one of the many banks in town.  Others are college students from just down Lincoln Way though there is surprisingly very few of them out and about (no thanks to the more modern side of the town where Target and Wal-Mart reign supreme).  The old beauty and antique stores I guess don’t tickle their fancy and most of the bars and pubs come alive when the sun sets.  The rest of the people are the townies that go about their own daily routine.\n\nWhile many of the buildings stay true to the old stone, brick and mortar fashion – the highest of them being the top three banks and town hall – in one area all of it is put aside and forgotten for just a moment.  Along the side of Michigan Jefferson, devoid of any shop entrances, lays a painted mural of the different shops in the town (at least I think them to be).  The brick wall, from one end to around the corner of the alleyway behind it, is filled with different charactures of shop owners and loafers dancing on top of awnings, drinking and having the time of their lives.  I wonder if this is the town Valpo was meant to be or was a different time.  There are no strange looks depicted in any of the portraits, just smiles and implied happiness.  In some odd way or twist of fate, the wall today has more of a plus than the town I wander in.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74fo3bn1p81"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0583,41.46939]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237310","metadata":null,"contact_name":"mgiguere","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:mgiguere","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237310","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":17,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237310,platial:user=mgiguere","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41959}
