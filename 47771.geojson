Although it is not technically out of the country I am counting it because it was pretty far away and not everyone just goes to Alaska for the heck of it. Alaska was beautiful and full of wildlife. After the cruise we continued further into Alaska and stayed in a few cool lodges, hiked a lot, and did many other outdoor activities! One of my favorite things I have ever done in my life was in Alaska. We got to ride a helicopter up into the mountains and land on a glacier. There we got out and \"explored\" it was amazing and I have way to much to say about it so I will stop.  :)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62xxmfc0xfh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-154.570999,61.288314]}},{"properties":{"name":"Athens and Greek Isles, Greece","description":"Posted by Kfische2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN5153.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN5159.JPG\">Athens, GreeceCan you say shocking?! I was suprised at how dirty and crowded a lot of Athens actually was. My junior year of high school my family went to Greece for our Spring Break. This has to be one of the highlites of my life! The Greek Isles are the most beautiful and fascinating places I know of in the world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62xxmj59rot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.729999,37.979999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Austria- Alps","description":"Posted by Kfische2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/summer_in_the_alps.jpg\">Salzburg, AustriaWhile visiting Germany we took a day trip into Austria to go up into the Alps and play in the snow.

Now this was just for fun! Cancun is beautiful and very touristy but, I enjoyed every bit of it. I went to Cancun with one of my best friends and her family the summer before my senior year in high school.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62xxmir3txx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.830001,21.17]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home Base","description":"Posted by Kfische2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/aCIMG7083.bmp\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/CIMG1577.bmp\">1660 Huntingdon TrailMy house in Atlanta.

In London we had 5 days to tour the city and of course see as many sights and historical landmarks as possible. I really enjoyed The London Eye, Harrods, and Buckingham Palace.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62xxmdy0z2z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"Munich, Germany","description":"Posted by Kfische2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/Germany0002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/GermanyMunichAlps.jpg\">Munich, GermanyWhen I was in 3rd grade I had my first opportunity to travel outside the United States.

We put on a day camp for the orphans on the Island of Nassau. Everyone thinks of Atlantis when you talk of the Bahamas but the truth is there are many poverty stricken people on just the opposite side of the island. I learned a lot on this mission trip and also got to experience the luxury aspect of the Bahamas for a day or so as well.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62xxmg1oloj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.330001,25.059999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris, France","description":"Posted by Kfische2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN0591.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN0660.JPG\">Paris, FranceThis has to be one of my favorite places that I have visited.

This was VERY different than anything I had seen even in Greece. The people seemed pushy and rude, but my mom thankfully was BOUND AND DETERMINED to get to Ephesus. In the end I was glad I got to experience this as well. It helped me understand history so much better!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62xxm85vth2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.366667,37.950001]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/55805","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kfische2","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kfische2","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/55805","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=55805,platial:user=kfische2","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47771}
