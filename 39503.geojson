It’s the same old routine. During the winter she comes to live with us because the only means of heat that she has at her house is a wood stove. She’s not exactly the most muscular 78 year old so to save her the trouble and us the worry of her carrying logs all over her house, she just comes to stay with us. Each year we pray for the announcement that she’s just going to stay, but on that first warm day she starts packing her bags. A few days before the official move, we all go over to her house to clean up what hasn’t been cleaned thoroughly in months. My uncle watches the house, and by watches I mean, he comes to get the mail every once in awhile and he feeds the cats in the garage. Buela doesn’t like the idea of returning to a dirty home and she’s the one that taught us to clean a house from top to bottom so it’s never a chore to complain about when the times comes. \nI rarely ever see her anymore. Nowadays, it’s just when I come home from school and on every holiday. But each time that I do get to see her, it’s like Heaven on earth. There’s something about her…about just being able to wrap my arms around her that fills me with a sense of peace—temporarily anyway. Near her, I feel protected. I always have. Yes, she’s my grandmother, but to me, she’s an angel. \nShe practically raised me in this house. She raised me and all of my cousins in this house. Each time I walk through the front door, I step into my childhood. And a visit never goes by without a session of Remember When? Corner at the big dining room table that we’ve sat around for years as an extended family. When I walk through the door, I stand in the dining room and behind it is the kitchen. When the door shut behind us, it was always a race to the warmest tortilla and then to the TV for first dibs on picking the channel. We’d take advantage on what little TV we got to watch since any minute we’d be summoned to the kitchen to wash dishes or the garage to sleep the floor or the back yard to pick up sticks. While you think grandparents spoil their grandkids, we lived in a completely different setting. Buela taught us discipline, but at the end of the day, Buelo would come home from work with a Big Size Crunch bar that he’d sneak to us without Buela knowing. It was a nice, little system we had going for us, really.\nSince it was warm out the day that we went to clean up, I went for a walk around the house outside.  Memories began to flood from when Buelo made us a golf course in the backyard—little dug up holes randomly created on the ground—so we could try our hand at knocking a golf ball into them with a stick we found in the garage; in their long driveway where Buela would take me for a walk every day to fetch the mail and along the way we would pick up those big rocks that had tiny diamonds in them which caught my eye every single time. She would never attempt to break my heart and tell me that they weren’t diamonds at all. I walked back to el monte which was just an extension to the backyard where Buelo would keep his tractors and trucks that he would fill with tomatoes and drive over to the Red Gold facilities. There were a number of tiny sheds that I was always too scared to look inside of and a lot of parts to God knows what that were just rusting in their place. I don’t visit this place often, but each time I do I come back to the house more fascinated than before because when I was little, it all seemed so much bigger. I specifically walk back to the hole in the ground that we used to burn trash. There was only one day in my entire life that Buela took me back there and we had a mini-bonfire. Sticks, hot dogs, and all, we started a fire and had dinner out there. Today, I can barely ever find where the hole used to be.\nOn my way back across the yard to the house, I can’t help but feel a little heartbroken that it’ll be another long while before I’m back here again…before I get to be with Buela again. Each time she leaves, I fill myself with fear with the thought of the inevitable. I never long to say goodbye and drive away. And it never fails that each time I leave, she cries. She tries so hard to wait until I leave, but she just can’t and seeing my grandmother cry is one of the hardest things I deal with in my life. She blesses me before I walk away and when I get in my car, my heart breaks even more. If she only knew what I did. She tells me every day that we’re together how proud I’ve made her and that she knows I’m going to do good things. She’s convinced that I won’t screw up and when she compares me to all of my other cousins who aren’t in school, who have kids, and aren’t married, I can’t help but cry at the realization that I’ve already failed her. \nIf she only knew. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pc97hyye"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.63732,40.00047]}},{"properties":{"name":"Birdland","description":"Posted by Victoria“God, remember when we used to try and count all these birds?” \n\nFrom the dining room, the curtain that plays as a door inside the doorway’s frame hides the living room, but once stepped through to the other side, it’s a different world. It’s a jungle. \n\nSamantha walks through and snickers at the site of the walls. With her 9-month-old son in her hands, she continues, “Look, you can still see the pencil marks we left to help us keep track.” The living room walls were plastered with paper completely doused with birds. From top to bottom, no space in between, blue birds, red birds, yellow birds, orange birds—they all lived there. Some sat on twigs, some were in mid-flight, and some were merely just there and all the pattern consisted of was birds. Standing in the middle of the room looking all around her, she said, “Like, someone actually had to have picked this paper out.” She sat down on the turquoise loveseat and let her son crawl freely. “It actually kind of scares the crap out of me.” The room was always kept dim. Light escaped in from either the dining room or from the edges of the blinds that were always kept shut. And birds would be flying around you, not near you, but all around you—right, left, in front, behind. \n\nBenjamin crawled to one of the walls and when he arrived to his blockade he examined a blue bird singing on a tiny tree limb. He lifted his hand, touched it, and turned around to alert his mother of his new discovery. He turned again to the bird and finally back towards his mother. Slowly, he formed a smile and began to bounce up and down in his stance on all fours. Samantha went to pick him up and as she walked away, he had one arm wrapped around her neck, the other reaching out behind her, and his eyes growing wet as the curtain fell over birdland. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pck3dny2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.63735,40.00049]}},{"properties":{"name":"Elvis Room","description":"Posted by Victoria“She already promised me all the Elvis posters.”\n\nAmanda admired Elvis room as she gloated about being the sole inheritor of all the memorabilia one day.

In Las Vegas performing, in Hawaii sharing his leis, on the stage flaunting the women with his red scarf…from top to bottom, this wall was covered with pictures of him. On the wall in front of you as you walk in, there’s a dresser that’s accented with memorabilia including a golden statue of his head encased in a shadow box. Inside the box is a necklace—diamonds spelling out ELVIS. A framed set of pink Elvis stamps hangs on the wall next to the dresser—the same stamp is woven into a blanket on the bed behind you. Everywhere you turn, you can’t escape him. “I love Elvis!” Amanda sits on the bed and looks around the room like she’s 15 years younger and surrounded by candy. “If it weren’t for Abuela, I wouldn’t know who he was…him or Julio Iglesias.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pcm700g7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.63744,40.00049]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grace's Pictures","description":"Posted by VictoriaEvery teacher has a favorite student.

She knew what question was coming and it didn’t take her too long to peruse through the yearbook in her mind. Back and forth, the rows of her 1st graders smiled extra big at her, some caught off guard with the flash, and some looking at something other than the photographer’s finger above the lens. Each time her eyes grew a little larger I wondered if she was reacting to the thought of her good students or if she was picturing those who were most definitely not her favorites. In the end, she introduced me to Grace. \n\n“There are so many…but…there’s Grace.” Every morning Katie can count on Grace’s little arms to embrace her and somewhere between recess and that last bell at the end of the day, Grace will dish out the latest juiciest 1st grade gossip.

It doesn’t take long before I’m ready to scream at the top of my lungs that I just want to get the fuck out of here! There are a lot of bad memories associated with home. In fact, the reason why I went to school was just to get away. High school was hell. No, I wasn’t a nerd. I wasn’t harassed. But it was the worst time of my life. I went to a small school. My graduating class was 74. Small. We started our freshman year with 140 kids. You’d think as a small farming community, it wouldn’t be as corrupt as it is. \n\nI first learned about sex when I was in elementary school and not from the sexual education instructor. We’d sit in the back of the bus and I’d listen to my guy friends talk so vulgarly about the act. It never hit me to mind or ask how they knew so much. Years would pass and I would realize that they’re all just perverts. It’s like some kind of gene they’ve all got. I’ve been boy crazy since preschool (yes, preschool), so I never went through the “Ewww! Cooties!” phase. I remember buying Valentines to give to each of the kids in my class, but when I was filling out the To:’s, I always chose my favorite cards to give to the boys I liked the most. They were my weakness. They are what broke me down. In junior high, sex was just common knowledge. In 8th grade, I learned about alcohol. I’d listen to the guys in class talking with the girls (that kissed the most boys) about the past weekend. They’d always laugh in the corner about how “cool” it was. Nearing the end of junior high and starting our freshman year in high school, my class really started going to hell. It started with marijuana, but Triple C’s were the most popular. By this time, every single weekend there would be a party happening in someone’s basement or in an open cornfield. By this time, I was spending every weekend at Kearstin’s house. We’d stay up all night and eat pizza, watch movies, and lip sync and dance around her room to the best songs on the radio at the time. Lame, right? But thank God that’s where I was. Before the first semester of our freshman year ended, Stacey got pregnant. By the time we were seniors, 11 of my classmates would have kids. Some dropped out, some didn’t, but all but one is struggling to survive today. \n\nI decided to cut through the high school parking lot to get to the other side of town. I live about four and a half minutes away from school. The memories came flooding back before I even turned into the parking lot. Classes had just let out so students were trickling slowly out the doors. As I neared the pedestrian crossing, I saw her. For three years, she’d been a part of both of our lives, I just didn’t know it until it was too late and he conveniently failed to tell me he was in love with her, too. High school drama, right? It never fails. She made my life a living hell. Without speaking a word to me, without looking at me, her existence made everything from my senior year in high school throughout my freshman year in college (keep in mind, I took a year off after graduating) pure hell. She was the all-American bitch perfect at everything. Co-star pitcher on the school’s softball team as a freshman and starting volleyball player, again, as a freshman. Later, after finding out the truth, I’d ask him if it would have made a difference if I were an athlete. He claimed it wouldn’t have, but I know better. Three years of my life, and this rich, perfect, Daddy’s little princess, took away the one good thing I had going for me (at least at the time that’s what I thought he was). There she was, in front of my car, with her little white visor and her French braid sticking out underneath it, her glove under her arm, and those stupid sunglasses with the lenses that you can’t see through. If you try, you only see yourself. She is just the start, and surprisingly only a miniscule part, of why home is such an awful place to spend my time. But with the mere sight of her, I think of him. I think of us. I think of what we did. I think of the nights I would pick him up in this very spot after football practice, after his track meets, after school, and on that day. As she walks by I remember that the entire time I was struggling to survive with my decision that I had made because he claimed to love me and he promised me the future, he was fucking her on the side.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pcgrhigi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.54205,39.87767]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hurricanes","description":"Posted by Victoria\tI just read this: “This being New Orleans, there were, of course, hurricane parties everywhere…The drink Hurricane is, as you may know, a local invention.” I chuckled to myself here and thought, “Oh, I know ALL about that Hurricane drink…” I continued reading and smiled at this next line: “Everyone I talked to had a hurricane story.” Now, while I was fully aware that Codrescu was speaking of the actual natural disaster, I thought about how everyone he talked to probably also had actual Hurricane (the drink) stories. So many drunken Hurricane stories. So here I am in the comfort (yes, for some reason tonight I can use the word “comfort”) of my dorm room and I fear that my mind is smiling at the very thought of that night...my Hurricane night. So, would you mind terribly if I shared my Hurricane story with you?\n\tIt was our last night in New Orleans. The wedding was just okay. No one in the family really liked the girl he was marrying. As a matter of fact, we still don’t like her. But either way, it was okay. We had spent the entire week as the epitome of tourists. As soon as we stepped out of the glass doors of our hotel, we were on the sidewalks of Bourban Street and during the day we walked up and down the streets of one of the cutest cities I’d ever visited. At night...we took a cab. Strangers amongst all the strange natives. That last night, though, David, my cousin, suggested taking my other cousin, Amanda, and I out. We accepted his offer and decided to take a WALK down Bourban Street. The bars were bustling with crowds seeping onto the street, many with drinks in hand. Now, for someone like me (mind you, I was 16 at the time), getting into the bar wasn’t a mission. At least it hadn’t been during my visit. In fact, earlier in the week I had the privilege of having a drink bought for me by a sailor…a sailor in full uniform. But, that’s a story for another night. This night, however, David took us to Pat O’Brien’s, the home of the New Orleans Hurricane. Now, this is the #1 rated bar in the city so this time I wouldn’t be getting in so easily. As we neared the building David was devising a plan for me. “Okay, here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna go up to the guy, dig around in your purse like you’re looking for your ID…then look at him and say you forgot it…” As he informed me of my instructions I just stared at him blankly. “Me and Amanda are gonna go in after you to make sure you get in…” So, I went. I did exactly as I was told, my heart racing throughout this entire act and finally I looked up at the doorman and sighed sweetly, “I must have forgotten my ID…” Before I even had the chance to bat my eyes he placed his hand on the small of my back, gave me a little shove, a wink and said, “You’re fine…go ahead.” \n\t“Did that really just happen?” I kept asking myself. Finally, I just told myself that this was going to be one of my greatest stories. \n\tAt the time, I had no idea how well-known this bar was, but I couldn’t believe how glorious it was. Yes, glorious. We stepped through a carriageway into a whole new part of the city. As we sat down in the Patio, David ordered for us, \"Three Hurricanes.\" In mere minutes, the largest, most stunning drinks were placed in front of us. It was punch. Fruit punch. But the kick didn’t hit me until I stood up for the first time since having been sat down and it was this night that I came to the harsh, yet exciting realization, that rum is very, very bad for me. I’d have two more…very, very bad of me. And oh, my dear, dear Pat O’Brien, there’s no one else I would have rather taught me what drunk is. And stumbling back down the streets to our hotel, New Orleans, there’s no other place I would rather tell my story about. \n\tTonight, my mouth waters a little for that drink. It waters for the enormous piece of pineapple that sticks out of the rim. Tonight, I wouldn’t mind being back there. All of a sudden, my dorm room isn’t as comforting as it was earlier. So how does a mere memory have such an impact on me? I suppose it’s the story. I suppose it’s the place. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pc96ax5o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04189,41.46585]}},{"properties":{"name":"I Hate Hospitals","description":"Posted by VictoriaMy friend was sexually assaulted last weekend.\n\nIt happened early Sunday morning. I found out later that afternoon. I held back my anger and waited to unleash it after I had gone to talk to her. It took me 3 minutes to get somewhere that would normally take me 20 seconds. Down the hall, five doors down, she was reliving it over and over in her mind. When I walked in, she was sitting up covered with a blanket, holding her knees up to her chest. She was just staring at the floor in front of her…trying not to picture it anymore. She was trying not to feel it anymore. I sat in front of her right at her feet. She didn’t even look up at me. She just started crying…sobbing. I started crying…sobbing. Her room, covered in bright oranges, pinks, yellows, was now covered in fear. Every picture that decorated her desk, her closet doors, and her walls, were reminders of the hell she was forced into. They were reminders of people she thought she could trust. Her clothes were reminders of the nights she thought she’d never want to forget. The next day, she would get rid of three trash bags full of them. She would throw away the pictures. She would attempt to clean every inch of the square room, but no matter how much of this place she tried to get rid of, she would never be able to escape it. “This is the room I came back to after that night…” “This was the bed I couldn’t get comfortable in after that night…” “This was the jacket I wore on that night…” “This was the campus that it happened…” Now, this is the place where she can’t stand being alone…where she’s scared to be alone. \n\nMonday night we made a few phone calls with hope that it wasn’t too late to take her to the hospital. Whether or not she would press charges was still up in the air, but because of how distraught she was the day before, we couldn’t convince her to handle things a certain way. The first phone call we made was to the hospital. We gave the nurse the benefit of the doubt when she answered our questions angrily with an “Well, she can just do this and this and we’ll do this, but I don’t know about this and that.” Thanks, Lady. Next. Every dorm room has an ugly poster glued to the back of the medicine cabinet’s mirror. WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. “Sexually assaulted” in bold letters. Sadly, we weren’t surprised to be directed to a voice mailbox. As if we weren’t angry enough with this entire situation, we got an answering machine. In the end, we found a 24-hour crisis hotline with an angry voice on the other end. “Hi, um…our friend was sexually assaulted the other night and were just wondering…” only to be replied with “Oh, well…I don’t know.” We were directed to someone else. Finally, we got an answer. There was still time. \n\nOn our way to the hospital, my friend asked me if I could tell the doctor what happened. Once we were there, she requested that the word “rape” not come out of any of the staff’s mouths. When we walked in, I stood at the Register desk, whispered to the nurse what had happened and of every rude voice we’d heard on our way to this moment, he beat them all. I suppose we were too naïve to assume that a bit of compassion would be shown. As I tried to explain to him what she wanted, he turned away from me as I spoke and asked, “Alright, who did it happen to?” It? IT? All I could be glad about was that he hadn’t called it “rape”…yet. He took my friend with him and the rest of us sat in the waiting room. It was around 11:30 and we caught the end of an Oprah episode. For the three hours that we sat there waiting, all I could do was drum my fingers, flip threw the magazine’s pages without reading a word and barely looking at the pictures, sway back and forth and chip away at my finger nail polish…and all of this, not because I was impatient, but because I was angry. I was pissed. I was fucking livid. We shouldn’t have had to be there. We shouldn’t have had to bring our best friend to the hospital because she was…the “r” word. I hated every minute of sitting in that room, walls covered with those wispy paintings of streaks of pastels over a beach…a broken vending machine…plastic flowers…I hated every minute of sitting in that room. For three hours we waited only to be told that we’d have to wait 2 days until we got the results. When she walked into the waiting room to let us know she was done I looked into her eyes and all I could think was how I never truly knew hate until now. I just sat in that chair hating everything about its floral upholstery, hating everything about those paintings, hating absolutely everything about this place. I’ve always hated hospitals but more than anything, I hate him.\n\nI hope that bastard rots in hell. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pcgd3ia3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04882,41.46736]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kitchen","description":"Posted by Victoria“Pues, aqui es donde aprendiste a cocinar, verdad?”\n\nMy grandmother walked her granddaughter through the kitchen which was all of about 10 steps to get from one end to the other. She laughed and replied that yes, this was where she learned to cook. Since she can remember, the kitchen hasn’t changed a single bit. The same stove, the same kitchen table, the same napkin holder and salt and pepper shakers, the same refrigerator, the same glossy, rigid yellow tiles…it was the exact same as when she first stepped into it. “Revuelta las tortillas”. Turn over the tortillas. The stove was cleaned every day at the end of day due to all the food that splattered onto the top and accumulated throughout the day. Pieces of tortilla, frijoles, arroz, salsa…it was a true Mexican Abuela’s kitchen. Across from the oven stood the kitchen table that used to be the ‘teenager’ table. There was a grown-up table, a teenager table, and a little kid table. The teenagers were moved into a different move. They never questioned it. They just ate. They ate on the fake gray marble top (it was really just plastic) and each chair surrounding it was different. Some taller than others. Some with the cushions ripped down the middle or not even attached. All that mattered was that they were closest to the food. Starting on the stove, the buffet began. The warm stuff stayed warm on the fire and off the stove top, the salads, the bread, the weird stuff that Tia Maria brought and no one dared touch it except her husband, and at the end of the counter, past the sink, were the desserts. And somehow, there were always more desserts than anything else. On Easter especially. Why? No one knows. But for some reason everyone felt the urge to bake and cover whatever it was in white frosting.

I did better this time, though. It wasn’t until I got to the gas station that I felt like I was in high school again. This was the second time that I’d decided to fight my better instincts and leave the house. Of course, this just proves why I should never be put in charge to make decisions. \nI pulled into Love’s. It’s about seven minutes away from my house. My car hadn’t been driven since the last time I was home…about a month ago. I remember leaving it with no gas. I pulled in to this local drug transfer spot and as soon as I parked I said, “God, I hope I don’t see anybody I know.” Which not surprisingly is something that I say anywhere I go when I’m home. And of course having just said that, I saw Scott. His older sister used to be one of my best friends and he was absolutely awful to her and his entire family. When I think about the shit that he put his mother through, it pisses me off. The rest of his family is one of the sweetest and most Christian that’s a part of my life. They’re good people. That’s all I can say. They’re such good people. The second day that he didn’t come home we knew something was wrong. He’d been grounded the night that he left for getting his eyebrow pierced and his mother had actually been very lenient after finding his stash of marijuana. We all just grew more devastated as we learned the things he was getting into—mainly because at one point, he had fit into his family. It didn’t take him long to find that “wrong crowd” once he became a freshman. Our high school just fucked everyone’s life up. Anyway, he ran away, broke his family’s heart, and finally once they found him he agreed to stay out of school and work online to finish out his semester as a sophomore. He also moved out of his house for awhile and stayed with an uncle to work on his ranch. Apparently it had done him some good…until he came back to school. I saw him walking towards the car full of every reason why he’s failing himself again. \nI actually stayed in my car for a few minutes before getting out hoping that they would all drive by and I wouldn’t have to deal with the usual glares from every single person that was still in high school. Unfortunately, I was in too much of a hurry to hide forever so I just got out and walk towards the entrance to pre-pay. They started driving as soon as I started walking and as I stepped onto the curb, they drove past me, honked the horn, and started screaming at me. Literally hanging out of the windows, half of them I didn’t even know, they just yelled God knows what. For me it wasn’t possible not to turn around and look. They pulled me back into the hallways at that moment. These kids who didn’t even know me, except Scott, knew one thing I did, and I’m being ridiculed while they’re driving around high. Who’s a worse person? \nI already know the answer.\nI was so close to getting in the gas station without anything happening. So close. But as soon as I walked up to the register, I saw two girls that I had graduated with. This is what they were doing with their lives. They were gas attendants. From high school to the local gas station? I remember these girls. From the way they worked and treated everyone around them, it seemed obvious that they didn’t really have much going for them, but they didn’t even try. I felt embarrassed for them, but then when I gave her my money she just looked at me like a bug. Then it hit me. They knew everything about me. And at that moment, my life was a bigger joke than theirs.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pcd0jhty"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.47362,39.87724]}},{"properties":{"name":"My Room","description":"Posted by VictoriaI’m making over my entire room. Every time that I step into it, I get a little sick to my stomach. Coming home this break has been harder than any other. I’m not quite sure why. Maybe it’s because in a couple weeks it’ll have been one year since everything associated with home, either inside the house or just a few miles away from it, became a bad memory. I’m painting all the walls red, a deep red, and covering the walls with my black and white photography. It hit me one night, though, to search through my family’s old photo albums to see if I could find anything. It was one of the best ideas I’d had in a long time.\nI was sitting on my bed. It was nearing 2 a.m. and here I was thumbing through pictures I had never seen before of my mom and dad before they even got married. A lot of polaroids. I found pictures of mis abuelos. There were pictures of me and my sister from vacations I had no idea I went on with my family. It was a bit of a nostalgic feeling I had running through my heart, but at the same time, I didn’t really know what I missed. And I don’t really long for anything to be the way it used to be. If anything, I wish I had never met him. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t hate home. I wouldn’t be bitter. I wouldn’t be heartbroken. I wouldn’t be broken. Yet, if I hadn’t, I would have never grown up. \nI can never decide, when I think about him, if it was a good thing to fall in love or not. I can never decide if he was ever worth it. And then again at the same time, I can never even try to imagine what I’d be or where I’d be if he hadn’t been a part of it. So really, it’s not even worth contemplating. And, I realize that it may be absurd to one who knows no details that one person who’s been in my life for almost four years now can have such an impact on what I consider my past, but in the matter of the first two years that we were together, I went through things a normal 18 year old should never go through. \nSo here on my bed I sat with a million things running through my mind. I want to paint over my past. Ironically, I’m painting over it and covering it with more past…just not mine. I came across a picture of my mom holding me when I was first born. I had a head of crazy, black hair, let me tell you. She was wearing a pink gown, lying in the hospital bed, and looking down at me smiling. She told me I was an accident. In most cases that wouldn’t be encouraging to hear, but I figure…look at me now. I walked to my mirror and took a look. I looked like shit. My hair a mangled mane which I hadn’t touched all day, wearing a gray t-shirt with a picture of a black oak tree imprinted on it, and a pair of black sweatpants with its bottoms pulled up to my shins. I turned to my side and remembered how I got this thin. In less than a month, I lost 20 pounds due to depression. I was never able to gain it back after my stomach had shrunk. I stared at myself for only a minute and I held up that picture of my mom and me again. I wondered what she thought about when she was holding me at that moment. Was she happy? Scared? I was an accident, right? And don’t people usually try to avoid accidents? \nIt wasn’t until it was too late that I got rid of possibly the greatest accident of my entire life. I just got rid of it. Like it was trash. Something that my mom could have done, but she didn’t. And now I want a new room. New walls, new pictures, new bed…a new bed because the one that I sleep in every night when I’m home is the one that my accident was conceived. A new bed because the one I wake up in every morning is the one that someone should be waking up next to me in. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pccx1uma"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.51699,39.90605]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans Blues","description":"Posted by VictoriaIt was the first thing that I noticed when I stepped into the hallway. The blues. For a minute, I stepped onto the street myself...I walked past a sax player playing his song. Mind you, the street wasn\\'t as jampacked with the costumes and masks and beads and liquor, but it was an entertaining walk full of cans with a few dollars in them, a human sock monkey, and a blues soundtrack playing throughout the background. \n\nThat is where I was taken back to when I stepped through the gallery, but soon I was brought back to reality. I stood in front of these images and again, I noticed most the great mess of blues. While the color itself that radiated through many of the pictures was quite eye-catching it was so bright, the concept behind the costumes made of the large blue tarps that almost all read \"FEMA\" made me wonder if these Mardi Gras regulars had recovered from their blues. Or, did they sing the blues? Listen to the blues? Feel blue after Katrina? Were they blues fans before Katrina? For they were showing off their mighty blues now. From wigs, to masks, to hats, to eyelashes, to jewels...the blues made everyone one. The blues brought the street of men, women, men very well-dressed as women together. And, as a backdrop of these photos what did I notice? These boys proud of their creations and standing strong on their land after Katrina tried to wash it away had a clear, blue sky framing them in their pictures. The streets were crowded, indeed, but that\\'s what I liked to see. The spirit that I\\'ve heard so much about lately was there. It was still there. I wanted to be there. I wanted to be surrounded by these blues that were worn on huge smiles. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pcakkzgm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03982,41.46401]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paz para VA Tech","description":"Posted by Victoria--The walk was near silent. Behind us two students informed each other what their day’s consisted of. In front of us, a group of students each walked with their heads down—chasing their shadows. I chased the Chapel’s light. I’ve come to discover that once the sun sets, it radiates from inside. From the highway across the street, it calls to you. The chandeliers that hang inside on the high ceilings play as the North Star. From the dorm buildings, it announces that it’s there if you need it. From any of the campus’ pathways, its kaleidoscope of windows aluminates and draws you into its sanctity. \n\n\t\n--Tonight, we’ve come together to pray. And isn’t it ironic that such a tragedy is what must take place for some to seek God? Is it strange that we’ve come together because someone has taken away people who are complete strangers to some of us? Gone…from the world. \n\n\n--I sit in a pew near the back. Some of the heads in front of me are down—praying already. Some are observing this environment they have never surrounded themselves with. Some are watching the candles burn in front of them. Some are twirling their thin, white vigil candles between their fingers. Ahead of us all stands a tall candle where the fire for ours will derive from. Next to this is a table consumed with dozens of pillar candles already burning. It’s easy to assume what these represent…who these represent. \n\n\t\n--The lights are dimmed. The speakers quietly pop when their power switch is flipped. The service begins. The voices are low, the passages are solemn. We learn nothing but sorrow as the story is retold to us. We pray.\n\n\t\n--Behind me, a man and woman sing “O Lord, Hear My Prayer” as the candles are being lit one by one. They arrived to the Chapel together and their voices accompany one another. She harmonizes his. It’s a melancholy hymn, but its two verses are sung over and over again. After so many repetitions I hear them slowly begin to hum only clearly singing the words “Lord” and “prayer”. They’d hum. “Oh Lord…” They’d hum. “Lord…” They’d hum. “Lord…my prayer…” The candles were lit. The song was done. \n\n\t\n--I heard a psalm and while he read it I watched the flame of a boy sitting in the pew in front of me. The voice read, “Weep with those who weep…” and I watched his candle melt away. I watched the wax fall down its side—as if it was weeping. My candle did not cry, but his wept. Three tears melted on top of one another on this boy’s candle. \nThree distinct tears. \n\n\t\n--I stood up with the whole of the congregation. “There are 33 candles in front of you. Not 32. But 33.” One by one we learned who belonged to each flame and with each name the bell chimed. My heart grew heaviest after each bell toll. I kept my eyes shut as the sound resonated through the Chapel, but here my tears began to melt on top of one another. Here, I wept with those around me.  I listened to the names, the toll that helped lead them into eternity, and to my neighbors’ whimpers. \n\n\t\n--We blew our candles out together and walked away. As I stood in line to leave the school a message from our university, I watched those who stayed to pray longer. In the back pews students took moments alone. By the 33 candles, one student stood. The other kneeled. He prayed with his hands palm to palm and his face resting upon them—the way prayer is depicted in pictures. Behind his profile stood the statue of Jesus at the front of the Chapel, his arms spread wide open, welcoming life…celebrating life. Next to me, students embraced one another. This was when I began to cry once again. I wiped away my tears and watched those praying by the candles as they finished. They as well embraced one another, but didn’t let go so quickly. He wrapped his arms around her and without stepping back he again replaced his arms even further around her as if the first time wasn’t strong enough. \n\n\t\n--She handed me the pen and I wrote: Vayan con Dios y enontren paz.

It was all simple routine. The food would be set, the table would be set, someone would ask, “Is everyone ready?” and at the sound of those words, everyone would stand up or walk in from the other room, form a circle around the dining room table, hold hands, and bow their heads. There were no questions, no changes, no objections…we would simply pray. The kids would peak open their eyes and watch their parents and aunts and uncles stand in silence and when Grandmother was feeling particularly generous, she would let the kittens come inside for the day. During the blessing, they would scurry around the middle of the circle and toss around their toys. “Thank you for this food…” The table in front of all of us would be covered with two different table clothes because really, the one long table was made out of two. And one tablecloth would be a pastel green while the other was white lace. In the middle would be an elegant vase filled with this year’s floral arrangement that Sol sent from Minnesota since he, again, couldn’t make it. “You died on the cross for us…” Behind everyone who stood in front of a wall, would be pictures of every child in the family’s progression from infant to toddler to teenager to today. Every graduation picture, every Quinceañera picture, every sports picture. And though she would always ask that she not be given pictures anymore because she didn’t have any room to put them, Grandma would always manage to find a way. On the far end of the dining room table, behind the chair, was a dresser covered with pictures and rosaries. “We thank you, Lord…” and you could hear my grandmother whispering blessings of her own. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pciz3njr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.63732,40.00047]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shelly and the Sun","description":"Posted by VictoriaMy mother specifically told me a few years back that when she died, she wanted a bench as her gravestone. At the time she told me, I didn’t care to take into consideration that we were treating a very heavy subject so lightly. It was right after my grandfather passed away and the headstone brochures were randomly dispersed throughout the house. I remember looking through them and finding the one that I wanted. A part of me even got excited about the idea. That’s weird. But my mom had seemingly made the decision a while back because she didn’t even have to start thumbing through the pamphlets before she told me, “I want a bench so you girls can come sit and talk to me.” I’m not sure that the conversation has come up since then. \n\nI hadn’t thought about my mom’s wishes until today so I figured, since I was here, I could reflect on her and see what some of our options are for benches. I walked right past the Garden of Memories and the Garden of Eternal Life. To me, the entire area felt vast with its rolling hills, picture perfect green, cut grass, and several paved paths for its visitors’ traveling convenience. I was walking through a park, really—a very quiet park where instead of shade coming from large trees that follow each pathway, the only shade seen on the ground comes in blocks behind the gray and white gravestones that tower from the lawn. And instead of the dozens of large trees, there are tiny berry trees that randomly accent the field of graves. For the place that I was standing in, it was actually quite beautiful and definitely peaceful. \n\nPast the gardens and “Welcome to Graceland Cemetery” sign, I met “Shelly”. It was the first bench that I came across on my way up the hill, but instead of sitting on top of it, I made myself comfortable on the grass next to it. Despite its purpose, it didn’t feel right taking advantage of a seat that’s been reserved for family and friends. Who was I to disturb her? COME, SIT AND REMEMBER ONLY THE GOOD TIMES. Before I even knew her name, I read her epitaph first. I wondered if anyone had come to think about bad times. When I looked on the other side of her bench, there she was engraved boldly, “SHELLY”…quotation marks and all. There were no more markings anywhere on the bench. Just her rules and her “name”. I took a moment to observe her neighborhood. \n\nI met the Kirkpatrick family, Mr. and Mrs. Addison, Gene Swanson who was patiently awaiting for his wife Joan to join him, and only a tiny part of the Sheaks family. BABY ROBIN GAY was waiting to meet her parents. By the bright pink flower arrangement that filled Baby Robin’s vase, Father Charles and Mother Cleta I it was clear to see had recently visited their newborn. All of these graves oversaw Highway 30 with the sun setting behind them. I thought for a minute and wondered if they had ever imagined that the chaotic sounds of semis and the fast paced life would taunt them even through eternity. There was something different about “Shelly”, though. While everyone around her faced the nonstop world past the “Thank you for coming” exit sign of the cemetery, she faced laid in the opposite direction. “Shelly” faced the sunset. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pcj2uy28"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03906,41.45842]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Cathouse","description":"Posted by Victoria“I have to take care of them…those stupid cats.”\n\nFernando walked into the garage only to be greeted by the mewing kittens Baby and…well, the other roamed around day after day without being called by anything but the sound of the Kibbles bag being picked up and emptied into his bowl. “Every day I have to come and feed them, but I don’t clean up after them.” While Grandma stayed in her daughter’s house during the cold months of the year, Fernando stopped by to care for the house every day. To make sure it was still standing. Before he would leave, he’d check in on the night caretakers who have taken over the garage. Since I can remember, I have never seen a car pulled into it. It was the place where we’d run to to grab the latest bar that the Schwan man delivered from the big freezer in the corner. Or the place where the family would seek shelter when the clouds tried to rain out our barbeques. We would all sit right inside with the grill pulled in with us and the garage door pulled open so we could all share our stories of what stood outside in front of us. The barn across the driveway, the houses farther back where the Mexicans used to live during planting season, the planter waiting to be hooked up the tractor in only a few short months, the shed with a couple of lawn mowers outside turning the grass underneath them yellow, and of course, all the cars. The garage was the place we learned how to clean…sweeping, organizing junk, whathaveyou. It would be where we’d eat watermelon in the summer to try and avoid the bees. Today, it was the cat’s house. Today, cars still don’t sit in it. Instead, there’s toilet paper shredded all across its cement floor that traces back to the bathroom in the corner. The kitty litter box sits right outside of the bathroom door. The yellow is chipping away off the walls and the garage door is rarely ever open. It used to be our playhouse.

I noticed how the rain had flooded a few of the gravesites. It was just a tiny corner of the cemetery. I looked across the street and thought it sort of funny how at the bottom of the hill there had been no flooding at all, but in this one corner, on much higher ground right near the street, there was a little pond with three gravestones peaking out of the muddy water. I pictured the ground underneath. I mean, not just the grass, but everything under the grass. Morbid thought process, I know. But I pictured the mud between the grass and the coffin and hoped that the family purchased a leak proof one. I noticed that the graves around these few had been recently visited. The colors of the flowers weren’t wind-blown and faded. It just seemed obvious that people took advantage of the first spring-like day of the year and replaced the old decorations with new. Little did they know, I guess, that Mother Nature had been tricking us and she had more snow and rain ready to bring us all down again. And those poor plots that had been flooded. I felt bad for the dead. For dead that I didn’t even know. I just felt bad. I felt bad for the person that could pick this day, of all days, to visit the gravesite. Then, I felt bad for the plot and its owner who might not even have anyone to come visit them. It was a mess of a reeling mind, but something about the whole situation just made me sad. \nI thought of Kearstin. She used to be one of my best friends and both of her parents were buried here. I remember both parents well and remember the days that they passed even better. Her mother had lung cancer and passed away the day before Christmas Eve. I was with Kearstin that night when they got the phone call. We were in 6th grade. Her dad passed much more suddenly…a heart attack. I found out the next morning and while I spent my entire day at school with the rest of the circle of girls, Kearstin spent her day planning a funeral. At 17, she planned her father’s funeral. Two days before spring break. \nI looked back at where her father was buried and remembered the day. To this day, every funeral I have gone to, it’s rained. I remembered my heels kept sinking in the mud. We all struggled making it across the yard, but all of us girls shared an umbrella. We were all a family and it was like we’d lost a father, too. We stood under the tarp with the rest of the family. That’s how you knew we were all sisters. The people that stand under the tarp—I mean, it’s like the VIP section at funerals. You don’t just get randoms under there. And we were under there. We were asked to stand there behind her. And I think we cried harder than she did. Now, I wonder how often he gets visited. Every spring break? I know I think of him when that time comes around. I ditched my trip to the Gulf Shore that year to stay home. We all spent every day and every night together. We became something even greater than family that year. It was the best spring break I’ve ever had.   \n\nI don’t talk to her much anymore. From spending every weekend with her in our elementary and junior high days to rarely ever speaking with her now, as strange as it may sound, she is the epitome of the person I wish I could be. This year, over her spring break, the same week that her father died four years ago, she’s going to Cairo as part of Habitat for Humanity. There is nobody else in this world that I admire more than her.

All the while, the walls are covered in the same birds that keep you company in the living room. From the moment you walk in, a rack of shoes brushes your shoulder. Shoes that can no way still be made today. Right ahead of you are the shelves full of sweaters, sweatshirts, Julio Iglesias t-shirts, Enrique Iglesias t-shirts, and of course, Elvis t-shirts. It’s not like other closets. Nothing is hung.

More often than not, someone was coming. \n\nI\\'ve never known what it was to have neighbors until now. Today, I\\'m basking in my own luck of living in Alumni Hall surrounded by the high pitched screams of the new and ecstatic sorority girls, the blasting \"gettin\\' ready to go out for the night\" music, the football and basketball players right above me playing football and basketball RIGHT ABOVE ME, and of course, the sweet sweet scent of Ramen and Mac &amp; Cheese. A dream come true...if you like that sort of thing. When I was younger I lived too far away to be able to ride my bike to meet any of my friends. Now, I place one foot out the door and I\\'m surrounded by doors covered from top to bottom and side to side with brightly colored wrapping paper always cleverly themed to the time of year.

The wait was about 15 minutes which I knew meant more like 30, but luckily I wasn’t in any big hurry. I come to this place every single time I come home for a break. Shear Accents. Clever name. The same stylist works on me every time even though I’m always a walk-in. I feel a little bad for never caring to remember her name, but you can’t miss her. Her red ringlets always pose a challenge for me to decipher whether or not it’s her natural color. To this day, I have no idea, but I don’t care that much. It’s just something to think about when she’s messing with my hair. To tell you the truth, I don’t trust any hair stylist. No matter who it is. I mean, if you fuck up my hair, that’s it. I can’t do anything about it until months after it grows out. Then, I just become one less person who puts money in your hands and the next time I go to get my hair done, I’m even more paranoid than I was with someone I was thinking about starting to trust. No matter what, cutting someone’s hair just seems like an easy thing to screw up. But so far, she’s done alright. And I can always count on walking in and having those big, bright blue eyes greet me. She doesn’t have to say anything. Those puppies speak for her and it’s impossible not to keep good eye contact with her. To tell you the truth, it’s kind of creepy. Crazy “red” hair and big blue eyes…big, like she’s trying to open them wide, but that’s just the way they look normally. She’s nice, though. \n\nToday I went in and her eyes told me she’d be with me as soon as she could. I sat down and took a gander at everyone else getting worked on. Eyes was coloring someone’s hair and some young girl I’d never seen before was doing something to some lady. They were complaining about how they couldn’t get the sound to work on the television. The lady’s husband was nervously pacing around while his wife was getting worked on. Eventually, he started pushing buttons to fix the TV. He seemed very determined to become our hero. He could barely reach it mounted on the wall and as I watched him on his tip toes, I wondered how much of a handy man he was at home. He didn’t look the part. Khaki pants that begged to at least reach the top of his sneakers and his sweater vest made me think he was more of a…well, not a handyman. I was proud to be proven right when I was forced to take my eyes off of the magazine I was thumbing through due to the snow screaming from the television. It startled everyone in the room and we all had to stop what we were doing. The volume was all the way up for sure, but before he had touched anything, I was able to guess what Montel Williams was saying. Now, I was getting a headache. He struggled to fix this problem, but after every few hits of the volume button to turn it down, he had to lay his feet completely on the ground to retrieve his balance. A few seconds later he would lift himself up again to finally hit the volume button a couple more times.  “Just turn it off, Jay,” his wife began to scold him. I immediately started feeling bad for having secretly been making fun of his pants since I got to the salon. His wife wasn’t nice. He obeyed her and again he started pacing back and forth. He would study all the different shampoos holding his hands behind his back. I sincerely felt that he was literally interested in these toiletries. “Jay...Jay…” his wife tried calling him, but he failed to hear her. With each repetition of his name, she sounded more and more like an owner getting impatient with her dog who wasn’t budging from the couch where he wasn’t supposed to be lying. “Jay…Jaaaaay…” the last call was irritated with a little bit of whine. He jumped a little bit when he finally let himself hear his wife’s voice. He turned around and walked next to the chair she was sitting in while her hair was marinating in a bag. I couldn’t hear a word she said, but I heard his reply. “She’s gonna be at the house in about 15 minutes.” He sounded so sweet—like he hadn’t just gotten yelled at. He even called her Honey.\n“15 minutes!? Jay, does it look like I’m going to be finished in 15 minutes?” she snapped back at him. He was clueless. “Does it? That doesn’t even make any sense, Jay,” she continued. No matter what she said to him, she would always include his name before or after the statement. I just felt bad for him.\nCarrot Top called me back as I started watching the way Jay was letting his wife degrade him. As I started walking back, Jay turned back towards the shampoos when I heard his name being whined again. “What now?” I thought. I couldn’t make anything more out after I started getting worked on. I felt like I was so close to figuring out their love story. After I was finished, Jay was gone, but his wife was still there. Laughing, telling stories…she was a completely different person now that Jay was gone. So as I was paying I wondered for a minute if she loved him. I made my decision. \n\nPoor Jay.  And…what a bitch.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pccbyl9r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.39332,39.86426]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Living Room","description":"Posted by Victoria\tI sleep in a lot. I don’t really have a social life here at home right now since all of my friends from around here actually got to enjoy their Spring Break somewhere that’s not Indiana. I woke up this afternoon (yes, afternoon) and when I opened my eyes to yet another dreary day out my window, I heard his little shriek that meant either his grandpa was picking him up or that he was getting his bib put on. I stayed in bed for about 30 seconds processing the idea of collecting myself before getting out of bed and starting the day on foot. I’ve only been home for a couple of days so my parents hadn’t had the time to annoy the hell out of me yet. As of now, we were saying “Good morning” to one another and it was okay for them to tease me about the fact that it was 12 in the afternoon. There’s a good chance that tomorrow it’ll have gotten old. \n\tI walked into the living room only to find my mom reading a book to my niece and my dad lying on the floor with my nephew sitting up next to him and hitting him with a big, blue Lego. As I walked towards the couch, they all stopped to watch me. Audrey is four going on about seventeen. The girl learned to roll her eyes at a very young age and to be brutally honest at an even younger age. “Hiiii, Twitty,” she spoke to me condescendingly. “Have you been sleeping this WHOLE time?” I didn’t feel so bad since she was still in her pajamas. Benjamin is nine months old and I can safely say, he is the number one boy in my life right now. He look over and up at me with his lower lip just hanging with the slightest shimmer of drool weighing it down and his big, brown eyes just working to remember who I was. I stand in front of him and he easily beats me in this staring contest we’ve got going. I know it’s only a matter of time before he—oh, there it is. “There’s that smile, baby! I’ve missed that smile!” His grin turns into a bit of a laugh and a maniacal tossing of his arms and Legos flying all over the place. I step over him and my dad. Sherry Lewis and Lambchop are annoying the hell out of me on the TV, but I’m the only one who’s acknowledging them. After a few minutes I turn my head around to ask where my breakfast is. As I looked over to everyone sitting in front of me, I stop for a second to take it all in. \n\t“Today is Halloween, Clifford!” my mom read. I watched Audrey’s eyes as she read along with her, as much as she could. As she was concentrated, she wouldn’t realize that she was gawking until she felt her mouth being weighed down much like her baby brother’s. I was distracted from Clifford learning about Halloween when Benjamin started another shrieking fit. I watched my dad play with his grandson and wondered what he would think if I told him I was pregnant. I remembered the day my sister sat us all down and told us she was pregnant with Audrey. I didn’t speak to her for weeks and I was the one that had to help my dad as he cried claiming that he wasn’t a good father. Three months after they told us they were having a baby, every tear that streamed from my eyes down to my lavender bridesmaid dress was full of dread and disgust. Today, I’m convinced that they love their children more than they love each other and to be completely honest, I wait every day to hear the announcement that she’s leaving him. Not because he’s a bad father or husband (because he’s absolutely amazing to put up with my sister’s bullshit), but because while my sister is a wonderful mother, she’s a stuck-up, overwhelming bitch to him. After Audrey was born, it didn’t take my dad any time to accept the reality of the situation. The second he held her in his arms, my new brother-in-law was accepted into the family. \n\tI have a sneaky suspicion that he wouldn’t have been so kind to me. The only people in the hospital that day would have been me, my parents, and his parents. I’ll have shamed him too much.  \n\tBut as I sat there and watched everything that was laid out in front of me, I smiled…right there with no one around, with no one to acknowledge it, I smiled. Every once in awhile Benjamin would turn his body around to make sure I was still there and he’d smile as soon as making eye contact. We have a strong connection—much stronger than Audrey and I ever did. She would scream the second I’d walk into the room. Benjamin reaches out for me. I like to think he was brought into this world for not only his own purpose, but for my own well-being—as a reminder that one day, I’ll have to forgive myself.  And every single time that I hold him, I just can’t help but wonder if someone else is looking at me through his eyes. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pcb0w1dp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.52069,39.90409]}},{"properties":{"name":"Under the Table","description":"Posted by Victoria“This is my baby,” she would say. “You wanna hold my baby?” “You wanna see my baby?” she’d proudly outstretch her arms with the fuzzy gray dolphin swaddled surprisingly almost perfectly in the handkerchief. “What’s its name?” we’d ask. And she’d look at us like we were three years old.  She’d squint her eyes, stick out her chin, cock her head to the right and blurt out so matter-of-factly, “Baby.” “Duh,” I thought. \n\n“Come out from under the table, Audrey.” She looked up at her father with a stone face. She blinked twice, looked back down, turned around, and cradled Baby in her arms. There, under the dining room table, sitting in the middle of what looked like rainbow sherbet among dozens of her great-grandmother’s scarves, she took temporary residence. I watched her mother her dolphin and every now and then she’d be distracted to look at the pair of shoes next to her. She’d crawl towards their feet, examine the heels or the laces or the dirt then return to her family. She fit just perfectly under that table. She sat surrounded by walls of the excess tablecloth that draped over the table and dark oak beams that held it up. Underneath her, the cold glossy-finished tiles that were foolishly made to resemble wood—shiny, rigid wood—would take a toll on anyone’s rear after so long. There, under the table where we had all, at one point growing up, created our own world that we’d never want to leave, she sat up on her knees and played house. Of this entire house, she chose the smallest crevice to reside, but there was no question. If any of us had to choose, we’d pick that exact same spot. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pccjidad"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.6373,40.00047]}},{"properties":{"name":"Upstairs","description":"Posted by Victoria“Nice room. It’s too bad I didn’t meet you before you moved out so we could have spent time together up here.” \n\nMario walked Michael around the upstairs of the house which really consisted of 2 rooms in one. It was part of the “grand tour” that every new addition to the family gets. They walked up the narrow, wooden stairs and upon stepping onto the lime green carpet, they were in the living area which consisted of an orange couch (upholstered with plastic), a desk piled with shoe boxes, and a random array of junk. As soon as they took the final step up, to their right was Mario’s room. The small window right ahead of the doorway looked over the backyard. Below its sill sat his bed. “I’m sure you got a lot of action in this bed,” Michael joked and stroked Mario’s arm. The room was small—the size of your typical college dorm room. His dresser took up almost half of the room and in the corner there were flags from his color guard career in high school. And Michael, holding a shiny pink and blue flag in his hand, of course expected, remarked, “And THIS didn’t tell anyone you were gay?” Everyone laughed and walked out to the other room. Next to Mario’s old room was Sol’s. Today, it’s taken up by a train set that used to belong to Fernando. At least that’s what Fernando says. It’s still in debate which brother the set actually belonged to. The window ahead of this door frame looked over the other half of the backyard that we missed from Mario’s window. This room was even smaller and instead of color guard flags, there were carnival stuffed animals and ridiculously large sombreros. “Now, are we sure Sol’s straight?” <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pch6iiyk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.63741,40.00049]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wal-Mart Aisle 21","description":"Posted by VictoriaHere’s something I’ve strongly believed for a very long time. Love is buying tampons for your girlfriend or wife. You know what I mean? I feel that a lot of men have issues with the topic of menstruation, which is understandable, but when it comes to the necessities of getting through that week, we girls usually need all the help we can get. I believe that if he really loves you, he’ll go out and buy you your tampons, or whatever it is that you prefer.  \nI came across true love at Wal-Mart today. He was an older man who, from the looks of his suit, worked in an office somewhere nearby. There was a definite rush going on in all of the 4 out of 30 lanes open. I chose Aisle 21 (20 items or less). Business man in front of me had one thing and one thing only in his hands. A little bag of Always. I stood behind him, keeping enough distance between the two of us that I could chuckle a little to myself. That was it. I can’t make it clear enough that that bag was all that he held in his left hand. My mind simply reeled. \nAs he kept looking all around him, I wondered if he was embarrassed or hoping that none of his business associates would see him. I wondered how much his wife had nagged him to MAKE SURE and stop by Wal-Mart on the way home just to buy these for her. Nothing else but these. I wondered if he struggled with the idea. I wondered if he immediately said, “Okay, dear” before hanging up the phone or if he groaned. Here is the consensus that I came to. He loves his wife. A lot. Because this was the ONLY thing in his hand and he didn’t care to distract the cashier with a lot of random items, not even gum or something, I smiled at the fact that he just loves his wife. Maybe I’ve got it all wrong. He has his story, but as for my belief, he loves her. \nWhen he walked in front of the cashier with his single item, she made the situation even more entertaining for me as she pointed out the exact same mini-bag of Always behind him. “Well, there’s a bag right behind you!” she was very friendly. She was a bigger, black woman with a voice as sweet as her smile…and observations. “Right in the middle of those bags of Cheetos!” I couldn’t help but to laugh out loud at the thought that you don’t see pads in the middle of Cheetos every day. The man turned around and as she handed him his purchase, he held his pads up in the air seemingly proud. “Welp, I’ve got what I need right here!” And indeed he did. Indeed he was quite proud of his pads. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7pc82r16j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.39108,39.85573]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237270","metadata":null,"contact_name":"victoria","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:victoria","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237270","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":23,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237270,platial:user=victoria","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":39503}
