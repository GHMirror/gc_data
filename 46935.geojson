We pass some shops and pubs, abandoned industrial sites, a council estate with tall tower blocks just to the south of us, the industrial deserts of East London to our immediate north. \n\nWe turn off the main road and head north along the Greenway Walk – an council funded path through the industrial wasteland – and walk along a raised path overlooking piles of different kinds of London waste; the City and central London towering up to the west of us, beyond the industrial sites, dumps, and factories. \n\nAt one point we turn off the path and walk through the graffiti landscape between a number of industrial units out onto a desolate road with rows of burnt out and smashed up cars, mountainous piles of tires, waste and broken glass spread across the tarmac. \n\nEventually we turn onto another smaller path and walk along a canal side path between the industrial sites and redevelopment luxury housing sites. We decide upon a spot near one of the locks of the canal and sit down on the concrete platform for some wine and sandwiches. \n\n1. The Greenway Walk, organization of space and materiality, city space and refrains. \n\nThe Greenway Walk seems to constitute a good example of how all city space – even the industrial wasteland we\\'ve just passed – is organized along certain parameters of a dominant practice (like an organized walk through the non-sites of East London). Another example of this is the corporate sponsorship signpost on the South Bank Centre designating the space \\'a place to sit and think\\'. Can we productively think of city space in terms of a great number of such defined territories: forms constituted from complex matter, organs from bodies and refrains from chaos (with Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari), subjects from pre-subjective desire, and so on and so forth?\n\nThe city, then, as a bunch of refrains – a set of repetitive or repeated patterns of spatial organization and practice (walking the dog whilst humming a tune), but also as a potential for displacements of these refrains, for a kind of dissonance, a kind of movement out of seriality or tune, as well as for the constitution of new, different kinds of refrains, different kinds of organization of matter into city space, movements of dissention, dissentious uses and practices taking place on top of, beneath or within, a given organization. Does this present us with a useful way of thinking of interventionist practices in terms of the politics of space? Does this provide us with a useful model for thinking about artistic practice as a form of dissention?  \n\n\n2. The ethical trajectory of artistic practice (continued from previous break).\n\nSummary of discussion from previous break (Temple Mills). \n\nTo what extent can we claim that the ethical trajectory of artistic practice has to do with the process of the practice itself? To what extent does dealing with this process constitute a practice in itself, or, at any rate, a significant part of more expanded a practice? \n\nDo we need to make a distinction here between an ethics – or a kind of morality – lodged in \\'actual\\' differences, existing conditions and their reproduction (i.e. political correctness, the acceptance of cultural differences and \\'the other\\', etc.), and a different kind of ethics, an ethics of the event, an ethics lodged instead in the production of futurity, of potential futures, prototypes for new kinds of living? And if so, what is the link between this kind of ethics and the notion of autonomy, or to be more precise, the notion that post-autonomy involves a process of staking out the discursive-practical ground for new notions, forms and practices of autonomy? Is there a point at which we can begin to think autonomy away from transcendental notions and towards a conceptualization of immanence? \n\nCan we start to try and think autonomy away from individualistic emphases and towards a more collective assertion, towards a collective practice of autonomy? If so, what is the socio-political usefulness of the concept? What is its link to an ethico-political project? What is the usefulness of Niklas Luhmann\\'s notion of art as a social system within the context of this discussion, and to what extent can we extract something from Humberto Muturana and Francisco J. Varela\\'s theorization of allo- and autopoesis? \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hqfs9fpaeu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.020664,51.537661]}},{"properties":{"name":"Greenway Walk, off Pudding Mill Lane, Stratford Marsh","description":"Posted by Ccred<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/ed7893e3e59f166219e905b02c85aa84.jpg\">We walk from Stratford Station along the main road taking us west, through the centre of Stratford and towards the East End.

We cross the cycle tracks and pass through a council estate (or housing project). Out on the main road, on a bridge across the river or railway, we find graffiti sprayed onto the red brick wall: \\'just riot - arts not dead\\'.\n\nWe turn right and pass through parts of the centre of Stratford.

Having passed the river and a canal running alongside it, we turn right and head south towards Stratford, across the cycling club track and into the green areas around Temple Mills. \n\nWe find a spot in the sun, on a slope overlooking central London: to the south, Stratford, further in the horizon the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf and the Docklands area; to the west, the City of London towers up; an abandoned housing project just to the east of us; massive industrial sites and empty land in our more immediate surroundings; to the north the busy A12 carriageway. \n\nIntroductions and brief practice presentations are followed by general discussion.\n\n1. London: Global City; Gentrification, the Olympics 2012, 7/7, Multi-Culturalism.\n\nWhat is this space? What is this space that we have traversed to get here? \n\nIt\\'s got the distinct feeling of being the periphery of the city, a kind of non-space surrounded by motorways, industrial sites, empty land, but, of course, this is also the site of the 2012 Olympics Games and there is huge economical and socio-political investment in the redevelopment and regeneration of the area; a kind of investment that seems linked not to the periphery of the city, but it\\'s most central point, to centrality itself, to the idea of London as global city. \n\nThe day after London won the Olympic Bid, the tube and bus system was targeted in the 7/7 attacks. The detonation of the explosives were quickly followed by the simultaneous establishment of a dominant political rhetoric emphasising \\'multi-culturalism\\' and our \\'sticking together in these difficult times\\', and increasingly intensified forms of local and global socio-political and cultural control and surveillance. \n\nThese are two images that unfolds in different ways in the landscape around us: London as a global city, united in multi-culturalism and a common sense of belonging, and London as a highly volatile social formation, fraught with contradictions and the remnants of centuries of capitalism and imperialism. (And it is pointed out that the concept of multi-culturalism dates back to the British occupation of India and the strategic repression of any resistance to the British colonial regime by the governing body posing one group against another in a rhetoric emphasising, systematizing and utilizing cultural difference as a form of control.) What does the juxtaposition of these two images, and these two events, imply? \n\n2. Interventions and the politics of space. \n\nWhat is space? What is the nature of space? Is all space social? Is all space political? Has all space got a politics? Is all space practiced, functional? Has all space got a set of dominant â€“ and perhaps not so dominant â€“ functions? \n\nWhat is the parameter of a practice seeking to intervene into space? Does all use of space involve or open up to a notion of intervention (an intervention, say, into its dominant functions)? Do we intervene into space when we rupture the texture of its habitual uses, the practices that seem to constitute it socially, politically, culturally? Do we intervene into space when we break or displace our habitual movements, actions and reactions in space; the normative or dominant experience of space offered to us?\n\nWhat is the relation between an intervention, a practice of intervention, and the proposed notion of (post-) autonomy? Does every intervention involve a level or degree of autonomy? Does an intervention, in the sense of a rupture of a dominant function or experience, always involve a moment of autonomy, as in auto and nomos, the establishment of a new, other or different nomos from within an existing terrain, from the practice of rupturing itself in the sense that the rupture also opens up to something \\'new\\' (new, other or different forms of use; new, other or different forms of practice)?\n\n3. Practice, participation and collaboration.\n\nWhat is the value of the notion of the audience, of a practice that operates within the discursive space constituted by the notion of the audience? How does the more contemporary concept of participation and participatory practice relate to this? What is a participatory practice? Nicolas Bourriaud talks about relational practices in a way that seems very linked to a notion of participation, but what is the politics, the institutional politics, of this kind of practice (what participatory relations are being generated by and in these practices)? Are there different notions of participation available to us; notions of participation that perhaps more successfully engage with institutional and cultural politics? \n\nDoes the notion of collaboration, and the notion of cultural micro-scenes, that we perhaps see in some recent â€“ and some not so recent â€“ forms of artistic practice, constitute a break with this kind of participatory paradigm and open up to a more political project dealing with (micro-) chronotopes (to paraphrase Bhaktin), prototypes for new forms of sociality and conviviality, the generation of particular kinds of intentional communities, specific affective experiments and experiences? \n\nWhy is it that we presume that art must reach out to the widest possible audience? Why can art not simply involve a semi-permeable / semi-open scene of different kinds of collaborators? What, if any, is the link between this demand for inclusiveness and the politically totalizing space of liberal capitalism in Europe? To what extent does this model of cultural organization rely on watered down versions of earlier European social democratic, and often equally totalizing if not worse, cultural policies?\n\n4. The event, documentation, representation.\n\nWhat is the status of documentation in relation to intervention or event based (or other forms of more transient, non-object based) artistic practice? At what point does documentation run the risk of designating the death of the actual event (of the event)? Or in other words, at what point does documentation become the object in itself, or even the practice in itself? What are the problematics and issues of representation (in general as well as specifically as documentation)? \n\nIs there a form of documentation that is more open and less authoritarian than more traditional forms of documentation (and the document)? Can we conceive of more productive notions of collaborative documentation, or process based documentation; a kind of remix or editing practice? Do new media technologies tend to provide us with useful tools in this respect, or are they too often stuck in their own seductiveness, novelty, or in the demand for technical know-how they pose on their users? \n\nWhat is the relation between the narrative of or around the event and the event itself? Is the event possible, in this sense, or is it secondary to the politics of representation (as documentation, as narrative)? Do we have to engage with and intervene into this process and these narratives rather than â€“ or as well as â€“ with the actual events to which they refer? Is it perhaps politically naÃ¯ve to dismiss this notion of narratives and focus only on the event, or the intervention, outside of its text, narrative, mythology or representation? \n\n5. The ethical trajectory of artistic practice. \n\nWhat is the ethics of an artistic practice? How does it relate to questions of inclusiveness? How does it relate to the political space of liberal capitalism? Is this a point where we need to make a clear distinction between ethics (and an ethico-political project) and morals, or morality (in Friedrich Nietzscheâ€™s sense)? \n\nIs there something valuable in Alain Badiou\\'s notion of the event, and the idea that ethics is based around a fidelity to the event? Is this something we can \\'translate\\' from the rather traditional notions of art he relies on (in the \\'Ethics\\'), to more contemporary forms of artistic or aesthetic practice? Can we talk, for instance, about the event of collectivity, and subsequently an ethics of fidelity to, at the very least, the potential or the possibility of collectivity?\n \n(For a continuing, albeit very brief, discussion of ethics and artistic practice see the text for Canal Lock, Stratford Marsh.)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hqfsbxxtoz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.016565,51.549538]}},{"properties":{"name":"Temple Mills","description":"Posted by CcredFirst stop with picnic<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hqfsjn1ez6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.017552,51.549698]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Approach Tavern, Approach Road","description":"Posted by CcredFinal stop<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hqfshgz36d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.048687,51.532268]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Approach Tavern, Approach Road, Bethnal Green","description":"Posted by Ccred<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/25db91a282240c46501837040c3ea7cb.jpg\">It\\'s getting very, very cold so we decide to leave.\n\nWe walk across the canal and continue, passing beneath one of the main carriageways leading out of London.
