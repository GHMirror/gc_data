Mr. Carr retired from CarrAmerica after the company\\'s sale to The Blackstone Group in a .6 billion transaction that closed in July 2006. Mr. Carr served in various capacities at CarrAmerica and its predecessor company, The Oliver Carr Company, from 1985 to 2006, including leading the Washington- born company through its initial public offering in 1993 and its national expansion in 1995.

The company is a combination of the former Columbia Equity Trust, a publicly traded company founded by Oliver Carr, and CarrAmerica Urban Development, which Bob Carr runs. J.P. Morgan Chase is the main backer of the new, privately held Carr Properties.\n\n\"It\\'s a collective enterprise both to serve the market and to blend income for our investors,\" said Bob Carr.\n\nCarr Properties will venture into suburban, mixed-use and residential development. But it will not abandon the script that the Carrs have followed over the decades, which is the development of office space in the District. The company\\'s first project is the construction of a 250,000-square-foot office building behind Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church at 901 K St. NW.\n\nEarlier this month, Thomas A. Carr, brother of Bob and Oliver, joined Federal Capital Partners, a regional real estate investment and development company headquartered in the District. Federal Capital said last week it had purchased the 447-unit Park Place Towers in Bladensburg for 4.4 million. The seller was Shaool Construction. (see http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/MD-Bladensburg-Park-Place-Towers.html)\n\nThe Fairmont – 1001 Chillum Road, Hyattsville, MD\n\nThe Fairmont is a 296-unit, 1960s-vintage mid-rise apartment community which FCP is transforming into one of the DC area\\'s most price competitive condominium projects. FCP is investing approximately 0,000 per unit to recondition and reposition the property completely. Improvements include full HVAC-systems upgrades, new elevators and controls, new exterior facades, re-carpeting and reappointing of all interior common-areas, reconditioning of the pool and completion of in-unit upgrades. Pre-sales have materially exceeded expectations.\n\nThe Fairmont addresses the Washington, DC region\\'s need for affordable, \\'fee-owned\\' housing. It is the region\\'s most affordable condominium community, with units priced from 9,000 to 30,000. The property\\'s mid-rise brick-and-block construction, elevator access, campus-like environment and numerous amenities (including pool and exercise room) make it an exceptional value. The Fairmont is located in Hyattsville, one of the area\\'s emerging urban sub-markets.\n\nFCP\\'s focus is on making Fairmont the best \"value\" in the DC condo market. Sales have remained robust, despite the slowing condo market. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7j7lgg9k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.91606,38.94065]}},{"properties":{"name":"910 units- student towers at UTC","description":"Posted by RufuslStudent Housing\n\nConstruction of University Town Center’s 910-bed student housing building is complete.

Crushed cars and stacks of tires surrounded the dog. Beyond that: auto repair shops, a strip joint and a nightclub where police last year arrested the owner in connection with a 220-pound cocaine bust.\n\n\"I\\'ve just found the greatest freaking site,\" Abdo said in his rapid-fire fashion. He lowered both windows. The smell of fuel and oil wafted in. He pointed to a banged-up red Ford. \"That\\'s where the center part of the private green space will be. It can feel like a sanctuary!\"\n\nThis is the vista that has persuaded Abdo to sink more than  million into designs, plans and security deposits to turn 16 industrial acres along New York Avenue and Bladensburg Road NE -- a decrepit stretch that most people barely notice on their way to and from the city -- into 3.5 million square feet of development at a cost that Abdo estimates at .1 billion.\n\nThe site is east of downtown, near the Prince George\\'s County line, and is bordered by New York and Montana avenues and Bladensburg Road NE. The project would include an estimated 3,000 condominiums, some with sweeping views of the Washington Monument, and about 140,000 square feet of retail space. Abdo envisions making it a gateway to the city, adorned with stores like Whole Foods and Crate &amp; Barrel, topped off by condos and a health club, with bike paths to the nearby U.S. National Arboretum.\n\nIt\\'s one of the largest privately financed condominium projects in years in the District, and it comes as the in-town condo market has cooled off. Units take longer to sell, and in some neighborhoods prices are flat.\n\nAbdo agreed that his vision for New York Avenue sounds risky. The site is a mile from the nearest Metro stop and different from what he\\'s done in the past decade: renovate historic buildings -- mostly in the Logan Circle and Dupont Circle areas and one on Capitol Hill -- and turn them into stylish condos and lofts.\n\n\"I know everybody\\'s dying to ask, \\'Jim, are you crazy? Who\\'s going to want to live at New York Avenue and Bladensburg Road?\\' \" he said to a group of builders and brokers at a recent breakfast.\n\nAbdo and his New York partner still need to raise the money to build, and the sale of the land that has five different owners is contingent on a major zoning change this fall. If everything goes well, he hopes to start demolition of what\\'s there by next spring.\n\nAbdo has two other big projects: a 0 million renovation of a historic convent into luxury lofts northeast of Union Station and a 6 million project across the river in Arlington. He is also negotiating to build as many as 600 condominiums above parking garages near the new baseball stadium in Southeast.\n\nAbdo\\'s competitors in an increasingly skittish industry, city planners and Mayor Anthony A. Williams -- a close friend -- are paying more attention than ever to the 46-year-old developer, who arrived in Washington from South Carolina 14 years ago.\n\n\"When you\\'re on the StairMaster, you\\'re looking out at a three-acre park,\" Abdo said, walking past the junkyards one day, talking about his plans. \"We toyed with the idea of tennis courts. . . . Too much land area. What am I doing? I\\'m taking the country-club developers\\' environment and taking it to the urban location.\n\n\"It works all day long,\" he said. \"Who\\'s ever thought of that? No one. Why? Because who has the critical mass? It\\'s not a golf course. It\\'s better than a golf course. Buy a condo and you\\'re in.\"\n\nAbdo got the idea after he met three brothers -- Jerry, Andrew and Dave Schaeffer -- who run a taxicab company their father started more than 50 years ago and have acquired land throughout the city.\n\nThe brothers tried to sell Abdo some land on Capitol Hill, but Abdo wasn\\'t interested. Abdo recalled asking: \"What else do you guys have?\"\n\nThey had quite a bit: 11 contiguous acres near New York and Bladensburg, one of the busiest intersections in the city, where tenants include auto-repair garages, a used-tire salesman, a towing company, a gas station and the Skylark strip club, which operates in a former Roy Rogers restaurant.\n\nThere was only one problem. The brothers were already talking to a group that wanted to build a place for slot machines. Abdo, figuring that slots would never be approved in the District, told the brothers that he would be back the day after the tentative deal expired.\n\nAnd he was.\n\n\"I want to make a big statement . . . something that\\'s going to be remembered for a long time,\" Andrew Schaeffer, 58, remembered Abdo telling him.\n\nWithin two weeks, Abdo essentially met the brothers\\' price, according to Abdo and the Schaeffers. Neither side will say how much Abdo is paying because the deal has not closed. Some brokers and developers estimate the 11 acres to be worth as much as 0 million.\n\nOnce Abdo had persuaded some other landowners around the Schaeffers to sell, he approached Broadway Management, a New York firm that for two decades has developed condos in Manhattan and has three projects in progress in the District.\n\n\"It didn\\'t take us long to decide this was something we wanted to be involved with, based on Jim\\'s capabilities and the opportunity to redevelop part of the city that\\'s in need of it,\" said David Weldler, a Broadway Management principal. \"He understands the D.C. market quite well. He\\'s a visionary.\" Neither Weldler nor Abdo will say how much money they are putting into the project.\n\nAbdo said he knew the project would work when he saw the bumper-to-bumper traffic. City officials say more than 60,000 cars pass through the New York Avenue and Bladensburg Road intersection each day.\n\n\"They\\'re like minnows swimming upstream,\" he said, showing slides of his planned development. \"This is my net. This is my big old net.\"\n\nStill, there are plenty of skeptics who point out that there is little in the area to attract buyers.\n\n\"I\\'m sure he believes in what he\\'s doing and I\\'m rooting for him,\" said Washington developer Monty Hoffman, chief executive of P.N. Hoffman. \"There\\'s not a market there. He\\'ll have to create one.\"\n\nIf Abdo has any doubts about the housing slowdown, they are not evident as he tours the high-end Arlington lofts that will be finished later this year. It\\'s the first time Abdo has built outside the city and one of the few times he\\'s built from scratch.\n\nAbdo -- with closely-cut brown hair flecked with gray -- put on a hard hat, climbed several flights of temporary stairs and looked down on the city around him.\n\n\"Look at these ceiling heights,\" he said, jumping up and down on the concrete floors of a unit with 18-foot ceilings. \"I wanted to bring true honest-to-goodness lofts to a place where everyone else is doing vanilla.\"\n\nTo that end, he ordered new bricks made to look old with black iron spots. And he is also using old bricks, taken from a 130-year-old District building.\n\nWill anyone pay 00,000 to  million?\n\n\"There\\'s 87 units here. I only need 87 people to say, \\'Jim you\\'re crazy, but we love it.\\' \\'\\' Abdo said with a wry smile. \"Right now I\\'m sleeping okay at night.\"\n\nBack in the city, at Second and H streets NE, Abdo pulled up to the former convent, sections of which date to 1870. He plans to sell 44 luxury lofts by next spring. The chapel penthouse is expected to fetch more than  million.\n\n\"This is my baby,\" he said.\n\nAbdo climbed several stories of stairs, walked through an open window and stood on metal scaffolding to show off the old brick structure. He paused, noticing something in the wall.\n\n\"Who the hell is driving a nail into the brick like that?\" he radioed to one of his construction managers. \"Tell them to do it in the mortar joints. They\\'ve chipped the brick. . . . Find out who\\'s doing it and whack them on their hard hat.\"\n\nAbdo has expanded his closely held private company from three people with 87,000 a year in sales to one that employs 55 and expects more than 00 million in sales by next year. He made millions of dollars around Logan Circle, seeing coffee shops in the place of crack houses two or three years before most anyone else did. That caught the mayor\\'s attention.\n\nToday, Abdo and Williams smoke cigars together on Abdo\\'s patio. Abdo tried to get the mayor into fly-fishing, taking him shopping at Orvis with the mayor\\'s security detail in tow. The mayor, who, Abdo says, has a thing for kitchen gadgets, once persuaded Abdo to buy a set of glass bowls at Williams Sonoma. Williams goes to Abdo\\'s weekend farm at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia where he rides an air-conditioned tractor, cutting grass.\n\nAbdo and his wife, Mai, 3-year-old daughter Sophie and 21-month-old son Griffin live in a three-story brick house off Massachusetts Avenue NW that was once the home of the former ambassador from Ghana. It is assessed at .2 million. Vernon Jordan lives across the street. Torched bluestone lines the pool out back. A 1939 Steinway sits in the living room. The kitchen has a Viking stove, two Viking dishwashers and a double Viking refrigerator. Inside, Abdo lines up plastic containers of crab meat the way other people might stack yogurt.\n\n\"We\\'re minimalists,\" Abdo said jokingly as he served grilled steaks, vegetables and peach pie with vanilla ice cream on a recent evening in his perfectly manicured back yard.\n\n\\'7-Year-Old Capitalist\\'\n\nJim Abdo seemingly picked a terrible time to come to Washington to develop real estate. In 1992, the District had just chalked up 443 killings, helping it maintain a reputation as the nation\\'s murder capital. Two years earlier, Marion Barry had been caught on tape smoking crack.\n\nBut Abdo had a few things going for him, the first being a thirst for money. The third child of a Palestinian immigrant who worked as a tool designer and a mother who taught English and social studies before staying home to raise four children, Abdo grew up in Kent, Ohio. As a 7-year-old he saw the homeowners on his paper route as prospects for a variety of services. Snow \"meant dollar signs to me,\" Abdo said.\n\nAbdo put himself through the College of Wooster, studying sociology, and graduated in 1982. He followed a girlfriend to Hilton Head, S.C., where he opened a pizza parlor with a 0,000 loan that his father co-signed. For 3 1/2 months, he said, he slept on a cot in the back supply room, but in four years he had five restaurants.\n\nBy 1992, he was tiring of the restaurants, sold some of them and moved to Washington with 50,000 to start a new chapter in his life.\n\n\"I\\'m Jim Abdo, the little 7-year-old capitalist who has to make money,\" he said.\n\nHe began slowly, buying a rowhouse in Georgetown, helping a contractor restore it, and selling it. Next, he bought a trashed house in Dupont Circle and turned it into condos.\n\nAt the time, most developers wouldn\\'t go east of 16th Street. To Abdo, the Victorian houses and rowhouses in and around Logan Circle, a gathering spot for prostitutes and drug dealers, seemed like a gold mine.\n\nHis strategy was to gut the houses, save historic elements. and put in high-ceilinged condos, apartments and lofts. He installed Sub-Zero refrigerators and Wolf stoves, bathroom fixtures from the Georgetown store Waterworks, and honed limestone from Italy. That lured buyers, which lured retailers, which lured more buyers.\n\nCarol Felix, a Logan Circle resident and marketing consultant, said Abdo had a gift for explaining why his units were worth their high prices. \"He\\'s always telling you a joke, even if he\\'s telling you he\\'s charging you 00 more a square foot,\" Felix said.\n\nAbdo moved to larger apartment buildings and commercial properties. When drug dealers kept crowding around a pay phone on P Street NW, a spot Abdo was fixing up for CVS and the Logan Hardware store, he called the phone\\'s owners several times, asking them to remove it. When they wouldn\\'t, he had his construction workers rip it out and toss it into a Dumpster -- quarters and all, Abdo recalled, as he munched on a Think Thin energy bar.\n\nHe showed another side, too. When Theo Turner, a man living in a nearby church basement, turned up asking for work, Abdo hired him to carry supplies and sweep up debris -- and kept him on for years. Abdo also leased a basement apartment to Turner at a reduced rent in one of his renovated buildings near 15th and P streets NW. Not long ago, Abdo visited Turner in a hospital, where he was being treated for a heart attack.\n\nIn 2002, Williams presided over the marriage of Abdo and Mai at the Meridian House in Kalorama. After that, Williams became a regular at their house. The mayor is godfather to Abdo\\'s son.\n\n\"He calls me the chief,\" Williams said. \"My wife calls me Hey You. It balances out.\"\n\nSince the beginning of 2000, Abdo or his company have contributed 1,550 to District candidates, including ,000 to Williams and ,500 to four candidates in this year\\'s race for mayor.\n\nAbdo admits he drops the mayor\\'s name, which some people find irritating. \"It\\'s because he\\'s a friend,\" Abdo said. \"I\\'m an outward, vocal person and if I see someone over the weekend I start rattling off. If that\\'s interpreted as name-dropping, I\\'m sorry.\"\n\nAs Abdo pursues his New York Avenue plans, he says the quality of his projects and the uniqueness of his design will create a market, regardless of broader trends.\n\nOn April 6, he presented his plans to a seven-member Advisory Neighborhood Commission. About 40 residents came out, and Abdo had the opportunity to display attributes important for a developer -- charm and salesmanship.\n\n\"I\\'m from a working-class family,\" Abdo said. \"That\\'s the idea here. We\\'re not trying to compete with Dupont Circle or Kalorama. These will be at least 50 a foot less than what they\\'d cost in Northwest.\"\n\nFrom the front row, resident Debbie Smith let loose a harrumph, shaking her head at the notion that working-class people would pay upward of 99,000 for a studio and 90,000 for a three-bedroom condominium.\n\nSomeone else asked about rising property taxes. That prompted Abdo\\'s new vice president -- Eric W. Price -- to jump up and address the crowd. They knew him from his previous job as deputy mayor for planning and economic development, which he held for five years. He played a major role in luring a baseball team to the District and jump-starting the redevelopment of the old convention center site. Now they listened as Price, 44, calmly walked through tax-break programs that could keep older residents on tight incomes in their homes, even as their property values rose.\n\n\"New York Avenue can become a place of Whole Foods, hair salons, boutiques and coffee shops,\" Abdo said. \"We\\'ve done this before on 14th Street and at Logan Circle and we\\'re doing it on H Street. We\\'ll tackle the tough areas. We\\'re not here to give you lip service. We\\'re here to make it happen.\"\n\nIt made for a compelling pitch.\n\n\"I\\'m tired of fighting the same garbage,\" Joan E. Black, a neighborhood advisory commissioner, told the crowd. \"We want to improve our standard of living.\"\n\nWithin 30 minutes, the advisory panel endorsed the plan by a 5 to 1 to 1 vote.\n\n \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7iva9f8w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.97554,38.91581]}},{"properties":{"name":"Art District Hyattsville by EYA - 500 new townhomes","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> EYA Townhomes in Gateway Arts District20 acre development on old Lustine auto site.

The Town of Bladensburg requested this sector plan amendment to the 1994 Approved Master Plan and SMA for Bladensburg-New Carrollton and Vicinity (Planning Area 69) in the spring of 2004. This request was a key implementation step determined by the “Feasibility Study for the Town Center Project”, which was commissioned by the Town and completed in April 2004. This study explored the possibility of creating a town center for the town of Bladensburg, utilizing the construction of new, expanded municipal offices as a catalyst for the larger development.\n\nThe new sector plan will establish goals, policies and strategies to guide the future growth of the town center in the Town of Bladensburg. The recommended land use, zoning, and design guidelines will help establish a foundation for new real estate and economic development activity appropriate for a regional center along the General Plan designated Developed Tier Corridor of Annapolis Road.

There is always a place for the independents -- hopefully,\" says Stephen Needel, a longtime drugstore owner in Landover Hills.

This month, the Prince George\\'s County Council amended zoning laws to allow Wal-Mart, the world\\'s largest retailer and grocer, to open its first store inside the Capital Beltway late next year. The site is the abandoned Capital Plaza Mall, about a mile from Chandler\\'s.\n\"Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart,\" Needel said. \"There is always a place for the independents -- hopefully.\"\nYet history suggests that where Wal-Mart goes -- and with 3,600 stores in the United States, it is close to everywhere -- small businesses often disappear. Some community leaders also have concerns about how the Bentonville, Ark., company, the nation\\'s largest employer, treats its 1.6 million workers, who are not unionized.\nWal-Mart, which has stores in Bowie and Clinton, said its hourly wage in the region is 0.08, compared with 3.19 at Giant and Safeway, whose employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. The company offers a health plan, but labor leaders, who have tried unsuccessfully to organize Wal-Mart\\'s workforce, said the wages are so low that employees cannot afford to pay premiums.\n\"Wal-Mart doesn\\'t have the greatest reputation,\" council member David Harrington (D-Cheverly) said. \"It leads to low wages and little benefit.\"\nStill, community leaders and residents said, most people who have qualms are ready to set aside those concerns for anything that might help Landover Hills and its Annapolis Road corridor, which has been in an economic tailspin.\nEven Needel said he has hated watching Capital Plaza, which takes up several blocks, turn into another abandoned building.\n\"I really do think it will be an igniter,\" said the Rev. Terence D. Collins, executive director of the Community Ministry of Prince George\\'s County, a nonprofit group that works with unemployed and low-income residents. \"There has to be a starting point, and that\\'s what I see Wal-Mart as.\"\nIt has been almost 20 years since shoppers strolled the mall, which was anchored by Montgomery Ward and Bradlees. Girls bought shoes at Fayva, and women shopped for clothes at Merry-Go-Round.\n\"Everything was leased up, the traffic flow was great and we had quite a number of national tenants,\" said Randall J. Levitt, president of Nellis Corp., which owns and manages Capital Plaza.\nWhen Bradlees left the Washington market, Hechinger, the hardware and lumber company, moved in. \"It was a good retailer but not a good anchor for a mall,\" Levitt said. A person buying lumber isn\\'t likely to buy a pair of shoes or a dress at the same time, he said.\nMontgomery Ward and Hechinger filed for bankruptcy, leaving Capital Plaza about five years ago. That left mostly small local businesses working on month-to-month leases.\n\"Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart.

But they are better than nothing.\"\nCollins recently witnessed the area\\'s need for economic revival firsthand as he watched his son play football a few blocks from the Capital Plaza site.

Two nearby apartment buildings, built nearly four decades ago, would be demolished. New construction would replace them, and the residents who occupy the 1,000 units would be relocated.\n\t\n\nThe Landover Mall site covers most of the area planners want to develop.

The area has changed, however, in the past couple of decades: Crime rates have risen, housing stock has eroded and student academic performance has slipped.\n\n\"We have some of the crime stuff, the transient kind of moving,\" said Sylvester Vaughns, 71, a member of the county planning board and longtime Landover resident.\n\nThe proposal to transform Landover into a residential and cultural hub is an example of what is happening in inside-the-Beltway communities throughout the county, with private-public development projects boosting the profiles of areas including Hyattsville and Suitland.\n\nFor example, a two-mile strip in Hyattsville that was once filled with auto repair shops and liquor stores is being reshaped into an arts and entertainment district, where condominiums with lofts are being marketed to artists.\n\nFarther south, Suitland Manor, a 33-acre complex of barracks-style apartments, is being demolished, and an 0 million development of single-family houses, condominiums and rental apartments will be built. County officials say a developer will soon be selected for the project, part of an overall residential and commercial center in Suitland.\n\nHarrington said the Landover development hinges on a commitment from Lerner Corp., which owns the mall property. Lerner\\'s 88 acres cover more than two-thirds of the area being considered for development.\n\n\"We\\'re very much on board,\" said Joel Rozner, an attorney for Lerner.\n\nOver the years, Lerner has been approached at different times with proposals to relocate the county seat, school board headquarters and Prince George\\'s Hospital Center to its site off Brightseat Road. Lerner showed interest, but none of the proposals came to fruition.\n\nRozner said that the company wants a \"vibrant mixed-used development\" on the property and that the current plans are a \"work in progress.\"\n\nPlanners are drafting the Landover Gateway Sector Plan, which would cover the demolished mall site, two aging apartment complexes, the Landover Crossing Shopping Center -- a half-empty complex with a liquor store, nail salon and barbecue takeout restaurant -- and a nearby abandoned used-car dealership. The county would need to make a zoning change in the area from commercial and residential to mixed use.\n\nFor years, community activists and residents of Landover, which includes the neighborhoods of Palmer Park, Kentland, Glenarden and Brightseat, have urged the county to push for revitalization of the area.\n\t\n\nThe Landover Mall site covers most of the area planners want to develop.

The plan hinges on a commitment from its owner, Lerner Corp., an official said. (Maryland-national Capital Park And Planning Commission)\n\nDiane McGlone, 53, said she wants beauty and jobs brought back to the area.\n\nThe Palmer Park resident remembers shopping, going to dinner and seeing movies at Landover Mall, which sits at the Capital Beltway and Landover Road, during its heyday in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe mall, with Garfinckels, Woodward &amp; Lothrop and Hecht\\'s as its anchors, was a landmark in the county for three decades. Before Bowie Town Center was built, people from across the region converged on the mall, which provided shoppers with the type of quality stores offered in nearby Montgomery and Fairfax counties.\n\nBut a stabbing on mall property, a shooting at a nearby apartment complex that left five people dead and a surge in overall crime in the area in the late 1980s and early 1990s frightened shoppers and eventually helped fuel the mall\\'s rapid decline.\n\nBy the time the mall closed in 2002, it had been reduced to a shell of its former self, its fashionable stores replaced with others selling items for a dollar, McGlone said. Only Sears remains of what used to be Landover Mall.\n\n\"Whatever they do, it will be beneficial for the community,\" McGlone said.\n\nBut not everyone is so certain.\n\nGlenarden Mayor John W. Anderson said he is worried about the thousands of people, many of them low-income, who will be forced from their homes.\n\n\"Where are they going to go?\" Anderson asked. \"Somebody needs to be concerned about that. . . . It\\'s not that I\\'m not advocating for development, but you have to also be concerned about the people who are going to be displaced.\"\n\nArthur Berlin, general partner of the Maple Ridge Apartments, which has more than 400 units, said he is interested not in selling his property, but in improving it. Berlin said he\\'d like to see a more upscale community, but he also wants \"to make sure long-term tenants are able to react to the situation.\"\n\nHarrington said the redevelopment of the area is designed to complement the nearly  billion mixed-use development being built less than two miles away, known as Woodmore Towne Centre at Glenarden. The 245-acre development, set to open next year, will include condominiums, a hotel, office space and a Wegmans grocery store.\n\n\"The two areas would strengthen each other,\" said Christine Osei, a county planner who is working on the Landover plan.\n\nOsei said an outline of the development should be finished by the end of the year. A public hearing is expected to be held in February, and the council will consider it for final approval at the end of next year, according to the projected timetable.\n\n\n\nOfficials focusing on Landover Mall\nAbandoned shopping center is down the road from site of new Wegmans\nThursday, June 8, 2006\nby Marcus Moore\nStaff Writer\nNow that Prince George’s County has landed its first major upscale retailer — Wegmans Food Market in Landover — county and business officials have turned their attention to nearby Landover Mall, which for four years has been an eyesore and vivid reminder of the economic development obstacles the county faces.\nArthur Turner, chairman of the Prince George’s Chamber of Commerce’s economic development committee, has criticized owner Lerner Enterprises of North Bethesda for its failure to revitalize the mall.\n‘‘Landover Mall has been a black eye on the county, because of the deterioration that Lerner allowed to happen at the mall,” Turner said. ‘‘While there’s been an effort to revitalize Landover Mall, the biggest obstacle has been the owner, and we have continued to work around them.”\nThe mall — on Route 202 near FedEx Field — is across from a used-car dealership and the 173,495-square-foot Landover Crossing Shopping Center, which has lost both its anchor stores in two years. Sam’s Club closed its doors at the 19-acre shopping center in August, delivering a blow to a center that had already lost Circuit City — its other anchor — to the Boulevard at the Capital Centre in Largo.\nBut before the area gets a major face-lift, much of the land would have to be rezoned, said County Councilman David Harrington (D-Dist. 5) of Cheverly.\nWhile Landover Mall is important to the city’s revitalization, it is not the key component, Harrington said.\n‘‘I don’t think it necessarily depends on Landover Mall,” Harrington said. ‘‘The days of having a mall like Landover doesn’t speak to the current marketplace. The development of the Woodmore Towne Centre will help the development of Landover Mall.”\nHarrington said he met Friday with Lerner officials, who agreed to develop a mixed-use project on the 110-acre property. Lerner officials are scheduled to meet with residents for feedback on the project in the next two weeks, he said. Portions of the mall are now being demolished.\nLerner representatives did not return phone calls seeking comment.\nThe Maryland-National Park and Planning Commission will spend the next two years analyzing Landover Mall and its vicinity, said John Funk, project facilitator of the Landover Mall and Vicinity Planning Study. The commission analyzed redevelopment opportunities for the area during the project’s first phase, which was completed in April. Starting in July, the commission will create a master plan for the area.\n‘‘It’s really a redevelopment strategy that the County Council asked us to look into,” Funk said.\nLandover Mall closed its doors in 2002, leaving only a Sears that remains open. Last September, Dimensions Healthcare System targeted the mall as a site for a 00 million hospital, complete with restaurants, hotel and a 250-bed hospital tower, but those plans have stalled.\n‘‘There wasn’t any fire under that,” Harrington said. ‘‘There was some interest to move there, but they had no funds to build there.”\nDown the road, Petrie Ross Ventures of Annapolis is developing the 245-acre, 8.5 million Woodmore Towne Centre, anchored by a 130,000-square-foot Wegmans Food Market. The store, scheduled to open in late 2008, will have about 700 employees, said Ralph A. Uttaro, senior vice president of real estate development for the Rochester, N.Y., chain.\nUttaro has called Landover an ideal location because of its proximity to the Capital Beltway.\nTurner agreed, calling Landover the center of Prince George’s and saying the city’s pending revitalization was a long time in the making.\n‘‘It’s not an accident. It’s by design,” Turner said. ‘‘Seeds have been planted for quite some time and now they’re germinating.”\nMall\\'s Comedown Taints Lerner Image\nResentment of Nats\\' New Owner Lingers in Pr. George\\'s\nBy David Nakamura\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nTuesday, May 16, 2006; Page B01\nAfter being named owner-to-be of the Washington Nationals, Theodore N. Lerner proclaimed that the team and the new ballpark in Southeast would be his legacy, the capstone in a long, distinguished career as one of the region\\'s most influential builders.\nTysons Corner Center in Fairfax County, White Flint Mall in Montgomery County and Dulles Town Center in Loudoun County are a few of the projects on which the 80-year-old Bethesda developer has made his reputation.\n\"The baggage and ghost of Landover Mall still negatively impact us today,\" says activist Arthur A. Turner Jr. of the Lerner Enterprises complex. (By Lois Raimondo -- The Washington Post\nBut in Prince George\\'s County, Lerner\\'s legacy is clouded by the fate of the Landover Mall, a once-thriving retail destination whose long, slow decline was punctuated when it was shuttered in 2002. Built and owned by Lerner Enterprises, the complex -- on a 110-acre site just inside the Capital Beltway, near the Washington Redskins\\' FedEx Field -- has sat dark and empty for four years, with the exception of a Sears store that remains open. The marquee is covered in sheets, the grass is calf-high and the vast parking lot is used for overflow football crowds.\nSome Prince George\\'s civic activists and the administration of former county executive Wayne K. Curry (D) have charged that the project symbolizes the broad neglect of the predominantly black county by major developers and retailers.\n\"When I look at the news and read stories, everyone fawns over what a great man he is,\" said Arthur A. Turner Jr., an activist from the nearby Kettering neighborhood who has lobbied county leaders to seize the property through eminent domain. \"But the baggage and ghost of Landover Mall still negatively impact us today. He\\'s a failure in Prince George\\'s County.\"\nCurry, who was county executive from 1994 to 2002, complained that Lerner invested heavily in his malls in other jurisdictions but failed to reinvest in Landover Mall after it opened in 1972.\nOther county residents and the administration of current County Executive Jack B. Johnson (D) have been more tempered, saying they hope the Lerner company will redevelop the site. They say Lerner could ride the momentum created by several new projects, including the Boulevard at the Capital Centre, featuring the Magic Johnson movie theaters, and the Woodmore Town Centre, which will include a Wegmans grocery store.\nAlan H. Gottlieb, chief operating officer of Lerner Enterprises, said company officials have met a half-dozen times with Prince George\\'s leaders in the past year.\n\"We listened to their vision for the site and spoke of our desire to build a great project,\" Gottlieb said in an e-mail. \"We discussed potential uses and shared information to create the foundation for a working partnership with the county.\"\nGottlieb added that Lerner Enterprises has made significant investment in Prince George\\'s beyond Landover Mall: The company owns the Greenbelt Marriott and helped build 3,000 apartment units in the county.\nLandover Mall opened when Prince George\\'s was still a predominantly white county. A regional attraction, the mall featured high-end department stores, a movie theater and an ice cream shop.\nBut when anchor stores Garfinckel\\'s, Raleighs and Woodward &amp; Lothrop went out of business, the mall began to decline. The Gap moved out, and the Dollar Store moved in. Meanwhile, the county was changing, too, becoming predominantly African American, with a higher level of affluence outside the Capital Beltway but growing social problems.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7j11zi0l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.855974,38.918618]}},{"properties":{"name":"M Square University of Maryland Research Park - 2.3M SF- 6,500 net new jobs","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> MSquare University of Maryland Research Park During the past three to five years, the University of Maryland has made tremendous progress in a number of important areas. Rapid advances in research, education, and service have propelled the University into the top tier, and we are now ranked 17th among national public research universities according to the U.S. News &amp; World Report. This year, the University of Maryland received approximately 52 million in direct research funding. On average, each faculty member brings in 45,540 in research funds each year.\n\nThe University of Maryland\\'s close proximity to Washington, D.C., grants us the opportunity to interact closely with nearby federal research agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). As a result, the University is able to work closely with government researchers and the policy-makers who guide federal research initiatives. Much of our research funding comes from federal sources, and the collaboration between the University and the federal government has enabled the Campus to participate in a variety of incredibly important scientific areas, including food safety, secure wireless communications, nanotechnology and biotechnology, homeland security, and transportation safety. Our faculty researchers also work with the State of Maryland, and the work that they do significantly impacts the economic life of the State and the surrounding region. The creation of a new research park, the 128-acre University of Maryland Enterprise Campus (also known as M Square), has already had significant impact on the University\\'s ability to attract new research activities and businesses to the area. Private funding is also central to our research programs, and many large corporations use the University\\'s broad expertise in science, engineering and business to design and build better models and products for consumers and industry.\n\nThe momentum of recent years has poised the University of Maryland to take leadership in shaping the research university of the 21st century. By virtually every measure of quality, the University of Maryland has gained national recognition as one of the fastest rising comprehensive research institutions in the country. It is, indeed, a very exciting place to be. You are cordially invited to visit the College Park campus. Our faculty and staff will be pleased to explore with you the fit between your research interests and career aspirations, and the particular strengths of our programs and faculty. I look forward to welcoming you.\n\nDr. Jacques S.

Adjacent to the University of Maryland, ranked among the nation\\'s top 20 public research universities, and located just 8 miles from the Nation\\'s Capital, the University of Maryland Research Park offers flexible space locations from incubator space for start up companies to build to suit options for larger technology clients in Maryland\\'s largest research park.\n\nThe park is served by the Washington Metro Subway and a commuter rail station providing service to both Washington DC and Baltimore, Maryland. The park\\'s location serves to link physically and programmatically university researchers, students and staff with federal laboratories and private sector companies.\n\nKey technology clusters at the park include: homeland and national security (the DOD-funded Center for Advanced Study of Language and the National Foreign Language Center); environmental and earth sciences (the NOAA National Weather and Environmental Prediction Centers) and food safety and food security (the FDA Center for Food Safety, Maryland Center for Food, Nutrition, and Agricultural Policy and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service).\n\nOther facilities near the park include the headquarters for the nation\\'s leading physics societies (American Center of Physics) and emerging private technology companies in fields from medical devices to information security.\n\nThe park is located in a HUB zone, with a mixed use housing and retails options scheduled for construction at the College Park/University of Maryland Metro station and adjacent to the park.\nMaryland\\'s intellectual property is here. M Square, a 130-acre research park adjacent to the University of Maryland, offers a wealth of advantages including access to the brainpower, facilities and partnerships within a top-ranked research university; proximity to major labs and federal agencies; and a prime, inside-the-beltway location next to the College Park/UM Metro station. Once completed, M Square will be the largest research park in the region with over 2.5 million sq. ft. of public and private research,lab and incubator space. \n\nM Square currently has space available with another 75,000 square feet under construction and deliverable in late 2005. \n\nTo learn more about partnership opportunities available at the University of Maryland and with M Square, contact Brian Darmody, Assistant Vice President of Research and Economic Development at bdarmody@umd.edu or call 301.405.1990.\nRecently (2006) signed 270,000 SF lease with NOAA.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7j4cu8qm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.929188,38.981864]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mosaic at Metro Affordable Apts - 264 units (HUD)","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Mosaic at Metro - Hyattsville -264 unitsMosaic at Metro\n264-Unit, Affordable Apartment Community\nClark Realty Builders, LLC was selected to construct this 264-unit HUD apartment community in Hyattsville, Maryland.

Zahner Co. of Kansas City, which manufactures custom architectural and ornamental metals.\n\"The technology on how to use the metal correctly has really come together in the last five years, he said. \"If they\\'re put up correctly they can last 100 years, and they\\'re fully recyclable.\"\nSome institutions, including Howard University, have installed zinc walls on buildings. Metal salesmen say some developers in the Washington region have inquired about zinc or plan to install it in new multi-unit residential buildings or single-family homes.\nThe loft building in Hyattsville, the Plaza Lofts 22, is nestled among five office buildings; 112 condominiums that are under construction; a 244-unit student apartment building; restaurants and a movie theater. Those buildings are made of brick or precast concrete.\n\"This is our jewel building,\" said Chris Hanessian, chief operating officer for developer University Town Center LLC. \"The zinc doesn\\'t discolor. It just holds up naturally.\"\nZinc\\'s reactions with compounds in the atmosphere allow it to effectively heal itself when scratched, like human skin.\n\"All the other buildings focus in on this building,\" Hanessian said. \"Thousands of office workers look down at the building. Student housing looks down at the building. It\\'s a focal point.\"\nMatt Lamb, senior designer with WDG Architecture of the District, who worked on the Hyattsville project, said another benefit of zinc is that it is lighter in weight, which will put \"less stress\" on the underground parking garage.\nHyattsville, a city of about 16,000, has an eclectic population that includes a concentration of artists.\nBut struggling artists, in all likelihood, won\\'t be able to afford lofts in the building, which also has an environmentally friendly green roof with vegetation, Hanessian said. The one- and two-bedroom units, slated to be completed by fall, range from 00,000 to 50,000, and about 80 percent are already sold.\nMichael Jung, a manufacturer\\'s representative for Umicore Building Products USA, which sold the French-made zinc for the Hyattsville project, said of the metal\\'s growing popularity in the United States: \"I call it the oldest new metal on earth. It\\'s beautiful stuff. It\\'s more expensive than steel and aluminum. In price it\\'s equal to that of copper.\"\nBut he said some universities have used it, in part, to save money.\n\"They can afford to save money,\" he said. \"It\\'s like buying a Mercedes-Benz. It\\'s a lot of money upfront, but hey, it\\'s still working years later.\"\nInstalling this particular zinc, which is mixed with traces of copper and titanium, won\\'t be a snap.\nDean Jagusch, project manager for Roofers Inc. of Baltimore, said that between prepping the building and the walls and cutting out spaces for windows, the installation will take a crew of eight about two months.\n\"It\\'s a unique kind of job,\" he said\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7j15jhfl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.95271,38.96768]}},{"properties":{"name":"Port Towns CDC ofc.- 4217 Edmonston Rd., Bladensburg","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Port Towns CDC ofc.- 4217 Edmonston Rd., Bladensburgweb site has a lot of information!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7izsagh2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.933653,38.942012]}},{"properties":{"name":"Post Park - Luxury rental EW HWY","description":"Posted by RufuslDeveloped by Post Properties.\nDan Lynch represents them.\nStormwater problem.\nCorporate Profile\nPost Properties, Inc.

Ground has been broken for 725,000 square feet of mixed-use space at University Town Center (UTC) in Hyattsville, Maryland. Between now and early 2006, the existing 1.3 million SF office complex, located across the street from the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station, will add a unique 16-story residence for some 900 college and graduate students, a 16-screen movie theater, and over 250,000 SF of retail space. \n\nFrom the Ground Up\nHyattsville Complex Adds Restaurants to Mix\n\nBy Ylan Q. Mui\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, June 12, 2006; Page D03\n\nThe 60 million University Town Center development in Hyattsville is entering its final stages, with several restaurants signing deals that developers hope will turn the 56-acre site into an entertainment destination in Prince George\\'s County.\n\nThe project is off East-West Highway, about a mile from the University of Maryland and near the Hyattsville Metro station. It is already home to four office buildings with roughly 5,000 workers, mainly from government agencies.\n\t\nThe developer, Prince George\\'s Metro Center Inc., wants to channel the foot traffic from those buildings into several restaurants and retailers. Old Dominion Brewpub recently agreed to rent 10,000 square feet. Other restaurants to open include Tokyo Sushi, Mongolian Grill and Salad Creations.\n\nA New York-based coffee and wine bar and a seafood restaurant are also negotiating for space.\n\nConsolidated Theaters is building a 14-screen cineplex. Safeway has begun construction of one of its new \"lifestyle\" stores. Madison Retail Group, which is leasing the project, said it expects to announce more tenants soon.\n\nOne of the goals of the project is to attract higher-end retail to Prince George\\'s County. Residents have long complained about the lack of sit-down restaurants and upscale shopping in one of the country\\'s wealthiest predominantly African American counties.\n\nWearing a hard hat, Prince George\\'s Metro Center Inc. President Herschel W. Blumberg, 82, walked through the construction area last week and imagined the end product: wide sidewalks, landscaped greenery and plenty of people.\n\nA preview party for the project\\'s eight-story condo building was held last week. Construction is to begin at the end of this summer on another condo building, with a curved zinc facade and a loft-like atmosphere. A 910-bed student housing complex will open in the fall, intended to draw tenants from the University of Maryland and Howard and Catholic universities, among others.\n\nThe project should be finished within a year, with the exception of the Safeway, which is expected to open in 2008.\n\nThe Mall at Prince George\\'s, near Blumberg\\'s site, has Target, Old Navy, JCPenney and Hecht\\'s as anchors. Home Depot is nearby. \"This area is changing dramatically,\" Blumberg said. \"We don\\'t mind the competition.\"\n\nBlumberg bought the land in 1954. He built office complexes but was unable to put together the mixed-use development he envisioned.\n\nNow that the tide is turning, Blumberg said he is glad that he kept the property. As he walked the site, he showed off the slabs of concrete that will become patios for the condos and the steel beams that will hold up the building\\'s walls. From the top of the student apartments, the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral could be seen near the horizon.\n\"He had this dream for 50 years,\" Tim R. Taylor, vice president of leasing for Prince George\\'s Metro Center, said of Blumberg. \"He wanted to see it come to fruition.\"\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7izb07tm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.951482,38.971388]}},{"properties":{"name":"Washington Gateway - Target - 123,770 SF","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Wash Gateway - New Target- 2008 123,770 SFStep into any Target store in any city in the country, and you know exactly what to expect: high-quality, stylishly designed items plus all the essentials for your life, displayed in a clean, organized and welcoming environment.

Peterson is a prolific suburban retail developer; Washington Gateway would be its first retail development in D.C.\n\nThe 350,000- to 400,000-square-foot power center could break ground this fall and be completed in late 2005. With the three potential tenants, the project would be about two-thirds committed, says Paul Weinschenk, vice president of retail at Peterson (www.petersoncos.com).\n\nOnce those deals are worked out, attention will turn to signing a couple of retail stores in the 15,000- to 20,000-square-foot range, filling 30,000 to 40,000 square feet more in smaller shop space and landing up to four restaurants.\n\n\"We\\'re getting there,\" Weinschenk says. \"We\\'re telling a story to the retailers, and helping to educate them about the market and letting them know there is income to be spent.\"\n\nThe average household income in Northeast is 6,000 a year. And about 135,000 vehicles a day pass the site on New York Avenue and 50,000 a day pass along South Dakota Avenue.\n\n\"If it\\'s designed correctly and managed correctly -- and the mix is set up properly -- these centers [in lower-income areas] are very successful ... ,\" says Gary Rappaport, president of The Rappaport Cos.

Before that, Fort Lincoln had tried for eight years to develop the site. Federal Realty Investment Trust also took a stab at it, as did Trammell Crow.\n\nThough it can sometimes be a challenge to convince retailers of a market\\'s viability, Lake says, \"once they get into that density with a captive audience, it\\'s incredible the volumes they do.\" \n\narticle from 2004\nDevelopers at the gate for Costco-anchored center\nWashington Business Journal -\nby Eleni Kretikos\nSenior Staff Reporter\n\nDevelopers are pushing to break ground this year on Washington Gateway, a 8 million shopping center in Northeast D.C. that would bring Costco to the District.\n\nBut first, they have a few important issues to hammer out with the city.\n[0]\n\n\nIn December, the D.C. Council approved 0 million in tax-increment financing for the 390,000-square-foot shopping center, which is bounded by New York and South Dakota avenues and 33rd Place, near the entrance to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.\n\nNow the developers and the city are working on the development agreement, a process that could be completed in the next 45 days.\n\nWashington Gateway is envisioned as the commercial center of the Fort Lincoln area. Development is planned on all but about 40 of its 265 acres, but that\\'s likely to change soon.\n\n\"It\\'s now a matter of the deals coming to fruition,\" says Tony Freeman, chief executive of the National Capital Revitalization Corp. (www.ncrcdc.com), which is overseeing the development in Fort Lincoln.\n\nFreeman says he\\'s looking for preliminary site and infrastructure work on Washington Gateway to begin later this year. If that happens, retailers are expected to start opening in late 2006 and into 2007.\n\nFairfax-based Peterson Cos. (www.petersoncos.com) is developing the 43-acre site with private developer Fort Lincoln Newtown, which holds the development rights.\n\nIt\\'s been a long time in coming. Before 2001, D.C.-based Fort Lincoln Newtown had tried for eight years to develop the site. Federal Realty Investment Trust also took a stab at it, as did Trammell Crow Co. So far, Peterson\\'s formula seems to be working.\n\nIn addition to Costco, which is expected to generate annual revenue of 50 million, Shoppers Food Warehouse and Staples have signed letters of intent for Washington Gateway. There are also free-standing sites for two sit-down restaurants.\n\nAlong with the much-needed retail stores, Fort Lincoln is likely to see residential development in the near future.\n\nIn August, Pulte Homes, Fort Lincoln Newtown and the Concordia Group are projected to break ground on 209 three-level townhouses marketed to moderate-income buyers; most will be priced below 00,000. And a nonprofit, trying to pin down its financing options, has proposed a high-rise senior housing complex close by.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7j6px3uj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.952834,38.920622]}},{"properties":{"name":"Washington Gateway -New Costco - 2008 - 151,700 with grocery and pharmacy","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Washington Gateway -New Costco - 2008 - 151,700 with grocery and pharmacyHow Costco Became the Anti-Wal-Marthttp://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/business/yourmoney/17costco.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=8b31033c5b6a6d68&amp;ex=1279252800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss\n\nA Costco warehouse store in Tigard, Ore. The company is challenging the idea that discount retailers must pay workers poorly.\nPublished: July 17, 2005\n\nISSAQUAH, Wash.\n\nJIM SINEGAL, the chief executive of Costco Wholesale, the nation\\'s fifth-largest retailer, had all the enthusiasm of an 8-year-old in a candy store as he tore open the container of one of his favorite new products: granola snack mix. \"You got to try this; it\\'s delicious,\" he said. \"And just .99 for 38 ounces.\"\nDefying the Analysts\nPeter Yates for The New York Times\n\n\nSome 60 feet away, inside Costco\\'s cavernous warehouse store here in the company\\'s hometown, Mr. Sinegal became positively exuberant about the 87-inch-long Natuzzi brown leather sofas. \"This is just 99.99,\" he said. \"It\\'s terrific quality. Most other places you\\'d have to pay ,500, even ,000.\"\n\nBut the pièce de résistance, the item he most wanted to crow about, was Costco\\'s private-label pinpoint cotton dress shirts. \"Look, these are just 2.99,\" he said, while lifting a crisp blue button-down. \"At Nordstrom or Macy\\'s, this is a 5, 0 shirt.\"\n\nCombining high quality with stunningly low prices, the shirts appeal to upscale customers - and epitomize why some retail analysts say Mr. Sinegal just might be America\\'s shrewdest merchant since Sam Walton.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with Costco\\'s business strategy. Some Wall Street analysts assert that Mr. Sinegal is overly generous not only to Costco\\'s customers but to its workers as well.\n\nCostco\\'s average pay, for example, is 7 an hour, 42 percent higher than its fiercest rival, Sam\\'s Club. And Costco\\'s health plan makes those at many other retailers look Scroogish. One analyst, Bill Dreher of Deutsche Bank, complained last year that at Costco \"it\\'s better to be an employee or a customer than a shareholder.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal begs to differ. He rejects Wall Street\\'s assumption that to succeed in discount retailing, companies must pay poorly and skimp on benefits, or must ratchet up prices to meet Wall Street\\'s profit demands.\n\nGood wages and benefits are why Costco has extremely low rates of turnover and theft by employees, he said. And Costco\\'s customers, who are more affluent than other warehouse store shoppers, stay loyal because they like that low prices do not come at the workers\\' expense. \"This is not altruistic,\" he said. \"This is good business.\"\n\nHe also dismisses calls to increase Costco\\'s product markups. Mr. Sinegal, who has been in the retailing business for more than a half-century, said that heeding Wall Street\\'s advice to raise some prices would bring Costco\\'s downfall.\n\n\"When I started, Sears, Roebuck was the Costco of the country, but they allowed someone else to come in under them,\" he said. \"We don\\'t want to be one of the casualties. We don\\'t want to turn around and say, \\'We got so fancy we\\'ve raised our prices,\\' and all of a sudden a new competitor comes in and beats our prices.\"\n\nAt Costco, one of Mr. Sinegal\\'s cardinal rules is that no branded item can be marked up by more than 14 percent, and no private-label item by more than 15 percent. In contrast, supermarkets generally mark up merchandise by 25 percent, and department stores by 50 percent or more.\n\n\"They could probably get more money for a lot of items they sell,\" said Ed Weller, a retailing analyst at ThinkEquity.\n\nBut Mr. Sinegal warned that if Costco increased markups to 16 or 18 percent, the company might slip down a dangerous slope and lose discipline in minimizing costs and prices.\n\nMr. Sinegal, whose father was a coal miner and steelworker, gave a simple explanation. \"On Wall Street, they\\'re in the business of making money between now and next Thursday,\" he said. \"I don\\'t say that with any bitterness, but we can\\'t take that view. We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now.\"\n\nIF shareholders mind Mr. Sinegal\\'s philosophy, it is not obvious: Costco\\'s stock price has risen more than 10 percent in the last 12 months, while Wal-Mart\\'s has slipped 5 percent. Costco shares sell for almost 23 times expected earnings; at Wal-Mart the multiple is about 19.Mr. Dreher said Costco\\'s share price was so high because so many people love the company. \"It\\'s a cult stock,\" he said.\n\nEmme Kozloff, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, faulted Mr. Sinegal as being too generous to employees, noting that when analysts complained that Costco\\'s workers were paying just 4 percent toward their health costs, he raised that percentage only to 8 percent, when the retail average is 25 percent.\n\n\"He has been too benevolent,\" she said. \"He\\'s right that a happy employee is a productive long-term employee, but he could force employees to pick up a little more of the burden.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal says he pays attention to analysts\\' advice because it enforces a healthy discipline, but he has largely shunned Wall Street pressure to be less generous to his workers. \n\n\"When Jim talks to us about setting wages and benefits, he doesn\\'t want us to be better than everyone else, he wants us to be demonstrably better,\" said John Matthews, Costco\\'s senior vice president for human resources.\nSkip to next paragraph\nPeter Yates for The New York Times\n\nCostco\\'s strategy of using plain spaces to sell products in bulk at deep discounts has won over many customers, said Jim Sinegal, Costco\\'s chief executive.\nMultimedia\nGraphic Defying the Analysts\nDefying the Analysts\n\nWith his ferocious attention to detail and price, Mr. Sinegal has made Costco the nation\\'s leading warehouse retailer, with about half of the market, compared with 40 percent for the No. 2, Sam\\'s Club. But Sam\\'s is not a typical runner-up: it is part of the Wal-Mart empire, which, with 88 billion in sales last year, dwarfs Costco.\n\nBut it is the customer, more than the competition, that keeps Mr. Sinegal\\'s attention. \"We\\'re very good merchants, and we offer value,\" he said. \"The traditional retailer will say: \\'I\\'m selling this for 0. I wonder whether I can get 0.50 or 1.\\' We say: \\'We\\'re selling it for . How do we get it down to ?\\' We understand that our members don\\'t come and shop with us because of the fancy window displays or the Santa Claus or the piano player. They come and shop with us because we offer great values.\"\n\nCostco was founded with a single store in Seattle in 1983; it now has 457 stores, mostly in the United States, but also in Canada, Britain, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Wal-Mart, by contrast, had 642 Sam\\'s Clubs in the United States and abroad as of Jan. 31.Costco\\'s profit rose 22 percent last year, to 82 million, on sales of 7.1 billion. In the United States, its stores average 21 million in sales annually, far more than the 0 million for Sam\\'s Clubs. And the average household income of Costco customers is 4,000 - with 31 percent earning over 00,000.\n\nOne reason the company has risen to the top and stayed there is that Mr. Sinegal relentlessly refines his model of the warehouse store - the bare-bones, cement-floor retailing space where shoppers pay a membership fee to choose from a limited number of products in large quantities at deep discounts. Costco has 44.6 million members, with households paying 5 a year and small businesses paying 00.\n\nA typical Costco store stocks 4,000 types of items, including perhaps just four toothpaste brands, while a Wal-Mart typically stocks more than 100,000 types of items and may carry 60 sizes and brands of toothpastes. Narrowing the number of options increases the sales volume of each, allowing Costco to squeeze deeper and deeper bulk discounts from suppliers.\n\n\"He\\'s a zealot on low prices,\" Ms. Kozloff said. \"He\\'s very reticent about finagling with his model.\"\n\nDespite Costco\\'s impressive record, Mr. Sinegal\\'s salary is just 50,000, although he also received a 00,000 bonus last year. That puts him at less than 10 percent of many other chief executives, though Costco ranks 29th in revenue among all American companies.\n\n\"I\\'ve been very well rewarded,\" said Mr. Sinegal, who is worth more than 50 million thanks to his Costco stock holdings. \"I just think that if you\\'re going to try to run an organization that\\'s very cost-conscious, then you can\\'t have those disparities. Having an individual who is making 100 or 200 or 300 times more than the average person working on the floor is wrong.\"\n\nThere is little love lost between Wal-Mart and Costco. Wal-Mart, for example, boasts that its Sam\\'s Club division has the lowest prices of any retailer. Mr. Sinegal emphatically dismissed that assertion with a one-word barnyard epithet. Sam\\'s might make the case that its ketchup is cheaper than Costco\\'s, he said, \"but you can\\'t compare Hunt\\'s ketchup with Heinz ketchup.\"\n\nStill, Costco is feeling the heat from Sam\\'s Club. When Sam\\'s began to pare prices aggressively several years ago, Costco had to shave its prices - and its already thin profit margins - ever further.\n\n\"Sam\\'s Club has dramatically improved its operation and improved the quality of their merchandise,\" said Mr. Dreher, the Deutsche Bank analyst. \"Using their buying power together with Wal-Mart\\'s, it forces Costco to be very sharp on their prices.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal\\'s elbows can be sharp as well. As most suppliers well know, his gruff charm is not what lets him sell goods at rock-bottom prices - it\\'s his fearsome toughness, which he rarely shows in public. He often warns suppliers not to offer other retailers lower prices than Costco gets.\n\nWhen a frozen-food supplier mistakenly sent Costco an invoice meant for Wal-Mart, he discovered that Wal-Mart was getting a better price. \"We have not brought that supplier back,\" Mr. Sinegal said.\n\nHe has to be flinty, he said, because the competition is so fierce. \"This is not the Little Sisters of the Poor,\" he said. \"We have to be competitive in the toughest marketplace in the world against the biggest competitor in the world. We cannot afford to be timid.\"\nSkip to next paragraph Multimedia\nGraphic Defying the Analysts\nDefying the Analysts\n\nNor can he afford to let personal relationships get in his way. Tim Rose, Costco\\'s senior vice president for food merchandising, recalled a time when Starbucks did not pass along savings from a drop in coffee bean prices. Though he is a friend of the Starbucks chairman, Howard Schultz, Mr. Sinegal warned he would remove Starbucks coffee from his stores unless it cut its prices.\n\nStarbucks relented.\n\n\"Howard said, \\'Who do you think you are? The price police?\\' \" Mr. Rose recalled, adding that Mr. Sinegal replied emphatically that he was.\n\nIf Mr. Sinegal feels proprietary about warehouse stores, it is for good reason. He was present at the birth of the concept, in 1954. He was 18, a student at San Diego Community College, when a friend asked him to help unload mattresses for a month-old discount store called Fed-Mart.\n\nWhat he thought would be a one-day job became a career. He rose to executive vice president for merchandising and became a protégé of Fed-Mart\\'s chairman, Sol Price, who is credited with inventing the idea of high-volume warehouse stores that sell a limited number of products.\n\nMr. Price sold Fed-Mart to a German retailer in 1975 and was fired soon after. Mr. Sinegal then left and helped Mr. Price start a new warehouse company, Price Club. Its huge success led others to enter the business: Wal-Mart started Sam\\'s Club, Zayre\\'s started BJ\\'s Wholesale Club and a Seattle entrepreneur tapped Mr. Sinegal to help him found Costco.\n\nCostco has used Mr. Price\\'s formula: sell a limited number of items, keep costs down, rely on high volume, pay workers well, have customers buy memberships and aim for upscale shoppers, especially small-business owners. In addition, don\\'t advertise - that saves 2 percent a year in costs. Costco and Price Club merged in 1993.\n\n\"Jim has done a very good job in balancing the interests of the shareholders, the employees, the customers and the managers,\" said Mr. Price, now 89 and retired. \"Most companies tilt too much one way or the other.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal, who is 69 but looks a decade younger, also delights in not tilting Costco too far into cheap merchandise, even at his warehouse stores. He loves the idea of the \"treasure hunt\" - occasional, temporary specials on exotic cheeses, Coach bags, plasma screen televisions, Waterford crystal, French wine and ,000 necklaces - scattered among staples like toilet paper by the case and institutional-size jars of mayonnaise.\n\nThe treasure hunts, Mr. Sinegal says, create a sense of excitement and customer loyalty.\n\nThis knack for seeing things in a new way also explains Costco\\'s approach to retaining employees as well as shoppers. Besides paying considerably more than competitors, for example, Costco contributes generously to its workers\\' 401(k) plans, starting with 3 percent of salary the second year and rising to 9 percent after 25 years.\n\nITS insurance plans absorb most dental expenses, and part-time workers are eligible for health insurance after just six months on the job, compared with two years at Wal-Mart. Eighty-five percent of Costco\\'s workers have health insurance, compared with less than half at Wal-Mart and Target.\n\nCostco also has not shut out unions, as some of its rivals have. The Teamsters union, for example, represents 14,000 of Costco\\'s 113,000 employees. \"They gave us the best agreement of any retailer in the country,\" said Rome Aloise, the union\\'s chief negotiator with Costco. The contract guarantees employees at least 25 hours of work a week, he said, and requires that at least half of a store\\'s workers be full time.\n\nWorkers seem enthusiastic. Beth Wagner, 36, used to manage a Rite Aid drugstore, where she made 4,000 a year and paid nearly ,000 a year for health coverage. She quit five years ago to work at Costco, taking a cut in pay. She started at 0.50 an hour - 2,000 a year - but now makes 8 an hour as a receiving clerk. With annual bonuses, her income is about 0,000.\n\n\"I want to retire here,\" she said. \"I love it here.\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7iys2fnc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.954594,38.919687]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wegmans Grocery Store -- Woodmore (Petrie)","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Wegmans Grocery Store<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7j8rotik"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.847391,38.912007]}},{"properties":{"name":"West Hyattsville Metro TDDP- West Hyattsville Commons","description":"Posted by RufuslWest Hyattsville Metro District Plan (TDDP)This project will update the 1998 West Hyattsville Transit District Development Plan (TDDP) to implement the recommendations of the 2003 West Hyattsville Metro TOD Strategy completed in FY 2003.

(Robert A. Reeder -- The Washington Post)\nPetrie Ventures Inc. of Annapolis, Erwin L. Greenberg Commercial Corp. of Owings Mills, and Hovnanian Land Investment Group (formerly Washington Homes) bought the property from the former Rouse Cos. of Columbia (now part of mall operator General Growth Properties).\n\nThe developers said they plan to put single-family houses, townhouses and condominiums, up to 1.5 million square feet of office space, and about 700,000 square feet of retail on the property, one of the area\\'s last unclaimed parcels.\n\n\"It\\'s an important site because it\\'s very close to the Beltway, and it\\'s another opportunity for us to attract unique retailers to the county,\" said Kwasi G. Holman, president of the county\\'s economic development corporation.\n\nPrince George\\'s County officials have been working to attract varied retailers. A few years ago, Landover Mall closed, leaving only a Sears, Roebuck store open there. The mall sits across the Beltway from Petrie\\'s project. Just a few miles south of Petrie\\'s project in Largo, there is a new, town-center-style shopping center called the Boulevard at the Capital Centre. It has a DSW Shoe Warehouse, Sports Authority, Circuit City and a movie theater.\n\nAlthough Petrie\\'s development team said it has not filed plans with zoning officials, it expects to build some first-floor shops with condos above them, according to Walt Petrie, chairman of Petrie Ventures.\n\nNot that the new development is likely to bring luxury merchants to Prince George\\'s. \"There\\'s a lot of people who want me to put a Saks Fifth Avenue or a Neiman Marcus in here, but it will be more moderate-priced shopping,\" Petrie said. A Trader Joe\\'s grocery store? \"That\\'s not out of the question,\" he said, and there also are likely to be neighborhood services such as a gym and dry cleaner.\n\nConstruction is expected to start at the end of the year, with completion in mid-2007.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v7iwjifzp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.841125,38.923626]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/5439","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rufusl","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rufusl","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/5439","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":48,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=5439,platial:user=rufusl","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":29645}
