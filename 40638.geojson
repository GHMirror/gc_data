Anytime anyone gets close to his seaside attraction, Warren pokes his head through the round window of his plastic \"box office\" --housed just to the left of the lenslike door, and asks, \"Have you seen the camera obscura?\"\r\nWhat they\\'ll see, if they pay their dollar and open themselves up to Warren\\'s enthusiasm, is sheer magic. They\\'ll also get to know a man who loves what he does. \"Take a moment to let your eyes adjust,\" Warren tells his guests, once they\\'ve walked through the swinging doors into his world. He rests his hands on the white rail surrounding what looks like a satellite dish, pointed toward the sky, dominating the small room. Swimming across that dish is a scene that looks like a painting-- a painting in motion.\r\n\r\nDepending on where the camera obscura\\'s periscope like lens is pointed at the moment, the view on the dish is of the walls of the Cliff House, or of the man-made concrete cliffs across the street, or of the condos lining the Great Highway where Playland at the Beach to be or of the Seal Rocks and the Pacific. As people watch, birds fly across the screen, a surfer rides a wave, the sea lions stretch on the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"The camera takes six minutes to go all the way around, but you can stay as long as you like, \"Warren tells his guests. One man last week stayed six hours.\" At this point, Warren can put on a taped narration and go back into his box office, but more often than not, he stays around, just to watch the reactions and share the discovery. \"What you are seeing is a rotating picture of what\\'s happening outside at this very moment, \" Warren tells his small, rapt audience. \"It works on the principle of the periscope. It reflects eighteen degrees of the view from outside, through an optically flattened, front surface-finished mirror and a series of concave and convex lenses, on to a parabolic or curved screen.\r\n\r\n\"It was the first camera,\" Warren goes on to explain. \"The camera obscura was invented by Leonardo da Vinci in the sixteenth century. His neighbors thought it was the instrument of the devil. They thought he could predict the future, the past and the present. They banned the creation because they believed it was related to the super- natural. That\\'s because, \"Warren continues, in his soft voice, \"people would go in and then go out and see their friends and say, \"I saw you when I was in the camera obscura,\" and people would think they\\'d seen the future because they had no idea about projected image.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Warren, on the other hand, several centuries removed from da Vinci\\'s time, has a lot of ideas about the projected image and the camera obscura. There\\'s very little he can\\'t tell you about this rare device -- how Isaac Newton wrote about it, or Copernicus charted the stars with it, or Renaissance artists painted with it.\r\n\r\n\"I\\'ve been an artist all my life,\" he says, \"and vision and light and shadow are wondrous things to me. Inside you become entrenched, especially people into the visual arts or visual optics and light.\r\n\r\n\"The vision of your eye opens up in there,\" Warren says. \"You see things differently. Your optic nerve is being affected in a different way. It stimulates the chemical makeup and your emotions. It moves me to tears.\" As the camera swings around to capture the view across the street from the Cliff House, Warren tells his viewers, \"This is the old Playland at the Beach. If you are a registered voter, you can sign a petition as you go out to put something there other than more condominiums.\"\r\n\r\nThere\\'s a reason that the former site of Playland holds a special place in Warren\\'s heart. That\\'s where he first saw the camera obscura, when he was sixteen years old. As a young man, Warren had show business in his bones; he ran away with the carnival, he learned how to eat fire.\r\n\r\nThen Warren grew up. worked on his career as a salesman, and lost touch with his beloved camera. When things began to fall apart for him, he found it again.\r\n\r\n\"I ended up separated from my family,\" he says. \"My wife divorced me. I had five kids, and I went into a deep depression. How can you sell anything at that point?\r\n\r\nHe took up some of his old interests. He signed up for the docent\\'s course at the Exploratorium and began doing research on Playland at the Beach, Just as it was about to be torn down. He met Gene Turtle, one of the two men who had built the camera. As youngsters, Turtle and Floyd Jennings had discovered Leonardo\\'s plans by accident, thumbing through the Encyclopaedia Britannica for a science project. They showed their completed model to George Whitney, who owned the Cliff House and Playland.\r\n\r\nWhitney set up the camera at the Cliff House, but for the first few years it didn\\'t do well because no one knew what it was. Then Whitney got the idea to make it look like a giant camera. Though located at the Cliff House, the camera obscura was a Playland attraction until they tore the place down in 1972. Early in his career, photographer Ansel Adams hung around the camera so much that they quit charging him.\r\n\r\nWarren ran into Gene Turtle in the 1970\\'s and ended up doing a fire-eating demonstration at Turtle\\'s wife\\'s birthday party. In 1978, David Warren was perched on a ladder at the Balboa Theater, painting a mural on the side -it\\'s still there, with Marilyn Monroe as centerpiece, but that\\'s another story -- when Turtle approached him and asked whether he\\'d like to take over the operation of the camera obscura.\r\n\r\n\"I told him I\\'d do it as soon as I got down from the ladder,\" Warren recalls, \"and I\\'ve been doing it ever since.\"\r\n\r\nWarren proceeded to spend years trying to figure out how to get people in to see what the camera had to offer. \"It\\'s a wonderful thing,\" he says. \"You think you should be able to tell people what it is, But it\\'s a paradox. As a salesman, I knew that people would like to know about it, but I found out that you couldn\\'t tell them about it.\"\r\n\r\nHe finally hit upon a solution; tell them what it does, not what it is. Slowly, Warren has learned the tricks of wooing them in, has discovered where the magic line lies between those who come in and those who wander off. A few years ago, he added a pair of huge brass arrows, pointing to the entrance. \"Before, people would just walk by and start looking at the ocean,\" he says. \"Now, these get their attention.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the people come inside, Warren starts spilling his enthusiasm, as the camera obscura chugs quietly around on its motorized axis, panning the surf and the sea lions and the sinking sun. At one point, Warren says, there were three such cameras in San Francisco alone. Now, there are only a handful left in the world. Dave Warren can tell you where each one is and who if running it. That\\'s one of his projects -- forming an organization of all the camera obscura operators in the world, so they can share information.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun sinks low enough in the sky at the end of the day, the sun itself is captured on the rim of Warren\\'s satellitedish screen, a glowing ball of concentrated light. At that point, Warren will hold up a flat, white board, moving it into the field of projection so that he can show people the sunstorms around the edge of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"We always look for the sunspots,\" he says. \"It\\'s part of our show. We turn off the narration tape and do the sunset show in person. We see the green flash in here about twice a month. It\\'s caused by the spectrum of light being split by the atmosphere. The various colors of light are separated. When green comes along, it flashes, like the northern lights, just as the last rays of light leave.\" Warren can\\'t help himself; his voice fills with awe. \"It lasts only a tenth of a second, but it\\'s very beautiful. Liquid jade. When Jules Verne was writing, he said if there is a green in heaven, it\\'s surely this green.\"\r\n\r\nAs people leave, Warren nearly always seems to find some excuse to give them a free pass for another visit. (\"Next time, come back while it\\'s still light, so you can see the sea lions\" or \"Come back and bring a friend.\")\r\n\r\nThe camera never fails to surprise him. \"The most unusual thing happened just the other day,\" says Warren. \"We were watching a sunset, and all of a sudden there was a thud. The screen got black. I thought for sure a bird had hit the camera, Later, when I went up to close the hatch, I reached in, and there was a fish. A pelican probably dropped it,\" he says. \"He sure had good aim.\"\r\n\r\nBut even on more humdrum days, the object of his livelihood and his affections totally entrances David Warren. Someday, he\\'d like to create a mobile camera, on that he could haul up to Twin Peaks. \"Now that would be something,\" he says. Meanwhile, if you venture down the stairs that lead to the terrace below the Cliff House, you\\'ll find him, polishing the brass arrows or leaning out through the box office, trying to coax people over that invisible line. When someone gets within earshot, Warren is there, speaking softly. \"Have you seen the camera obscura?\"\r\n\r\n On a side note, Dave was the first “fire performer” and individual to light the burning man in the black rock desert.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6569gq77cpt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.514215,37.778262]}},{"properties":{"name":"Defenestration","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/DEFENSE.bmp\">6th and Howard St. San Francisco CaOn March 9, 1997, hundreds of people came together to celebrate the opening of Brian Goggin\\'s Defenestration installation.

Some sources list his date of birth as February 14, 1819. Although he had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented. Norton also wrote to Queen Victoria, and he was referred to as His Imperial Majesty by local citizens and in the newspaper obituaries announcing his death.\r\n\r\nThough he was generally considered insane, or at least highly eccentric, the citizens of San Francisco (and the world at large) in the mid-to-late 19th century celebrated his presence, his humor, and his deeds—among the most notorious being his \"order\" that the U.S. Congress be dissolved by force, and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge to be built across San Francisco Bay. The King in Mark Twain\\'s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is reportedly modeled after him.\r\n\r\nHe is considered a saint by the followers of Discordianism and is referenced repeatedly in the seminal work of the religion, the Principia Discordia.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nNorton was born in England. Records vary as to the date and place of birth. His obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle, \"following the best information obtainable,\" cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was \"aged about 65.\" This suggests 1814 as his year of birth. Other, non-primary sources have his birth on February 14, 1819 in London. According to Drury (1986), immigration records indicate that he was two years old in 1820 when his parents emigrated to South Africa. Southern African genealogies suggest that his father was John Norton (d. August 1848) and his mother was Sarah Norden. Sarah was the daughter of Abraham Norden and niece of Benjamin Norden, a successful Jewish merchant, who displayed his eccentric side by frequently suing family members. This is supported by Cowan (1923) who stated that Emperor Norton I \"was of Hebrew [Jewish] parentage.\"\r\n\r\nNorton emigrated from South Africa to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a gift of 0,000 from his father (possibly his inheritance after his father\\'s death). He accumulated a fortune of 50,000 by 1853 (Cowan 1923). He enjoyed some highly impressive initial success in the real estate market when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice. The price of rice in San Francisco skyrocketed from 4¢ per pound to 36¢ per pound (9¢/kg to 79¢/kg). When Norton heard that a ship holding 200,000 pounds (100 tons) of rice was coming from Peru, he bought all the rice, hoping to corner the rice market. Unfortunately, shipload after shipload of rice came from Peru, and the price of rice plummeted. There was extensive litigation over the incident amongst Norton and his financial partners between 1853 and 1857. Although resulting in a victory for Norton in the lower courts, the cases eventually resulted in a defeat for Norton in the Supreme Court (Cowan 1923). Norton declared bankruptcy in 1858. He then left the city for a time, and shortly after returning announced his title to the offices of the Bulletin.\r\n\r\nThere are no known documents noting an eccentric personality or unusual behavior of Norton prior to the loss of his fortune, so it is not known whether his pronounced eccentricity was a permanent aspect of his psychology, or arose as a result of the stressful financial events of the 1850s. Nonetheless, after his sudden loss of financial stability, Norton seemed to become (in the absence of a proper diagnosis) somewhat \"odd,\" and began exhibiting delusions of grandeur, but it is entirely likely that all his declarations and behavior were the result of successful creative response to the pressure of poverty.\r\n\r\nSelf-proclamation\r\nHaving become fully disgruntled with the inadequacies of the political structure and state and federal governments of the United States, Norton took matters into his own hands on September 17, 1859, when, in letters to the various newspapers of the area, he summarily proclaimed himself \"Emperor of These United States\":\r\n\r\nAt the pre-emptory request of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last nine years and ten months past of San Francisco, California, declare and proclaim myself the Emperor of These United States.\r\n\r\nHe would, on occasion, add \"Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year \"reign\" over America.\r\n\r\nDecrees\r\nIn accordance with his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of state. Deeming that he had assumed power, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree that formally \"dissolved\" the United States Congress. He also observed that\r\n\r\n\"…fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Emperor ordered that \"all interested parties\" gather at Platt\\'s Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 so as to \"remedy the evil complained of.\"\r\n\r\nIn another imperial \"decree\" of January 1860, Emperor Norton I summoned the army to depose the elected officials of Congress:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished; \r\nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with; \r\nNOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress. \r\nNorton\\'s \"orders\" had no effect on the army, and the Congress likewise continued in its activities unperturbed. Norton issued further \"decrees\" in 1860 that purported to dissolve the republic and to forbid the assembly of any members of the Congress. These, like all of Norton\\'s decrees, passed unnoticed by the government in Washington, and by the nation at large. Norton\\'s battle against the elected leaders of America was to persist throughout his \"reign,\" though it appears that Norton eventually, if somewhat grudgingly, accepted that Congress would continue to exist without his permission.\r\n\r\nHis attempts to overthrow the elected government of America by force having been frustrated, Norton turned his attention and his proclamations to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, \"being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm,\" he \"abolished\" both the Democratic and Republican parties. On another occasion, the failure to refer to his adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:\r\n\r\nWhoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable word \"Frisco,\" which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nWhile it is unknown if he intended it as a formal decree, Norton called Minnie Rae, a preteen prostitute who worked in the city, \"the little countess.\" She apparently credited his pronouncement with saving her life in her \"autobiography\" (it is believed the book, which is now lost, was actually written by a journalist who interviewed her between 1871 to 1872).\r\n\r\nAfter examining a number of his \"Imperial Edicts,\" it is tempting to conjecture on the mental condition of America\\'s only sovereign monarch. Unfortunately, diagnosing the precise psychological condition of Norton is an impossibility, due to the anecdotal nature of all the documents that relate his behavior. It has been suggested that he may have been schizophrenic, as \"delusions of grandeur\" is a symptom frequently associated with that condition. However, it is also possible that he suffered from some other mental illness, or even that he was merely eccentric.\r\n\r\nFor all of his quirks and regardless of the precise nature of his psychological condition, it cannot be denied that Norton was, on some occasions, a visionary, and a number of his \"Imperial Decrees\" exhibited a profound wisdom. Among his many edicts were instructions to form a League of Nations, and he explicitly forbade any form of discord or conflict between religions or their sects. The Emperor also saw fit on a number of occasions to decree the construction of a suspension bridge connecting Oakland and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience being exhibited by the authorities:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees. \r\nGiven under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872. \r\nThis decree, unlike most, concerned events that eventually came to pass. Construction of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge began in 1933 and was completed in 1936. BART\\'s Transbay Tube was completed in 1969 and opened in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zpub.com/sf/history/nort.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6569gvhtfat"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.461759,37.679851]}},{"properties":{"name":"Former location of Café Proust","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/cafe.jpg\">1801 McAllister St, San Francisco, California, United StatesMiss P.

The name belied the gentle albeit zany nature of its members, who had a predilection towards light-hearted practical jokes.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, some of the former members of the Suicide Club formed the Cacophony Society, a group similar in spirit to the Suicide Club.

What would later become Burning man in the Black Rock Desert was spawned here as “Bad Day at Black Rock” a Cacophony Society zone trip. The early “SF Decom” (Burning man decompression parties) were held in this sprawling 2 story flat.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, an owner move in eviction forced an abrupt end to a creative and fruitful era. \r\n\r\nPictures from the last party:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bitchwick.com/amacker/1907/index.htm\r\n\r\n“The Last Party at 1907 Golden Gate -- All these years, \"Miss P.\" Segal\r\nhas hosted those wonderful soirees.

You get hippies. All kinds of hippies: panhandling Deadhead hippies, with parents who live in Kentwood; white-boy-dreaded hippies with vegan tendencies; scary mud hippies who get into pagan love rituals; rainbow-colored tree-hugging hippies with clothes made of hemp and bumper stickers. Just the thought of a Berkeley parade is enough to send any right-minded leather-lover on a one-way trip to San Jose. Unless you\\'re a member of PETA (People Eat\\'n Them Animals). Two years ago, PETA representatives appeared in the How Berkeley Can You Be? Parade and nestled themselves between a Wells Fargo float and the Peet\\'s Coffee contingent. From a distance, they looked harmless enough -- an original Doggie Diner head smiled warmly from their float -- but as PETA neared, onlookers paled. A roar of chain saws overpowered a nearby didgeridoo player. Weirdos dressed as animal-faced butchers, Charlie Manson, Farmer Vin-cent, and Leatherface tossed hunks of seared meat into the crowd. The smell of flesh mingled with that of patchouli, sandalwood, and sweat. A woman drenched in blood tossed GPC cigarettes and chicken claws at children. It was a hideous spectacle, one that should have warranted serious peace-love-and-granola retaliation, but the sunny municipality of Berkeley was caught completely off guard. Thank god for the Veget-Aryans who were on hand in military force to protest the bloody-mindedness of PETA. They goose-stepped through the ranks wearing creased brown shirts and crossed carrot-stick armbands. They carried \"Meat Is Murder\" placards and shouted, \"We can smell you from here!\" Meat flew. Bullhorns blared. Kids smoked. It was grimy chaos. Strangely, Berkeley invited PETA back. In turn, the invitation has encouraged other miscreants -- fire-breathers, defrocked priests, and disgusting clowns -- to join the carnage. This year, three dog heads will now make their way to Berkeley. Secret PETA organizer Oscar Myer is threatening to butcher a pig, which should be something of a treat. The procession leaves from California and University on Sunday, Sept. 27, at 11 a.m. and ends at Civic Center Park at 5 p.m. Admission is free as long as you\\'re a freak\r\n\r\nhttp://deuceofclubs.com/artcar98/acf9811.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/1998-09-23/music/music5.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6569gokffuh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.28238,37.870226]}},{"properties":{"name":"The (last) Doggie Diner Restaurant","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/doggie_diner_sign_front.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Sloat Boulevard at 47th Avenue, adjacent to Ocean Beach and the Great Highway Doggie Diner\r\nLocation: Sloat Boulevard at 45th Avenue\r\n\r\n\r\n(Possible plaque inscription for the Doggie Diner Head): \r\n\r\n\"\\'THE DOGGIE\\' \r\n\r\n\"This sign from the last operating Doggie Diner (later called Carousel Restaurant) once stood at the northeast corner of 46th Avenue and Sloat Boulevard. \r\n\r\n\"It was designed c. 1960 by graphic artist Harold Bachman for the popular Bay Area chain of 30 unionized drive-in restaurants. Its whimsical style has delighted generations. \r\n\r\n\"A massive, grassroots effort to preserve it, chronicled nationally in the comic strip, \"Zippy the Pinhead,\" led to its acquisition by the City of San Francisco in March, 2000. \r\n\r\n\"Toppled by wind April 1, 2003, it was restored to its original site by SF Central Shops and the Department of Public Works. In January 2005, the Doggie was relocated to this spot to welcome all who visit Ocean Beach. \r\n\r\n\"\\'Long Live the Doggie!\\'\" \r\n\r\nThe last Doggie Diner head (on a pole) makes its home in the Outer Sunset district, and with talk of official landmark designation, it has transcended its origin as a whimsical advertising icon. \r\n\r\nStarted in 1949, the chain of Doggie Diner restaurants were everywhere by the 1960s. The Richmond district alone had three of them, and a three-dimensional (and once rotating) dog head with chef hat glared down gleefully at each of them. \r\n\r\n \r\nDesigned circa 1960 by illustrator Harold Bachman (who is still surprised at all the hubbub and said in early 2005 he just thought the darned thing would help sell hamburgers), this San Francisco institution has found a new location a block from its old home. The Doggie Diner Head now welcomes visitors to Ocean Beach from 45th Avenue and Sloat Boulevard, giving his sardonic grin to all who come west. (Probably a nice change of view, after looking south at the Zoo for over 40 years.) \r\n\r\nOn February 14, 2005, under threatening skies, a small, happy crowd welcomed the Doggie to its new home. Ed Lee, the head of San Francisco\\'s Department of Public Works, presided and welcomed third-graders from Ulloa Elementary School, some real canines (and their guardians), a couple of jugglers, and a passel of media. The Mayor couldn\\'t make it, but Supervisor Sean Elsbernd said how the Doggie was a great memory of his childhood, and Supervisor Fiona Ma\\'s representative talked of official landmarking! \r\n\r\nDoggie saviors Diana Scott and Joel Schechter of the Ocean Beach Historical Society attended and Diana gave a few words of thanks along with the exclamation of the day: \"Long Live the Doggie!\" \r\n\r\nNo sign of Zippy the Pinhead, but likely the Doggie will find its way into his world soon enough... \r\n\r\nThe Doggie was actually moved on January 28, 2005, and these great photos of city workers moving the Doggie are courtesy of Diana Scott of the Ocean Beach Historical Society. \r\n\r\nhttp://outsidelands.org/doggie_diner.php<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6569h0pbtsm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.504033,37.735488]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Albion Castle","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/Albion_Castle_0290_L.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 881 Innes Avenue San Francisco Ca.The Albion Castle was built as a brewery in 1870.

MANGRUM\r\nSubject: Cacophony Race of Doom\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, 7/9/95\r\n\r\nWhat started as an oddball prank took a tragic turn today as onetime\r\ncounterculture scenester and San Francisco Cacophony Society member Timothy\r\nLiddy apparently plunged to his death in the icy waters of the Golden Gate.\r\nThough officials expressed concerns that the dive may have been accidental,\r\nor even the result of foul play, others were quick to proclaim Liddy the\r\n1,000th person to commit suicide by jumping from the historic span.  \r\n\r\nThe trouble started when sixteen members of the pranksterish Cacophony\r\nSociety, a longtime fixture in the local underground scene, chose the day of\r\nthe San Francisco Marathon to dress up in jogging togs, don the number 1000,\r\nand race to the center of the bridge in a simulated mass suicide. An article\r\nin the Examiner the day before had set the official Bridge death toll at 999,\r\nand expressed concerns among law enforcement and public health officials that\r\npeople would be \"lining up to be number 1,000.\"  The Cacophonists responded\r\nwith their ill-fated \"Race of Doom,\" a black-humored piece of guerilla\r\ntheater complete with official-looking marathon-style number placards for all\r\nthe runners. \"It was just a joke,\" explained Cacophony spokesperson Lloyd\r\nVoid. \"We\\'re just a bunch of harmless kids having fun.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy, on the other hand, was no kid, and according to some sources far from\r\nharmless. After nearly achieving notoriety in the 60\\'s as the unindicted\r\neighth conspirator in the Chicago Seven trial, the 45-year old Liddy went\r\nunderground in 1976 under a cloud of drug, weapons and money laundering\r\ncharges. Federal officials were guarded when queried about Liddy\\'s\r\nbackground. One source, who asked not to be identified, expressed doubt that\r\nthe jumper could have been Liddy at all, as Liddy was known by the NSA to be\r\nin Haiti with longtime acquaintance and golfing companion Robert Vesco.\r\nNoting that no body had been recovered from the Bay, he implied that the\r\nwhole affair was nothing more than \"a crude attempt at disinformation,\r\npossibly by the Mossad.\"\r\n\r\nEyewitnesses on the Bridge, however, insist that a man matching Liddy\\'s\r\ndescription jumped, or was pushed, or accidentally fell from the railing at\r\nmid-span at about 6:25 P.M. Members of the Cacophony group were engaged \r\nin a mock shoving match, each trying to climb up the railing ahead of the \r\nother, when Liddy apparently went over the side.\r\n\r\nLiddy, whose autobiography \"I\\'ll Sleep When I\\'m Dead\" has been tied up in\r\nlitigation since 1982, left no known survivors. His publishers, Duke Press,\r\nreferred a request for comment to their Accounts Receivable \r\ndepartment.      \r\n\r\nSubject: Re: Cacophony Race of Doom - Posthumous Postscript\r\nDate: 95-07-11 01:56:46 EDT\r\nFrom:\tsblack@library.berkeley.edu (Steven Black)\r\n\r\nOne of the surviving Cacophonists on the scene of the Race of Doom found \r\nthis unsigned message, perhaps left by that late millennarian Timothy Liddy:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS OF DYING AT THE THOUSAND MARK\r\nbrooding on a morbid body count\r\noff the Golden Gate Bridge\r\nJuly 9, 1995\r\n\r\nWhy this of all Sundays\r\n\t\t\tI decide\r\n\t\t\t\tto die\r\nA millstone off the\r\n\t\t\tbridge\r\n\t\t\t\tof life\r\nGold\t\tmolten\t\tred\r\nCity\\'s blood\r\n\t\t\tlatticed\r\n\t\t\t\teyes\r\n\r\nI seize the night\r\nfrom under\t\tthe sun\ta knife of\r\n\t\t\t\twater\r\nCaresssing\tteeth\t\tsteals\r\n\t\tmy \tbreath \taway\r\nHello\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\tfin\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tit\r\n\r\n\r\n_\t_\t_\t_\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6569h2fgsuf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.477437,37.811199]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Cult of Fantasia (Fantasia Protest)","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/MIKE14.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> 429 Castro Street, San Francisco CaDancing Elephants And Other Menaces, July 3, 1991 \r\nWall Street Journal, Wednesday April 1, 1992 \r\nPolitically Correct Demonstration of the Year, Walt Disney \"Fantasia\" picketed at the Castro Theater by groups including: Bay Area Say No To Drugs Committee, Bay Area Drought Reliance Party, Dieters United and Parents Against Scary Movies. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6569gq60361"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.435139,37.762076]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Dashiell Hammett Tour","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/falcon200_2.jpg\">100 Larkin San Francisco CaTravel with Don Herron over the fog-shrouded hills stalked by Sam Spade, the Continental Op, and other legendary characters created by San Francisco\\'s most renowned mystery and noir writer.

The event grew quickly, moving from Baker Beach in San Francisco to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada in 1990 after the burn scheduled for the summer solstice was shut down by police. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it on the beach, event organizers disassembled the effigy and returned it to a vacant lot where it had been stored. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed and the pieces removed when the lot was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The effigy was then reconstructed, lead by Dan Miller, Harvey\\'s then house-mate of many years. The Man found his new home in conjunction with the already scheduled Cacophony event sponsored by John Law and Kevin Evans, \"Zone Trip #4\" in the other worldly, remote and largely unknown, Black Rock desert.\r\n\r\nhttp://burningman.com/whatisburningman/1986_1996/firstyears.html\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6569gsul8jy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.165783,40.81199]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/8287","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kevans","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kevans","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/8287","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=8287,platial:user=kevans","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":40638}
