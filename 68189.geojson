Following school, I worked for the City of Williston, ND, Engineering Department, then my wife, Michelle and I moved to Racine, WI in 1987 where I worked for a consulting Engineering and Surveying Company called Nielsen Madsen and Barber. It was while in Racine where our oldest Daughter Brittany was born in 1990. In 1992, I accepted a job with Welch Land Surveying in Redgranite, WI. In 1994, our youngest daughter, Mariah, came along into our lives... Brittany finally got a baby sister! (all my boys are girls). In 1995, after Bob Welch lost the US Senate election to Senator Herb Kohl, I purchased the business from Bob. In 1997, I purchased Schindler Land Surveying in Wautoma, WI. Somehow around that same time I started into Commercial real Estate Development, and started 2 realestate development firms which are still operating today. In early 2007, I bought a Title Insurance Agency from First American Title Insurance Company, and I am spending alot of my time at the Title Company right now. The surveying end is still thriving.

I knew nothing of surveying; I actually thought it was a dead profession. Now, 40 years later, I wonder if it is or not.  I continued to work for numerous engineering firms for 8 years. Then, I went to Ferris State College in Big Rapids, MI and got a 4 year BS in Surveying - that was May of 1981. Then I moved to MN, got licensed in MN, IL &amp; SD. Did three Cadastral contracts in the Black Hills - exciting b/c we found original PLSS corners and Bearing Trees. We busted 10 sections around MT. Rushmore, really cool. Then with my own survey business, we did GPS jobs in MN winter around CASS Lake &amp; Black Duck - snowmobiles, northern lights and logging trucks! Also in Red Wing along the high bluffs of the Mississippi; in Minneapolis duriing the great solar event of 1989; in Mankato; and in Northfield. I started doing GPS in 1987 and the first to use 5 Ashtechs and 4 Trimble 4000SDs simulltaneously in observation - what a nightmare!
