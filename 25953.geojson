Box 38504 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA 19104Voice: 215-681-0783. E-Mail: nvweb@nonviolence.org\n\n\t\n\nThe Nonviolence.org Story\n\nNonviolence.Org is an entirely virtual new media organization. It was started by one person—-me, Martin Kelley—-in my home office in 1995. Almost eight years later, it’s won accolades and attention from the mainstream media but has remained largely invisible to progressive foundations and much of the old peace movement.\n\nThe past eight years have seen countless “New Media” projects burst on the scene only to wither away. Yet Nonviolence.org continues without any funding, attracting a larger audience every year. As the years have gone by and I’ve found the strength to continue it, I’ve realized more and more that this is a ministry. As a member of the Religious Society of Friends I’m committed to spreading the good news that war is unnecessary. In my personal life this is a matter of faith in the “power that takes away occassion for all war.” In my work with Nonviolence.org I also draw on all the practical and pragmatic reasons why war is wrong. \n(For more details please go to original url above)\n    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5x0gmf5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.202445,39.959732]}},{"properties":{"name":".: Charm City Roller Girls :.","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://www.charmcityrollergirls.com/Images/car_tat.gif\">8025 Belair Road Baltimore, MD 21236Charm City Roller Girls, LLC was formed in 2005.

Freedom of the press, and freedom of religion supported by the strict separation of church and state.\n    * Your right to equal protection under the law - equal treatment regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.\n    * Your right to due process - fair treatment by the government whenever the loss of your liberty or property is at stake.\n    * Your right to privacy - freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into your personal and private affairs.\n\nWe work also to extend rights to segments of our population that have traditionally been denied their rights, including Native Americans and other people of color; lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgendered people; women; mental-health patients; prisoners; people with disabilities; and the poor.\n\nIf the rights of society\\'s most vulnerable members are denied, everybody\\'s rights are imperiled.\n\nThe ACLU was founded by Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Albert DeSilver and others in 1920. We are nonprofit and nonpartisan and have grown from a roomful of civil liberties activists to an organization of more than 500,000 members and supporters. We handle nearly 6,000 court cases annually from our offices in almost every state.\n\nThe ACLU has maintained the position that civil liberties must be respected, even in times of national emergency. The ACLU is supported by annual dues and contributions from its members, plus grants from private foundations and individuals. We do not receive any government funding.

I saw a couple of cops in a squad car swerve quickly towards a cyclist and harrass him out the window of the car. When they pulled up to the light next to eachother I remarked to the cyclist that he didn\\'t seem to have done anything wrong. I also said the same to the cops in the car.\nOn my way back past the intersection, soda-pop in hand, I saw the cops had pulled over the cyclist and were writing him a ticket. I approached, with the intention of offering to be a witness for the cyclist at his court date. I was immediately told to get the hell out of there. I stood dumbfounded at his tone of voice and asked why. I was subsequently arrested for obstructing a \"Peace Officer\". I was handcuffed, put in a holding cell, treated like an imbecile, and stuck in jail for approx. seven hours. It was awful and humiliating and I did not deserve this.

Aylmer, a rather large, penis-shaped parasite, gives unsuspecting Brian brain damage by getting him hooked on an hallucinogenic, blue fluid that Aylmer himself produces. Oh, the colors! But the thousand-year-old worm-like parasite demands something in return for the buzz - human brains! Aylmer and his actions seem to be a metaphor for drug use and addiction and convey very graphically how substances foreign to our bodies can alter our own thoughts and actions.\nvia imdb, David Ross Smith\n\n\nFUNNY GAMES\n1997 Directed by Michael Haneke\nHorror / Drama / Thriller \n\nMichael Haneke\\'s \"Funny games\" shows up. Two friendly and ordinary looking young blokes dressed in white neat clothes turn out to be a pair of sick and perverted psychopaths and the sadistic molestation, tormenting, harassment and torturing of a perfectly innocent family gets started without even a tiny warning. Although we can\\'t practically see even a one clear act of physical violence during the entire film and we spot hardly a drop of blood, \"Funny games\" is probably one of the most violent films there is. It\\'s so overfilled with mental cruelty the pressuring anxiety grows up to be something highly enormous. For example when the torturer orders the desperate mother to undress, camera only concentrates on showing her agonized and painful crying face when she strips off. \t\nVia imdb, Mika Pykäläaho<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5rbx2nd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.629305,45.516226]}},{"properties":{"name":"Back to Back Cafe","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/74490484_8ce9402b5b_s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Worker Owned!PAWC Directory: We are a worker owned cafe serving a diverse customer base in the central eastside of Portland.

The\ntruth is that the Bush Administration has used the McCain anti-torture bill to codify a policy of torture that is\nnow embedded in our legal system for perpetuity.\n\nProfessor Alfred McCoy is the author of a new book, \"A Question of Torture\", in which he gives a history of US\ntorture from the CIA\\'s development of torture techniques through the latest generation of systematic torture in\nthe Bush Administration\\'s \"war on terror\".\n\nMcCoy explains how the Bush Administration has purposefully crafted a strategy of torture. They have claimed\nexecutive powers and have had laws re-interpreted by Administration lawyers to give the government the power to\ncontinue the practice. Loopholes slipped into the McCain bill now ensure an enduring policy of torture.\n\nDemocracy Now interviewed Professor McCoy several weeks ago. We\\'ve taken about 9 minutes of clips frmo the 23\nminute interview and provided them here. The entire interview and transcript are available from Democracy Now.\n\nDue to the focus on detainees\\' human rights at Guantánamo, the U.S. is quietly expanding a detention center at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. In the past few years, the population has increased by 5 times. While there\nhas been significant legal action over Gitmo, little has been done for the detainees at Bagram.\nMany say the conditions at Bagram are far worse than even during the height of the Abu Ghraib abuse.\nAdded on April 29, 2006, 09:27 PM by halfandhalf \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5xem2mp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.002529,40.718511]}},{"properties":{"name":"Butters Gallery LTD","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://buttersgallery.com/images/Thumbs/Echo7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 520 NW Davis St Portland Or 97209503-248-9378\ntues-fri 10-5:30\nsat 11-5<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5xh0ky0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675716,45.52436]}},{"properties":{"name":"Buzznet","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://www.buzznet.com/assets/logo-homepage.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.buzznet.com/assets/logo-homepage.jpg\">2404 Wilshire blvd #11b Los Angeles Ca 90057Buzznet is a vibrant community centered around our user\\'s content: video, photo, journals and organized by individual interest.

March 19, 2006: The Constitution is the supreme law because every other law in all fifty states is linked directly to its seven articles and twenty-seven amendments. Whether you think the Constitution is a dead letter or not, no federal official or branch of government has ever declared a veto of the Constitution in a court of law.\n\n Law is objective, it is fact. In constitutional law it is absolute, you can either do something or you cannot. You have a procedure, it is followed.\n\n A federal lawsuit Walker v. Members of Congress (05-35023 U.S. Ninth Circuit Court) is newsworthy because it is concerned with Article V and the amendatory process. The Constitution requires that 34 states must apply before a convention can be called. Just as there “shall be” three branches of government, Congress “shall call a convention for proposing amendments” once the state applications are received. This is the direct language of the law all elected officials and members of our U.S. Military swear an oath to uphold, and the evidence before the court is that 567 state applications from all fifty states have been received by Congress.\n\n When Supreme Court decisions state emphatically that it is not the place of either the court or legislature to alter the amendatory process, and when the case before them concerns the issue directly, then the U.S. must follow the law as written. Congress by its actions is claiming a veto power over a clause of the Constitution. Article V makes clear the clause was “peremptory,” done without debate, and that Congress shall have no option in the matter. In short, the Founders anticipated the political question doctrine almost 250 years ago and dealt with it directly. Thus a convention call is ministerial in duty, not discretionary.\n\n Going back to 1969, 1986, 1993, and 1999, when talk of a convention circulated, the traditional fear has been that such a convention might tamper with the Constitution. Besides what Congress is currently doing to the Constitution, it must be noted that such a fear is invalid since any proposed amendment needs 38 states to agree to it, which means any idea that is even slightly questionable has no chance of being ratified. Only those with broad and overwhelming support will be ratified.\n\n The one and only thing which will come out of America’s first Article V Convention is a roster of ideas, and Walker frames the situation, not that it is time to a hold a national convention, but that it is a constitutional requirement. The refusal of Congress to issue the call when a sufficient number of applying states exists is illegal and unconstitutional. Congress cannot veto the calling of a convention.\n\nMembers of Congress, the President, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General will tell you how important the Constitution is just about every chance they get--and they are right. The Founders knew then what we know now, that governments can become corrupt. That is why the legal mechanism of the convention call was placed in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nPlease send a letter to your congressional representatives and ask them about Walker.\n\nPlease go to the above url to see more about how you can help affect the change you want to see in our country.\n\nAlso for more information please email:  admin1@cc2.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u607qmty"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036667,38.895]}},{"properties":{"name":"Crepevine","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 5600 College Avenue Oakland CaHours: Sun to Thurs 7:30 am to 11 pm\nFrid &amp; Sat 7:30 am to 12 midnight\nMiddle Eastern, Crepes.

Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff came to the city early in the year, inspiring the creation of the School of Design  (the official name of the Rex Organization).  The Grand Duke attended a performance of a popular operetta called  Bluebeard at the  Academy of Music on St. Charles Avenue (where the Hotel Intercontinental now stands).  In the show was a young lady named Lydia Thompson, whom the Grand Duke had met before his arrival in the city.  In the show, she sang an unusual melody entitled \" If Ever I Cease to Love\" that was assumed to be a favourite of the Duke\\'s.  Rumour had it that there had been a courtship between the Grand Duke and Miss Thompson, though such an assignation was never proven.  However, in the best traditions of Carnival, the romantic rumours soon became acknowledged \"fact\" and \" If Ever I Cease to Love\" was adopted as the official song of Mardi Gras.  The Grand Duke was also given the honour of selecting the official colours for Mardi Gras, and using the heraldic traditions, selected purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.  These are also the colours of the House of Romanoff.   Several other traditions were established that same year, including  the tradition of keeping the identity of Rex a secret until Mardi Gras Day, and Rex\\'s arrival by riverboat at the foot of Canal Street at sunset on Lundi Gras evening. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5miu43r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.0703,29.950061]}},{"properties":{"name":"In Yorkshire and London England!

It was the end of a long hot summer.  I convinced a friend to drive me down to Des Moines (without telling his parents) ostensibly to see Henry Rollins and the Rollins band play.  He loved Henry Rollins, I loved a songwriter and editor of a local punk \\'zine.  He saw the show, I walked off into the night with my love and found this spot next to the river behind some bushes off of a little walkway.  It was liberating, intense and passionate.  Lots of hot sweaty leather moments.  I can still remember the lovely smells of that night.  We made love for so long that when we returned to the botanical center, my friend was terribly upset with me--he was really late getting home which blew his cover and he was grounded for a month.  On the long drive home, he angrily berated me while I strummed on a guitar dreamily and sung her songs.

Mount Tabor Park has basketball courts, tennis courts, a reservoir, hiking and biking trails AND annually boasts the PDX Soap Box Derby courtesy of Beulahland and others.  Right before sunset, bike with friends up belmont and around to the top of the hill, sit on the bench facing donwtown, open your beers and watch the sun set and the lights come up on hawthorne. Then bike down the hill on the other side and stop off at Sapphire Hotel for drinks and food. Tell Sheila Paige sent ya and ask her if her daughter still likes the new bike helmet.

Sniper attacks in Iraq have resulted in the deaths of over 200 U.S. soldiers.\n\n\n\nyoutube user: Assasin47\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz6BA-E7aWE<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5zdt03z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[43.679291,33.223191]}},{"properties":{"name":"Somewhere in Iraq--Soldiers talking about the war by nicholasp323","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/2_15_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Iraq\n\nfound on youtube posted by user: nicholasp323\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJvmT2Z8gIY<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5v84wnd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[43.679291,33.223191]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steak 'n Shake","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/10/12735634_e117daf24c_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/21/30199385_0eff2eaa41_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2315 S Dale Mabry Hwy, Tampa, FL 1950s diner fries up fast-food classics 24 hours a day. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5syzkjq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.506019,27.924537]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steak 'n Shake","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/21/30199385_0eff2eaa41_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 295 E Altamonte Dr, Altamonte Springs, FL 1950s diner fries up fast-food classics 24 hours a day. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5wr5qyf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.382539,28.662463]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steak N Shake","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/11/14977383_73122e488f_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 17325 Lorain Ave, Cleveland, OH1950s diner fries up fast-food classics 24 hours a day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5qx0mla"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.817591,41.44995]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stumptown Annex","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/36/76730074_cd68eef0b6_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/37/76730066_0f5a24fc73_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 3352 SE Belmont St. Pdx Or 97214unbelievably great coffee<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5nxcgan"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.630218,45.516311]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sunseed Food Co-Op","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.happycow.net\" href=\"http://www.happycow.net\">Happycow</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 6615 N Atlantic Ave, Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States, North AmericaVegetarian FriendlyHealth Food Store<a href=\"%5C'http://happycow.net/reviews.php?id=3126%5C'\">Reviews</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5tbgnbt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.60567,28.3774]}},{"properties":{"name":"Super Mario Bros.

Built over the ruins of an ancient  temple to the Egyptian goddess Isis, the church possesess an architectural footprint matching that of Notre Dame to within inches. The sanctuary has played host to the baptisms of the Marquis De Sade and Baudelaire, as well as the marriage of Victor Hugo. The attached seminary has a well-documented history of unorthodoxy and was once the clandestine meeting hall for numerous secret societies.

The protest, denouncing China\\'s economic instability and political corruption, was violently suppressed by armed soldiers ordered into Beijing by the PRC government.\nAlthough student protests had been occurring for over a year, the famous protest began in mid-April 1989. It was triggered by the death of Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the CCP between 1981 and 1987. Hu was forced to resign by Deng Xiaoping because of his soft attitude toward the student unrest in 1986. He was widely respected among students and intellectuals.

Carmen Ave Chicago, IL 60640Purpose of VitW: Voices in the Wilderness (VitW) was formed in 1996 to nonviolently challenge the economic warfare being waged by the US against the people of Iraq. Voices continues its work today, acting to end the US occupation of Iraq.\n\nWhat We Can Do:\n\nEducate &amp; Learn the story:\n\nGet informed about the history of the U.S. conflict with Iraq. Visit the Voices in the Wilderness website and the Electronic Iraq website to brush up on the myths and realities of 13 years of sanctions and war. For a helpful digest, read “Sanctions and War: Myths and Realities.”\n\nUnderstanding Corporate Media:\n\nCorporate media, or the Fourth Estate are no longer run as public trusts with a responsibility to society. They are now consumer products that are marketed and manufactured. Understanding the corporate media and knowing which independent and trustworthy alternatives are available is essential in truth telling and bringing justice during this most recent war and the failures of the on-going occupation. Reverse the corporate media spin IN EVERY CREATIVE WAY YOU CAN. Stay updated with website news services such as www.antiwar.com, news.independent.co.uk/world/, www.commondreams.org, and the “world news” section of the Guardian Unlimited Then use mediums such as art, street theatre, flyers, and alternative literature to effectively communicate the “rest of the story” to the public.\n\nEducate yourself wisely:\n\nIf you are a student, sign up for courses in Peace Studies, Arabic Studies, and International Relations. Consider getting a major or minor in one of these subjects. Or, attend lectures about these topics. The movement for a humane and just U.S. foreign policy towards Iraq and the Middle East will benefit from people with this sort of knowledge.\n\nResearch divestment:\n\nFind out which military contractors or corporations (e.g. Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Pentagon, and Department of Defense) have a vested interest in your school through grants and/or research. Consider starting a divestment campaign like students from Penn and Colombia have done: check out www.columbiadivest.org, www.geocities.com/penndivest/, and divest-from-israel-campaign.org.\n\nTeach others:\n\nHold a teach-in at a local educational, community or religious center. Contact Voices in the Wilderness at 773-784-8065 for speakers and educational materials such as literature, videos, and enlarged photos taken in Iraq. On the iraqpeaceteam.org website, click on “multimedia” and then “activism.”\n\nQuestion:\n\nAttend the public speeches of political candidates or any public figure who has supported or has remained silent about the crimes of sanctions and war. Ask questions. Be respectful, but DO NOT back down. Come with a group of friends who will help distribute literature, hold banners, etc. Send out a press release before and after the event.\n\nPressure:\n\nAfter you’ve called, emailed, faxed, and visited your Senators, Representative and the White House (for contact info see capwiz.com and the WH at 202.456.1111) to say NO! to continued U.S. military aggression, step it up a notch. Sit-ins, die-ins, and singing in a congressional office make an impression. Make connections with domestic concerns, such as heightened domestic insecurity if our government keeps exporting war around the world. Additional points to bring up are the number of civilian and military casualties, the high cost of war compared to the lack of funding of social welfare programs, and the loss of civil liberties.\n\nAct:\n\nWith most actions it is well worth it to contact the media. For an excellent media manual, see the Ruckus Society websites media manual.\n\nProtest:\n\nIf there is a defense company in your area, hold regular vigils at the site, distributing info, and making music to attract attention. Since March 2003, there have been countless creative nonviolent actions at Boeing Headquarters in Chicago. For example, a group of 15 people recently drummed and leafleted outside Boeing for 6 hours one afternoon and reached hundreds of people. Other possible sites include Congressional offices, federal buildings, military recruitment centers, and gas stations. VitW can send you sample leaflets as well as banner and slogan ideas. Email info@vitw.org.\n\nResist war taxes:\n\nAt present, close to 50% of every federal tax dollar goes to military spending for present and past wars. Consult with a war tax resister, such as those within the Voices network, or contact the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee, (800) 269-7464; nwtrcc@lightlink.com; War Resisters League (800) 975-9688; email wrl@igc.org.\n\nGive blood:\n\nOrganize a blood drive in your area and donate blood locally. Do this in memory of Iraqi children who have suffered and died in Iraq from sanctions and war. You could invite each donor to share a few words about the reasons she or he is giving blood. Look up blood banks in your local yellow pages. Usually you’ll need a minimum number of definite participants and a location. Work to get local community leaders, religious figures and other well-respected individuals to attend. And as always, invite the media.\n\nMonitor:\n\nHelp monitor military access and involvement in our schools. For more information, check out the American Friends Service Committee’s Youth and Militarism website.\n\nSponsor:\n\nDonate towards the stipend of an activist who is combating economic and military injustice. Help sponsor an organization working to end economic and military warfare through a donation of time, energy, or resources.\nWrite:\n\nSend a letter to the editor of your local paper or an article to a news magazine. If they are not published, call and ask for a non-discriminatory policy. Keep writing. If your paper presents only a pro-war perspective, consider requesting a meeting with the editorial board to pressure for better media coverage.\n\nAvoid oil consumption:\n\nExplore and use alternative transportation and energy. Love your bike!\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5t1qxer"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.667058,41.974524]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wachters' Organic Sea Products","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:EFRgK2-uwKoJ:http://www.healingretreat.com/images/wells-logo2.jpg\"> 360 Shaw Rd., S.

He had just gotten to the library and called me as soon as he heard. People at the library were scared for their lives. I begged him to come home and he said that he might have to but that things were still unclear. When I got to Tracy\\'s house she hadn\\'t heard so I told her. She and I sat in front of the tv for 2 hours not talking. We got hungry and found a cafe that had a tv. We ate in silence as we kept watching and getting sicker and more upset by the moment. I couldn\\'t call home (NY) becase all of the lines were busy all day and I was terrified that one of my brothers or sisters was there for some reason, even though they live hundreds of miles away in upstate the fear was so real I could taste it.\nAfter half a day spent watching television and feeling miserable Tracy and I decided to run away. We packed up the car, got the dog and went to a secret swimming hole in the woods we knew. We left because we felt like we were going to implode. We spent the rest of the afternoon sleeping next to the river. We were so overloaded with fear and sadness. That night we all went to the bar. We were embarrased to be out drinking but all of our friends were in shock and no-one could sit still or be alone. It felt like the whole was ending. I remember how scared everyone was, how fragile everything felt.

I shaved my head before I left, drove bare-foot and wore the same shirt for the whole trip. I was crazy superstitious about the journey because I had only learned how to drive the car 3 days before I left upstate NY. I thought I had everything taken care of- had the car checked out, got new tires and I was obsessively driving the speed limit and checking my oil. This was before I knew that WYOMING IS A VORTEX FOR CROSS COUNTRY JOURNEYS. \nMy car over-heated no less than 3 times, the final one stranding me at a rest stop 20 miles outside of Laramie. I was so shook up I locked my keys in the car.\nI ended up crying and kicking the car and calling AAA on the pay-phone to find out that b/c I didn\\'t have my AAA card (it was being mailed to my previous address) they wouldn\\'t help me AT ALL.\nI have since then been stranded twice more in Wyoming on 2 other cross country trips.

Along the entire length of the streetcar line, there are fourteen motion-sensored spotlights that are triggered by pedestrians walking along the sidewalk.  You must be on the same side of the street and walking in the same direction as the streetcar runs.  The spotlights are attached to utility poles.  The light won\\'t come on immediately - sometimes it takes several minutes for it to fade on and slowly fade off.  The spotlights illuminate things you might not normally think too much about, like a simple architectural feature, a park bench, or a patch of dirt.  \n\nWhen I first heard Harrell Fletcher describe his concept for the project, it went something like this: \"When I was a boy, my father and I would go on walks and he would point at things that he thought were interesting.  Later in my life, I studied photography, and I thought of that as a form of pointing, or saying \"I find this interesting.\"  The spotlights are intended to illuminate things that I found interesting along the streetcar line.\"  \n\nThis public art piece makes a really fun evening walk for the curious.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5o9aypp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675,45.523611]}},{"properties":{"name":"my new home","description":"Posted by Paigesthis is the latest homestead, my new roomie lisa is awesome.\nwe have the whole basement to craft and paint in, a huge backyard and I am only seven blocks from work.\nA creaky old house with each room a different color.\nLovely<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5y7gla7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.65886,45.55437]}},{"properties":{"name":"noble rot","description":"Posted by Paigesan old portland staple in a new portland location.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a671u5og3y3w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.638557,45.521984]}},{"properties":{"name":"otsu","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://veganmart.com/img/assets/counter.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> 3253 16th St San Francisco 94103Vegan shopping at its best!\n\nTue-Sun: 11am-7pm\nMon: Closed\n\nPhone 415-255-7900 or 866-HEY-OTSU toll-free!\nEmail: info-at-heyotsu-dot-com\n\nOtsu is located in San Francisco\\'\\'s Mission District on 16th Street between Guerrero and Dolores.
