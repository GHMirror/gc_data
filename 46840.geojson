It commemorates the loyalty of the Skye Terrier known as Greyfriar’s Bobby. In the 1850’s Bobby visited the inn every day at 1 o’clock with his master Jock, a shepherd. They had lunch together and became a well-known pair.\n\nAfter many years, the shepherd died and was buried in the churchyard. A few days later, Bobby showed up at the inn, and ate his regular lunch of bone. When the innkeeper followed the little terrier they ended up at the churchyard where Jock was buried, and Bobby laid on the grave of his late master. Bobby kept their routine and stayed by his master’s grave until his own death 14 years later.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hlbxot4rw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.1914,55.947085]}},{"properties":{"name":"Isis and Morpheus","description":"Posted by Bethanyjean<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/5/8568438_08fbac461e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/104738973_15b843b92b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/38/105000450_cfa16c4cee.jpg\">3050 Heald HighwayIsis is the lab mix, Morpheus is a bullmastiff<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hlbywxixa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-69.27412,44.223183]}},{"properties":{"name":"Laika, First Animal in Space","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/images/Laika.jpg\">moscow, RussiaLaika (from the Russian word for \"Barker\") was one of the Russian space dogs and the first living creature to enter orbit. She was launched into space on Sputnik 2, a Soviet spacecraft, on November 3, 1957. Like many other animals in space, she died during the mission, though earlier than intended.\n\nShe was found as a stray wandering the streets of Moscow, a mongrel female weighing approximately 6 kg (13 lb) and about 3 years old. \"Laika\" is in fact the Russian name for several breeds of dogs similar to the husky. Her name was changed from Kudryavka (Russian for \"Little Curly\"), and she was also nicknamed Zhuchka (\"Little Bug\") and Limonchik (\"Little Lemon\"). The American press dubbed her Muttnik (mutt + suffix \"-nik\") and some animal rights activists at the time called her Curly. Her true ancestry can never be known, although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part terrier.\n\nLaika died a few hours after launch from stress and overheating. Her true cause of death was not made public until decades after the flight, with officials stating that she was either euthanized by poisoned food or died when the oxygen ran out. Some former Soviet scientists have since expressed regret for allowing Laika to die.\nAlthough Laika did not survive the trip, the experiment proved that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure weightlessness. It paved the way for human spaceflight, and provided scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hlc2daoro"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.649889,55.75354]}},{"properties":{"name":"Murphy","description":"Posted by Jilbean3<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/874370f8481fa4173e8ecad3b103d919.jpg\">7567 Monarch Ct  Delray Beach, FL  33446Border Collie Pup<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hlc5zltij"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.165372,26.476732]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rifle the Fire Dog","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://www.rvcfire.org/opencms/opencms/system/galleries/pics/FireStations/rifle.jpg\">14580 Broadway, Cabazon, CA 92230fire dog, dog<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hlbxixw6d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.78273,33.909433]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rin Tin Tin","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://www.dogpark.com/content/images/1_57_1uy7tk1eAC-225x.jpg\">hollywood, CAThe German Shepherd Rin Tin Tin was the nation’s first canine movie star, although his beginnings were humble.

It was his nature not to burden others and he stayed in a hovel. While he lay dying, a dog from a nearby villa found Saint Roch and brought a fresh roll from his master\\'s house each day. The dog\\'s owner noticed this strange behavior and his curiosity led him to Rochus. Touched by the sick man and his condition, the dog\\'s owner befriended him and Saint Roch recovered.\n\nBack in France there was a civil war. Saint Roch left for home and the dog went with him. The turbulence of war led him to be accused to spying. Saint Roch refused to identify himself as royalty and was thrown in prison along with his dog. He spent time praying and helping fellow prisoners until he died five years later. At his death a document in his possession and the distinctive birthmark revealed his true identity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hlc7gguvx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.501068,41.874929]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sam","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/24/103282520_0bea5df435.jpg?v=0\">International Dog of IntrigueWe got Sam from the humane society at Genevilliers near Paris, in France.
