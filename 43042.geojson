(2005) in the October 7 issue of Science\n\n‘Nicole’, a ca. 3.8 m female great white shark (named in honor of actress and white shark enthusiast Nicole Kidman) was fitted with a pop-up archival tag in Gansbaai, Western Cape, South Africa, on November 7, 2003. Almost 4 months later on February 28, 2004, the tag popped up just 3 kilometers from the coast of Western Australia. This remarkable trip demonstrated what powerful swimmers white sharks are, and that female white sharks do indeed move between two of the most important white shark populations in the world. Nicole returned from Australia to the same exact bay where it was originally tagged only 9 months after being tagged.\n\nThe study, which was a collaboration between the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the South African Department of Environmental Affairs &amp; Tourism, the White Shark Trust, the University of Pretoria and the University of Cape Town, provided essential information to enhance the management and conservation status of threatened white shark populations in the regions via an improved understanding of species distribution patterns (for more details see: http://wcs.org/greatwhitesharks).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim09jz8it"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.426,-34.639]}},{"properties":{"name":"Date 2003-1-22, 9 weeks","description":"Posted by Dolphintim<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/1_11_.jpg\">-27.6855\t82.1338Interesting fact about this journey # 4- \r\n\r\nMost time spent: at surface (61%) \r\nTolerance of water temperatures: as low as 3.4°C (~38 F)\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim05vsbj7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[82.1338,-27.6855]}},{"properties":{"name":"Date 2003-11-21, 2 weeks later","description":"Posted by Dolphintim<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/1.jpg\">-34.8486\t,18.7646\tThis is Nicole!\r\n\r\nImage credit: Michael Meÿer<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim0flgwa0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[18.7646,-34.8486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Date 2003-11-29, 3 weeks later","description":"Posted by Dolphintim<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/1_3_.jpg\">-38.3203\t,14.3262Interesting fact about this journey # 1- \r\n\r\nTransoceanic return migration involved a return to the original capture location \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim0jkb8xj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.3262,-38.3203]}},{"properties":{"name":"Date 2003-12-15, 5 weeks","description":"Posted by Dolphintim<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/5.jpg\">-42.9345\t,36.4307Doesn\\'t the shark have a HUGE head/ jaw?\r\n\r\nLead researcher Dr Ramon Bonfil said: \"Nicole has shown us that separate populations of great white sharks may be more directly connected than previously thought.\" \r\n\r\nImage credit: Staverees/MCM<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim0hi2mgt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.4307,-42.9345]}},{"properties":{"name":"Date 2003-12-21, 6 weeks","description":"Posted by Dolphintim<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/1_8_.jpg\">-39.8144\t,47.8564Interesting fact about this journey # 2- \r\n\r\nTotal distance: 20,000+ km long <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim0hsy26y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[47.8564,-39.8144]}},{"properties":{"name":"Date 2003-12-29, 7 weeks now","description":"Posted by Dolphintim<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/1_9_.jpg\">-36.1670\t57.7441Interesting fact about this journey # 3- \r\n\r\nDeepest diving depth: 980 m <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim0l3gxgm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[57.7441,-36.167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Date 2003-12-8, a month's gone","description":"Posted by Dolphintim<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/3_2_.jpg\">-42.3193\t,24.8291This data didn\\'t come easy -

You drove like a demon, cutting corners at 50 miles an hour, and wildly swerving around old grandmothers walking slowly across  streets in front of the car. You were my only companion for the two months I lived in Portugal. We met each night but never once spoke on the phone. I hated your driving, hated the way you drove fast and furious  making me cry and hide in my seat. You loved to scare me. Laughing good naturedly at my terror until I cried and then pulling the car over. You would mumble a thousand apologies, kiss my hands and face and repeat the word for \"Joke\" over and over while stifling giggles.\nIt was a nightly ritual, I would sit all day reading by myself and wait for you to get off of work and then we would drive aimlessly. There was nowhere to be and no one to care what we did. I couldn\\'t speak a lick of Portuguese and you spoke no English at all. For two months we talked with our hands, our bodies, our eyes and our kisses. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6wim0htr7c9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.838501,39.291797]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/227145","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dolphintim","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dolphintim","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/227145","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":16,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=227145,platial:user=dolphintim","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":43042}
