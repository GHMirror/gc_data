It is about AIDS, conservative politics, history, relationships, religion, identity (ethnicity, race, homosexuality), love, forgiveness, survival and transcendence.  The plot focuses on two trouble couples, one gay, one straight.  Their fates quickly become intertwined as the \"upheaval\" of the story developed.  The script is written with beautiful dialogues and the language is stimulating.  The production and acting are superb with Al Pacino and Meryl Streep being extremely powerful and moving.  It won the Emmy for Best Mini-series 2004; 4 in the actors categories and 12 in total.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s overwrought with sadness, pain, and profound loneliness. But it\\'s a profound human dimension or existential experience. You\\'ll end up saying: \"More Life.

Not only is Foer\\'s language necessarily dropped from the loop�apart from the inevitable narration, giving us a molecular taste of the Ukrainian protagonist\\'s chaotic consumer English�but so is the mysterious no-man\\'s-land between page and reader, where absurdist ideas are not visualized but can be seen nonetheless. Schreiber jettisons the novel\\'s juicy mock-folk shtetl legends and focuses on the \"very rigid search\" of young American neurotic Foer (Elijah Wood) for the Slavic woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Wood\\'s Foer is an anemic straight-man caricature (hardly the precocious nebbish Foer suggested himself to be), and so texture is provided by Eugene Hutz (of Gogol Bordello) as Alex, Foer\\'s Odessa hipster guide, and grizzled Russian vet Boris Leskin, as Alex\\'s irascible, anti-Semitic, guilt-riddled grandfather.\n\nWhat tale there is left to tell is reduced to driving (through the Czech Republic) and mildly comic culture clash conversation�until the three-man convoy reaches the extinct village where Foer\\'s ancestral treasure lies half buried, waiting for rediscovery. Schreiber relies on relentless soundtrack oompah-pah to make the jokes seem like jokes�until the sniffly climax. (Schreiber, like many actor-directors, is indulgent of\"heavy\" moments of staring and gesture that actually have no weight at all.) Still, Foer\\'s ironic ideas have a lovely roundness to them, and somehow the film achieves Holocaust-fiction balance without much ado or melodrama. It may be substantially less ambitious than its source material, but that may be what saves it from implosion. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65yi0mbdl18"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.329999,50.75]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fargo","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/46/26/70m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Fargo, North DakotaA homespun murder story.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65yi0nz2422"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.789444,46.877222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Garden State","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/37/14/58m.jpg\">New Jersey<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65yi0j9t3qz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.729004,39.707187]}},{"properties":{"name":"Heavenly Creatures","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/87/92/10m.jpg\">Christchurch, New Zealand<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65yi0fa3md9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[172.880859,-43.675818]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel Rwanda","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/39/81/98m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Rwanda<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65yi0laweu0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[29.873888,-1.940278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Invercargill; The World's Fastest Indian","description":"Posted by Keownnz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2a61d49eb01149795c9a20d106238622.jpg\">new zealandHome of Burt Munro who is now immortalised by Anthony Hopkins in The World\\'s Fastest Indian.
