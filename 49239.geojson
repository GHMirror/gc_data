After an hour and a half of buses, I discovered that the listing in the newspaper was wrong, it\\'d been yesterday and Friday.  After that, I planned on taking it easy for the evening.  The highlight of the day was running into two of my friends from back home on the bus and bringing them on a tour to my favorite bar, coffeehouse, pizza joint and playground in the neighborhood.\n\nBut then I sang at a strip club instead.\n\nTo preface:  In my 26 years, I\\'ve only been in a strip club once, many years ago.  By the end of the night, I\\'d decided I\\'d never go to one again, because it was just too easy.\n\nToo easy to spend my last 0, which I\\'d planned to spend on re-piercing my eyebrow.\n\nBut when the Aussie told me there\\'s a club further down the bus route that has \"Stripparaoke\" every Sunday night, I knew some things in my head had to change.\n\nAnd so it was that me, the Aussie and the Minnesotan walked into the Devil\\'s Point to the sound of \"Land of the Rising Sun,\" sung by a guy sharing the stage with a dancer named Valentine.\n\nStripparaoke.  It\\'s all in the name.  You\\'re singing karaoke on the stage of the club, next to the pole, reading the lyrics off a TV screen or the projector behind you, surrounded by mirrors -- while a stripper rubs up against you, gyrates around, and occasionally flips upside-down on the pole and spreads her legs for the audience.\n\nThere were some damn good songs.  One guy got on stage, and told us about how one method of torture the U.S. uses against detainees is to play The Eagles loudly, for a long time.  Then he sang \"The Eagles Must Die.\"  Another guy announced, \"This song is from George Bush to Osama bin Laden,\" and sang \"Never There\" by Cake.  \"When I need you, baby?  You\\'re never there!\"\n\nThe Minnesotan sang \"Mustang Sally,\" and the Aussie sang \"Mack The Knife\" despite the computer glitching.  Myself, I chose \"Kiss Off\" by The Violent Femmes over the Dynamite Hack version of \"Boyz in da Hood\" and \"Mambo #5.\"  This wasn\\'t the wisest choice, because as soon as the music started I realized I\\'m only familiar with live recordings off it and the cover Matt Hopper plays, yet I don\\'t think I did that bad in the end.\n\nBut maybe next Sunday it\\'ll be time for \"Boyz in da Hood,\" \"Mambo #5\" and perhaps even \"You Can\\'t Hurry Love\" by The Supremes.  Because it was a fucking blast, and I\\'m definitely going to become a regular.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64lf53swlxy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.607837,45.495128]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Pied Cow","description":"Posted by Hawthornehostel<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/265802909_e49ea9f6a8_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 3244 SE Belmont St portland oregon<b>Staff Picks:  Place To Go Out At Night</b>\n\"Smoke a hookah while enjoying one of their 30 beers or numerous wines.\" - Drew\n\nThe Pied Cow is a coffeehouse, wine bar, and hookah bar in a historic house on Belmont.

Velveteria is an entire museum devoted to them.\n\n\"Velvet painting is the Rodney Dangerfield of art. It\\'s the stuff nobody wanted like a red headed step-child. But that\\'s wrong.  Velvet painting is technically difficult and requires different skills than ordinary painting. Our pieces range from fine art to \\'Oh my God, what were they thinking?\\' With over 170 painting on display, there is something for everyone.\n\n\"Velveteria takes one through the South Sea islands to a lair of beautiful ladies to the Wall of Fame where the classics of velvet are found. Dogs playing poker, Elvis, Banditos and clowns. Plus, we have rotating shows, like the story of Jesus and Mary on velvet, during April for Easter. Velvet painting captures pathos and whimsy in a frame. \"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64lf4wm15zp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.637204,45.526665]}},{"properties":{"name":"cargo","description":"Posted by Shopportland734 nw 14th avenue, portland, or<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64lf52urea8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.685356,45.528185]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/75998","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dj10ninjas","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dj10ninjas","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/75998","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=75998,platial:user=dj10ninjas","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":49239}
