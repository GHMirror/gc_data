Bring your costumes, instruments, and silly attitudes and prepare to be charmed by one of New York City\\'s wackiest Halloween extravaganzas. Hot Peas \\'N Butter—who stunned audiences from Symphony Space to the Tribeca Film Festival with their upbeat blend of Puerto Rican bomba plena, American folk, and groovy R&amp;B—will have audiences of all ages dancing in the grass. The group will be joined by nine-year-old Puerto Rican dance prodigy Alize Roid. Rebecca Frezza and her Big Truck Band became an instant smash hit on Nickelodeon cable television with her song about gardening entitled H²O + O² + Sun. She promises to bring that song and more of her award-winning high octane rock \\'n\\' roll sounds to BBG audiences on the Cherry Esplanade. Parent\\'s Choice Gold Award–winner Billy Jonas returns from Asheville, North Carolina, to sing about recycling, watermelon seeds, and Mount St. Helen with his one-man \"industrial re-percussion\" band. Plus use Sassafras-leaf rubbings to make a \"ghost portrait,\" check out displays of \"shrunken apple heads\" and Thai pumpkin carving, or make your own recycled instrument to take home. The afternoon culminates with a Halloween costume parade led by drummers from the Brazilian percussion corps, Maracatu NY. Visiting ghouls and goblins can march to the beat of hundreds of zany percussion instruments, carry an assortment of larger-than-life puppets, or just show off their own costumes for all to see! \n\nvia <a href=\"http://brooklyn.about.com/od/recreation/a/halloween.htm\">about.com</a>\n\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ai5mck5kup"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.961226,40.664606]}},{"properties":{"name":"Halloween Festival 10/28/2006","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/0/kids5_lg.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 85 South Oxford, Brooklyn, NY, 11217Fort Greene Park Conservancy The 7th Annual Halloween Festival in Fort Greene Park: Saturday, October 28th, 12 noon - 3 pm\n\nFace painters, some clowns, bean bag toss games, sack races, a pumpkin patch with pumpkins for painting, a children\\'s costume parade &amp; contest, live musical performances, a dog costume contest (see above), and a horse-driven hay ride, are part of the free festival.
