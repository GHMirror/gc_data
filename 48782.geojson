They lived there because her father liked to travel and he went over there to train Nigerian teachers.  My mom always tells me crazy stories about things that happened there and about the native people.\r\nI\\'ve always wondered what it would be like to grow up in Africa.  Someday i would like to go where my mom lived and see what it\\'s like.  I\\'m sure it would be a lot different from my life here in America.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byfkjbocij"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.5475158691,12.2890174723]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chernobyl","description":"Posted by Bigb<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/300px_Chernobyl_Disaster_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/C2VT4CA2QU8STCAVBQ8L2CA9EL311CAYRC9R2CADGXXXKCA93P81OCA7DEI7XCACVPNH7CA2DZPY1CADKYISMCAB2DFOYCAIDTVBACAVHNNCACAEF9TT1CAEDNLUICA1R58PXCA8MH6ZLCA0QXHT8.jpg\">RussiaChernobyl is the name of a power plant located in Russia.  On April 26,1986 one of the reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded.  This cause a fire to brake out damaging the other reactors and sending nuclear toxins all over Russia and Other parts of the world.\r\nAs a result the whole area surrounding the power plant had to be evacuated.  Only about 50 people died during the explosion, but it\\'s estimated that around nine thousand have died from cancer that was caused by the incident.  The area closly surrounding the plant is still abondond till this day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byfkmqzav2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[105.318756,61.52401]}},{"properties":{"name":"Colosseum","description":"Posted by Bigb<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/tyyt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/_952988_gladiator_ap300.jpg\">The colosseum is located in Rome, Italy.  It was built as a gift for the people in 72 ad and was completed in 80 ad.  They did many things there but mostly venationes (hunts) and the munera (gladiatorial games).\r\nIt must have been well built because it stayed in service for four and a half centuries.  It also survived throught a fire caused by a lightning bolt and many large earthquakes.  Also it is still around today more than 1900 years later.  One day I hope to go there and get the feel for how life was 1900 years ago.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byfkh8av8b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.492077,41.890154]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grand Canyon","description":"Posted by Bigb<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/j.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/gt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/y.jpg\">californiaThe Grand Canyon is located in Arizona.

Not only is it senic but they have hiking and mountain biking trails.\r\nMy family is thinking about go to the Grand Canyon this year for vacation.

It affected many peoples lives from soldiers to the people living in Hiroshima at the time the bomb was dropped.  It was dropped on August 6, 1945 and was nicknamed \"Little Boy\".\r\nIt killed over 140,000 at the time.  Later it killed over 60,000 people due to cancer and other long term affects.  In my opinion I think dropping the bomb was a good idea.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6byfkofvql7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[132.440002,34.389999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kwajalein","description":"Posted by Bigb<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/4_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Marshall_Islands___Kwajalein_Ocean_Road.jpg\">My mother lived on Kwajalein with her family when she was in high-school.  She lived there because her father liked to travel and he had an opportunity to be the islands elementary school principal.  When she lived there it was being used as a military base.  This is why almost half the island is made up of an airport.\r\nShe said life there was very different than life in America.  They didn\\'t have cars, a cafeteria at there school or even telephones.  She always tells me about it and about the time she accidentaly pierced her friends ear with a fishing hook while out fishing.

It\\'s a small town in Wisconsin, but it\\'s nice and quiet.  There\\'s alot of hunting done there for deer and turkey, so you always see deer out in fields.  There are some realy cool things there such as an old granite quary, a huge Tru Value store, and lots of rivers and lakes for fishing in.\r\nAll of my moms family lives up there and they live pretty close together.  My mom\\'s family consists of three aunts and uncles, and seven cousins.

It was finished in 2003 and is now a world class stadium.\r\n     One day i hope to go to a bear\\'s game in their home stadium.  I\\'ve never been to a football game in the snow and it snows alot at Soldier Field.

I\\'ve caught many bass there and on ocasion blue gills and gators.\r\nI\\'ve been fishing there ever since I moved into my new house and that was eleven years ago.  The only downside to fishing there is that you have to walk on an old trail through the woods to get there.
