Tom Pfeiffer of Elgin purchased and dismantled  the vessel, using the lumber for building the Inn.\nThe McClellan had 22 bedrooms and was lighted throughout with acetylene. The hotel was leased to Miss Ethel McClellan (she later married John Flowers), who was known by the traveling public as one of the best hotelwomen in Texas. From 1910 the train made a 20 minute lunch stop at Elgin and Mrs Flowers fed the passengers.  \nAfter Mrs Flowers\\' death in 1926 the hotel had several owners.
