We moved back to Helena, after that.  Close to Jet are the famous Salt Plains, left over from pre-historic days.  Tourists and locals go out there to dig up the unique salt crystals, always hoping to get the elusive \"rose\" crystals.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6h20el8mu6z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.181767,36.666767]}},{"properties":{"name":"AZ A School","description":"Posted by Moyockokie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/colors.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 740 FLETCHER ROAD MERIDIAN MS 39309-5040I went to AZ \"A\" School at NTTC Meridian, MS, it was a 6-week school, to teach us the basics about the Aviation Maintenance Administrationman rate.  I did very well in the class, achieving a top score, (top of the boot camps, not top of the class; a \"fleet returnee\" female Marine got a higher score).  That normally would have earned me the right to choose orders to my first command in the fleet, but it didn\\'t work that way with my class.  The Leading Chief Petty Officer simply told us where we were going, with no choices.  I ended up getting orders to the one and only, the one of a kind, CV-67, USS John F.

I went morning and afternoon, completing a 2-year course in one year, of Culinary Arts.  It was fun, and I couldn\\'t find a job anyway, so it was something to fill my time till I could find work.  I did end up working for a while at the \"Next Door\" restaurant, and then the Maxwell Pancake House.  I had started out the year living with relatives and ended the school year living on my own at the age of 18.   I graduated with a grade of 4.0, sharing the top score with a good friend, an old oil well worker looking to get training in a new vocation.  It was a good time, and I grew up a lot, but living alone was very boring.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6h20ev0uszu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.892355,36.419663]}},{"properties":{"name":"College","description":"Posted by Moyockokie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/hospitality_splash.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1801 East 4th - Okmulgee, OK 74447I got an Associate\\'s Degree in Culinary Arts etc. here, and met and married my wife of 17 years!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6h20eirdz9y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.940406,35.627442]}},{"properties":{"name":"Enlisting in the Navy","description":"Posted by Moyockokie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/St_Louis_Arch.jpg\">1222 Spruce Street St. Louis, MO 63103-2816In February 1991, I enlisted in the Navy, as an Undesignated Fireman (WTFO?), and was in boot camp in less than a week!

I was sent there after Boot Camp and Apprenticeship Training, in Orlando, FL.  After working in the Galley, \"mess cranking\", and cleaning in the school house (1st LT), I was told (along with 7 or 8 others) that I was too hard-of-hearing to be in an engineering rating, and had to re-classify.  I was given 3 options; getting a new school and rating in a less noisy environment, going back out to the fleet as an undesignated Fireman, or going home and getting out of the Navy.  Getting out was not an option (I needed the money), and I had earned my school, so I re-classified.
