There\\'s a stagnant pond on Middle Calf that must have once provided water for the group of houses here. They were lived in up til 1954. \r\nI once saw a man in a small boat towing a line of cows to leave them graze for the summer. I have used dried cow-pats to build a big fire on the beach. Stiff and light, like big deep-dish pizzas, they burned beautifully with a clear flame, little smoke and no smell. Usually my first concern, after settling on a beach camp, is to head off again and load the back deck with driftwood. It might mean scavenging all the beaches and coves on a small island to make enough to last the night.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjrqvkzos"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-9.5036,51.47941]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aiguafreda","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/a_typical_fishermans_villag_2_.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjrx1dxjd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.22727680206,41.9641810801]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aiguafreda","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/a_typical_fishermans_villag.jpg\">A typical old fisherman\\'s village, where your typical old fisherman is a millionaire.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjrujm83v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.22659015656,42.0413252393]}},{"properties":{"name":"Backroad to Loch Hyne","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/near_Loch_Hyne.jpg\">A plein air painting of one of a hundred identical little lanes. \r\nThe fear that too much Bungalow Bliss has been allowed to happen all over rural Ireland, makes a revisit an alarming prospect. \r\nLoch Hyne itself is a natural oddity, with unusually cold and semi-salty depths - and a host of creatures that shouldn\\'t be living there.

Then I recently came across this horrendous item: Sixty grey seals slaughtered on Blaskets 05-11-04\\'About 60 grey seals have been culled on one of the Blasket Islands off the coast of Co Kerry. The Irish Seal Sanctuary blamed local fishermen for the slaughter of the seals. \"There\\'s only one direction the finger can be pointed at: the fishing community,\" said group spokesman Mr Sean Eviston, who travelled to Beginish Island off the coast of the Dingle peninsula to confirm reports of the cull. Mr Eviston said the grey seals killed were mostly \"whitecoats,\" pups about three weeks old. He said the attackers appeared to have used several methods to kill, including gun shots, beating the animals with rocks, and driving nails into their skulls. \"They ripped some of these seals open from the nape of the neck,\" he said. Gardaí are investigating.he Minister for the Environment, Mr Dick Roche, described the slaughter of the seals as \"cruel and barbaric\". He has sent a department official to the islands to investigate. The cruel and barbaric slaughter of these seals has a de-humanising effect on society. The sight of seals being bludgeoned to death is repugnant,\" mr Roche said. ishermen have been blamed for occasional slaughters of seals on the islands that dot the western and southern coasts of Ireland. Nobody has ever faced charges. rey seals are supposed to be a protected species under Ireland\\'s Wildlife Act of 1976. Beginish is part of the Blasket Islands, Ireland\\'s largest sanctuary for grey seals. The Irish Seal Sanctuary estimates that fewer than 400 grey seals are resident in the islands, down from about 2,000 a half-century ago.\\'<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjs5ly4cm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-10.50748,52.11578]}},{"properties":{"name":"Between Escala and Estartit","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/rock_formation_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/the_wine_dark_sea.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/the_wild_coast.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/sea_cave_2_.jpg\">Between the built-up towns and the sandy bays, are stretches of wild coast with only tiny calas to shelter in.\r\nTortured rock formations, sea-caves, islets and warm water - this is seakayak heaven, as well as sailing bliss.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjry5ehax"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.20251464844,42.0931273199]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blue trees above Ribaute","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/Blue_Trees.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> A plein-air painting,mid-summer,between Ribaute and Lagrasse.<a href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">www.maryhorganpaintings.com</a>\r\nResidential painting weeks : www.artholiday.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjrvi4z3z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.59222,43.0971]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cabo de Gata, Andalucia","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/Agave_and_Cactus_Tree_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/agaves_and_cactus_2_(_oil_75x75cm).jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/cactus_tree,_cabo_de_gata_(oil__60x80cm).jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Plein air paintings of agaves and cactus trees on the dunes of Playa dos Genoveses,near San Jose.

The best may be High Island and Toe Head Stags out of either Union Hall area or Lough Hyne.\\' He goes into more detail in the main page of the site: High Island: \\'This splendid steep, craggy, rugged, grass topped island is not for the faint-hearted. Any landing is from deep water onto rock, but there are two very sheltered coves on the N side, one facing E and the other W towards Low Island. The easier scramble to the summit is from the E cove, in proof of which I point to the blood on the rocks at the foot of the W cove, which is mine. The main nesting birds are Lesser Black-backed Gulls, and Shag. The main interest for the kayaker is the varied host of creeks and rocky passages on the Low Island side, and the sporting, surfing reefs and bumpy water generally on the outside, especially with a tide running. Low Island lies close by to the NW of, and is dominated by, High Island, its impressive neighbour. Landings may be had on the SE side facing High Island, or also on the NW side. In each case, land easily onto a sheltered pebble beach. The big goat reported in earlier editions seems to be gone and no longer makes camping insecure. However, camping is insecure in that the ground is very sandy, reluctant to hold tent pegs, and this type of topsoil is thought to be rodent friendly, and there are lots of them! The island is not dramatic.\\' <a href=\"http://www.oileain.org/recex.htm\">www.oileain.org/recex.htm</a> The first time I landed there - some time before this was written - there were two goats, the big old puck and a female. The next summer - just the puck, and a whitened skeleton with a drumskin of brittle hide stretched over the ribs. Low island was eroding rapidly too: the \\'waist\\' of sandy soil between the two beaches was much reduced and there may be little remaining to camp on by now.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjrqvou1g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-9.12895,51.51622]}},{"properties":{"name":"Holeopen -  Blood on the Rocks","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/Old_Head_arial.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/this_might_be_holeopen.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/1/one_is_holeopen_2_.jpg\">Sea Kayaking underground - if you\\'re lucky. David Walsh, of <a href=\"http://www.oileain.org/\">www.oileain.org</a> : \\'This mighty headland extends 7km out to sea, W of Cork Harbour. Magnificent and rocky, it \\'boasts\\' a golf course over the entirety of its outer parts, denying pedestrian public access over much of its amenity. This is said to be the finest, and certainly is among the most expensive golf courses in the world, to which the very rich, mainly American break-takers, fly in especially. A major battle has been conducted in the courts and on the ground between the competing interests of entrepreneurial private property on the one hand and the Keep Ireland Open spirit on the other. It is claimed that a traditional right of way existed. There was a rock-climbing crag at the head itself, now disused. The grid reference given is for a narrow neck halfway out, to the E and W of which are Holeopen Bay, E and W respectively. Through this narrow section, S of which lies the golf course, run three caves. One (narrow but deep) is kayak friendly and should in most conditions allow passing kayaks to avoid the rounding of the headland itself. One (broad but bouldery) might also do so at HW. A third allowed researchers a glimpse of light and might require cool nerves. Cliffy and gorgeous : do not readily pass by without a visit.\\'This is so near Cork City, and its thrill-seeking paddlers - yet so few take the opportunity to die a horrible and lonely death, immediately beneath a bunch of fat golfers.\\'Was that a scream, Chuck?\\'\\'Could be. Maybe. Pass me that putter.\\' This day was quite ordinary - except it involved the most frightening passage (only 200 m. long) of my life.There had been hours planning it - checking the tide-tables, the forecast, the family etc.Then lurking at the various entrances : which was the one? And which was not the one. Which was the one that would involve several days waiting, for my wife, before the body could be brought out? Not being trained, not being a member of a paddling club - in fact having an aversion to training, and clubs - left me open to the kind of casual \\'oh-what-a-fool\\' type of death that I have always feared, while knowing that social embarassment is not going to be that important , after all, once I\\'ve made the ultimate gaffe.\r\n\r\nIn the end I went through all three.\r\nThe tide was so low for the first, I had to get out on a patch of shingle right in the middle, and haul the boat over the boulders.\r\nThere were bright orange starfish and purple blobs shining eerily in the wet green half-light. I emerged, heart racing, jubilant.\r\nThe second was narrow, but straightforward with depth all the way. More jubilation.\r\nThe last cleft took all my nerve to enter. Even less light, paddle scraping the walls on both sides, the swell now sweeping me up and down the confines of a dank dripping lift-shaft, the possibility of being dropped on a submerged rock a constant fear.\r\nThe relief on exiting was shattering.\r\n\r\nThere is a story around Cork, of a paddler who tipped over halfway through. He swam back out and climbed the cliff-face to the golf course above, leaving a trail of blood on the rocks from his shredded hands. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjrtygzvn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.53895,51.61509]}},{"properties":{"name":"Illes Medes","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/Rick_at_the_Medas_Isles.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/Islas_Medas.jpg\">I am allowed to try my hand at looking ruggedly capable.\r\nAnd the same rocky islet in sun.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjs3636up"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.22693347931,42.0407196761]}},{"properties":{"name":"Imagined landscapes : Montlaur","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/Bend_142k.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/mn_night_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/by_montl.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/4/In_the_Corbieres.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Sketches and paintings begun en plein air - finished in her studio.

There\\'s snow on McGillycuddy\\'s Reeks. The trip down through all three lakes is fascinating at every turn. The Upper Lake is my favourite: wilder and less visited, overhung by The Reeks and Purple Mountain (named for the screes of dark slate), and dotted with islands, one of which would make a great camp. Long Range is a stretch of river that links Upper to Muckross Lake, passing under Eagles Rock. Finding your way in to it  is tricky - reeds mask entrances or turn out to be deadends. A fast run-off in the mountainous catchment also means that in heavy rain the level of the entire Upper Lake can sometimes rise by up to a metre in a matter of a few hours. We found a scuffy dank beach on the main lake, Loch Leane: dripping rhodedendrons out of place next to ancient rotund beeches. It took two of us to effect a tree-hug around one. For once we were an all-male group - but we were careful to avoid any Iron John stuff, concentrating mainly on getting the damp wood to light, and getting a fair share of the whiskey.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjs232wj9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-9.56017,52.02736]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Escala","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/1/Sketching_everything_everyw.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/La_Escala___and_the_tame_co.jpg\">This is the other face of the Wild Coast : stark, modern moorings, and high-rise fantasies all round the bay.\r\nWe did find a friendly and tasty tapas place, however - on a nondescript street.\r\nThe town is a half-mile walk from the fishing-fleet port.

To this day I\\'m still not sure what sounds are going to come out of my mouth when I say it: \\'no-HO-vul\\'? or maybe \\'NO-haval\\'? or even \\'novul\\' - going for the casual local diction.The fact is, I\\'m a Brit. And I could live to be a hundred without really getting it. It being what the Irish have, and the rest of the world don\\'t.Nohoval - say it how you like - is a gloomy and nondescript sort of a place, favored by smugglers and gun-runners and wreckers. And sea kayakers living in Cork City needing a quick blast of ozone and spray.There are gaunt cliffs and sea-caves, and a tricky launch off a slimey, seaweedy stone beach. It\\'s not epic material, but it\\'s technical what with the launch through surf (no matter how calm the day) and then clapotis all the way.I had a duty-call later in the day, so it was up early and out along under the cliffs in brilliant autumn light. There are days that start ordinary and gain speed and momentum and clarity and significance. From the start,everything was heightened: colours and shadow, light and attention, detail and contemplation. This isn\\'t some Wordsworthian \\'emotion recollected in tranquiliy\\' - I knew it. I knew it at the time, and I can know it again now : the sheer exhuberance of being alive.The duty call was a sort of hippy/gypsy funeral rite : the death of a daughter of friends of a friend, that I said I\\'d attend. I wasn\\'t really interested.Becket was not exactly her name - more the name that became hers when she took to the road in an original barrel-top horse-drawn caravan.She\\'d learnt how to do it from her English parents. Bev and Del have been living the horse and wagon life for years. There\\'s magic and nonsense, ecology and dreams, road fumes and freedom in the whole mix.The car that swiped her off her bicycle and into a vegetetive state was never found.Her father had to say yes, pull the plugs. Now you must die, completely.And this afternoon there must be a complete conflagration of her possessions. It is, apparently, the Gypsy Way. There is a Loving Cup, filled and refilled and passed to everyone. All her precious belongings are arranged in her caravan, and everyone stoops, enters, looks into this tiny world ( and it IS cramped : I lived in one for a year and there\\'s only room for a bed, a stove and a bottle of poteen) steps back, says something inadequate to Bev or Del, and moves away from the coming horror. Then bales of straw are brought, and lit, and soon this extraordinary space, this life, this dream goes up in flame and smoke. Nothing remains - just memory, and that doesn\\'t either, not for very long.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjs4rvko2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.38428,51.71416]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old sea kayak and modern tent - Heir Island,Roaringwater Bay","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/seakayak_and_tent_on_Heir_i.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> I still have this, my first and only sea kayak. The Baidarka Explorer was designed by Derek Hutchinson. It has a very pronounced V–shaped hull and as it has a cutter bow and stern the keel extends the whole length of the waterline. This coupled with its Swedish form makes it quite a fast boat. The turned up bits on the bow and stern are Hutchinson’s interpretation of the bifurcated bows on the skin boats of the Aleutian Islands (it\\'s Russian for \\'little boat\\'). expedition boat designed to carry large loads. It’s very good at going from A to B in as straight a line as possible but it\\'s not very manoeuvrable: even when edged right over in a high brace turn it doesn’t turn quickly. When loaded that deep V keel is pushed down into the water and the soft chines give it very good secondary stability. When cranked over there’s a positive feel to edging. But when empty it rides higher in the water so you’re sitting on that V shape which makes it very twitchy and the positive feel of the chines disappears. The high peak on the fore deck makes it a very easy boat to roll. This is an old design now there are more modern expedition boats around that will carry as much, are just as fast, more manoeuvrable and better behaved when empty.But they don\\'t look so weirdly wonderful.

It is possible to get through the channels except at LW. The stach nearer Rabbit is climbable in the E side with care. The larger taller steeper stack farther from Rabbit will be too dangerous a grassy scramble for most tastes. \r\nRabbit Island: \\'This pleasant, formerly inhabited island is the mainstay of this group and very much worthy of a camping stopover. he best landing place is halfway along the N coast, on a sheltered pebble beach under a ruined house. There is sheltered camping beside the house, but no water was found. The island is waisted N/S at this point, and camping may also be had on the other, S side of the waist, also from a pebble beach, for that \\'oceanic feel\\' and also at any number of other pebble beaches on this much-fragmented, attractive island, which is well worth pottering around, on foot or afloat. \r\n\r\nThis island is privately owned (1997) by an owner who would prefer exclusive use of the S facing beach referred to above for picnics and boat, but otherwise would allow well behaved visitors to use the rest of the island in passing. \r\nThere are wild horses, burrows, Chough and Linnet on the island. Otter were seen on the W side and at the Stack of Beans on the E side.\\' \r\n\r\nSome years back, that new owner turned up for the first time and caught me by surprise: up \\'til then I had thought the exclusive use of the place, including that \\'oceanic feel\\', was mine. How could someone \\'own\\' this uninhabited island? How could he own \\'my island\\'? I broke camp and left in a rage - which was only slighly moderated later that summer, when I cruised past and spotted them skinny-dipping - as I had done before.

The weather had seemed set fair for the long weekend, but lobstermen off Inishnabro warned of a rapid change. As David Walsh says in Oileáin (an evolving guide to the Irish islands): \"There is little in the way of anchorages for bigger boats at the outliers, which are also rugged and exposed. Therefore, sea kayakers are privileged to have the finest way to explore the group as a whole. he Blaskets are a showpiece of Irish sea kayaking. That said, among the outliers, only Beginish and Inishvickillane have landings that are in any way dependable. Good conditions are needed elsewhere to avoid having to swim ashore, or worse. Expect to have to work for any landing.\"\r\nThere was just time to land and piss on Inishvickillane, Haughy\\'s private island and rush back to break camp on Beginish. Crossing Blasket Sound before the squalls hit was fearful: the tide races in the sounds, including Blasket Sound, have a fierce reputation.

The Gearagh essentially forms an inland delta, where the River Lee breaks into a complex network of channels (2 to 6m wide) weaving through a series of wooded islands. It is the only extensive remains of Alluvial Forest found in western Europe. It is a unique place of streams, narrow channels and small islands. Here are found some very rare plant and insect specimens which have been investigated and recorded by famous naturalists and scientists since the 19th century. There are 100\\'s of species of flowers, plants and ferns. During the autumn and winter months migratory birds arrive in vast numbers and flocks of wild duck, snipe, woodcock, curlew, lapwing and swans can be seen on the islands. I watched an otter diving repeatedly for eels, and eating them floating on its back, the eel held in its forepaws. The Gearagh can also be a very dangerous place - it is very easy to get lost, there are deep areas, muddy banks and floods do occur regularly. The photos with the cows show us completely lost and having to haul the boats across several semi-flooded fields to find a road. In latter years the Gearagh has achieved a certain amount of fame as a source of poitin (\\'potcheen\\') - a highly potent raw-tasting alcohol brewed from malt syrup or molasses in illicit stills. The last time I ran a RiverTrek weekend, the weather turned - after a couple of capsizes I called a halt a few miles short of the end. We pulled the boats up high, and struck off across fields in the dusk. The house we stumbled on turned out be that of the elderly brother and sister who I used to buy my poteen from. They welcomed all eight of us, warmed us with a \\'hot drop\\' - and drove us to our cars.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the Gearagh was flooded to form a reservoir for hydro-electricity - the stumps have all the gloomy horror of a 1st.

A bunch of Marks &amp; Spencers employees signed up as guinea-pigs, for an autumn camping adventure weekend.The moon in the photo is real : none of us could explain its size.Loch Allua is small, and its pleasures are small-scale too. There\\'s an archeological curiosity - a little island encampment dating to mediaeval times or before, that was reached via a submerged causeway, known only to its defenders. As you pass along the road from Inchigeelagh towards Ballingeary, after about three miles on your left hand side, it\\'s easy to miss a tiny island situated about 50m. offshore. This crannóg is known locally as Oilean Ui Mhaothagain (Mehigan\\'s Island) named either from a local chieftain or from meathain, Irish for twigs and saplings. A crannóg is a type of ancient loch-dwelling, built on an artificial island, found throughout Ireland and Scotland and dating mainly from the Early Christian Period, but may be up to 5,000 years old. Many crannógs were built out in the water as defensive homesteads and represented symbols of power and wealth, and some may have been used well into the times of recorded history. It is not unusual to find evidence of jewellery being manufactured on these islands. In its original state it probably carried a wooden building supported clear of the water on stakes. A raised walkway may have joined it to the shore. I have added a couple of examples of crannógs in Scotland, restored after considerable archaeological investigation, based on the excavation evidence from the 2,600 year old site of \\'Oakbank Crannóg\\', one of the 18 crannógs in Loch Tay. One summer, of unusually low water levels, I explored the site. It was a tangle of low trees growing among stoney ground. Visible part way around were the stumps of staves, preserved in the acidic peaty water.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hjs5et7xk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-9.15178,51.83986]}},{"properties":{"name":"The bar on Sherkin Island","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\" href=\"http://www.maryhorganpaintings.com\">Bacchus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/the_bar_on_Sherkin_Island.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/near_Rabbit_island.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Paintings like these have their own truth - an accuracy that cameras can\\'t always capture. Elements are simplified, or removed, for the sake of the composition. To the painter, it\\'s only the painting that matters. The bar may never have looked like this: it certainly doesn\\'t now.
