season-to-date wins L – Total season-to-date losses E# – Elimination Number, the combined number of wins (by the first place team) and losses (by the trailing team) that will eliminate the trailing team from winning the division. The Elimination Number for any team is determined by adding their number of losses to the number of wins for the team leading the division, and subtracting that total from 163. The Elimination Number for the second place team is the \"Magic Number\" for the first place team. \"E\" indicates that the team has been eliminated from winning the division. v.
