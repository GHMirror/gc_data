You can reach it by boat, or you can take the walking path which descends from the village down to the beach. (It takes about half an hour to get down, and more than an hour to get up again, it\\'s quite steep!) Apart from the fact that the place is becoming popular for tourist boats and ships, this beach is near-perfect.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6o9ftsz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.321612,44.885979]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meli","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/meli1.jpg\">Beatiful hidden beach on Cres island, probably my favourite. If you want to get there, turn east from the main road 7km north of Osor, near the bus stop, where the sign on the opposite side of the road points west for the village Ustrine. From there, a bad macadam road goes through villages Srem and Plat. Important: There are many gates on that road that keep the sheep confined; after you open them and pass through, make sure to close them again in order to prevent the sheep running away and getting lost. After you reach the village Plat, you have to continue on foot for about half an hour. The path will lead you to a tiny harbour. Follow the path for the additional 30m and the hidden Meli lagoon will appear. The beach is truly beautiful, so keep it preserved and clean!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6ob4xji"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.473543,44.740142]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meli nr Punta Kriza","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/Meli_PuntaKriza.jpg\">In the Punta Kriza village take the road to the left just before the small church. When you reach the sea, proceed right on the macadam road. After 3km or so you\\'ll find plenty space to park on a straight section of the road. From there take one of the forest paths on the right that lead to the nearby sandy coves. The coves form a beautiful sandy shallow lagoon, perfect for children, nudists and having fun in the sea.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6pooouy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.528561,44.628474]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paradise beach","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/Croatia238SanMarino.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/rab__san_marino.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Due to the shallow sea level, this huge beach is perfect for inferior swimmers, children and elderly people. Near the beach there is San Marino hotels village and the biggest camping on the island, as well as many private apartments to rent. Sandy shallow waters are long and it takes about 500m until the sea comes half the waist of an adult. This beach gets quite crowded in summer. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6bvrrdk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.738932,44.822334]}},{"properties":{"name":"Porat","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/3/porat3v.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/3/porat3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/3/IMG_9010.jpg\">This beautiful sandy beach on the small island of Bisevo near Vis should not be missed. Clear water and the fact that it\\'s not too popular make it one of the best. You can get food and drinks there too. To get there take a boat trip from the island of Vis which will also take you to the famous Blue cave on the other side of Bisevo.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6c2r019"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.00468,42.98255]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rucica","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/P8020272.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/P8020277.JPG\">A hidden beach near the village Metajna on the island of Pag, Croatia.

A large sandy beach with pebbly coast, with shade available and even a nice beach bar. This place is (as expected) quite popular with the yachting people, but fortunately boats are not allowed to get too close, which makes this place great for any activity: swimming, playing games, fooling around... It can get busy around here, but since the beach is huge (for Adriatic standards), it never feels crowded. There\\'s even a smaller and less popular beach a short walk to the south. A great place.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6newd62"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.871969223,44.1339432221]}},{"properties":{"name":"Srebrna","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/3/Srebrena.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/3/img00001.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/3/Srebrna.jpg\">Beautiful midsize pebbly beach amidst nice rocky coastline, naturally clean and with plenty of shade. One of my favorites. Almost at the end of the road to the village Rukavac turn right (you\\'ll see a sign) and after a short ride you will reach a macadam parking place.

The beach in textile part is 700m long and covered with pebbles, with a sandy sea bottom. The beach on the naturist side is rocky and arranged with platforms, surrounded by oak forest.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6boi2sb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.880981,44.541242]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sv.

It\\'s easy to find, close to Lumbarda, which is close to Korcula town. The beach gets very crowded in summer so if you like sandy beaches hurry up to take good spot as early as possible. There is an open-air cafe/restaurant right on the beach for simple food and refreshments.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ibz6f6prwr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[17.186651,42.917589]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zrce","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/g_zrce.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/zrce.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/13_bazen.jpg\">Zrce is a long, stretched, white pebbled beach with crystal clear sea, situated near Novalja, on the Pag island, Croatia.
