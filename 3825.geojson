Northern hatcheries (north of I-80) primarily culture warm/coolwater fish, while southern hatcheries (south of I-80) primarily culture trout.  This GIS layer contains the locations of these hatcheries.\n\nPurpose:\n\nTo be utilized with various maps to depict PFBCoperated hatchery locations and for the public to know where they can obtain hatchery information from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission across Pennsylvania.\n\nSupplemental_Information:\n\nThe data set was created by geocoding the hatchery addresses and then verifying the locations with aerial photography.  The photography used was PA Map imagery where available and National Agricultural Imagery Program 2004 Color Infrared imagery in other areas.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"ID":{"max":14.0,"mean":7.5,"variance":17.5,"stdev":4.18330013267038,"min":1.0,"median":8.0}},"features":[{"properties":{"NAME":"Oswayo","STEEL_SALM":"","ID":5.0,"TROUT":"y","WARM_COOL":"","VISITOR_CE":"y","id":"a62dgvn07wo5","REGION":"Northcentral","FULL_NAME":"Oswayo
