Flat tire in some highland desert like corner of Wyoming.  Couldn\\'t budge the lugnuts, literally bent 2 tire irons and the wheel was spinning under pressure, despite NOT BEING ON A JACK!  We piled all out luggage in the front of the bus and had one another sit in the driver\\'s seat in an attempt to offset this weight issue, no luck.  We decided to hitch it back many miles to some town.  The minivan family that stopped would only let one of us in (cautious).  When he got back with a can of WD-40 he told me of his adventures trying to catch road wandering cattle, to ride one, because there were NO CARS COMING.  After many hours of waiting, a park/forest ranger type guy came along, and called us a tow truck from over 100 miles away.  What a day.  Oh yeah, the tire shop said that the wheel had been mounted so tight with an air compressor that no human would really have ever been able to get that thing off. great.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65khwypdapg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.164001,41.403198]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cannes Film Festival","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/40794c6adc93686e0d3be32a7baffaa8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> cannes, franceWent with an employee of a french film distribution firm, got less than legit passes, whisked into parties, lounged in the warm sea.

Some of us, the good vert skaters, had injured themselves during practice.  The rest of us tried our best not to bail while doing rock&amp;rolls, fakie popouts, little mini ollie nosegrinds, and ollies not quite out of the top.

Finding myself at a far off edge of the ruins in Tulum, I balanced up a few big stones, then realized they looked very \\'in place\\' here, that they almost looked like they had been there for a long time.  \n\nSo, I backed off to a hidden spot and watched several groups of tourists come and stare at the pile, stand in front of it, take photos in front of it etc.  \n\nThen one poor old guy thought he\\'d see how stable this thing was, how it had survived over time, his finger slowly reached out and the moment he made even light contact, the precarious balance was upset and the whole pile toppled into a dust cloud faster than anyone could blink.  The man and his group looked nervously all around for the approaching federales, but only saw me, squatting 100 yards away covering my laugh with a dusty hand.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65khwkxcbtp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.42834,20.21615]}},{"properties":{"name":"Slept on large gravel beach, after stumbling upon a mystery rave.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://www.cowfish.org.uk/paw/girl.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> East end of the Beach, Brighton, UKTook a bus to Brighton with Betsy on a whim, walked around, rocked the little skatepark, scoped the historical photos of the Mods vs. the Rockers, then we strolled off down the beach to find a place to crash for the night.
