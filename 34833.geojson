Each association has a Chief Gardener and he/she is responsible for assigning plots as they become available and for collecting all related fees. The Arlington County Board has set a base rate for community garden rentals at $60 (with water) and $50 (without water) for full plots, $30 and $25, respectively, for half plots. The monies collected from the rental fees offset county costs for fence and water system repairs as well as maintenance.\n\nA surcharge is added by each community gardening association as part of their dues to cover additional expenses (water, mulch, locks, etc.). Each association handles these differently, and some may assess a &quot;new gardener&quot; fee in the form of a security deposit. Costs may range accordingly.\n\nBecause of exceedingly high demand for garden plots, particularly in the Metro-accessible area of Arlington, waiting lists for many of the gardens are very long. For this reason, half plots are assigned to new gardeners; you may ask for a whole plot after gardening in good stead, but assignments are at the discretion of the Chief Gardener and/or the governing committee of each garden association. Names are retained from one year to the next on all waiting lists, so you do not need to reapply each year.\n\nAt present, there are eight garden sites, of which seven have access to water. The total number of garden plots is just over 200. \n\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"lon":{"max":-77.066191,"mean":-77.08886875,"variance":0.000236430519928623,"stdev":0.015376297341318,"min":-77.111509,"median":-77.087522},"lat":{"max":38.896487,"mean":38.863107875,"variance":0.000340292775839292,"stdev":0.0184470262058493,"min":38.845474,"median":38.858178}},"features":[{"properties":{"lon":-77.106136,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ekcql3pg","lat":38.851777,"state":"VA","location":"S Four Mile Run Drive along the Bike Trail"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.106136,38.851777]}},{"properties":{"lon":-77.111509,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ek7k3hiq","lat":38.858178,"state":"VA","location":"S 9th Street and S Buchanan along the Bike Trail"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.111509,38.858178]}},{"properties":{"lon":-77.093117,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ekdiqu0r","lat":38.849773,"state":"VA","location":"Fort Barnard (S Walter Reed Drive &amp; Pollard Street)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.093117,38.849773]}},{"properties":{"lon":-77.066191,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ek6blpo7","lat":38.845474,"state":"VA","location":"S Glebe and S Lang Streets"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.066191,38.845474]}},{"properties":{"lon":-77.087522,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ekfbhk55","lat":38.884878,"state":"VA","location":"N Barton and N 10th Streets"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.087522,38.884878]}},{"properties":{"lon":-77.076242,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ek7m4yi8","lat":38.86693,"state":"VA","location":"S 9th Street and Rolfe Streets"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.076242,38.86693]}},{"properties":{"lon":-77.092944,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ekal6fof","lat":38.851366,"state":"VA","location":"N Harrison Street (near Chestnut Hill Park)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.092944,38.851366]}},{"properties":{"lon":-77.077289,"city":"Arlington","type":"Community Garden Center","id":"a645ek6ev2si","lat":38.896487,"state":"VA","location":"1601 Key Blvd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.077289,38.896487]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/ParksRecreation/scripts/facilities/ParksRecreationScriptsFacilitiesCommunityGardens.aspx","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Arlington County, VA: Parks, Recreation & Cultural Resources ","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/ParksRecreation/scripts/facilities/ParksRecreationScriptsFacilitiesCommunityGardens.aspx","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":8,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"arlington,arlingtonrec,community,gardens,parks,plots,recreation,virginia","published":"2009-05-11T16:00:00Z","id":34833}
