The safest places for walking are those with a lower PDI. These metros tend to be older northeastern or northern states, or places with a generally compact development pattern. Metros such as Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; and Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN are investing to build a well-developed network of sidewalks and crosswalks and have many people walking and bicycling.\n\nThe list of the most dangerous metro areas for walking is striking in its uniformity. Nine of the ten metro areas are in the South, and the top four are in Florida. These areas are dominated by lower density and automobile-oriented development patterns, which include high-speed urban arterials that are particularly hazardous for walking. A national FHWA survey affirms these results, finding that respondents in the South rate pedestrian safety far lower than their counterparts in the rest of the country.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"average annual pedestrian deaths per 100,000 residents
