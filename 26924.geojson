The first floor has a wide open space with two animal stalls in the back. The second story is reached by a narrow staircase and has a wide door in the front, apparently to get hay upstairs. There\\'s also an open place for tossing hay down to the first floor. The shape of the barn looks like a typical \"English Barn\", except the double door s are in the narrow end rather than the long side. \n\nTown records show that a \"spinster\" lived here in the mid-1800\\'s and had a market garden. The house and barn were also owned by someone who built the cabinets for Seth Thomas clocks.

It was built-out perpendicular to the north-south ridge of the existing barn.\n\nThe first floor was designed to be clear span with two king post trusses that span 30 ft (creating 3 bays) running east-west, front wall to back wall. The second floor is framed into the bottom chord, and the kingpost supports a beam (running north-south) that the roof is framed into.\n\nThe north and west exterior walls are parapet walls around a shed type roof with a slope of 1-2 on 12.\n\nA coachman reportedly lived in the barn during the early 1900\\'s when the house was owned by a Doctor.  This is evidenced by markings that there was a   \\' x   \\' room in the south east corner.  The exterior walls in this area are filled with sawdust, there is an inactive chimney in this corner of the barn, and markings where there was an electric light in the center of this room and a wall switch.\n\n\nFoundation/Cellar:\n\nThe barn has full cellar - possibly a manure pit?\n\n\nFirst Floor:\n\nElectrical wiring was installed within the framing spaces before interior finishes were applied indicating that there was electricity available when it was constructed, about 1900.\n\nThe interior walls and ceiling on the first floor were finished with 6\" beaded board, painted a dull green.

We do not have information as to who was the original owner nor when the barn was built. The original house was demolished in 1958 to enable construction of the Poultney Post Office. Isaac Leffingwell was a merchant and constructed a store building next to his house in 1840 which stands today in front of the barn.\"\n\n\"The barn dimensions are 34\\' x 24\\'. It is divided in the middle by a wagon bay with two stables to the left (east) and with storage space and an out-house to the right. Above the stables and the storage space are hay mows. The construction is post and beam with timber about 10 to 12 inches square. The roof rafters are split tree trunks about 6 to 8 inches wide and sawn rafters about 4 inches wide have been added i later years we presume to support the slate roof. Some roof shingles can be seen from inside beneath the slate, and therefore we believe the slate roof is not original to the barn since slate quarrying was not begun in the area until around 1840. The floor of the barn is made of wood planks about 12 to 15 inches wide and about four inches thick, As shown in the photos, there are large double doors for access to the wagon bay area, a four foot wide door, and a 26\" door to the out-house. At the rear in the middle is a door ad windows are located to either side.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66dtfae6bi5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.235191,43.516849]}},{"properties":{"name":"Morse's East Barn","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~barn\" href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~barn\">Vtbarncensus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/04/1/276_Morse_1_East.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_maroon_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66dtfgelw7q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.7219712734,43.7592081367]}},{"properties":{"name":"Morse's Middle Barn","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~barn\" href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~barn\">Vtbarncensus</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/04/1/277_Morse_6_Middle.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_maroon_verD.gif\"> With the chimney it appears that the building was used as living quarters at some time.
