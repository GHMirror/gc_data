Everyone had the opportunity to put forward their views and we had a good representation from the fishermen and I think everyone\\'s found it a very beneficial process.\"\r\n\r\nHe said the inquiry found a Regulatory Order was needed to develop a viable and sustainable fishery and to avoid the boom and bust situation that exists at the moment, which has seen cockle stocks fall. \r\n\r\nMr Winstone said the inquiry looked at the number of licences that should be granted and there was general agreement that 50 was the right number. A proposed licence fee of £992 was reasonable because it enabled the Agency to recover the costs of managing the fishery.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=2943265\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gmup9p8pjj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.12149,53.25536]}},{"properties":{"name":"11/06/07 - Man's rape conviction quashed after six years in jail","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\">Leaderonline</a>A MAN who has spent more than six years in prison after being convicted of raping and assaulting a teenage girl will have his convictions overturned by three top judges this week.\r\n\r\nKenneth Samuels, 50, of Maes Glyndwr, Treuddyn, was sentenced to 10 years in jail at Mold Crown Court in January 2001 after a jury found him guilty of the rape and indecent assault of the girl.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Samuels always protested his innocence and on Friday – after the case had been referred to the Criminal Appeal Court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body set up to investigate possible miscarriages of justice – three judges said the convictions were \"unsafe\".\r\n\r\nRepresenting Mr Samuels, Peter Wilcock told the court new evidence had come to light since the convictions, which, if it had been available at the time of the trial, could have influenced the way in which the jury viewed the case.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=2943819<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gmupckz82h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.13711,53.17708]}},{"properties":{"name":"11/06/07 - Neighbour rescues woman in flat blaze","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\">Leaderonline</a>A MAN helped rescue one of his neighbours who was choking on thick smoke after a fire broke out in her flat.\r\n\r\nResidents at a block of flats at Fairy Road, Wrexham, escaped on Friday night after hearing a smoke alarm, and have praised the swift response of fire crews. \r\n\r\nDavid Davies, 33, helped a 44-year-old woman out of the building after seeing her struggling in the smoke in one of the flats upstairs.\r\n\r\nHis girlfriend Jane Prince, 36, helped get the children including her daughter, Cathy, four, and other residents out of the building.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=2943405<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gmupaiw49v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.99837,53.03964]}},{"properties":{"name":"11/06/07 - Probe after arsonists strike at city flat","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\">Leaderonline</a>POLICE are on the hunt for arsonists who attacked a flat in Chester.\r\n\r\nThe fire, which caused extensive damage to 43 Medlar Close, Lache, was put out by firefighters at 3.30 on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nFlat owner Kathy May, who at the time was away in Cumbria with her six-year-old son, was being comforted by family yesterday.\r\n\r\nHer sister, Stephanie Whyborn, told the Leader: \"I feel so sorry for her.\r\n\"Everything has gone, her clothes, her son\\'s clothes, her bed was burnt – everything.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire, on the second floor, caused extensive smoke damage to four other flats within the building.\r\n\r\nTwo pumps from Chester Fire Station attended the incident.\r\n\r\nTwo women from the flat upstairs, which became smokelogged, had to be rescued by firefighters and were lifted down a ladder.\r\n\r\nThey were taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital but were allowed home after four hours.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chestereveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=2943853<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gmup28c1wr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.91678,53.16965]}},{"properties":{"name":"11/06/07 - Son's anger at dad's wait for ambulance","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\">Leaderonline</a>AN ELDERLY man was forced to wait 40 minutes in agonising pain because there were no ambulances in Wrexham to get to him sooner, his son has claimed.\r\n\r\nFrancis Parry, 73, of Falcon Road in Wrexham, fell in the kitchen breaking his thigh bone.
