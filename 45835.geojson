We decided to take my boyfriend’s 2002 Red Ford Mustang and decided to make it a fun evening. In the atmosphere of a place called Il Café located with the neighborhood of North ridge, IL. The place was accentuated with tables to eat or to have a drink and to hang out; the place has a foosball table with a few arcade games like Black Jack or Pac man. \nRon, who can sometimes be a dramatic nice guy with a lot of ups and downs, Joe a sort of indecisive person with somewhat could be classified  as an ultimate geek, Candace easy to talk to and fun to be around and quite a party girl. The light is excessively dim with a big light to hang over the billiard table. There is a spot to insert three quarters to play a game of billiards. My boyfriend reaches into his pocket and grabs three quarters and the billiard balls rolled out and he got the triangle to set up all the balls to get broken apart. My boyfriend decided to break the balls. He went down to the other side of the billiard table and lined up his stick to make a good break. The balls scatter everywhere due to the cue ball. I grab my pool stick and line up to take my shot. With the ball rolling on the upper right pocket, it ricochets off the other ball and ended up missing the shot. Some games I was solids and some games I was stripes. We ended up play three games. As it turns out, I did not win many games and just was there for the fun of it. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99j9m1378"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.46507,41.8446]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cd's House","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILFew Friends\n\nThat evening my boyfriend’s friends Joe, Ron, and Hubert along with another friend Sandra came to hang out and have a good time. We were all sitting up in his room gathered around his computer. Sandra wanted to burn a few CD’s. Sandra is one of those people who feel like deadlines are essential and she can have her weird moments. She just felt like she had to have these few CD’s as soon as possible. I forget what the CD’s were, but they were obviously very important for her to have. We used a CD program like Real Player to burn these CD’s. As soon as the CD’s were done burning, we all decided that we were going to go downstairs and outside to enjoy the nice weather outside. My boyfriend sat down and entered the CD with the songs on it in one drive and the blank CD in the other drive, and hit a red button on the computer and let the computer do the rest and had all the songs transfer and burn to the other CD. It only took like three minutes when the CD was done. When the CD was done, you could see the smile on Sandra’s face, you could just tell that she was grateful to have the CD now in her possession and to be her own copy. \nWe were holding glasses of Polish Vodka called Zubrowka mixed with apple juice and it was scrumptiously good. The weather outside was pretty nice. We proceeded outside the back door and walked around talking about random events like work and school. Some of the music and movies were given to me to give me some entertainment to do in my spare of time in case I am bored with no school work to do. I did not drink excessively even though the alcoholic drinks were very good. Ron was walking and stumblingly outside, which I do not if the drinks made him a little tipsy or he was just a little dizzy and didn’t feel so well. There was no special occasion being celebrated, but I do remember that since my boyfriend has a Polish background that his heritage and alcohol are intermixed. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99j53p64t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Alegre Burrito","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl13247193 W Grand Ave, Chicago, ILFrom having all this fun with our friends the day before, we woke up at 11 am the next morning and decided that we would satisfy our hungry taste. My boyfriend and I tried to decide what we were in the mood for, and we decided to go to a well-known Mexican restaurant. The restaurant we decided to go to is right around the corner from his house. The weather was kind of cool that day, so we were both bundled up with our rain jackets and umbrella just incased it was going to rain. Around the corner, I could see straight ahead of me the sight that said “Pablo’s Mexican Restaurant” with outlines of red and orange rectangles around the sign. Getting up to the door, and going through it, we had to go through a little dining area before getting up to the counter to tell the person at the counter what we would like to eat. \nI am staring up at the light green menu trying to decide what I would like to munch on. I originally wanted to order a chicken enchilada. There was an oval glass up at the counter that you can see what their chicken enchilada looked like. The chicken enchiladas that were wrapped in a corn tortilla filled up with scrumptious green peppers, tomatoes, onions, oregano, and shredded chicken with shredded cheddar cheese along with other water tasting ingredients. Looking through the window just made me want to stick my tongue out and wanted to crave it so badly. The inside of the restaurant looked like a diner and TV’s that were playing Spanish soap operas and Mexican decorations hanging all around. Hanging from the menu was a big Mexican flag. Behind the counter, there are a lot of ads in Spanish, adds more meaning to the atmosphere. Due to much convincing, my boyfriend told me to order a double cheeseburger. Double Cheeseburgers are supposedly a famous trademark of the place and one of my boyfriend’s friends works there and makes very good ones. The cheeseburgers are on a sesame bun with the beef, melted cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, ketchup and a little bit of spicy mustard. When we were sitting in the café, I put the burger up to my mouth and it tasted so incredibly good. I knew since I loved him so much that I would trust his opinion. As soon as I walk in there, there was no aroma that grabbed my attention, but just trying to get some that would spark my appetite. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99j38f0uf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.8059,41.923799]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Gordo","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILPicture Perfect Burrito\nFor lunch the next day before I went back to school, we decided to visit another Mexican restaurant that had a different setup. Part of my descent is Mexican, so I gain a lot of respect for the culture and the type of food that Mexican places serve. Even sometimes for special holidays, my family would cook up burritos, tacos or enchiladas for meals and they would be absolutely delicious. My boyfriend does respect my culture and what it has to offer. \nThe restaurant was called El Gordo. The decorations are Mexican-authentic looking and the walls are nicely accessorized with beautiful and gorgeous artwork with beautiful colors on the walls like light oranges and reds. One of my favorite pieces of artwork that stood out to me was this photograph filled with all these chili peppers of all different colors. You would not believe there is so many spices they use within Mexican recipes. Some of those spices can possibly be some of the hottest spices in the world. Looking at this restaurant compared to the other, I definitely felt like I was more in a Mexican setting mainly because even the workers were speaking Spanish and they were definitely from that part of the world. \nThere were a few waitresses wandering around that spoke very little English. They were dressed up kind of like Jennifer Lopez in the Maid in Manhattan movie, which was a gray dress with a white apron with their head nicely put up in a bun. \nIt did not bother me that she was speaking Spanish because their dialect was speaking really slowly. I actually understand a little Spanish from my high school classes. The waitress came up and took our order and I tried to use my little Spanish that I did know to let the waitress know what we wanted. There was Mexican music that was playing very softly in the background. My boyfriend was not that hungry, but I decided to order a burrito. When it was place in front of me, it was one of the biggest burritos I have ever seen. The burrito was intermixed with lettuce, tomatoes, chicken, vegetables, and beans whipped up in a big shell. Our waitress gave us a wicker basket that was filled with Tostitos chips with a side of hot and spicy salsa. Everything that I tasted in the palette of my mouth was amazing and fresh, I could feel the scrumptious food in the stomach being filled. \nWhen it was time to say goodbye, there were tears about leaving my boyfriend and knowing that I would soon be back in about two or three weeks, I tried my very best to stay strong and put on a smile even though I was hurting inside to leave. \nThis is Jenny again. I hope you enjoyed my adventures of traveling to the Chicago-based area. Hopefully there are at least some highlights of my trip that stuck out to you and amazed you. There were some unique highlights and hope that you enjoyed them.

I immediately jump into his arms and give him a kiss. My boyfriend is understanding and warm loving individual who likes to dress in Gothic black clothes, but likes to have fun and play games. He asks me, “What would you like to do?” I say “Since we have not played games in a while lets play a game on Playstation.”  I am bopped down on my bottom next to my boyfriend playing video games. I forget the name of the video game, but the object of the game is to steal the sheep from the pasture. The main character in the video game is a farmer and he is trying to steal sheep off his farmland. When the farmer steals the sheep, the player receives points.  My opponent is my boyfriend and we also play on the computer. My hands are grabbed tightly to the controller because the farmer has to jump over things to retrieve the sheep. I try my very best, but I know that we play for the pure fun of it. The video game has a split screen so my game is on the top and his game is on the bottom. Sometimes I get distracted and try to look at his game to see how he is doing.  His walls are white with cracks that are chipped and dirty. His room has two desks with two computers (one is his and the other one is his brothers), two beds, his TV with play station, CD rack and tons of clothes scattered all over the floor. Right along his bed, he has a metal Gothic group called Gorgoroth, who is a group that likes to wear accessories and masks. It is a typical guy vs. girl war trying to win a game, but he is very skilled at shooting type of games, but just know that it is all for fun. The whole round lasts a few minutes and as it turns out my boyfriend wins the game, and turns to me and says, “See I told you I win.” I replied, “You are so competitive.” We proceed to give each other a kiss to show there was good sportsmanship. To keep the sport competitive going we decided to go a few towns west in North ridge to play billiards with a couple of friends.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99jhcnvtp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.814985,41.925485]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little Caesar's Pizza","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILCheeser Cheeser\n\nA few hours later, we decided that we need a change of food to satisfy our dinner appetite. We decided that we would call up our friend Hubert, who is a boy who likes to have fun and be himself to come along. \nMy boyfriend, his friend Hubert and I took a taxi to go a couple blocks down in Elmwood Park to get some delightful pizza to munch on. The sign in front of the place was very easy to spot knowing it is Little Caesar’s Pizza. It looked like the little man that had a slice of pizza on a stick waiting to go in his mouth. Seeing that sign we knew that we were in the right place. \nWhen we got there, we sat down a round table and ordered two pizzas with a couple of orders of Crazy Bread. One of the pizzas had just cheese and the other pizza had pepperoni on it. From the table, we couple smell the baked cheese and garlic from the kitchen that made our tongues water with taste. When I was sitting in my chair, I could feel my stomach just rumbling of hunger. When our waitress placed the pizza the pizza on the table, we began to divide up the food. Crazy Bread is a long breadsticks with a garlic buttery aroma taste. When the food was placed, our eyes bogged out and we were sitting on the edge of seat waiting to dive in. I immediately took the pizza knife and divided, we could see the melted cheese that was stretched from each pizza as it was lifted up from the pan to our plates. It just made us want to dig in that much faster. Putting the piece of pizza in my mouth my eyes just closed and I felt like I went to heaven I just was so happy to taste the wonderful cheese with marinara sauce. I was able to eat about three pieces of the cheese pizza and my boyfriend was able to eat 4 pieces. \nWhat was the most amazing thing about the experience was seeing Hubert, was able to stuff down a whole pizza and an entire order of Crazy Bread by himself. It almost seemed like he could be entered into an eating competition with the way he was stuffing the pizza in his mouth. I could see the drips of cheese hanging out of his mouth. He was trying to not gross us out, but trying to enjoy eating. Our mouths dropped in amazement and it looked like he hadn’t eaten anything in three days. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99jhhhrj2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Movie Night","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Elmwood Park, ILSlaughter Massacre\n\nWhen our friends left and had their own things to do, my boyfriend and I decided to go to the living room in the downstairs and watch a movie. There is a case of movies next to the TV with a bunch of movies and we decided to pick from those which movie we were going to watch. There was a bunch of options so we needed to narrow our choices down. We were deciding between Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Click, Just Married or American Pie. We were also trying to figure out what movie we have not seen in awhile. It was a hard decision to choose. \nMy boyfriend and I decided to choose Texas Chain Saw Massacre the Beginning, which is a pretty gruesome movie filled with blood and guts. We were curled close on the couch with a couple of pillows and a blanket. I knew that we needed to stay close because we never knew when the movie was going to get scary. No movie watching was going to go along without having some Farm Hard Lemonade (maybe kind of similar to Mike’s Hard Lemonade). I think we wanted to go beyond the snacks that go with usual movie watching which is of course pop and popcorn. Knowing that Farm Hard Lemonade, we knew right there it was not high in alcohol count so we knew it was perfect for watching a movie. It would end up that we would not get too distracted from watching this movie. Both of our eyes were gazing into the TV trying to make out with what the movie was showing, and there was no conversation during the movie. We wanted to make sure that we were both paying enough attention because if we did not we would miss a big part of the movie. \nWith the lights turned out to minimize the dim effect, I do remember the most gruesome part of the movie. I especially remember a part when a man tried to avenge the murder of his girlfriend and he got knocked out and fill on the top of the chainsaw and chainsaw started and sliced throughout his body. Through being scared, I had to hide my eyes on my boyfriend’s shoulders. He had his arm around him so I could hide my face and not to look at the TV during the gross parts. He asked me, “If I was okay?” “I am okay just kind of scared” I said. Also from finishing the lemonade, I drank some Smirnoff’s Ice while my bones were shaking in the chair praying not to get scared. I just needed something to calm my nerves. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99j7cjpr7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Party Hardy","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Party Hardy\n\nTo close my spring break adventures, there was a party at my boyfriend’s house. Ron, Joe and Candace came to the party. When I was sitting on the couch in the living room listening to the bass beats to a certain type of music like Disturbed and Rammstein. This party was partially about our one year anniversary that I had with my boyfriend. Some of his favorite music is from this band called Crematory. The reason why he likes this certain type of music is because it is something different than the traditional hip hop beat like most groups have. They offer a new twist to the music industry and he likes the beats and music that this group offers. \nI know this is something very dangerous to do, but there is a unique way on how my boyfriend and I met. We met over the Internet in a chat room. I knew that I did not want to date anybody that lived on the west coast due to distance, so I was thinking since he and I had so much in common that we decided to hook up and become a couple. \nI knew it probably would be good ideas to buy him a rare remix of his favorite type of music. Some of my other gifts that I included were limited box edition, a poster, a patch (which can be put on clothing or bag), and autographed poster. My boyfriend is truly a unique individual who likes things that are out of the ordinary. While opening his presents, we had tall bottles of Smirnoff’s Ice to drink. At the party, once he opened the CD, he immediately wanted to play and hear the intense sound banging on his ears. There is something in the Polish background that is called the “Polish factor.” Most parties tend to include alcohol and polish people think it intermixes with parties well. With a party closing my spring break adventures, I cannot think of anything better to have one last big blowout with my boyfriend and his friends. The next morning, we were going to have lunch and then I needed to load up on the charter bus to go back to Wittenberg University through Indianapolis, Indiana to get back to my normal school routine.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99j49ed79"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.806,41.91812]}},{"properties":{"name":"Puzzles","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Indianapolis, INHello. It is me Jenny and I am going to be taking you on an adventure of what my spring break was like. This whole adventure was when I went to visit my boyfriend in Chicago, and was traveling through Indianapolis, Indiana to go see him. My emotions are excited and cannot wait to jump into his arms. I hope you enjoy and can picture you doing what I am.\nI am crammed in between people trying to concentrate on my fairly easy sudoku puzzles. Picture doing a puzzle with nine big squares with nice little squares in them, with numbers scattered randomly about while you are trying to think of which number between one through nine to put in that little square. I am on a charter bus that is about to leave Indianapolis so I can go visit my boyfriend who lives in Chicago. I am really anxious to see him, but I need something to keep myself entertained. I am bouncing up and down in my seat, but I need something to calm my anxiousness to see him. I grabbed in my red book bag and reach into the little zipper and pull out my sudoku book and my pencil and ready to do some problem solving. Even if I am not doing the puzzles, I either sleep or find someone on the bus that I can talk to, or else I work on homework. I brought along a pillow from my bed in my dorm at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio that I can lie on and take a snooze. I have a book with close to 500 puzzles in it. I do not have a specific strategy besides logic and process of elimination to solve them. Sometimes I might do these in Chicago if my boyfriend gets busy with something else or has to attend a class. Working diligently, I flip to page 170. My pencil hits the page marking down the appropriate number. I gaze between the lines and try to figure out what options I can rule out. When I know I am doing well it gives a sense of confidence. Traveling along the long five hour bus ride with the shiny yellow light that is gazing above my head so I can see the page, I usually go through about five puzzles or so to pass the time. In the back of mind though I am trying to calm my nerves about seeing my boyfriend that I have not seen in a little bit over six weeks, I keep my mind working. I like the sudoku puzzles because they pass time and fun to do, and keep my mind challenged and sharp. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j99jayvd8o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.248748,39.900437]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/21664","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kdsjcgrl1324","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kdsjcgrl1324","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/21664","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=21664,platial:user=kdsjcgrl1324","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":45835}
