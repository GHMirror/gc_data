Upon arrival by the fire fighters, the resident was found restrained by the vest, also his ankles were tied to the recliner. The resident was moved to the hospital with smoke inhalation, and died a few days later.  During the Penalty Review Committee, officials representing the residence claimed the resident's death was not a consequence of the smoke inhalation.  The PRC voted unanimously against the facility;  2007:  Did not perform vital signs before telling the EMS dispatcher that the resident was 'still breathing.' 14 minutes later EMS arrived and were told by staff that she had no pulse but staff had failed to initiate CPR. EMS responders found the resident not breathing, with no pulse, and started resuscitation, including administering cardiac drugs.
