The shooting took place shortly after 6 p.m. in the 7300 block of Pitt Street, near Lowerline Street, police said.\n\nThe Orleans Parish coroner\\'s office identified the victim as Leyon Gaines, 32, of New Orleans.\n\nArea residents reported hearing at least three shots. Gaines fell onto the pavement near an idling car in the middle of the block. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHe died from a gunshot wound to the head, New Orleans police spokeswoman Shereese Harper said. Police had no motives or suspects, she said, but a red compact car was seen leaving the scene.\n\nGaines pleaded guilty in 1997 to possession of crack cocaine, according to court records. He was arrested early last month for possession of a stolen vehicle and for being a felon with a firearm. He had an April court date pending.\n\nWithin minutes of the shooting, dozens of grieving people flocked to the site.\n\nSeveral people, all wearing memorial R.I.P. shirts, said Gaines and some friends had attended the funeral of a relative earlier in the day. - from the Times-Picayune<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63ba8g0b19v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.075,29.954444]}},{"properties":{"name":"05.13, 930PM","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\" href=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\">Nolafugees</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> New OrleansNew Orleans police arrested one local man and have issued an arrest warrant for his brother in the city\\'s most recent murder.\n\nAn unidentified man was gunned down Tuesday night at about 9:30 p.m. in the 3400 block of South Claiborne Avenue, near Louisiana Avenue, in Central City, according to a NOPD news release.\n\nPolice arrested Andre Hankton, 30, and booked him with second-degree murder shortly after the slaying. A warrant was issued for his brother, Telly Hankton, 31.\n\nDetectives learned the victim, in his vehicle, was being chased by gunmen in another car. At some point, the victim tried to flee from his car and run away. The suspects hit the victim with their vehicle and then shot him, police said.\n\nOne gunman exited the car and ran and the other drove away. The vehicle was located shortly later and officers apprehended Andre Hankton, police said.\n-Times-Picayune<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img

Orleans. When hurrican season came nobody was expected for this mass destructive hurricane. Only one day of this brutal storm was enough to ruin New Orleans. Another historical moment in New Orleans was the Battle of New Orleans. General Jackson who later became president Andrew Jackson, defeated the British in this battle. The battle was from the time of 1814-1815. \r\n\r\nOne historical event outside of New Orleans was the Louisianna Purchase. The United States purchased millions of acres from the French for pennies on the dollar. \r\n\r\nNew Orleans was also a key city to be held during the Civil War. The Union controlled a blockade outside in the Gulf of Mexico that ran along the entire Eastern seaboard and was known as the Anaconda. It kept the Southern states from re-supplied by outside resources such as the English and French.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
