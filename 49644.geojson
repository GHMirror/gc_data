The sushi is delicious, as is the tempura (especially the shrimp), and they have an amazing dish called the Crunchy Roll which is so scrumptious I don\\'t mind that it always falls apart on me.  The tea there is also amazing!  And free!  I love to go in on a cold day, sit down, and be given a cup of tea to warm my hands and face--it smells wonderful!  Sam\\'s also is very reasonable, and the waitresses are very efficient and polite.  Love it!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8okexjj8g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.38464,47.668668]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sip And Ship","description":"Posted by Johndoe<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8okegoy77"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.381062,47.668672]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steve and Beth's House","description":"Posted by Gokubi2432 NW 63rd st, Seattle, WA, 98107<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m8okcf1ygr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.388072,47.674559]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/9019","metadata":null,"contact_name":"gokubi","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:gokubi","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/9019","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=9019,platial:user=gokubi","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":49644}
