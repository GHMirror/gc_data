I spent 15 years in the tiny room at the end of the hall and moved into my sister\\'s much larger room once she went off to university. When I was four I burned down my room. I built a tree-fort in the American Elm on the north side of the house and I once buried a time-capsule in the back yard but forgot to dig it up when we poured the concrete for our three-stall garage. Bummer.\n\nI never really appreciated this house when I was growing up in it. It was built in or around 1905 the evidence for which is in reeeeally old photos at Swedlund Photography and that the boiler in the basement had \"1905\" stamped on it. Now, I\\'d really love to be able to live in a great big old house again.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3olq4przf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-100.926793814,48.0599690842]}},{"properties":{"name":"#10 - Quatama Crossing","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> I lived here for almost a year. It was nice to take the MAX to downtown where I worked. The 45 minutes on the train were a nice way to learn French. Though, once the real estate market shifted to a \"buyers market\" in 2003, all of the nice, caring, new family people from this place bolted to buy their first homes. Shortly after that the apartment complex new that it needed to keep their rooms full so they made a lot of their buildings government assisted. Not that there\\'s really anything wrong with that, people need places to stay. But, when that happened the crime went up, vandalism and graphiti went up, dogs were shitting in the hall ways, unemployed men would hanging out in the parking lot all day without wearing any shirts. It was just kind of a bummer. \n\nIt was fun throwing snap-its from the 3rd floor balcony to the sidewalk below and it was cool to have a swimmin\\' pool. Ultimately, I just wanted to move downtown.

It was downtown. I could walk everywhere. It was an old building with milk-delivery windows. The kitchen was fun to cook in and the hardwood floors were a dream. Also, this place was uphill from downtown where I worked so I could do that skateboard trick again where I get ready for work, go outside, put my board on the sidewalk and basically stand still all the way to work. Skateboarding uphill sucks though. S.W.A.S.S.\n\nFrom the front view of this building you can see the marquee outside of PGE park.

I moved from an apartment on the second floor back to a new one on the second floor corner. I just loaded my shit up on a skateboard, did a little heave-ho action and boom! New apartment.\n\nIt was basically the same as the one just before it but it was laid out better and it had a much better view from of the street. It was super weird and fun/interesting to be so close to the neighbors to the building just to the east of me though. You never know if someone can see you running from the shower to the kitchen in the buff (sometimes I\\'d forget I put toast in the toaster).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3olmjqr70"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.692048252,45.5283960805]}},{"properties":{"name":"#14 - The Retro Church","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> I lived here with Paul Alcott of Binary Dolls and Datr for a few months. He was really cool to live with, literally and figuratively -- the place was freezing and Paul is an interesting guy. Paul let me borrow a bicycle of his so I could get to/from work (the days of skateboarding to work were long gone) but the bicycle provided quite a wonderful lot of freedom.\n\nThe guys from Binary Dolls were over nearly every day. We invented a tiddily-winks-esque game called Black from the Dead which involved bouncing poker chips into a cup in the center of a dining table. Genius.\n\nOne thing that was really cool was that I was living here while Binary Dolls were recording \"Too Much Thinking Sinks Ships\" which, incidentally, and independent of this experience, has become one of my favorite music albums. I sincerely urge you to check it out.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3olgi4qko"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.644055486,45.5586085109]}},{"properties":{"name":"#15 - The AB House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://b1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/00161/12/55/161565521_l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Oh, the AB house. This was the band house of the Altarboys, thus the title AB. I lived here longer than any other place in stumptown. It was truly great. Everyone who lived there at the time of us all moving in were somehow recently single so we were out at the bars every night.\n\nTo avoid getting fat from all of the drinking I rode my bike downtown to work virtually every day and I used to love to run to the waterfront and back or I\\'d jog up to Mt. Tabor. \n\nThis house was a dump but I friggin\\' loved it. It was loud, fun, fast, and dirty: just like the Altarboys music. Here\\'s a clip from one of their old songs. Somewhere around 37 seconds there\\'s a shot of me chucking a beer at Smiley during our New Years 2006 party.\n\nGood times.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3ollphdi1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.62184009,45.5073610296]}},{"properties":{"name":"#16 - 24th and Johnson","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> This place was weird, but it was a nice break from the hazy, crazy days of the AB house. I needed to unwind from a bit of drama that came up while I lived at AB so I found myself back in NW. When I moved in here there was a really awesome French guy who taught at the Portland French school and a kinda lame guy who was a financial analyst at the Standard, Kirby. \n\nUnfortunately the cool French guy moved out after a month and his replacement, Lauren moved in. Eech. We didn\\'t get along very well. Ultimately, Kirby and Lauren wanted the place to themselves so they kicked me out saying that I was disrespectful. \n\nThat sucked. But I got over it. A few months after I moved out I saw that they moved out anyway because house was being remodeled. Either way, I\\'ve never had such awful roommates.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3olj7ahei"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.701147646,45.5280954338]}},{"properties":{"name":"#17 - The Elizabeth","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://www.kbcmgmt.com/properties/northwest/Elizabeth2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.kbcmgmt.com/properties/northwest/Elizabeth003.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Aaaaah, alone again. I lived in this studio for about a year and NEVER should have moved. Though, the way my life shook out after moving was quite wonderful (I fell in love at the place just after this and am now in a newer, nicer, place in both real estate and love are concerned) but this place was sweet. It was small because it was a studio, but it was close to everything and I loved riding my scooter all over town from this location. Elephant\\'s was close by and my friend Nikki would go there on Sundays. It got amazing light in the mornings and the balcony (read: fire escape) was fun to have outside.\n\nEvery morning I\\'d do freelance work before going to the office and this awkward lady would awkwardly jog up 22nd ave. She just looked AWKWARD... but she was a part of the neighborhood. I haven\\'t seen her since.\n\nThe only reason I moved was because the building was being sold to KBC and I knew my rent was going to skyrocket, which was a bummer because it sucks to pay a lot of money for such a small apartment. Also, I wanted to move to France so I figured I\\'d shack up with friends in NE before shipping out.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3oln09bws"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.696245909,45.524679223]}},{"properties":{"name":"#18 - Wygant We Be Friends?","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> This. Place. Was. Fun. I lived here with Jess and Kari and we threw the best parties, had a ton of fun cooking in the kitchen, and just got along really well. It was nice to have relate-able roommates again. The kitchen of this place was clearly it\\'s heart. Lotsa chrome, lotsa granite, lots of boiling pots for pasta. Also, this is where I met Kirsten, in that very kitchen.\n\nWhen I moved into 12th and Wygant We Be Friends I had planned on saving money to move to France but I ended up quitting my day-job to do contract web design full time (the new Platial website looks pretty nice, doesn\\'t it? ;o)  Eventually our lease ran out but I didn\\'t save up enough to go to Paris so I just moved back over to the NW side.\n\nThe lawn here was a bitch. I always like the idea of doing yard work but when it really comes down to it, I just didn\\'t like spending my time on it. We\\'d let the grass get a foot and a half tall before doing anything about it then I\\'d spend all friggin\\' afternoon unloading bags of grass.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3olk66xcl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.653429806,45.5571511428]}},{"properties":{"name":"#19 - 23 Hoyt","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> This place was a dump, but I had really great roommates. The landlord inherited the house from his grandmother and basically lives off of the rent of the house. It\\'s ,500 a month to rent, the tenants pay utilities so the landlord can just ride off of the wages from the place. The only sad part is that the house is in dire need for love. It could be a really cool place but it was just so run down. \n\nThe house next door was virtually identical to ours, except the owner obviously had a bit of money in his back pocket and a subscription to Dwell magazine. Standing on 23 Hoyt and looking at the two houses is like looking at Dufus and Gallant. I should have moved into Gallant.\n\nEw. That\\'s kinda gross.\n\nI\\'ve always wanted to buy this house and make it my own but the landlord won\\'t sell. He could make a pretty shiny penny off of it, but he\\'d rather just cash the rent checks. I don\\'t really blame him, but it is a shame that such a wonderful house is going to shit without the attention it deserves.\n\nMoving on, though, this neighborhood is my favorite of all of Portland. You can have your Albertas and your Hawthornes. Me? I prefer the yuppie shops and fancy plates that fly from this corner of the world. I sure do miss walking to Noah\\'s every morning for my coffee and it was nice to have Escape from NY pizza right across the street.\n\nEither way, though, it was a pit, but fun. We had a crazy-awesome Halloween party and there was a prefect little gap by the side of the house where I could park my scooter.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3olsrt9wh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.699135989,45.5271408699]}},{"properties":{"name":"#2 - My Aunt's House in Nebraska","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\" href=\"http://www.matthewstroh.com/\">Matthewstroh</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> I lived here with my Aunt and Uncle in Seward, Nebraska while I worked for my Uncle\\'s corn detassling company: The Sloup-Thorrell Corn Company. It was nice. I stayed in the basement every summer for four years while working in the fields all around Seward, York, Waco, and the likes. We\\'d get up at 4 or so in the morning, get ready, go to Seward High, board a bus, drive an hour to a field somewhere, wait until legal sun-up, work for 12 hours, get home, rinse off the mud, take a shower, pass out, have dinner, hang out with friends, pass out again and start over. It was great. Also, rollerblading was just getting some steam and it was cool to blade all over Seward. Though my Aunt\\'s house was on a street that was entirely paved with bricks. Not. Cool.

I lived in the dorms with a Montanan named Pete before taking a room at the end of the hall with Scott, a nice Democrat from Drake. It was aaight.

Of course, now that I\\'m lurking on being 10 years out from my freshman year in college, I realize that I WAS a child. \n\nFitting. Also, the RA was kind of a dick. Scott was cool though.
