Personally, I think the fried vermicelli tastes the best.\n\nFood volume is comparable to Sam-Woo takeout, standard 3 compartment (2x small 1x large) take out box, pretty much filled to the top.  Though the take out is \"loaded\", I didn\\'t feel as explosively full as I would after finishing it as I would have with Sam-Woo takeout... a good thing, I suppose.
