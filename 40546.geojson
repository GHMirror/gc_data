I was always good at talking my way out of things. I had already told myself to just starting drinking juice for breakfast, and a light lunch, and then after dinner it would all come up. I had my plan, and I knew that it was going to work. I knew that the nuns would be keeping a close eye on me, so I had to be sure to keep things low key. So I went to Walmart and picked up a sand pale bucket, and placed it under my bed. Every night I would purge into the bucket, and then I would wait till the morning. I would put the bucket in my shower caddy and wrapped the towel over the top. I would go into the shower and water down my vomit before putting it down the drain.”\r\n\r\nKellie was doing well with the trick. No one was suspected anything about Kellie. She had gained about five pounds on purpose to make it look like she was following orders. Every Tuesday and Thursday she would go to see her psychologist and talk like there was no end of the day. The doctor there put her some medications that were supposed to help with her chemical imbalances and stress related problems.\r\n\r\nShe said, “That is always the doctors to everything, put the loony on medicine so the patient won’t feel a thing. Its not that I didn’t enjoy sitting around for four hours a week talking about myself, but everything that I was saying was a complaint lie, and this guy had no idea.”\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchvb4df7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.911143,43.052531]}},{"properties":{"name":"A trip to a Milwaukee Hospital","description":"Posted by Ddobosz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> 9200 West Wisconsin Avenue Milwaukee WiAfter the Holiday season had passed, Kellie returned back to school. Her parents had been keeping a close eye on her all through the holiday season. Even though she didn’t eat much, she didn’t seem to making as many “noticeable” trips to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n Kellies said, “I was learning the tricks of the trade. I would play the waiting game. Once my parents were gone and dinner was over for sure, I would then go to the bathroom when nobody was looking and ride myself of what I had just eaten. I remember after Christmas dinner I could not find a place to do my business. So I told my mother that I was hot from all the cooking that had been going on. I claimed to want to go outside and cool off. This seemed innocent enough to my mother, so I went on my way. I remember I snuck around to the side of my house where there were no windows. I crawled back in by a bush and got down on my knees. I stuck my middle and index finger way down my throat and just started purging up garlic potatoes, sweetened carrots, rolls, and the other dinner foods. This took about a good ten minutes. I picked a leaf up off the ground and wiped my face off before returning back inside of the house. I entered the house full of joy and excitement ready to open the family gifts.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “My mother and father took my back to school thinking and hoping that what they had noticed of Thanksgiving break was just a phase, and I was starting to outgrow it. Now that I look back on it, I know that just like me, neither of them wanted to comfort the issue of my eating disorder. I got out of the car, and head straight to my room of isolation. I was thinking that it was good to be back because now I would not have to worry about being so discreet about my diet.”\r\n\r\nClass soon got started, and so did the dinner times. Nuns were sure to go to Kellie’s room and bring her straight to eat. When she chose to go to Mount Mary, she had to sign a contract. This was a very strict school. If she were caught disobeying any of the rules, then she would be out of the school. One of those rules was to eat your food and to keep it down. Kellie knew as well as some of the facility that she was not up holding her contract to the highest standard. Since the nuns had no real evidence to uphold Kellie to, they were just going to do there best with watching her with the closest of eye. \r\n\r\nAbout two weeks into the second semester while sitting at dinner Kellie became very dizzy and could see straight. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “At this point I was keeping nothing down me, and I was only eating the very minimal that I could. I was sure to drink lots of water, but I was done to 85 pounds at this point. As gross as this sounds, I was not longer just purging the food that I had just eaten, but rather what looked to be my insides. The vomit was a pale yellow and greenish color. It also just didn’t taste the same.”\r\n\r\nKellie started to roll backward off of the cafeteria table and fall onto the floor. She had blacked out. She was told that she was taken straight the emergency room at Milwaukee hospital. When the doctors had heard everything that was going on, and they took a look at her skin and saw her bones coming out it, they knew to diagnose Kellie with Bulimia. Kellie was unconscious for along time, and when she awoke she looked over at her left side, and saw all of the IV’s that she was hooked up too. She was scared, but still had no idea why she was in the hospital. \r\n\r\nShe laid in her bed and stared at the IV in her arm, and noticed that all she could see on her arm was pale colored flesh. There was no fat surrounding her arm or to give her that extra look of healthiness. She was in a room that contained another older women. Kellie looked over at the woman who was just lying in her sleeping. The women was a large older women, and Kellie couldn’t help but think to herself that even when people get older they are still chucky and don’t want to do anything about it. Kellie turned her head and stared up at the ceiling. She could not put two and two together on how and why she was in the hospital.\r\n\r\nA nurse entered the room and gave Kellie a menu and told her what number to call and order herself a lunch. The nurse also told Kellie that the cooks had a menu of what she was and wasn’t aloud to order. \r\n\r\nKellie picked up the phone and called the cafeteria. She said, “ I would like to order lunch. I will have green Jello, and a water with a lemon.”\r\n\r\nThe cook said, “Miss Kellie, you have to order more then that.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “I am not that hungry, and I just want a little something to tide me over for dinner. I will be hungry then and order a feast, can you please just this once not follow my guidelines. This is how I always eat, and since I don’t know why I am here, I will just order how I normally would eat.”\r\n\r\nThe cook said, “Miss Kellie, I am not aloud to tell you why you are here, nor am I aloud to bend the rules. Is there a sandwich or something else you want?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “NO there is not. Just forget it.” Kellie slammed down the phone and felt a tear starting to roll down her face.\r\n\r\nThe doctor entered the room and started to ask Kellie a list of questions. Then he sat on the side of Kellie’s bed and told her that she was being diagnosed with an eating disorder. He explained that even though she is skin and bones she sees herself as being fat. This is all due to a chemical imbalance in brain. He told her that he would give her some medications, and that she was to start seeing a therapist to work out her issues. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “Excuse me, but I don’t have an eating disorder. I am just naturally thin, and I can’t help that.\r\nThe doctor said, “That is the imbalance talking. Kellie at the age of 20 nobody is naturally 82 pounds. You have a problem, but we will work through it, and you will get better.”\r\n\r\nKellie sat in her bed and watched the IV just pump a white liquid into her. All she could think about was how much weight she will have gained by the time she gets out. She needed to get out of this hospital and back to her way of living. She knew deep down that she had a big problem, but she wasn’t ready to admit it yet. \r\n\r\nBefore leaving the hospital the doctors and nurses gave Kellie a guidebook to her new diet. IT wasn’t full of fatty foods or unhealthy choices, but rather it was a healthy book filled with salads and sandwiches, but Kellie still didn’t want to put one calorie into her system.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchsuv1ac"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.026689,43.038352]}},{"properties":{"name":"An interview with Victoria","description":"Posted by DdoboszThis class is amazing because I have reason to use my geography background then ever before. I no longer need to hide my behind my nerd tendencies of all the facts and knowledge gained over my past years in Valparaiso. I now have a reason to write about place. So I was sorry for shy and fun loving Victoria when she had to answer my question: What type of a landform do you represent in Northwest Indiana?\n\tAt first she turned her head slightly and starting laughing. Then she simply put her hand to her face and just said “I don’t know. I am not from this area. So I am not too familiar with the land forms or what is around.” So I went back to my knowledge and then just starting listing off some landforms. When I said the Dunes, I was shocked when she responded; “I have never been to the dunes.” I don’t think Victoria knew she was talking to a park ranger. Finally, instead of listing the technical names of landforms, I just name a basic group, hills. Victoria looked at me right in my eyes and said, “I am just like a hill!”\n\tShe then continued this time knowing where she was going. Victoria, although I am not too sure what state or region, is from a flat area. She enjoys waking up every morning and looking out her window and seeming the rolling plains of the Valparaiso Moraine. Her identity is just like hill. Some days are up while others are down. But this is a good thing to her. She likes it here much better then high school. Even though there is still drama in college it isn’t as bad as the higher school drama. \n\tShe has yet to reach that mountain peak in total or complete happiness. That is why a hill is a good way to describe what she is feeling. It’s not too tall in other words. You have your high moments, but it’s not that exciting and soon comes to an end. Victoria said that is better have it this way, because if you were climbing that mountain you would except to reach total excitement once you have reached the top, and then it would be a long downward fall. But with a hill it’s always up and down, and since size is different on each hill you never know what those moments are going to arise. \n\tMood swings, mood swings, mood swings, she was stressing to find me another metaphor for a hill. But she does not smoke marijuana, so she couldn’t say rolling a joint. Even though she was struggling to find these metaphors, she knows that Valparaiso is a nice change of pace for her. She no longer sees flat land first thing in the morning, but rather rolling topography, cranes, masses of construction, students, and workers. Not only when walking to class, but to other areas of town she is tramping through the mud, not a big fan of that, and walking up and down those hills and her personality most relates with.\n\tWhether or not we notice landforms or geographic features around us, we all are just like one or two of them. Victoria is a hill! She is a White Snapple drinking, energetic, jolly, freshman girl, with high ambition in her life. She knows that life has ups and downs, and she is prepaid for those and other challenges to happen.    \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchqegtq8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.99524,41.4489]}},{"properties":{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","description":"Posted by Ddobosz212 Lincolnway, Valparaiso, INWhat do you want to do about dinner? That is a normal topic of conversation around 6 o’clock in the evening on a Saturday between Danny and myself. Danny will usually tell me to cook something, and I will respond by telling him that I cooked all week and cooking on a Saturday night is not something I really want to do. I usually want to do something romantic, while Danny will want to be cheap and fast so we will be able to get back and move along with the rest of the night.\nSitting in my Compass Point apartment plain dull while living we bicker back and forth about where we will go and who will pay if it is somewhere expensive. It usually ends up around seven o’clock before we both finally agree on a place to eat that we both like. \nTypically, at this point my roommate Susie will ask what we are doing for dinner and her boyfriend Will end up joining Danny and myself. Not to mention this usually changes our plans from a romantic dinner for two to a casual dinner for four at some chain restaurant here in Valparaiso. Don’t get me wrong, I love Susie and Will and would always want them to come along to dinner.\nThe four of us all pile into one of your compact cars and drive the 2.5 miles into the heart of Valparaiso. We turn into a parking lot where half of the parking if for downtown customers and the other half is just for Around the Clock customers. Even though we are not allow to park in the Around the Clock spots, nine times out of ten we do. (Nobody ever knows the difference.)\nSusie and I will grab our purses from the car and Will and Danny get out of the front and lock up the car. We all run fast across Lincoln Way to the Buffalo Wild Wings. The restaurant is located inside of a building that contains a bunch of other stores including a hair cutter. Since this tends to be one of the hotter food eateries in town that is always a wait of at least thirty minutes. We put our name on the list. If it is not a typical Valparaiso night out, we usually will go stand outside of the restaurant and stand on the sidewalk. The two boys go off and joke about everything that they are looking at while Susie and I gossip about the new facts of our third roommate.\nThen our name is called, Dana party of 4. We all run inside the building and meet up with the hostess as she takes our to a wooden booth that contains four menus, a drink list, some Buffalo Wild Wing costars, and usually some crumbs from the last table occupants. Danny and Will talk one of the booth while Susie and myself sit on the other.\nWe sit in our wooden booth that contains a picture of a buffalo carved into the sides quietly and read over the menu, while the people around us talk about their daily lives louder and louder because it seems that the music is getting louder and louder. \nWe all have decided what we want to order. I look under the table and see old fries, pieces of buns, and chicken bones under my feet. I all of a sudden start to wish I would have cooked at home, because at least there is no food remnants under it. \nWill, “I will have 12 wings in sweet BBQ, buffalo wedges, and a side salad.”\nSusie, “I will have 12 wings in Blazin, buffalo wedges and a coke.”\nDanny, “I will also have 12 wings in BBQ, and a side salad with a water and lemon.”\nDana, “I will have 12 wings, 6 in honey BBQ, and 6 in Blazin, and an order of wedges.”\nThe order has been placed and we sit on the wood talking about the past week and what is come the next week. The smoke from the bar starts to roll over to where we are sitting and Susie’s eyes start to water from her allergies. \nOur drinks are bought, and Danny finds a piece of lettuce floating on the top of his water. It is sent back for another, and the waitress become perturbed with us. I start to sit cold because of the draft that is coming in from the front window. I put on my black jacket. \nAfter about forty-five more minutes of waiting our food finally arrives. It is placed in front of us. It doesn’t appear to be much food. I decide to use the restroom before eating. Susie gets up and moves out of the way. In the restroom is a group of four high school girls talking about the dates they are on, and how lame each of the guys is. I walk over to the facility one, and there is pee on the rim, then I move to facility two which looks as though it has never been flushed, and finally the third one appears to be ok. I wash my hands in the splashed and soaped up sinks before returning to the table.\nStudents are all over this place, and more and more seem to be coming in. The place is just increasing in noise and alcoholic drinks keep getting served more and more. \nThe four of us eat, and then ask for the check to be split into two: one for Danny and me, and the other for Susie and Will. Danny and my check is for 2.00. Now I really should have cooked at home. The food was not worth 2.00. We pay and live a tip for the grouchy waitress. \nAs we walk out our clothes smell of fried foods and smoke. We get into the car and drive back to Compass point. Another Saturday evening and another waste of money on a mediocre meal.       <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchsv5l0w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.222811,41.470763]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harper Community College","description":"Posted by Ddobosz 1200 W.

In that one year Kellie put on 30 pounds, and started to lose hair.\r\n\r\nKellie will still sometimes mysteriously disappear to the bathroom unannounced, or will disappear at eating functions. Kellie will always be fight the Bulimia monster in herself. Sometimes, I am almost positive that it gets to her and she purges, but it is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. \r\n\r\nKellie is afraid to leave home. She is attending Harper Community College and getting a associates degree in Fashion Merchandizing. \r\n\r\nKellie says, “Yes someday I would like to put out my own live of clothes, but right now I am afraid that the pressures of eating and looking thin will lead me down the wrong path a lone. I am afraid to eat alone because I don’t know what I will do. I also don’t like this weight I have put on. Even though I currently only weight 125 pounds, I still see myself as fat. I don’t want that weight, but I know that I need it. I need to be at home where my mom and dad will watch after me. I am afraid this is turning into a dependency problem.

I am always learning more and more about the personal hidden secrets of what I consider to be my closest and dearest friends/family members. \r\n\r\nKellie has been my best friend for a solid six years now. One would think that the both of us know each others personal and hidden dark times. In reality, I have hardly scraped the surface that unfolds Kellie’s inner challenge. \r\n\r\nJacobs high school was just like any other large high school. It had it clicks with the popular kids, the nerds, the sports jocks, the sex-a-alcohols, the pot smokers, the drinkers, the clubbers, and any other stereotype of a person one would get from a high school. Our school colors were brown and gold, and everywhere in the hall there were pictures of our school mascot, the Golden Eagle. Even though must of the student population didn’t have much school pride, Jacobs was know in the community for one thing, trendy clothes. It was known that if a person could not fit into clothes from Abercrombie and Fitch that they were losers, and would have to endure endless accounts of naming calling and being whispered about during class. \r\n\r\nJacobs had what must people now days call “The Plastics”. Every girl wanted to be one of them. What is a plastic? A girl that wears only name brand clothes, hair down four days a week, has to be blond, weight no more then 125 pounds, drive the newest cars, have parties or attend parties every weekend, and must be in a relationship 85% of the time. Even though the majority of Jacobs girls did not fit into this category, we all wanted to. No matter how much Kellie said, “Those girls are so stupid, and I would almost do anything not to be one of them”, we all knew that she, like the rest of us, was striving to be a plastic. \r\n\r\nKellie was always into fashion. She knew that she was going to major in fashion since I can remember. She was always designing new and weird looking outfits. She would never buy a store bought dress because they were not a Kellie original. For every single prom, and homecoming she designed and made her own original style. Nobody, expect for her closest friends, ever acknowledged her creating talent. Deep down this hurt her.  \r\n\r\nSomething was always different with Kellie. Her friends always had suspicions that something was chemically not right with her thinking methods. Kellie would always deny that anything was wrong with her. Never having hard evidence, nothing could ever be said or done. \r\n\r\nSitting down to lunch at one of the 40-lunch table in the white walled cafeteria, Kellie actually let out a hit to her eating disorder. Standing in the long lunch line waiting to get her usual green Jello and diet Coke, Kellie watched a fellow students go from the pizza line, to the nacho line, to the bake goods line, and then ending in the pop fountain line. Kellie’s face turned green as though she was about the puke. Thinking it was just the smell of the thick coats of grease that layered the pizza of the student in front of her, it was just ignored. \r\n\r\nArriving at the table to sit down and eat, Kellie stared at a large girl. The was only 5’2”, short brown hair, was wearing tight American Eagle Jeans that showed her white an black striped thong, and a red tang top that revealed her 400 pound stomach. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “I just don’t understand how people can let themselves get like that. I mean come on doesn’t she know that she is fat?”\r\n\r\nI said, “Well maybe she is happy with herself the way she is. I wouldn’t worry about it.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Yeah well look at her. Does she actually think that she looks good wearing that? If I was her, I would lock myself in my room and starve myself until I lost at least half of that weight.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Kel, if that was possible, you know I would do it. But she would die. Stop being so concerned with other people. How did you do on the PE test?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Yeah, but at least you know that you have a problem with your weight, and you are trying to take steps in getting ride of it. Plus you don’t dress like that. I mean come on.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Kellie, I have issue with the way I am, but if I was comfortable with myself then I would be looking like her and eating like her. Now look you have made me self-conscious about the food I just ate. I know that I shouldn’t have had the candy bar and coke today. Now that is all I am going to think about for the rest of the day, so lets just drop the subject.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Let me tell you something. It’s not that bad to go and throw up what you eat every now and then. Just a little bit, then you don’t have to be concerned with what you just put into your body. Plus you can eat whatever you want and not gain any weight. If anything you will lose some weight.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Kellie, that is called Bulimia. I don’t want an eating disorder thank you. Anyways PE…”\r\n\r\nKellie gave her first clue sitting at the fake wooden dark, brown lunch table. What could have been done at that point? Gone to the little green room where the nurse sits and told on her? Called her moms office and relayed the conversation to her? Spread a rumor around school about Kellie and her eating disorder? Maybe one of the above would have helped, but not realizing that it was as serious of a problem as it was, I kept it to myself and pretend like nothing ever happened.\r\n\r\nThe bell sounded to tell us that that lunch block was over, and it was once again time to journey down the long brown and gold halls to my classes. As we stood up from the table, Kellie put her hand around her 109-pound waist and said, “Well, even though I am not small, I will never let myself get like that.” Kellie shock her head so her hair flow to the back of her and her necklace fall right back to the front of her chest. She picked up her untouched Jello carton and half drunk diet Coke and tossed it in the trash. Her chicken legs went one in front of the other as she trotted off to her locker moss colored locker to gather materials for her next class. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchrq929c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.335411,42.168263]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kellie's House","description":"Posted by Ddobosz1208 Poplar St Lake in the Hills IllinoisShe arrived home for the first time on Thanksgiving break. Like must college students the first time coming home for a large break is a big ordeal. As Kellie’s dad drover her up the little drive way leading to the little blue house with the one white garage door, Kellie was thrilled to be arriving home. She ran in through the white garage door that lead her into the house and throw her arms around her mothers. All her mom could feel on her was her bones.\r\n\r\nHer mom said, “Kellie you look so hollow, and thin. What are they feeding you?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “You know college food, its no home cooking.”\r\n\r\nKellie took her suit-case of items down to her room in the basement. Kellie had no door to her little olive green room and contained hardly anything any more since she started school. There was a bed that laid in the corner and a makeup desk that still had all the stuff she left at home before leaving for school, and a closet that had her designer and home-made designer outfits in it.\r\n\r\nKellie walked over to her closet and found a dress that she had made right before the end of senior year in high school. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “I remember I was so proud of this dress when I made it. It looked just like a Ann Taylor, expect better. I striped down to my underwear and put the dress on. The straps on the blue flowered material fell off my shoulders. It no longer sat on them perfectly. The cut I had made to fit my body just tight enough to show my hips off, now just hung there with nothing to show off. It was more of a sack dress at this point. I went to my little mirror that hung on the make table and looked at myself. My cheeks were hollow, my teeth were turning yellow from the purging, and I didn’t have an once of fat on myself. I loved this dress so much, and now I was too thin to fit into it. It was at this time, my first trip home, that I realized I had an eating disorder. I wanted to stop, and I wanted my hips back, but something in my head was telling me that I looked good, and that I need to be thing in order to be the next Vera Wang. (Who also has an eating disorder.)”\r\n\r\nKellie now weighed in at about 90 some pounds, and her clothes were falling off of her. When she would go to eat she would pick at her food, and then run to the bathroom immediately. Her mother started to become very considered, and contacted one of the nuns at her school. The nun told her that Kellie was not showing up to the organized meals, and that herself and other faculty had been keeping a close eye on her. Kellie was standing the hallway bathroom the whole time this conversation was occurring. She could not believe her ears. She did not have an eating disorder. She is as normal as one could be. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “When my mother hung up the phone from that conversation, she leaned up again the wall behind her. She put her hand over her month and leaned her forehead up against the wall started to cry. It was a silent cry. But if you were to walk behind her or peek out of your room, you would know that she was upset about something. I didn’t know what to do, so I simply walked out into the hallway, and started to talk to her as though I hadn’t noticed anything was wrong.”\r\n\r\nKellie’s mom looked up with red, puffy eyes, and asked Kellie, “Would you like something to eat?” Kellie responded, “No thanks I just had a huge lunch.” \r\n\r\nShe knew that she was lying, but after all she was down to a size zero, and had nothing to worry about.

She chose to attend Mount Mary in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This was a very small school for fashion design, and only allowed girl attendants. She though that by choosing a girls only school, she would be able to give less thought and caring to her appearance. She would be able to focus on her education, and finally get her life put together. She packed her bags, and left to go to school. She got a single room thinking that this would lead her to less temptation, and she would be able to focus on everything else except her looks. (No roommate to compare herself with, or other friends running in and out of her room.)\r\n\r\nKellie decorated her dorm room just as she wanted it to be. Posters of the Red Hot Chile Peppers on the walls, green and yellow flowers that boarded her room to remind her of the outside while doing endless hours of work, green sheets on her twin sized bed, and a desk with a computer and numerous pictures of her friends from Algonquin surrounding it. She felt that since she was at an all girls school that her attire would not matter as much, so she only chose to bring her comfortable clothes and a few other items.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “All of my comfortable clothes were a little on the baggy side, and often when I would put them I would feel fatter then ever. I would run to the bathroom and purge up anything I had in my system, no matter if I had eaten or not. The last thing I wanted was to look fat wearing baggy jeans and a mid-sized sweet shirt.”\r\n\r\nAfter about two weeks of living on her own, she became lonely. She had made tons of friends, and had only wanted to hang out with them instead of going back to her room of isolation. Still being at an all girls school, she felt in the comfort of other girls that would not make fun of her for gaining a few pounds. After all this was college now, and not high school where you have to be plastic to fit in.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with eating disorders is that it’s a mental issue. Even though you think that you are doing something right, or you keep telling yourself that everything will fall into place, you still have that chemical imbalance in your head that makes issues like this hard to deal with. \r\n\r\nKellie’s says, “My friends at Mount Mary could have cared less what I looked like. But because I was not on any medication I could not handle the imbalances, and kept telling myself that I need to purge to stay in the in crowd. This was not the case.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlcht875ul"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.03531,43.07163]}},{"properties":{"name":"My home in Valpo","description":"Posted by DdoboszI sit on my roommates bed holding her while she cries about her fight. Only only a few white and blue Christmas lights strung around the top corners of her room light her room. Her computer monitor had fallen in sleep mode. She sits there nestled up in-between my two pink sleeves. The apartment smells of fettuccine because that is what was on the stove cooking when the fight occurred.\nI had just ran to the near by Target to pick up some glue for a project I was working on. I left the two of them in the kitchen happily cooking dinner. I stood at Target and debated about the different types of glue I could buy. Generic verse Elmer’s, and then clear glue verse that deep white glue. I ended up buying a .24 cent bottle of clear Elmer’s glue. (I think it was miss-marked.) I checked out and went back into the dark, cold night and travel the mile back to the apartment. \nI unlocked the door, which I hadn’t locked before leaving twenty minutes ago. The fettuccine noodles were boiling over on the stove, and water from the pot was dripping on the floor. The white creamy sauce was boiling high splashing again the microwave, making a mess. Where was my roommate? \nAll of a sudden I hear deep sobs coming down the hall in the apartment. All the lights are off, except of the glare of Full House that was on the living room. (I had left the TV on when I left to go on my errand.) I stood there in the cream colored hall, holding my Target bag, and debated on whether or not I should disturb her. I walk lightly over to the coat closet, next to her room, and hung up my brown coat. I stood outside her door for a moment and tapped on the door. It wasn’t my roommate that answered; it was her boyfriend saying, “she is fine.”\nFrighten by the situation I ran back to the living room and sat down on the green couch. I turned the volume up on the TV, took out my glue, and started glue together my project. I could still heat her sobs coming from the room down the hall, and occasionally a males voice would be yelling. I just kept on turning the TV louder and louder to drain any noises in the background.\nFull House was ending, and he came storming out of her room. He slipped on his blue flip-flops and left the apartment. I sat there and stared down the empty hall. I didn’t know if I should invade on her privacy or not. I stood in the kitchen and started to clean up the mess that was created. She came out of her room. Her eyes were swollen, and her face was as red as Santa’s suit. “Let me clean this up. I made the mess.” I told her not to worry and gave her a glass of ginger al. She sat on the green couch while I worked on cleaning the mess up. She just stared at the white painted walls, and then turned her head slightly toward me and started sobbing again. I looked at her and she ran into her room.\nI dried my hands off, and went down that hall, opened her door, and sat next to her on her bed. I opened my arms and she crawled right into them, and just sobbed and sobbed. \n     We have never spoken about that night, and I have no idea what the fight was about. I know that I was home at the right time, for my best friend was in need of a shoulder to cry on.     \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchss0cy5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.12158,41.47772]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans","description":"Posted by DdoboszI knew I was about to enter Professor Tomasek exhibit, but I was not aware that I was about to enter into a New Orleans Mardi Gras. The walls of the exhibit were covered in photos taken from the first Mardi Gras after Hurricane Katrina. I started gazing into the pictures that were filled with yellows, purples, greens, blues, and whites. All of a sudden I hear, “Here have another Rum and coke, this ones on the house.” I look down at myself and I am wearing a simple green and yellow dress and there are ten strands of beads hanging from my neck. I ran over to a near by mirror and I can not see my face because it is hidden behind a mask. \nI am drawn away from the local street bar, to jazz musicians on the street. As I walk I notice that the ground is covered in trash, and there are other people just like me wearing customs. The air is humid and dry, and it dawns on me that I am attending the New Orleans Mardi Gras. I decide to walk around taking notice of everything that I pass. The people attending the festival are of all ages, young, middle aged, and old. They are all in some custom, expect for one older woman who is wearing a sweatshirt, but she has a multitude of breads hanging around her neck. People of all shapes and sizes are here.  What I did notice was that there was much multi-cultural diversity at this party. Much of the people were white, and I was unable to tell if they were visitors or locals. I would assume that from the smiling faces of the people, the elaborate customs that they were wearing. \nOut of the corner of my right eye I see two young men. I turn to look at them. There customs was one of the most unique I have ever seen. They have a custom of white flesh representing the body that lays under the cloths. The irony of this was that they were still hiding their own true bodies. Because what they were wearing was representing clothing and under them laid their own bodies. I have no idea why only one hand was wearing a black glove, and why their faces were hidden behind a black mask. \nEveryone around me is either holding an alcoholic beverage, or is holding a cigarette. If they are not wearing face paint, then they are wearing a mask. I am surprised that since this is the first Mardi Gras after the hurricane that some of the people took the same amount of time as normal to develop these elaborate customs. There was one man who took of the whole street himself. He was dress in a white leotard and had huge feathers with eyes coming out of them. He was supposed to be a peacock. Most of the men just dressed up as women in dresses, or lady suits. Another man was dressed as Popeye. \nThe women were just dressed as going to a masquerade ball. The slinky dress, and skirts with their faces hidden behind face paint or a mask. \nI started making my way down the street, gathering beads and taking pictures. I was drinking and laughing with everyone else. I didn’t care I had no idea who these people were, and I didn’t even remember that the hurricane had hit just a few months before. It was fun to be in the true sprit of New Orleans.\nI dropped my pen on the ground and as I bent down to pick it up; I realized that I was still in the VUCA visiting an exhibit. My trip to New Orleans had been created by the pictures surrounding me on the two walls. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchy05ls3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04,41.46404]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ranger closing shift","description":"Posted by DdoboszWhy am I so drawn to nature?

Kellie went and got into her mother’s van, and she was driven to the rehab center. There was a crew of people waiting for Kellie when she got out of the car. She was taken into the center and sat in a group with other just like her with eating disorders. This was lock down time for Kellie. There was no getting out of eating here. \r\n\r\nStill Kellie found a way to purge to first few days she was there.

She was going to try this new diet that she was put on, and she started to understand that she had a problem with eating. The main this was that Kellie could not keep anything down herself without becoming worried or it was like so was addicted to the whole idea of purging her food. The cycle continued.\r\n\r\nAt a family dinner one night Kellie was standing over by the sink and started to black out again. Her father was able to catch her and they ran her to Sherman Hospital this time. Ad Kel lay in he hospital bed, her parents sat in with a specialist on eating disorders, and she gave them information about a rehab center in Schaumburg Illinois. She parents signed Kellie up immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen Kellie awoke the specialist was right by her bed. She said, “Kellie you have a problem. I know that you understand that you don’t have a problem, but you have to admit it. Please talk to me and tell me everything so I am able to help you.”\r\n\r\nThe hospital room was dark, and no light was on except for a little light about her bed. Her eyes were rolling all over the place, and she did know what to do. This was her third trip to a hospital. She look at the lady and just started balling.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “I want to be normal. I want to fit in. I don’t want to be 200 pounds when I am thirty-five years old. I see people and think to myself that they are huge, and should do something to change themselves. I am afraid that I will never find love, and that no one will want to hire me to design their clothes because I am fat and ugly.”\r\n\r\nThe specialist stopped Kellie and said, “You think you are attractive being 70 pounds and gangly looking.

You need to eat, and you need to say you have a problem.’\r\n\r\nKellie looked at the IV in her arm, and stared at the ceiling.

Even though I will have to move out of my apartment in late May, I still find the urge to clean what I can. (I guess my mom with the bucket and a mop has really stuck in my head.) The problem was, everything in the apartment was relatively clean. The kitchen gets scrubbed down once a week along with the bathrooms, and the floors get vacuumed once if not twice a week. Then I walked into my closet and it looked like a tornado had stuck down and everything was taken up in a whirlwind. \r\n\r\nAs I stood inside this walk in hazard area, I saw clothes that were half hung on the hanger, piles of pants there need buttons sewed on, cleaning supplies that I had stashed away at the begging of the year and forgot about, a laundry basket filled with clothes to hid the bottle of Vodka from the RA’s. The worse thing was the smell. Now don’t get the idea that I smell bad, and don’t do my laundry. I do my laundry twice a week, and clean everything that I wear. But I don’t where everything in my closet and I believe that those items have accumulated a smell of the year. It just smelled like old clothes that had been boxed up for the long winter, and I was just about to unpack them. \r\n\r\nThere in front of me stood the most fabulous spring-cleaning project, my closet. I figured that I would eventually need to clean it out before leaving so there was no better them the present. (I had no idea what I was getting myself into.) I started with the shoes. I have six shelves built into the wall on the far end of my closet. I like to line my shoes up pair after pair so I can match them to each outfit. As of this point all of the shoes were just stacked on top of one another, and the leather ones were coated in salt. I started by putting the winter shoes and the bottom and rising them clean of the salt particles. Then I went to the summer shoes and started lining those up by color. This look me a good half and hour in the back of my closet, but I was now warmed up and ready to attack the big part.\r\n\r\nI continued to the right in the closet. Over here hung my dress clothes: dressed skirts, nice slacks, and blouses that match each of them. All of these items were hung poorly, some were hanging off the hanger, well others were inside out, and yet somehow I still managed to leave my legging and tights inside of the pants. (Can we say lazy?) So slowly I went throw each item and pulled out the tights, leggings, and hung everything that needed to be hung nicely on each hanger. Above this bar is a shelf that contains items such as: a Nike carry bag, a empty shoe box, paper plates, and paper cups. Honestly, I looked at the items and said, “I will deal with that soon enough.”\r\n\r\nThen I continued on my way to the front entrance on the closet, which contains yet another six shelves. The first shelf is my purses and extra blankets. I re-folded the blankets that were in a pile and organized my purses to be in a straight row. The next shelve was easy, just some big towels, that were already folded nicely. The next shelf was a mess of wash clothes. I stood there and folded each little different colored square into a nice neat tiny square. The next shelf was my PJ’s, needless to say this shelve was a hazard. Then after that the next two were sweat shirts that all needed re-folding and I also needed to re-wash some to get the weird looking spots out on them. \r\n\r\nThen the far left wall awaited me. I started slow by re-hanging everything and placing more items in the laundry basket. Then I got annoyed and bored my clothes just were so poorly hung, and I was finding shirts that I should have never bought in the first place. Finally, I was done. I took a vacuum to the floor and started a load of laundry. \r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, the place is getting back to the usual piles and poorly hung clothes. It’s a cycle that will never end. I will never learn from one cleaning experience to the next. Even though I am tired and swear to myself that I will never let things get out of hand, the very next day things start to go array.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlci1osgop"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.033885,41.474165]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Joe's Hospital","description":"Posted by Ddobosz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\">   77 N. Airlite Street, Elgin, IL - 60123he end of the school year was wrapping up, and Kellie was packing up her dorm room. She was ready to return home for the summer and get some rest and stop this non-sense for a while with this so-called eating disorder. Since Mount Mary had seen an improvement with Kellie they said that she would be able to return to school in the fall. Kellie and her parents were happy to hear this, even though her grades were in the dumps. Everyone had felt that since she was dealing with the issue that the next year would be different.\r\n\r\nBoth of Kellie’s parents work during the day, and Kellie didn’t have a ton of hours at Joe Ann Fabrics. This left Kellie a lone most of the day in her house. She was in heaven with all the food that she could eat, and then purge up. No one was there, so she decided to make it appear she ate a ton of food during the day, and then conveniently was not hungry or stuff anything else down her for dinner. Kellie had now gotten into the habit of wearing over sized clothes to make it look like she was not losing weight. On a Tuesday late afternoon, Kellie was on one of her purging episodes and passed out. She laid downstairs in her bathroom, until her mother arrived home to find her daughter laying on the cold blue tile floor and saw the vomit of food in the toilet. She still had a pulse, so she gave Kellie some water and rushed her to St. Joe’s hospital. \r\n\r\nThey rushed Kellie into a rood and immediately connected her to and IV that began shoot a food substance liquid into her veins. Kellie was unconscious for a good eight hours. My mother and father were worried that she was in a comma and that she may not wake up out of it. But eventually she did. Kellie’s eyes were drawn to the large needle sticking in her vain injecting food into her system.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Get this out of me. I don’t need this. I am eating on my own. I don’t want to gain weight. I am up at least eight pounds from my last hospital visit.” \r\n\r\nKellie just started screaming and crying and screaming until a nurse came running into the room. She was able to came Kellie down, and shortly after a doctor came in. \r\n\r\nThe doctor said, “Kellie, actually you are weighing in at 78 pounds which is five pounds less from when you were in the Milwaukee hospital. Are you taking your medications?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Of course I am.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor said, “Because the blood test that we ran show us differently. The chemical that you are missing is still not showing up in the blood. You need to be taking that medicine, or you will kill yourself.”\r\n\r\nKellie looked down at her legs in the stiff white bed. She could see every bone imperfection sticking out of her pale greenish skin. \r\n\r\nThe doctor said, “Do you know what you are actually doing to yourself? You know the life consequences of having bulimia and not dealing with it?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Yeah being thin and a super model. Well for me it will be a top designer.”\r\n\r\nThe doctors said, “No. Actually, soon you will start to lose your hair, once you start eating you will have a hard time taking any unwanted weight off, big huge brown blotches will appear on your skin, if will be hard for you to conceive, and may other life long effects. So I suggest that you start to put yourself together, so you can help prevent as many as the above as possible.”\r\n\r\nWith that being said Kellie closed her eyes and fell asleep. She stayed at St. Joe’s for two nights. They once again gave her a guide book as to what foods to eat and how to start eating again. This doctor also gave her information on the life consequences that she was doing to herself.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “This doctor was trying to scare me into eating. He thought that by telling me everything bad with an eating disorder, and then I would be scared to eating again. The most important thing this doctor gave me was a hot line to call in case I felt like purging. Although I never used it, now that I look back on it I should have. This doctor was really concerned, and he should have been I was only weight in at 78 pounds. Must people weight that at the age of 8 and 10.

We spent the whole afternoon there, just the two of us and the garden, not a single soul walked around us. \r\n\r\nThe next week at school had been a tough one, lots of work and drama with friends. I needed my oak tree and its calming voice to relax me. Unfortunately, that was all the way back in Illinois. I found myself picking up my car keys and going outside to my car and driving back to the gardens. Again I was alone no one else there expect of myself and the wind. I grabbed my blue notebook out of my car and walked down to a pavilion that was just being built. There was a wooden picnic table set up on the inside next to a small man made stream. I sat down on the table and opened up my notebook. \r\n\r\nThe wind blew silently up my shirt back, hugging me and comforting me while I sat and pondered my week. The wood under me held me still and re-assured me that it was going to allow me to sit for as long as I needed. The trees that were over the top of pavilion helped shade the sun out of my eyes. And the wind that blew across the man made stream was talking to me and calming me down, just like the oak tree at home. \r\n\r\nI opened my notebook and began to write a serious of questions that were asking myself the truth about what was going on. How well did I study for that chemistry test? Why did I really go and tell Keith about Susie? Why did I tell my mother that I was upset with her for not coming this past weekend like she said she would? I wrote questions and then filled in the answers to each. Nature spoke to me and helped me find the real answer to each of them. It was comforting to know that someone was there that cared and wanted to help.\r\n\r\nI knew that I could relay on this place when I needed to come again and regroup. I go to this place every time I need my own time to self reflect. I go back to that same wooden picnic table, which now has character from all the weather changes, and sit there and write questions and allow the stream to help me answer them. It is all honesty and reflectance on what happened. Every time I go to leave I come out with a smile on my face and I am calm and ready to attach the drama at hand, or I am ready to forgive and forget. The wise, the knowledgeable, the dependant, the truthful, the relaxing, the scenic, the calm, the understanding, the aged…mother nature.   \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlci25iwqb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.18493,41.45251]}},{"properties":{"name":"The unknown","description":"Posted by DdoboszPale, alone, he lays in the bed at Porter Memorial Hospital. Weighing in at 109 pounds, and being a good 6’1’’, he is not healthy. What could be wrong? He lies slightly as I enter the room. He turns toward me, and he says, “Hey you, I will be just fine, don’t worry.” Enthusiastic, smiling, just happy to see someone other then a nurse. I go by his side, and kneel down by the stiff bed that is covered in sandpaper like sheets. I take hold of his cold, shacking hand, he still smiles at me trying to re-assure me that everything is going to be the same. I grip his hand tighter and tighter and look up at the gray/blue ceiling, praying to God that nothing will take this wonderful creature away from me. He lets go, and I walk over the single window in the room and open the gay straw like curtains. “Its cold in here,” I say, “Do you think there is a draft?” The nurse comes in carrying videos that say, “Coping with diabetes type one.” She lays them on top of the VCR that sits under the black 20’’ TV. I put my hand over my month trying to show him that I am not afraid, our lives will now be completely changed, and that life will now take us down a different path. I look over at him and see the heart monitor hook up to him, and other machines and needles that are stuck in and around him. The room is bare and cold with two single old 1960 looking chairs. He hits a remote found at the side of his of bed that allows him to sit up. “I think I might want to go to the bathroom.” He slowly stands up and carries the sugar water machines with him into a cold blue tiles bathroom, with a white porcelain toilet and a handicapped shower. He closed the heavy, dark wood, maple door for a few minutes before returning to his position in bed. The main door to the room is open, and as I sit in the olive green chair, I see busy nurses running past yelling things like, “106 in room A.” or “Dr. Young is RIGHT NOW.” The love of my life sits in an unknown bed, pale, shacking, and trying to understand what’s going on. He doesn’t want to show fear to me, and I don’t to him. The hospital speaks both of fear and emotions for the both of us. “They say in a couple of months I can stop the injections and go on the pump,” he says. Good news, I guess, something that is hardly heard in these hallow, cold, spooky walls. “When are you coming home,” I say. “Don’t know, I guess this has to be home for a few more days. They have to get my sugar levels down from 420 to 120,” he states. I take off my coat and lay it on the heating vent, for this is going to be a long day…  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlci0dhyo0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.01172,41.45096]}},{"properties":{"name":"Train ride","description":"Posted by Ddobosz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Chesterton Train Station 9:15 a.m.\n\t“Will, go run and catch that train before it leaves the platform. GO GO GO,” I said.\n\t“Dam the train is already leaving the platform”, said Will \n\t“Well if I am able to drive fast enough maybe we will be able to pass the train up and meet up with it at the next train station,” I said.\n\t“Good idea, Dana use those Chicago driving skills and go fast, I will help watch to the police,” said Susie.\n\t“There is the train, we can do this. Ooooh, shoot a red light.”\n\tWaiting, waiting, waiting, 5…4…3…2…1 \n\t“The train has once again passed us, we have to catch up with it” said Will.\n\t“I am going. All right we can park here. Hurry run,” I said.\n\tRight, left, right, left, right left; faster and faster the feet beat on the slick black pavement at the Gary train Station.  \n\tMy left foot starts to ascend in climbing the three large steps that will lead me into the first train cabin. Once I have climbed those steps I scanned to train for four open seats together were Susie, Will, Danny and I can sit together. The first train car is completely filled with people from all different cultures and backgrounds. After traveling through three separate cars, we were able to find four seats that are semi-close to each other. We sit down. Will automatically falls asleep and says, “Wake me up when we get to Chicago.” Danny, Susie and I star at each other for a minute before my eyes start to drift through the train car. In front of me is a family of four, going to one of the Chicago Museums, in front of them is an man mumbling to himself. Across from that man is a women dressed in a white fur coat complaining about the filth of the train and how it might damage the real mink fur. \n\tI noticed in that brief second of time the various different cultural groups that had been mashed together in the 15-car train. \n\tBump, Bump, Bump, Screech and we come to a haul.\n\tMore people load onto the train. Will’s head jerks forward in the movement with the train as we start up again. Something is poking at my back, and turn about in my seat to see what it was there is a spring coming out of the seat that I am sitting in. I then dared to glance down at the floor of the train. Large clumps of gum stuck to the bottom of my seat, and the floor has what seems to be running rivers of snow melt and rainwater dripping back and forth. The floor has a pink speckled pattern to it, almost as if this train has once been the pride and job of the owners. In-between the pink speckles are spots of dirt that are adding a brown color to the floor that is not intended to be there. \n\tBack and forth back and forth my body moves.\n\tI look up at the stark bare metal ceiling of the moving train. It is moving with every inch of track in every direction that the train goes. \n\tAll of a sudden the mumbling man stands up and yells, HOME AT LAST.\nEast Chicago 10:15 a.m.\n\t  \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchp9zcls"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.14355,41.60312]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valparaiso Court House","description":"Posted by DdoboszvalparaisoValparaiso Indiana contains a comfortable and quaint downtown. Even though the weather is often gloomy, Valparaiso’s streets still buzzed with business professionals and students from the near by Valparaiso University campus. They have fast paces walks as they hurry into the various local coffee stands or street Café’s. \n\nAs the wind blows down the back of your windbreaker, you stop at a cross walk looking for a button that will signal the walker sign. Where is that button? They are artistically, hidden on the top of a freestanding black post. \n\nCrossing the street one will often receive wafts of smells coming from one of the diverse restaurants in town. Pizza of pizza arise from Papa John’s or Tony’s eatery, smells of grease come from China House or Around the Clock, or the smell of a grilled hamburger from Buffalo Wild Wings, and the best smells come from the coffee Café’s that smell warm drinks and serve chocolate goodies. \n\nFood smells are not the only smell one gets while walking though the town. While walking down one of the alleys in Valparaiso one can smell garbage, or bits of sawdust coming from the new construction. Not everything in the downtown is new construction, but rather most of it is old, architecture. The main focus of the downtown is the City hall, and while walking past it ones nose will pick on in hints of ancient buildings. \n\nThe corners of downtown are covered with banks or jewelry stores. So if you need an ATM then there is nothing to fear because Valparaiso has plenty of them. Down the side streets of the main town are different clothing stores. Everything type of cloths for everyone is covered in the downtown: children’s, men’s, and women’s. \n\nThe neatest thing part of the downtown is a mural that was created on the side of a store called LifeStyles. If you were to just come into town and not know a thing about it, the mural would explain everything that the town has to offer. There are actually a bunch of hidden secrets about the town written into this artwork that make it apart of Valparaiso history. For example, there is one sign that reads: “Today’s special is a small coffee and a bagel for 7.95. Don’t let the comforts of the town fool you, because it is expensive. The people are all smiling and friendly while the Valparaiso Police are chasing after an escapee from the near by jail. Valparaiso Police are on the game at all times looking for criminals of all offenses. The near by jailhouse is an part of Valparaiso long history. The jail house is open for tours five days a week, and admission is free. \n\nIf you become tried while walking the streets of the square, then don’t fear because there is a wide verity of benches to take a rest on. Some of them are the simple, plain black, wired benches, while others are artfully done to be unique and colorful. Each of those benches represents Valparaiso in its on unique way.\n\nIf you are looking for a place to take a walk on a Sunday afternoon, have a cup of coffee, or stroll through the variety of stores, then Valparaiso’s downtown is the place to be. Take a few minutes to stop and look around, and smell the air to fully enjoy what Indiana has to offer.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlchtuke6c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05418,41.46976]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237216","metadata":null,"contact_name":"ddobosz","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:ddobosz","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237216","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237216,platial:user=ddobosz","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":40546}
