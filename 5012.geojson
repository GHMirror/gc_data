Before the bailout, Federal Govt had already committed to nearly a trillion dollars spending rescueing Freddie and Fannie, AIG, Bear Stearns etc. The total including bailout comes to nearly $1.8 trillion $s. Each of the gov agency and private recipients were geocoded and a point shapefile was created where each point has an estimate of govt tax $s that may be involved in the rescue plan that really started with Bear Stearns and culminated in the $700 billion bailout bill. \nMain source:
