Addison St, Chicago, ILHoly Cow!  It may say I was born in 1987....but I honestly think I was born the day I walked into Wrigley Field for the first time to watch my beloved Cubs.  Me and my three best friends from high school had taken a road trip after our senior year, and made a trip through St. Louis and Chicago.  Being a Cub fan my whole life and finally getting to see the green outfield ivy and everything the park had to offer was just surreal.  So we went and saw a game and it was probably the best game of the whole year as the Cubs won the game in the bottom of the 9th inning.  I had such a good time that I went back two days later and scalped a ticket for like 60 bucks and went to the game while my friends were out in the town.  It was awesome!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a666lqs0oz4g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.655788,41.947372]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/26679","metadata":null,"contact_name":"volsfan87","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:volsfan87","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/26679","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=26679,platial:user=volsfan87","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48469}
