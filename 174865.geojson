it's message as the protesters have been replaced in part by drug abusers and homeless people who are just there for the tent space.\nThe occupants should be focusing on their (many) message(s).  The risk of loosing the tents are a distraction.  They can still protest either way.\nMaybe the problem is that the occupants won't be able to sleep in past 9am if they have to travel to the protest site each day.  Might make it too much like work.\nIn 8 days, if Susan Anton wins the Mayoral election, she will use the insane rabid bulldog approach and have city staff tear down the tent city on her behalf regardless of the violence that ensues.  She's made it clear in the election debates that she's an all or nothing black or white 'leader' with no room for subtle considerations.\nRecall that a few years ago, Susan Anton declared that all of Vancouver's crime problems could be solved simply by ticketing every J-walker and litter-bug while ignorantly claiming that this is how New York got cleaned up.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/suraky/6330730995/","id":"12"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.120142,49.283035]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/6331477752","title":"2011-11-09 - Occupy Vancouver Day 26","published":{"end_time":"2011/11/10 03:23:30 -0500","original":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 00:23:29 -0800","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/11/10 03:23:29 -0500"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/suraky/\">Suraky</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/suraky/6331477752/\" title=\"2011-11-09 - Occupy Vancouver Day 26\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6112/6331477752_8b45d73fda_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"56\" alt=\"2011-11-09 - Occupy Vancouver Day 26\"></a>\n\nAnother deadline passed without a full court injunction so the occupants are trying to buy time by dealing with some of the safety concerns. \nThis morning the tents look more organized as the occupants thinned them out and increased space between them to make the fire chief happy.\nReally what it looks like is the new society of the occupy movement is starting to realize that some of the rules of the old society are actually important.\nTonight (previous photo) they tried harder by working on the wood palettes  upon which sit the tents.\n22 photos stitched together for this panorama.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/suraky/6331477752/","id":"13"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.119938,49.282857]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/6331470722","title":"2011-11-09 - Occupy Vancouver Day 26","published":{"end_time":"2011/11/10 03:18:58 -0500","original":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 00:18:57 -0800","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/11/10 03:18:57 -0500"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/suraky/\">Suraky</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/suraky/6331470722/\" title=\"2011-11-09 - Occupy Vancouver Day 26\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6218/6331470722_8224959e3d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"71\" alt=\"2011-11-09 - Occupy Vancouver Day 26\"></a>\n\nTonight the camp seemed to be working hard to move tents and address safety concerns ... trying to buy time while the city works on a court injunction.\nI'm not sure how applying plywood to the wooden palettes that the tents sit upon helps any.
