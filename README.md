Archive of GeoCommons data contributed between 2007 and 2015. 

## About

GeoCommons was a community data sharing site where anyone could upload and attribute data, discover and download in open formats and build maps and perform spatial analysis to discover new insights. 

Launched in 2007, GeoCommons was one of the first open data repositories on the web. It pioneered web-based spatial data exploration and collaboration. Since then, the global commons of data sharing has matured into a vibrant collection of catalogs, repositories and tools.

This repository contains a full archive of the public datasets shared at GeoCommons.com.


[ArcGIS Open Data](http://opendata.arcgis.com) publishes data directly from authoritative sources and provides similar functionality to download in common formats, make maps and develop with an API. 

## Using Data

The 150,000+ datasets are all available as GeoJSON. Data are available using the same dataset ID from GeoCommons of the form: `https://github.com/geocommons/geocommons_data/blog/master/datasets/{dataset_id}.geojson`

In GitHub this will display a map if the features are few or simple enough. If there are too many, or if you want to view the full metadata, then visit `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoiq/gc_data/master/datasets/{dataset_id}.geojson`

A few examples:

- [EPA Air Quality Index, 2006](https://github.com/geoiq/gc_data/blob/master/datasets/6.geojson) - [metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoiq/gc_data/master/datasets/6.geojson)
- [DC Crime, March 2012](https://github.com/geoiq/gc_data/blob/master/datasets/222312.geojson) - [metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoiq/gc_data/master/datasets/222312.geojson)
