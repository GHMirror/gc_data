The 2010 Labor Force Participation Rate shows the Civilian Population over 16 years of age who are in the Labor Force. This includes all civilians aged 16 years and older that were either employed or actively seeking work. \n\nThe Labor Force Participation Rate is calculated as the number of persons in the labor force as a percentage of the total working-age population. Labor force participation rates that are lower than the U.S. rate of 63 percent may indicate chronically high unemployment among residents who are no longer looking for work or above-average proportions of children or retirees in the resident population. This data variable is included in Esri's Updated Demographics (2010/2015).\n\nThe map is designed to be displayed with a 30–50 percent semi-transparency for overlay on other basemaps as noted in the map legend. A basemap with relatively few colors, such as the World Terrain Base, works well with this map when transparency is used.\n\nThe geography depicts States at greater than 25m scale, Counties at 1m to 25m scale, Census Tracts at 250k to 1m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 250k scale.\n\nEsri's Updated Demographics (2010/2015) – Population, age, income, sex, and race are among the variables included in the database. Each year, Esri's data development team employs its proven methodologies to update more than 2,000 demographic variables for a variety of geographies. See Updated Demographics for more information.\n\nScale Range: 1:591,657,528 down to 1:72,224\n\nCoordinate System: Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere (WKID 102100)\n\nTiling Scheme: Google Maps/Bing Maps \n\nMap Service Name: USA_Labor_Force_Participation_Rate\n\nPublication Date: December 2010\n\nUpdate Frequency: Once per year\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e678211313464ecd84e4f12bba1fd776","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"ArcGIS.com","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e678211313464ecd84e4f12bba1fd776","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"block,bureau,census,cloud,commerce,counties,demographics,department,doc,federal,groups,labor,national,of,population,states,tracts,us,usa","published":"2010-12-16T17:00:00Z","id":90192}
