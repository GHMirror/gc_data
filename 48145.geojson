Most of the forest is located in Brazil. The Amazon is half of the worlds remaing rainforests. The Amazon is the largest and has the richest soil than any other rainforest in the world. The Amazon rainforest has so many different species of wild life. It is home to about 2.5 million different species of insects.\r\n\r\n Around 438,000 different plants and vegetation. Like 3,000 species of fish along with 1,294 species of birds.About 425 mammals and amphibians and 378 reptiles. One in every 5 birds live in the Amazon Rainforests.

It is the largest inland body of water in the world. It is about 750 miles long and 130 to 271 miles wide in some areas. The average depth in the Caspian sea is 550 feet deep but its deepest is 3,363 feet deep.\r\n\r\n The caspian sea has many tributaries flowing into it but the sea has no outlet. Over 130 rivers flow into the caspian sea. The sea is linked to the Baltis, white and black sea. The average temperature in the water is 61 degrees fahrenheit. The surface area of the Caspian sea is 143,244 square miles.

The plains cover most of central USA and go into parts of Canada. The plains are in 10 US states and 4 Canadian Provinces. The plains are about 500 miles east to west and 2000 miles north to south.\r\n\r\n The plains cover an area of about 1.125 million square miles. The great plains are divided into valleys, plains, plateaus, hills, and steppe.

The trench is the deepest part of the earths ocean and the earth. It is created by ocean-to-ocean subduction. The deepest part of the trench is called the Challenger deep. The trenches depth is somewhere near 6.8 miles deep. \r\n\r\nThe trench forms the boundary between the Pacific plate and the Phillipine plate.The most accurate measurement of the depth of the mariana trench was by an unmanned Japanese sub which took the measure of 35,798 feet deep.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64kyz989fy3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[142.55859375,11.9533493936]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mauna Loa Volcano","description":"Posted by Tomthebomb313<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/mauna_loa1984.jpg\">Mauna Loa is the largest volcano in the world. It is located on the big island of Hawaii. The type of volcano it is is an active shield volcano. The name Mauna Loa means long mountain. Mauna Loa is an active volcano and its last eruption was in late march of the year 1984. Mauna Loa is not a tall or steep volcano but it is very wide and fat.\r\n\r\n Scientist think that the volcano has been erupting since 700,000 years ago. The volcano has been dormant since 1984 but scientist have concluded that their will bee an eruption in the next few years.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64kyzjfqyc0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.563659668,19.4691817878]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mid-Atlantic Ridge","description":"Posted by Tomthebomb313<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/AtlanticBathy.jpg\">The Mid Atlantic ridge is a giant and long underwater mountain range. Some of the high peaks of this ridge meet the surface and form islands. The ridge was discovered by a team of scientist in 1872. The ridge runs from 87 degrees N to 54 degrees S.\r\n\r\n The ridge is formed from two plates moving away from each other letting magma seep through. The magma cools and forms land under the water creating ridges. Some of the Ridge goes through Iceland and forms volcanoes.

Its height is somewhere around 29,035 feet. Mount everest got its name from Sir George Everest who was the first person to record the height and location of the mountain. Mount Everest is located in the Himialya mountain range between Nepal and Tibet.\r\n\r\n At the top of Mount Everest the wind speed is about 118 miles per hour from the jet stream it is like a hurricane. The normal temperature on the summit of the mountain is around -15 degrees but it can reach   -100 degrees. The first people to ever climb mount everest were in late May of 1959. Until mount everest got its name in 1856 it was known as peak XV. The mount is covered with giant glaciers that form its shape.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64kyz99dgh9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[87.5830078125,27.7613298745]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ngorongoro Crater","description":"Posted by Tomthebomb313<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ngoro.jpg\">This crater used to be a volcano before it collapsed (caldera) about two million years ago and is the largest collapsed volcano in the world. The crater is about 12 miles wide and some of the crater walls can be about 2,000 feet about the floor of the crater. In the crater there are many types of animals and birds but the famous animal inside the conservation area is the black rhine which is frequently sighted.\r\n\r\n The tribe near the Ngorongoro crater is the Maasai tribe and they are allowed to herd their cattle inside the crater.The crater itself is apart of the Ngorongoro conservation area which was created in 1959. There are very many plants and vegetation from the rich volcanic soil and lots of water that runs down into the crater. The crater is only about 165 square miles and it holds about 30,000 animals all year round.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64kyzdt30ya"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.4091796875,-3.25020856165]}},{"properties":{"name":"Niagara Falls","description":"Posted by Tomthebomb313<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/niagara.jpg\">Niagara falls is divided into three big waterfalls on the Niagara river that separate Ontario from New York. One of the three falls is located on the Canadian side it is called horseshoe falls. The other two falls are located on the US side one named American falls and the smaller fall named bridal veil falls.\r\n\r\n All three falls were carved out and formed by glaciers from the last ice age. Horseshoe falls drop is about 173 feet down but it is 2,600 feet wide. American falls drop is only about 70 feet down before hitting a giant pile of rocks and it is 1060 feet wide.

It occupies about 3.5 million square miles of North africa. The deserts size can be compared to the contentinental US. To this day people and camels travel from oasis to oasis trading food ,water , and other goods.\r\n\r\n The surface of the Sahara is different there are not only san dunes but there is dry valleys, stone plateaus, gravel plains and salt flats. The average temperature is around 86 degrees F. During the heat of the day the temperatures can scorch a 122 degrees F while during the night it can creep into freezing temperatures.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64kyz6k51qg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[9.404296875,28.8446736808]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/97208","metadata":null,"contact_name":"tomthebomb313","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:tomthebomb313","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/97208","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=97208,platial:user=tomthebomb313","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48145}
