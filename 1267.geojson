This website provides a rundown of the key findings for this year’s survey. It is hoped that by addressing and understanding the attitudes of drivers, the results of this survey will help educate drivers and influence safer driving habits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n\nAutoVantage commissioned Prince Market Research, an independent research firm, to conduct a nationally representative telephone study with consumers in 25 major U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nThe survey was conducted between February 4 and March 23, 2008. A total of 2,512 interviews were completed, evenly distributed among the designated markets. Qualified respondents needed to be at least 21 years of age and drive at least 10 minutes during rush hour three or more days per week.\n\nThe survey consisted of 34 questions, and interviews averaged 6 – 8 minutes. No incentive was offered.\n\nThe margin of error is +/- 2%.\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"lon":{"max":-79.997459,"mean":-99.991586,"variance":448.372607992295,"stdev":21.174810695548,"min":-122.675629,"median":-93.264929},"rank":{"max":5,"mean":3.0,"variance":2.5,"stdev":1.58113883008419,"min":1,"median":3},"lat":{"max":47.60358,"mean":44.007417,"variance":8.7858442798825,"stdev":2.96409248841572,"min":40.43831,"median":44.979035}},"features":[{"properties":{"city":"Pittsburgh","lon":-79.997459,"rank":1,"id":"a631v6r0ggsl","lat":40.43831,"state":"PA"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.997459,40.43831]}},{"properties":{"city":"Portland","lon":-122.675629,"rank":2,"id":"a631v6ryn12n","lat":45.511795,"state":"OR"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675629,45.511795]}},{"properties":{"city":"Seattle","lon":-122.329454,"rank":3,"id":"a631v71uhyum","lat":47.60358,"state":"WA"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.329454,47.60358]}},{"properties":{"city":"Minneapolis","lon":-93.264929,"rank":4,"id":"a631v75f9sqr","lat":44.979035,"state":"MN"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.264929,44.979035]}},{"properties":{"city":"Cleveland","lon":-81.690459,"rank":5,"id":"a631v6vkkl99","lat":41.504365,"state":"OH"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.690459,41.504365]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"https://www.autovantage.com/global/scripts/promo.asp?ref=avAUTVANonlgs01","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"AutoVantage","contact_phone":""},"source":"https://www.autovantage.com/global/scripts/promo.asp?ref=avAUTVANonlgs01","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":5,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"car,cities,city,courteous,highway,road,rudest,transportation,travel,truck,vehicle","published":"2008-05-15T12:00:00Z","id":1267}
