(Colossians 1:3-7) Therefore, we place a high emphasis on the teaching of God\\'s Word that our Faith may grow. \"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" (Romans 10:17) Also, we live in anticipation of the return of Jesus, for He is our blessed Hope. \"Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.\" (Titus 2:13) Finally, we desire the fullness of His Spirit in our lives, for the fruit of the Spirit is Love. By our love shall all men know we are His disciples. \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

As a result George Bryson was asked to take a team from Calvary Chapel of Vista into Moscow, Russia to start the first Calvary Chapel of Russia. In less than two weeks, a short term mission team of 19 witnessed the birth of the first Calvary Chapel in Moscow and the beginning of what is now called Calvary Chapel Church Planting Mission. Initially CCCPM took church planting teams to Ukraine and Belarus as well as Russia but now focuses almost exclusively on Russia. God has truly opened a door for the gospel in Russia. Teams are leaving from various Calvary Chapel affiliates (as well as from what we call Calvary compatible churches) almost every month. The method and aim of this ministry is as simple as it is exciting. A group of short-term missionaries spend about ten days evangelizing the lost and discipling those that are saved from this evangelism. Another ministry team of mostly Russian nationals (now) stay behind to ensure that the newly formed church gets the pastoral and ministry care it needs to grow.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a08qgf4b0l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.619998,55.75]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gospel for Asia","description":"Posted by Gcuevas<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/img_aboutgfa_kp_2_.jpg\">Seoul, KoreaGFA\\'s mission is to be devout followers of Christ and to fulfill the Great Commission among the unreached in Asia through training, sending out and assisting qualified laborers in partnership with the Body of Christ.

GFA trains and sends native missionaries. Native missionaries have few or no cultural barriers to overcome. They can readily share the Gospel with those who, unlike their western counterparts, have never heard. While national workers do face difficult obstacles as they take the message from village to village, they still have an enormous advantage over their coworkers from North America and other non-Asian lands. GFA currently has 54 Bible colleges where nearly 9,000 students are preparing to become full-time church planters among those who have never heard. Currently, more than 27,000 churches and mission stations have been planted by GFA native missionaries where no church existed before.
