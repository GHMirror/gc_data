These forces were the British expeditionary forces, the French and Polish armies. They were evacuated by everything from fishing boats to cargo ships. Because Britain didnâ€™t have the amount of ships needed for the evacuation they had civilians volunteer to go and help. \r\n\r\nMany civilian vessals were forced to turn back because they were too small and were in danger of sinking. Think what could happen to day if the American People were behind our war effort in Iraq half as much as the British people were. We could make a huge difference in the outcome of the war.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m670xhxab0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.37270355225,51.031894768]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Alamein","description":"Posted by Bricefutch<img src=\"http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/alameinbattle9.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/wwiicairo1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.warlinks.com/equipment/5.5_alamein_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://houseofice.tripod.com/history/schrivenbach/images/shrive_binoc_rommel.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bchomesellers.com/ww2/wpics/63-rooikat_II_2_the_end.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bchomesellers.com/ww2/wpics/7-jakhalsII_02.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.ngatoa.com/e107_images/newspost_images/new_zealand_soldier_arch_currie_on_a_truck_el_alamein_egypt__photograph_taken_by_h_paton.ca_9_july_1942._da067252f_thumbnail.jpg\">El AlameinThe battle of El Alamein was a deciseve victory for the Allied armys. To set the stage here is a little background. Erwin Rommel was the commander of the Axis armies and had beaten the Allied armeis to pulp. Then the British replacerd there commander Feild Marshel Montgomery And the U.S. brought in Goerge S. Patton. Together the pushed Rommel back to the town of El Alamein. \r\n\r\nRommel knew that his only hope was to have a massive counter attack and split the armies in two. But the bigest enamy was supplys there were massive pipelines that connected fresh water and gas to camps and depo\\'s. This ws because of the sand and heat trucks and planes would need constant maintanence and would break down completly and would leave troops without water and veichals without gas. Remember this it will come in handy latter.\r\n\r\nIn every battle there is deception and counter deception and this is where the british had the upperhand. when ever troops would move or camps would move those pipes had to move also. The British had come up with aplane to decieve the Germans to move troops and open up there vonerable flank. The plane was to move miles of this pipelinein the opposite direction they were going to attack. This was very risky beacse it would mean very little suppleis for the attacking troops. \r\n\r\nThe gamble paid off and monty moved attacked the vonerable flank and trapped Rommel as to where he had to withdraw into the sea and escape by boat. This was the end of the Germans in Africa\r\n\r\nA side note Feild Marshel Bernard Montgomery is in the second picture seated 2nd row up 3rd seat down int the Bera with Metals on it.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m67124j8s7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.954309,30.82247]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hickam Feild","description":"Posted by Bricefutch<img src=\"http://z.about.com/d/gohawaii/1/0/I/O/pearlharbor30.gif\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Pearl_Harbor-_Nakajima_B5N2_over_Hickam-_80G178985.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/s100000/s176626.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.nps.gov/archive/usar/photos1/PR-201.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Hickam_Field.jpg/759px-Hickam_Field.jpg\"><img src=\"http://z.about.com/d/gohawaii/1/0/D/O/pearlharbor35.gif\"><img src=\"http://cache.viewimages.com/xc/3401060.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=BD2794AE0B3E23AD320E3D261AAF5DCEA55A1E4F32AD3138\">This is the Historic Feild In the area of Pearl Harbor were on December 7, 1941 was cripled by the Japenese attack on Pear Harbor. \r\nNearly all of the planes that were stationed here were destroyed on the ground and were not able to fiight back during the attack. Only about a Dozen fighter planes were able to respond and they were all destroyed shortley after. All of the ground crew fought as hard as they could to salvage aircraft so that they could respond but were not successful. \r\n\r\nBecause it was a Sunday all of the ammo was locked in side storage rooms. ground crew members had to bust locks off of doors because they could not get keys in time. This was the reason that there was a delayed response and the reason many planes and equipment was destroyed on the ground without resistence.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m6712mvs1o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.926235199,21.316242989]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hiroshima Japan","description":"Posted by Bricefutch<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Little_boy.jpg\"><img src=\"http://jnblog.typepad.com/provocations/images/Hiroshima.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/154810131_5b924b9eef_b_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.giornalisti.it/binarioloco/archives/Hiroshima_60_anni.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.lebenshaus-alb.de/magazin/media/img/hiroshima.5.jpg\">Hiroshima was the first time a nucular bomb was ever dropped against a enemy.

It was not the intent to kill civillians it was just mistaken identity. \r\n\r\nHo Chi Minh is now the largest city in Veitnam and is on the Mei Kong Delta which is a very essientel Harbour.

Which ever side controlled this city had a great influence on the people of the county. That is why North Veitnam wanted this city so badle.\r\n\r\nThe Tet is the Veitnamese new year and both sides had a cease fire agrement for that holiday however the N.V.C (North Veitnames) didnt honor the cease fire very long.This started the Tet Offinseive. The Tet offensive wwas a plane to hit the US where it hurt when they werent expecting this owever was not the case. They (N.V.C) faild misserable and the US wiped out almost half of there forces. But the N.V.C was able to tak Hue becuase the was only a light batallian of South Vietnamese troops there that were recouperating.\r\n\r\nThe US went into the city greatly outnumbered about 5-1 2,500 taking on 10,000 intreached enamy troops.

It was situated between Sword Beach and Gold Beach. \r\n\r\nIt is also known as the Canadian beach, as it was assigned to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division (with the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade). Juno Beach stretched from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer on the east to Courseulles-sur-Mer on the west. Both assault formations were placed under the command of I British Corps for the initial phase of the invasion, and did not come under Canadian command again until July 1944 and the establishment of II Canadian Corps headquarters in Normandy \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m670sfnh85"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.446304,49.3356]}},{"properties":{"name":"Omaha Beach","description":"Posted by Bricefutch<img src=\"http://www.sproe.com/images/screenshots/lifebelt-06-large.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.fashion-online.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/omaha-beach-robert-capa.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/cb/November2000/Iwasthere.gif\"><img src=\"http://unitedcats.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/dday_omaha.jpg\"><img src=\"http://sapiens.ya.com/sosilos/album/Hacia_Omaha.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.howitzer.dk/battlefield/battlefieldphoto/normandy/Bunker-Omaha.gif\"><img src=\"http://www.meridianmagazine.com/travel/images/dday4sm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.historyinfilm.com/ryan/images/beach3.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://www.abandofgamers.com/images/Normandy07-Day4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/3193/SITours/normandy-battlefields-tour-pointe-du-hoc-omaha-beach-and-the-american-in-bayeux-2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uscg.mil/history/gifs/Omaha_beach_low_tide.jpg\"><img src=\"http://web.mac.com/davedepickere/World_War_II,_analyzed!/Saving_Private_Ryan_files/shapeimage_3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://users.skynet.be/jeeper/beach61.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\">Â <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\">Â Omaha Beach, FranceThere were several elements to the invasion of Omaha beach. The first was the 2nd Ranger Battalion which had to take Point de Hoe. At this point was shere cliff whith Germans at the top and Six 155mm Howetsers. There mission was to climb the cliff and take out the guns before they could destroy the main assult forcelanding on the beach down the way. When they reached the top of the cliff and had taken out the Germans gaurding it (which was no walk in the park) they found that the guns were missing. They had been moved several hundred yards away but were latter found and destroyed before they coyuld do much damage.\r\n\r\nThe main force that land on the actual beach itself was none other than (The Big Red One as they we comonly known) the Ist Division. They were the guys that took Sicily and were in Italy. They came under stiff resistence and were pinned down for a long time but finally made a break through.

Sword Beach was based about nine miles to the north-east of the vital city of Caen and was less than ten miles from Gold Beach and four miles from the start of Juno Beach.\r\n\r\nSword Beach itself was about five miles across and the town of Ouistreham was all but in the middle of the target beach. The main prize of Caen was important because all the main roads in the region ran through the city and control of these was vital if the Allies were to successfully advance inland and to the east and west. Such was the importance of Caen, that the Germans were also prepared to fight for it â€“ ultimately to the cityâ€™s detriment.\r\n\r\nThe area around Sword Beach was lightly defended when compared to beaches such as Omaha. The Germans had oriented their main defence around artillery emplacements away from Sword. Five miles to the east of Sword was the Merville Battery where the Germans had placed 75-mm guns. Twenty miles further to the east at Le Harve were 155-mm guns. Eight miles inland of Sword were 88-mm guns. In terms of artillery, Sword could have taken a pounding and casualties could have been high. This, however, never happened.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m670vprf3c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.27009,49.291851]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tehran Iran","description":"Posted by Bricefutch<img src=\"http://www.patmedia.net/campos/us_history_2/world_war_ii/big_three.jpg\"><img src=\"http://en1.chinabroadcast.cn/mmsource/image/2005-4-29/Big-Three-Yalta.jpg\"><img src=\"http://teachpol.tcnj.edu/amer_pol_hist/fi/00000184.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.vw.vccs.edu/vwhansd/HIS122/Images/BigThree.jpg\">Tehran Iran was the first meeting place for The Big Three.
