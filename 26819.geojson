Because we believe a joint solution to these challenges is the best solution, our programs address all three of these issues simultaneously by building partnerships with, and providing resources and training to community groups, sustainable farmers and urban gardeners. The support we offer and the trainings we provide connect regional farmers with profitable markets and strengthen some of New York City’s most underserved neighborhoods by creating new economic opportunities, improving community health, and preserving urban green spaces. \n\nFor more information please visit us at www.justfood.org\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a685nlkq9scv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.970093,40.75636]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kensington / Windsor Terrace CSA","description":"Posted by Justfood1East 4th Street and Caton St., Brooklyn, NYDistribution day - Saturday<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a685nlmo1ivy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.977249,40.64762]}},{"properties":{"name":"L'Ecole","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farmaid.org\" href=\"http://www.farmaid.org\">Farmaid</a>462 Broadway, NYwww.frenchculinary.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a685nlpl85p1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.000631,40.720875]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Familia Verde Farmers' Market","description":"Posted by Justfood1E.

Owner Jonathan Rapp believes in promoting fresh and local and supporting local farms and brings this philosophy into the schools by donating his time periodically to cook healthy lunches. Plus, this summer, he partnered with Drew McLachlan of Feast Market launching Dinners at the Farm to help promote local farmers by creating mouthwatering farm fare from the back of a red, 1955 Ford, Flatbed, firetruck right on the grounds of a local farm in a festive and convivial setting.
