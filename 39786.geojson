He asks me to find some bike shops in or around Aurora, OH.  I provide three.  The only one IN Aurora is \"TUSS\" cycle (or so it sounded like TUSS when the 411 Operator said it.  I text the vitals to John\\'s phone.\n\nSo John calls the number of this \"Tuss Cycle\" place. Asks their location, they say just come down 82 (or whatever road it was) and continue 4 miles. We\\'re right there. John goes 4+ miles, sees nothing resembling a bike shop and calls back. You went the wrong way. Turn around. 8 miles later, John rolls up to Tuff Cycles, and sees Tank standing there. Tank wipes his hands and says \"oh, a bicycle. Come on in let\\'s have a look\".\n\nThey get in and the guys look it over. Sure enough. 7th gear is bent. \"Well, we can heat it up and put these clamps on it to try to straighten it out for you\". And so it was. Not sure how well it will hold up, but it\\'s straighter than it was.\n\nTank then shows him around the shop at the monster bikes he puts together. Top notch, real deal stuff here. Tank then says. \"Hey, you\\'ve been here 10 minutes now. You have to follow the rules\". \"What\\'s the rule\", John asked. \"You have to get yourself a beer\". So, he helped himself to a beer while they talked about bikes and BIKES, and one beer led to another. Tank gave him a quart of some awesome bike cleaner.\n\nI tried to email Tank, but the email bounced, so I called the shop and talked to Brenda. Told her to tell Tank thanks. She gave me an alternate email address so that I can send the email and a link to the progress map. Done.\n\nA good time was had by all.  John said \"This was the best mistake I ever made\".  Good way to end the day I guess.\n\nTuff Cycle\n1379 S.

Total Miles: 67. As of 1645 EDT John had made it to Norwalk, OH. In John\\'s own words, \"It was a bad day.\" Shortly after lunch John had a complete rear blow-out that was impossible to repair, so he was forced to start walking. To John\\'s everlasting good fortune, a person in a little red VW slowed down to ask if he need assistance. That is how John met Ron. Based on John\\'s description, Ron sounds like an interesting guy; if your thing happens to be 14th century pipe organs. No kidding; apparently Ron teaches at Oberlin College and his thing is pipe organs. He gave John a ride to a bicycle shop near Oberlin College, where John bought a new rear tire, and then he took John on a local sightseeing tour, which John accepted cheerfully because of Ron\\'s kindness. Ron dropped John off near Kipton where he resumed his westward travels; that is, until he reached Wakeman where, of course, he had another flat. After a quick repair John decided to stop in Norwalk and call it done for the day. John is planning on finding a local Wal-Mart where he can stock up on some bike supplies. The current plan for tomorrow is a best-effort ride with no particular destination. John is hoping that the roads will improve as he moves farther west. Besides the constant head-wind, it\\'s the mechanical breakdowns that have been the biggest cause of delays so far.
