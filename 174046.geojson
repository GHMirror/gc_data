Esta es una estrategia que forma parte de la fase de transición en que se encuentra el brote, considerada en el Plan Nacional de Respuesta para una Pandemia de Influenza que sigue los lineamientos de la Organización Mundial de la Salud.\nEl Ministerio de Salud llama a la personas de la Región Metropolitana, especialmente a las familias de los colegios afectados, a permanecer en sus casas si se encuentran con síntomas de infección respiratoria, tal como fiebre alta, dolores musculares, dolor de garganta, cefalea, secreción nasal, y a no viajar en estas condiciones.

Se trata de una ciudadana peruana de 27 años que arribó al país el sábado en la noche en un vuelo de la compañía LAN procedente de la ciudad de Nueva York.\n\nSegún informó Ugarte, la persona en cuestión no mostró ningún síntoma que delatara su estado al momento de su arribo. Sin embargo, el día domingo, al padecer los malestares que se describen en la cartilla que se reparte a los pasajeros que llegan al país, llamó al teléfono que el Ministerio de Salud tiene habilitado para estos casos. Personal de ese despacho acudió a su casa, donde se decidió aislarla del resto de sus familiares en su propio domicilio. Luego de practicarle los exámenes y pruebas correspondientes, se determinó que padecía la influenza AH1N1.\n\nUgarte señaló que desde que se presentara esta situación se ha procurado localizar a los demás pasajeros que bajaron con ella en Lima. También se informó a las autoridades sanitarias de Chile, hacia donde continuó el vuelo, sobre la situación presentada en Lima para que tomen las medidas del caso. Al respecto, la empresa LAN informó que los datos sobre el vuelo en que llegó la enferma y el número de pasajeros que descendieron en Lima está siendo alcanzado a las autoridades del Ministerio de Salud.\n\nSobre el estado de la enferma, el ministro comunicó que ha evolucionado favorablemente al tratamiento antiviral. Interrogado sobre por qué no fue trasladada a un hospital o zona de aislamiento especial, señaló que su estado no lo requería y que tal decisión era la más conveniente en este caso.\n\nTRATAMIENTO EN CASA\nSobre la decisión del Ministerio de Salud de aislar a la enferma en su propio domicilio, el gerente regional de Salud del Callao, José Carlos del Carmen, manifestó que obedece a un protocolo ya establecido por la OMS.\n\nSin embargo, Del Carmen precisó que fue la propia paciente quien, dos días después de su llegada al país y al sentir los síntomas típicos de una gripe, se acercó a una clínica local donde fue atendida y devuelta a su casa. Fue luego de esta visita, que personal del ministerio recién acudió a su domicilio, tomó las muestras correspondientes y ayer dio a conocer a la opinión pública los resultados. Personal del ministerio no pudo ser contactado para contrastar esta versión.\n\nDel Carmen también señaló que la situación actual no debe alarmar a la población ya que la persona contagiada es un caso de influenza importado (es decir que la persona se contagió fuera del país) y no local.\n\nHasta el día de ayer, el caso de la ciudadana argentina Alejandra Coche, que el 28 de abril fue obligada a bajar del avión que iba con destino a Argentina procedente de Panamá por mostrar preocupantes síntomas de gripe, había sido el único caso supuesto en el Perú de influenza AH1N1. Como se recordará, al día siguiente, un preocupado ministro de Salud daba la mala noticia al país, sin tener la total certeza de ello. El día 30 debió rectificarse y descartar que la pasajera argentina tuviese la temible gripe. “Falta un reactivo para ratificarlo”, declaró entonces.\n\nUgarte recalcó que el país cuenta con 106.180 tratamientos antivirales y que la población puede comunicarse al teléfono de Infosalud (0800-108-28) para cualquier consulta y orientación.
