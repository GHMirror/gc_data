After her death, Evita remained a formidable influence in Argentine politics.

In 1971 the military government, bowing to Peronist demands, turned over her remains to her exiled widower in Madrid. After Juan Peron died in office in 1974, his third wife, Isabel Peron, hoping to gain favour among the populace, repatriated the remains and installed them next to the deceased leader in a crypt in the presidential palace.

During her Cuban stay she had a strong influence on Cuban literature. Her first poems, originally published under the pseudonym of La Peregrina (The Pilgrim), were collected in 1841 into a volume entitled Poesias liricas (\"Lyrical Poems\"). Combining the classical style of Manuel Jose Quintana with her own romantic vision, tinged with a pessimism born of much personal suffering, these poems rank among the most poignant in all Spanish literature.

Pocahontas was a young girl of age 10 or 11 when she first became acquainted with the colonists who settled in the Chesapeake Bay area in 1607. Pocahontas became a frequent visitor to the settlement and a friend of Smith. Her playful nature made her a favourite, and her interest in the English proved valuable to them. She sometimes brought gifts of food from her father to relieve the hard-pressed settlers. She also saved the lives of John Smith and other colonists in a trading party in January 1609 by warning them of an ambush. After Smith\\'s return to England in late 1609, relations between the settlers and Powhatan deteriorated. The English informed Pocahontas that Smith had died. She did not return to the colony for the next four years. In the spring of 1613, however, Sir Samuel Argall took her prisoner. Treated with courtesy during her captivity, Pocahontas was converted to Christianity and was baptized Rebecca. She accepted a proposal of marriage from John Rolfe, a distinguished settler; both the Virginia governor, Sir Thomas Dale, and Chief Powhatan agreed to the marriage, which took place in April 1614. Following the marriage, peace prevailed between the English and the Indians as long as Powhatan lived.\nAlso called  Matoaka  and  Amonute , Christian name  Rebecca .

Her father, a leader of a peasant organization opposed to Guatemala\\'s military government, died in a fire while protesting human-rights abuses by the military. Her younger brother was kidnapped, tortured, and killed by a military death squad in 1979, and her mother was kidnapped, raped, mutilated, and murdered by soldiers the following year. Menchu fled to Mexico in 1981 and was cared for there by members of a liberal Roman Catholic group. She soon joined international efforts to make the Guatemalan government cease its brutal counterinsurgency campaigns against Indian peasants, becoming a skilled public speaker and organizer in the course of her efforts.\n\nMenchu gained international prominence in 1983 with her widely translated book I, Rigoberta Menchu, in which she tells the story of her impoverished youth and recounts in horrifying detail the torture-murders of her brother and mother. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 for her continuing efforts to achieve social justice and mutual reconciliation in Guatemala. In the late 1990s her autobiography became the centre of controversy after its veracity was questioned, most notably by David Stoll in Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans (1999). Despite alleged inaccuracies in her story, Menchu continued to earn praise for bringing international attention to the situation in Guatemala. In 2004 she accepted President Oscar Berger\\'s offer to help implement the country\\'s peace accords.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vjehevhyuo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.263672,14.944785]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rita Levi-Montalcini lived here","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.faqs.org/health/images/uchr_02_img0136.jpg\">Turin, ItalyNeurologist who, with biochemist Stanley Cohen, shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1986 for her discovery of a bodily substance that stimulates and influences the growth of nerve cells. \n\nBorn April 22, 1909, Turin, Italy.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vjeham9g8a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[7.679999,45.080001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rosa Parks didn't give up her seat","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.freedomforum.org/graphics/2001/05/photos/parks.rosa.6-15-99.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> montgomery, AlabamaAfrican American civil rights activist whose refusal to relinquish her seat on a public bus to a white man precipitated the 1955-56 Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama, which is recognized as the spark that ignited the U.S. civil rights movement.\n\nBorn February 4, 1913, Tuskegee, Alabama, U.S.,\ndied October 24, 2005, Detroit, Michigan<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vjehhwjmoq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.3,32.366667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sally Morgan Indigenous author lived here","description":"Posted by Greymantle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/03/1/Picture_36.png\">Perth, Australia\r\nProfessor Sally Morgan, indigenous author and artist lived here.\r\nRead \"My Place\" (1987)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vjeha88r3c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.839996,-31.959999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sirimavo R.D.

She left office in 1965 but returned to serve two more terms (1970-77, 1994-2000) as prime minister. The family she founded with her late husband, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, rose to great prominence in Sri Lankan politics. Bandaranaike carried on her husband\\'s program of socialist economic policies, neutrality in international relations, and the active encouragement of the Buddhist religion and of the Sinhalese language and culture. Her government nationalized various economic enterprises and enforced a law making Sinhalese the sole official language. By 1964 a deepening economic crisis and the SLFP\\'s coalition with the Marxist Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Ceylon Socialist Party) had eroded popular support for her government, which was resoundingly defeated in the general election of 1965. In 1970, however, her socialist coalition, the United Front, regained power, and as prime minister Bandaranaike pursued more radical policies. The failure to deal with ethnic rivalries and economic distress led, in the election of July 1977, to the SLFP\\'s retaining only 8 of the 168 seats in the National Assembly, and Bandaranaike was replaced as prime minister.\n\nIn 1980 the Sri Lanka parliament stripped Bandaranaike of her political rights and barred her from political office, but in 1986 President J.R. Jayawardene granted her a pardon that retored her rights. After regaining a seat in parliament in 1989 she became the leader of the opposition. Failing health forced Bandaranaike to resign her post in August 2000. Shortly after voting in the October parliamentary elections, she suffered a heart attack and died. \nIn full  Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike, \nborn April 17, 1916, Ratnapura, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)\ndied October 10, 2000, Colombo, Sri Lanka\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vjehcu3azm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[79.849998,6.929999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sojourner Truth lived in NYC","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/TRUTH/truth.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> New York, N.Y.African American evangelist and reformer who applied her religious fervour to the abolitionist and women\\'s rights movements. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vjeh983fnt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006567,40.751744]}},{"properties":{"name":"Su Boliou (My Mom)","description":"Posted by ShelleyAmity, OR<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vjehe4m9pu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.174402,45.115704]}},{"properties":{"name":"Susan B.
