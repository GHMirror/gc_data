The Agata Project\nhas abundant gold prospects and work has\nfocused on two major groups of gold\nshowings: the Lao and American Tunnels\nProspects. Strong gold in soil anomalies\nhave been defined over an area in excess of\n600 by 600 meters at the Lao Prospect,\nwhere gold mineralization occurs in\nlimestone and associated with\nintrusive/ultramafic contacts. A saprolite\n(soil) horizon was mined for gold by\nthousands of artisanal miners in the 1980’s\nand local miners (at the Assmicor Mine) are\nactively mining mixed oxide/sulphide ore\ndown to shallow depths of approximately\n30 meters using primitive methods. In\nproximity to the Assmicor Mine,\nmineralization occurs in altered intrusive\njust above the footwall ultramafic over a\ntrue width in excess of three meters.\nChannel samples along walls returned an\naverage of 5.2 g/t gold over the 86 meters\nof tunnel developed at the time of sampling.\nMay 1999 samples of the active mineworking\nnorth face returned an average of\n10.4 g/t gold over a true width of 2 meters\n(still open to the east). A sample from the\nsouth face returned a very high 29.9 g/t\nover 1 meter (also open to east). A small\nbulk sample (8 kilograms) from the mill\nreturned 10.3 g/t gold. Mineralization is\nopen along strike to the north and south, as\nwell as to the east in the hanging wall. The\nextent of possible surface enrichment and\ngeometry of mineralization are unknown at\nthis time. Of particular significance is the\nextent of alteration, gold soil anomalies and\nrock values in the adjacent limestones.

The regional geology consists\nof late Cretaceous to Mid-Miocene\nvolcanics, volcaniclastics and sedimentary\nrocks. The strata are intruded by Oligocene\nand post-Oligocene intrusives, and\nunconformably overlain by Pleistocene lava\nflows and pyroclastics.

These rocks are\ninterpreted as near surface epithermal\ndeposits of hot spring sinter and\nhydrothermal breccia. The breccia consists\nof 40-50% sulphides and 50% quartz. Of\nthe sulphides, the content of pyrite is about\n60%, 25% chalcopyrite, 15% covellite, and\ntraces of chalcocite. Petrologist Dr. Jane\nBarron suggests a probable overprinting of\na multiphase mineralization. The\noccurrence of low temperature cherty silica\n(epithermal environment) and the exsolved\nbornite in chalcopyrite (˜4750) strongly\nindicates a multiphase system. The sulphide\nrich quartz veins may represent the upper\nportions or ‘bleeding’ of a porphyry deposit\nat depth.

The deposit is\nlocated on the western flank of the Pacific,\nbetween two major splays of the Philippine\nFault System. Kingking, so far, is the most\nsoutherly of a group of gold and copper\ndeposits found along a 75-km long northnorthwest-\ntrending mineralized belt that\nincludes, among others, Hijo, Amacan and\nMasara mines and the bonanza-grade gold\nrush areas of Diwalwal farther north.\nCopper and gold mineralization along this\nbelt is generally associated with Miocene-age\ndiorite intrusives.\nMineralization in the Kingking deposit is\nhosted primarily by an elongate and\nN60°W-striking diorite intrusive complex.\nThe intruded country rock is composed\nmainly of highly folded Cretaceous -\nPaleogene tuffs, andesites and\nundifferentiated sedimentary units. Capping\nthe sulfide zone at the Kingking deposit is a\nthick oxide blanket, which probably formed\nthrough rapid uplift and subsequent erosion\nof the roof of the anticline which, coupled\nwith the characteristic low pyrite content of\nthe deposit, might have also prevented the\ndevelopment of a significant supergene\nsulfide enrichment blanket. Hypogene\nsulfide mineralization usually occurs as\nfracture fillings and, to a lesser extent, as\ndisseminations in the diorite porphyries and\nadjacent wallrocks. The main copperbearing\nminerals are chalcopyrite and\nbornite and occasional primary chalcocite.\nPyrite and magnetite are ubiquitous\nthroughout the deposit. Molybdenite\ncommonly occurs as fracture coatings and\nin quartz veins. Gold occurs as exsolution\nintergrowths in the sulfides particularly\nchalcopyrite. Hydrothermal alteration is\ntypical of island arc porphyry copper\nsystems except for unusually well developed\nbiotite and potassium feldspar zones and\nthe ubiquitous occurrence of epidote in all\nalteration types.

Tagpura\nwas the first copper orebody exploited by\nopen pit mining method from 1977 to 1981\nbut shifted to gold at Batoto Gold Project\nwhen copper operation was at a decline.\nThe oldest rock unit in the area is the\nmetavolcanics / volcanics sequence. It is\nunconformably overlain by slight crystalline\nlimestone. Diorite intrudes the\nmetavolcanics and limestone. Mineralization\noccurs as interlacing veinlets and\ndisseminations of pyrite, chalcopyrite in\nmetavolcanics / volcanics and diorite.\nExploration to date showed a newly\ndiscovered 65-meter wide gold “halo”\naround Tagpura having a grade of 1.2 g/ton\nAu. In addition, the exploration team\nrecently discovered a 55-meter thick goldrich\nskarn at 1.4 g/ton Au.\nOpen pit area\nSome 23,000 meters of drilling and 4,000\nmeters of underground development was\ncarried out by a previous operator in the\n1970's delineating about 80 million tonnes\nof mineralization grading about 0.4%\ncopper, 0.5 g/t gold and 5 g/t silver. As a\nresult of this work a 10,000 t/d operation\nwas placed into production in 1979 but\nclosed 18 months later reportedly because\nof high oil prices, low copper prices and\nexcessive bank debt. All the production came from the Tagpura\ndeposit which occurs in the southern sector\nof the belt. Some 30 million tonnes of waste\nand 10 million tonnes of copper-gold\nmineralization were mined and according to\nold records the highest copper resources\n(0.81% cu) found during drilling operations\nstill exist at the base of the current open cut.\nIn addition to the known deposits potential\nexists for substantial additions to the known\nresources by way of undrilled geophysical\nanomalies surrounding and beneath the\nlimits delineated by the drilling.\nA very large undrilled induced polarization\nanomaly exists south of the Tagpura deposit\nand based on the dimensions indicated by\nthe anomaly may represent a new major\nexploration target.
