As of Monday, nearly 500 cases had been reported in McHenry, DuPage and Lake counties in Illinois, the Chicago Tribune reported, but health officials say that cases are likely much higher due to many people who will go undiagnosed. Thirty to 40 new cases around the state are being reported each week. &amp;#8220;This is a vaccine-preventable illness,&amp;#8221; Debra Quackenbush, spokeswoman for the McHenry County Health Department, told ABCNews.com. &amp;#8220;Parents should make sure children are up-to-date on their vaccinations. If you have a cough that seems to linger and it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to go away, get it checked out by the doctor just to be sure.&amp;#8221; Quackenbush said 172 cases of whooping cough have been reported in McHenry County, Illinois, and she  expects that number to continue to grow. The number\r\nis a stark contrast to the nine cases that Quackenbush said the county recorded all of last year. If a person comes down with whooping cough, doctors will give the patient five days of antibiotics. Health officials encourage the entire family of the patient to go on antibiotics, as well. But more importantly, get vaccinated, they say. The counties have made the tDap vaccine, a shot that prevents diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, readily available to the public.\r\n\r\nQuackenbush said it&amp;#8217;s hard to say why the collar counties have been hit so hard this year, but it&amp;#8217;s likely a combination of factors. &amp;#8220;Some people aren&amp;#8217;t vaccinating their children,&amp;#8221; said Quackenbush. &amp;#8220;They try to skate by without vaccines, but what people don&amp;#8217;t realize is that, at the beginning of the 20th century, thousands of people died from this particular illness. These vaccines save thousands of lives.&amp;#8221; Nearly a dozen states recently passed laws that require parents to prove that their middle and high-school aged children received a whooping cough vaccination. The law was prompted by a whooping cough outbreak that killed 10 babies and sickened about 9,000 people last year in California. While people of all ages can come down with whooping cough, even if they&amp;#8217;ve been vaccinated, it&amp;#8217;s particularly dangerous for newborns&amp;#8217; systems because they don&amp;#8217;t have the immunity or vaccine to fight off the infection.\r\nStudies show that about 75 percent of newborns that come down with whooping cough get it from a family member. Eighty-three percent of all deaths from pertussis between 2004 and 2008 were in children less than 3 months old. Because of the high rate of whooping cough in young infants, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended that pregnant mothers get vaccinated with Tdap, a vaccine to protect against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. &amp;#8220;The mother then passes her antibodies to the baby before they are born, and this helps protect the baby against getting whooping cough prior to the time that the infant gets the first three doses of the vaccine,&amp;#8221; Dr. Jon Abramson, chair of the advisory committee on immunization practices of the CDC.\r\n\r\nLast week that found more parents have opted out of school vaccines for their kids. The reasons for declining vaccines varied. Some doubted the need for vaccines, others feared adverse effects and other parents said it&amp;#8217;s easier to check a box opting out of the shots, rather than go through the necessary paperwork and time. While many anti-vaccine activists argue that there is not enough sound research for vaccination advocacy, Dr. Mark Sawyer, a professor of pediatrics at University of California at San Diego, said that vaccines are actually the best studied medical intervention out there. Experts know more about the safety of vaccines than most available surgeries and medications because of the ability to track adverse effects of people who receive various vaccines. &amp;#8220;Those studies are going on all the time scanning for rare vaccine reactions,&amp;#8221; said Sawyer. &amp;#8220;By doing so, we now know that vaccines do not cause autism and they do not cause other serious\r\nproblems.

Vanguard gathered that the portion of the building on the premises of Saint Paul&amp;amp;#8217;s Anglican Primary School, Igborosun, collapsed at 10 a.m during class work. An eye-witness said the victims were later rushed to Badagry General Hospital, where they are being hospitalised for medical treatment. According to sources, some of the pupils had fractured limbs and injuries on their bodies. At press time, Vanguard gathered that three of the pupils were in critical conditions, while others were said to be doing well with minor injuries. The witness lamented that the building that collapsed was the only strong structure in the school compound. The incident, according to reports, threw the entire community into panic, as parents stormed the school in search of their wards. A man said: &amp;amp;#8221;The prevailing peace\r\nin the school was immediately gone, forcing many to run for dear life. Most parents who heard of the incident rushed to the school to ascertain the well-being of their wards. Many parents, who could not locate their wards, rushed to the Badagry General Hospital.&amp;amp;#8221; Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State Police Command, Mr. Samuel Jinadu, when contacted on phone, said he was yet to get the report from the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Badagry Division. However, confirming the report, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Aderemi Ibirogba, said: &amp;amp;#8220;Yes, the incident happened, but it was a portion of the fence that collapsed. Three pupils of the school got injured in the process.&amp;amp;#8221; He described the situation as unfortunate as the Yuletide session was getting closer, saying &amp;amp;#8220;we are on top of the unfortunate situation.

Vanguard gathered that the portion of the building on the premises of Saint Paul&amp;#8217;s Anglican Primary School, Igborosun, collapsed at 10 a.m during class work. An eye-witness said the victims were later rushed to Badagry General Hospital, where they are being hospitalised for medical treatment. According to sources, some of the pupils had fractured limbs and injuries on their bodies. At press time, Vanguard gathered that three of the pupils were in critical conditions, while others were said to be doing well with minor injuries. The witness lamented that the building that collapsed was the only strong structure in the school compound. The incident, according to reports, threw the entire community into panic, as parents stormed the school in search of their wards. A man said: &amp;#8221;The prevailing peace\r\nin the school was immediately gone, forcing many to run for dear life. Most parents who heard of the incident rushed to the school to ascertain the well-being of their wards. Many parents, who could not locate their wards, rushed to the Badagry General Hospital.&amp;#8221; Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State Police Command, Mr. Samuel Jinadu, when contacted on phone, said he was yet to get the report from the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Badagry Division. However, confirming the report, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Aderemi Ibirogba, said: &amp;#8220;Yes, the incident happened, but it was a portion of the fence that collapsed. Three pupils of the school got injured in the process.&amp;#8221; He described the situation as unfortunate as the Yuletide session was getting closer, saying &amp;#8220;we are on top of the unfortunate situation.

FDA issued a statement saying it has not and does not intend to take \"enforcement action against an individual who purchased and transported raw milk across state lines solely for his or her own personal consumption.\"  The raw milk protesters believe the FDA's statement \"leaves the door open for FDA to pursue farmers, buying clubs and individuals acting as 'distribution agents.' \"The Wisconsin to Chicago Raw Milk Freedom ride will challenge the FDA's use of force against raw milk distribution -- they are pointing out that the mothers transporting the milk will act as 'agents' on behalf of other mothers who cannot make the trip.\"  Raw milk advocates gained some support in Congress last month. Local food champion and small farmer Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-MN) wrote to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg questioning the agency's enforcement actions against raw milk producers who have distributed their dairy products across state lines.  Pingree said she believed the FDA's statement on individuals who purchase and transport is a \"step in the right direction\" but she \"continues to have concerns about some of the practices of the FDA.\"  \"For example, during tight budget times it appears that the Agency has chosen to commit scarce resources to activities like farm raids and what many believe to be overly zealous enforcement of the ban on the interstate sale of raw milk. When consumers increasingly want to know where their food comes from and that it's safe, why does the FDA choose to put so much energy into these enforcement activities aimed at small farmers?\" asked Pingree in the Nov. 18 letter.  \"It also doesn't make sense to me that, given the numerous food safety scares involving large-scale producers, resources are being diverted to prevent consumers from choosing the type of milk that they want to drink,\" she added.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatricians and the FDA deem raw milk a public health risk, pointing to a variety disease-causing pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria that can potentially contaminate raw dairy. According to FDA, between 1987 and 2010 there were 133 outbreaks, 2,659 illnesses, 269 hospitalizations, 3 deaths, 6 stillbirths and 2 miscarriages linked to raw milk and raw milk products.","description":"\r\n\r\n\r\nBCON Identification Number: 612029025\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the coattails of last month's protest at the Food and Drug Administration headquarters in Maryland, more raw milk-supporting moms are planning to defy the federal ban on distributing unpasterized milk across state lines by transporting 100 gallons from Wisconsin to Chicago on Friday.  \"What if Santa and his reindeer fly better with whole, unprocessed milk?,\" asked Kimberly Hartke, a publicist for the group, in a press email Monday. \"Lots of children (and even zoo animals) seem to do better with the farm fresh, white as snow beverage.

In a recently released summary of its progress, FDA disclosed that it has more than 100 of its own inspectors on the egg rule beat and that it has signed up 10 states that are providing additional expertise to get the job done. When the new egg rule took effect in July 2010 with the goal of preventing Salmonella Enteriditis (SE) in table eggs, FDA's register of large producers totaled 604. However, because of large farms that went out of business or cancelled their registrations, the list was cut by 87. Through the first three quarters of 2011, FDA has completed 41 \"comprehensive\" and 254 \"targeted\" inspections of shell egg production facilities. According to the agency, the only difference between the two types of inspections is that the targeted inspections do not include environmental sampling. With as many as 222 inspections left for the final quarter, which ends Dec. 31, it might seem like making the goal is a stretch. However, for the first time, FDA said it has inked contacts and off-loaded 136 inspections to Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. FDA is left with 86 inspections to make its year-end goal, easily within the reach of its own inspection teams that typically number three to five per inspection. And FDA inspectors sometimes team up with state personnel as well. FDA's contracts with the states are only for targeted inspections, meaning no environmental samples are sent off to labs unless conditions they observe merit testing. A state expanding to a comprehensive sample-taking inspection apparently requires sign-off by FDA's local district offices. In the 41 comprehensive inspections, FDA has taken 2,056 swabs for laboratory analysis for SE contamination. Only 52 swabs, part of 22 samples collected from 10 farms, showed results positive for SE. FDA says all farms with positive SE test results either were brought into compliance with the egg rule and implemented testing, or their eggs were diverted from the table egg market. The new egg rule had barely gone into effect last year when two Iowa egg farms -- both owned by agribusiness man \"Jack\" DeCoster -- became responsible for the largest recall of shell eggs in U.S. history---more than one half billion eggs. But after DeCoster was painted as rogue bad actor, several other top egg producers, including Rose Acre Farms and most recently Sparboe Farms, were found to be failing to meet egg rule requirements. McDonald's and Target stopped buying eggs from Sparboe for its treatment of chickens, and Chicago-based Mercy for Animals said it would complain about the egg producer making false statements about how it treats its poultry. In putting together its battle plan for the first time inspections under the new egg rule, FDA says it used an \"at risk\" approach to get to the 50 high risk farms first. It used risk criteria such as the number of laying hens, registration status, and past history of recalls, outbreaks, and even consumer complaints. Most of the comprehensive inspections requiring environmental sampling have already been completed. \"Significant deviations\" from the rule found during the first 295 inspections included: - Lack of written SE prevention plan or significant requirements of that plan. - Failure to environmentally test for SE during required time period. - Failure to divert eggs or begin egg testing after a positive environmental sample. - Failure to implement the SE prevention plan. - Failure to maintain required records - Failure to monitor conditions required for the implementation of the plan. Apparently, from counting work done in 2010, FDA went into the final quarter claiming to have inspected more than 300 table egg producers and completed 82 comprehensive inspections. From May 1 to Nov. 30, 2010, at least 1,939 people were infected with Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) from the contaminated eggs from DeCoster's farms in Iowa. Many sued the egg producer and just as settlements were being reached last month, it was reported that DeCoster is getting out of the business. Centrum Valley Farms is leasing the Iowa farms, and Land O'Lakes is taking over DeCoster's Maine operations. In both cases, DeCoster and his son, Peter, reportedly are out of any management role in the businesses taking over the egg production in the two states. DeCoster, a native of the Maine town of Turner, was left with 100 laying hens when his father died and grew them into a chicken empire.","description":"\r\n\r\n\r\nBCON Identification Number: 612034415\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is going to require a big finish, but it apparently remains on target to complete new egg rule inspections of all 517 American egg producers with 50,000 or more laying hens by Dec. 31.
