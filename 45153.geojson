With many of its fine Georgian buildings lovingly maintained and a vibrant cultural community the city has an energy all its own.\n\nHoused in a landmark heritage building, in the main drag of North Hobart often referred to as the Lygon Street is the very stylish and contemporary 70 seat restaurant of Fish 349.\n\nThe fit out is minimalistic, made up of hard-edged stainless steel, glass, and concrete, soaring ceiling, open kitchen, simple, clean lines of black in the tables, window benches and a large abstract mural.\n\nThe restaurant serves local seafood, great fish and chips and gelati. The suits take lunch and talk business here. Families elbow the suits at dinner time and take in the action both inside and outside on the street, through the full length windows.\n\nTasmanian wines and beers have been selected to compliment Fish 349 meals.\n\nThis lively spot is becoming a must-visit for locals and tourists. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fz6ixo73r2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[147.31561,-42.87313]}},{"properties":{"name":"Juiced Up","description":"Posted by Zygo99Juice Bar<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fz6imx2w41"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[147.31514,-42.87263]}},{"properties":{"name":"POST OFFICE","description":"Posted by Zygo99http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/heritage/photodb/imagesearch.pl?proc=detail;barcode_no=rt41637<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fz6j090tha"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[147.31428,-42.87222]}},{"properties":{"name":"POST OFFICE","description":"Posted by Zygo99<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fz6ire3p7b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[147.31428,-42.87222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Queens Head Hotel and Bar","description":"Posted by Zygo99<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> http://www.northhobart.com/queenshead/\n\nQueens Head Cafe &amp; Wine Bar\n400 Elizabeth St.,\nNorth Hobart 7002\nTasmania<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fz6iy75lkc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[147.31487,-42.8729]}},{"properties":{"name":"Republic Bar","description":"Posted by Zygo99\nhttp://www.republicbar.com/\n\nOne of the most popular Pubs in Tasmania.
