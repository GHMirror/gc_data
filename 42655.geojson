Encouraged by the prospect of support and funding, a national competition was organized to select the best ideas. Arts Council activists Barbara Luecke, Roger Wheeler, Peter Beavis, Peter Toms and Denise Fogelman juried the field down to five finalists who were then commissioned to create models that would be voted on by the community at the Fremont Fair.\r\n\r\nThe Troll created by a team led by sculptor Steve Badanes was voted the overwhelming favorite. A city matching grant was successful in funding the project. Thus, the Fremont Troll came to be. Made from rebar steel, wire and 2 tons of messy ferroconcrete, the Troll monument took about 7 weeks to complete.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mdghbu35sz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.3473,47.65099]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gas Works Park","description":"Posted by Pakio<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 2101 N Northlake WayPark, View<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mdghjvwoft"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.333935,47.646881]}},{"properties":{"name":"Library tour","description":"Posted by Pakio1000 Fourth Ave., Seattle, WA 98104Liprary Tour Free<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mdghnhsmxh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.332875,47.606145]}},{"properties":{"name":"Uwajimaya","description":"Posted by Pakio600 5th Avenue South, Seattle, WAChina Town, Shopping<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mdghi1bilu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.327674,47.59743]}},{"properties":{"name":"Uwajimaya","description":"Posted by Pakio600 5th Ave SouthShopping, China Town<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mdghgnxcx5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.641705,27.765636]}},{"properties":{"name":"View point","description":"Posted by Pakio12th Ave. S and S Forest St.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mdghnkp643"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.317398,47.577771]}},{"properties":{"name":"Volunteer Park Conservatory","description":"Posted by Pakio<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 1400 E.
