Eight years ago, Comstock settled in Philadelphia and found a space in which to open his facility.\n\n“With my background in live sound, we do a good amount of radio and television broadcast recording, which is the mainstay of our business,” comments Comstock. “Our main tracking room is definitely the biggest space for this type of live sound event here in Philadelphia. We are able to accommodate about 200 people in addition to the stage area. The Aviom system is a great piece of equipment: it distributes audio to individual band members and performers on stage, giving each their own personal mix and eliminating latency issues with the house speakers.”\n\nLocated in an old root beer bottling plant, the studio boasts a 4,2000 square-foot main tracking room with a tall, vaulted. Upstairs, adjacent to the tracking room, is a 600 square-foot control room. The studio is equipped with Aviom’s Personal Monitor Mixing System, an AN-16/i, an AN-16/o, an SSL 4048, a ProTools | HD System, a RADAR 24 recorder and many pieces of vintage outboard gear.\n\nCourtesy Mix Magazine Online\nhttp://mixonline.com/news/headline/Indre-Studios-Aviom-103044/index.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ckur0wl5u8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.158657,39.931633]}},{"properties":{"name":"John Gerich's","description":"Posted by Learly9918255 Denby, Redford, MI 48240<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ckur3dj81w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.310037,42.421205]}},{"properties":{"name":"Krypton Document Solutions","description":"Posted by Learly99 20300 Superior Rd., Taylor, mi<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ckur7412p4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.229976,42.211387]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mike Forte Studios (Alpha International Recording - Philly World)","description":"Posted by Learly99<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/R_150_30086_001_2_.jpg\">2001 Moyamensing Avenue, Philadelphia, PaDuring its incarnation as Alpha Internaional (1977-1988), the label Philly World also operated out of this location.

In the seventies, the City of Brotherly Love was the first and last word in soul, due to the silky, emotionally-pitched epics that flowed like water from the imagination of the so-called Philadelphia Sound crew -- writer/producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff and arranger Thom Bell. The centrally-located studio was every bit the principle player in this unfolding chapter of music history.\n\nGamble, Huff and the rest worked with a veritable who\\'s who of seventies rhythm and blues. Their very own Philadelphia International Records label was responsible for the careers of hitmakers like the Delfonics, the Intruders, the Stylistics, the O\\'Jays, and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes; they also lent their distinctive touch to recordings by Jerry Butler, Dusty Springfield, and Wilson Pickett, among others. Sigma Sound became a chief destination for rockers looking to a put a little bit of funk in their sound, most famously David Bowie for the \\'Young Americans\\' album. Sigma Sound also proved itself more than capable of recording pop artists like Elton John and Billy Joel.\n\nAnd while Philadelphia is no longer the music capital of the world, the studio, despite having changed hands, remains a popular destination for acts looking for top-notch professionalism and possibly a little bit of that Philly magic. -- Nathaniel Friedman <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ckur2bosu7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.159007,39.955925]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sigma Sound / Philadelphia International Records 309 Studio","description":"Posted by Learly99<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/Philadelphia_Intl.jpg\">309 South Broad , Philadelphia, paThe Sound of Philadelphia\n\nJust as Motown and Stax were closely associated with a specific sound from a specific city (Detroit and Memphis) in the 1960s, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff created \"The Sound Of Philadelphia\" in the 1970s, catapulting Philadelphia International Records (PIR) to worldwide fame.\n\nKenneth Gamble (born 1943 in Philadelphia) was a background singer and lyricist who first met Leon Huff (born 1942 in Camden, NJ) in 1962 at Philadelphia’s Shubert Theatre. They complimented each other as songwriter and pianist. Eventually, Gamble and Huff became members of a local band, the Romeos, along with Thom Bell, who later became a famous songwriter and producer.\n\nKenny Gamble and Leon Huff collaborated on a number of earlier R&amp;B songs, but the pop hits did not arrive until 1966 with the Intruders and Soul Survivors\\' We\\'ll Be United, Together, Cowboys To Girls, and Expressway To Your Heart among others. They also wrote and produced Atlantic hits for Archie Bell &amp; the Drells and Wilson Pickett. But most of all, they were instrumental in reviving the career of ex-VeeJay singer, Jerry Butler in 1967 with hits like Only The Strong Survive, What\\'s The Use Of Breaking Up and Hey Western Union Man on the Mercury record label. These Jerry Butler records really set the scene for what was to come: silk voices singing in high register, a tight rhythm section and lush string arrangements. Gamble got the entrepreneurial bug and started his own record company in 1967, but it folded due to distribution and collection issues common to small record labels. He next tried his hand co-founding Neptune Records with Huff in 1969. Wiser from the first experience he signed a national distribution deal with Chess Records.\n\nIn 1969, the Neptune label was founded and distributed through Chess Records. Although Neptune released only 4 albums, it marked the starting point for Gamble and Huff\\'s collaboration. Upon recommendation by the Intruders, they also brought in the O\\'Jays. And in 1970, Thom Bell joined the label as an arranger, writer, producer and musician. By 1971, Chess Records involvement with Soul Music declined, so Gamble and Huff signed a national distribution, music catalog and financial deal with CBS Records, then changed the company name to Philadelphia International Records (PIR). Though no longer an independent record label, with distribution and financial issues behind them, PIR was now free to go in the positive message artistic directions it desired. \n\nIn the 1970s, Gamble and Huff puzzled together dance rhythms, orchestral arrangements, and positive topical lyrics that established a musical signature having sophisticated soulful orchestration. It was lovingly called, The Sound Of Philadelphia. Recording most of The Sound Of Philadelphia at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, PIR was finally prepared for lift-off.\n\nThe O\\'Jays finally hit it big in 1972 with Back Stabbers. The O\\'Jays continued rolling out the hits with Love Train and For the Love of Money in the 1970s. Other prominent acts on the PIR label were Billy Paul (Me and Mrs Jones) and Harold Melvin And The Blue Notes (If You Don\\'t Know Me By Now and The Love I Lost), Blue Magic, The Spinners, Jean Carn, The Spinners (Could it Be That I\\'m Falling in Love), Stylistics (Betcha by Golly, Wow) and Delfonics (Didn\\'t I Blow Your Mind This Time). Philadelphia International Records soon became a force in the Soul Music market and even drew praise from musical rivals.\n\nAs PIR rolled out the hits, Stax Records imploded and Motown\\'s record identity tarnished a bit after moving from Detroit to LA. Soon it became easier for PIR to attract top artists like The Jacksons, Jerry Butler, Lou Rawls and Phyllis Hyman. They nearly signed the Temptations after they left Motown in 1976.\n\nAble to anticipate market trends, PIR helped create the disco craze when it introduced The Hustle by Van McCoy in 1974. They also had good karma. Producer and songwriter Richard Barrett is credited with bringing the Three Degrees to PIR in 1973. A short time later, Don Cornelius, producer and host of Soul Train asked the Three Degrees to do vocals for the show\\'s new theme track, with instrumentals by MFSB. Thus, The Sound Of Philadelphia) became a huge disco hit in 1974 and known the world over as Soul Train\\'s theme song.\n\nStorm clouds came their way. In 1975, charges were brought against Huff for offering Payola in exchange for airplay. The charges were dropped in 1976, but Gamble was fined ,500 in related matters, which tarnished the record company\\'s reputation. It’s unclear why they were singled out, particularly since Payola, often non-monetary, was common in the industry. Then in 1982, mega-star sex symbol Teddy Pendergrass smashed his car into a highway divider, paralyzing him from the waist down and body slamming his recording career.\n\nThere was a bit of good news. In 1983 Patti LaBelle released the I\\'m in Love Again album and it reached gold status. Unfortunately, it was the last PIR album to reach gold.\n\nBy 1985, the hits ebbed and Philadelphia International Records switched its distribution to Manhattan (a Capitol subsidiary). Still struggling to get more radio airtime, publicity and record store shelf space, they switched to BMG in 1991 -- again without much success. The 1990s were not kind to most record labels, so no one should be surprised at the difficulties PIR encountered.\n\nThe prominence of PIR was usurped by a new generation of record labels. Nevertheless, PIR set benchmarks for community relations and style as Gamble and Huff maintained a Philadelphia record label rather than move to LA or New York. Gamble-Huff Music, the successor company to PIR, has a well-earned place on Philadelphia’s Avenue of the Arts and Philly loves them back. The renowned Philadanco Dance Company recently presented a new work set to vintage music from Philadelphia International Records. \n\nCourtesy Soulofamerica.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ckuqzxp9ve"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.166967,39.937188]}},{"properties":{"name":"TechTown","description":"Posted by Learly99440 Burroughs, detroit,mi<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ckuqw5v7jn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.072802,42.364897]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tera Shirma","description":"Posted by Learly99<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/22_oldStudioB.jpg\">15305 Livernois, detroit,mi<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ckuqzsmqv9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.140529,42.403361]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Electric Factory","description":"Posted by Learly992201 Arch Street Philadelphia,paHerb and Jerry Spivak-owned/Larry Magid-booked Electric Factory, 2201 Arch, from \\'68 to \\'70.
