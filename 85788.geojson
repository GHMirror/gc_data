The issues are complex, the stakeholders are many, and the progress has been slow for a variety of reasons. Fundamental to most of these issues are the people; the plans and planning efforts; and the projects that are invested into to address specific requirements and needs. Based on their combined experience over the past 6 years, the states and urban areas of the All Hazards Consortium have adopted a new “integrated planning and coordinated investment ” approach designed to integrate the private sector owner/operators into the planning and project development efforts with some of the regional states/UASIs and the federal partners. The 2nd Annual Regional Urban Areas Security Initiatives &amp; Planning Workshop will be the first workshop under the AHC’s new strategy.","link":"http://www.koniaggeospatial.com/2011/02/urban-areas-security-initiative-workshop/","id":"a677v4nnomu4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.1723667,40.735657]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.koniaggeospatial.com/?p=117","title":"Public Health Preparedness Summit","published":{"end_time":"2011/02/09 16:34:04 -0500","original":"Wed, 09 Feb 2011 21:34:03 +0000","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/02/09 16:34:03 -0500"},"description":"The National Health Security Strategy: Building A Resilient Nation","link":"http://www.koniaggeospatial.com/2011/02/public-health-preparedness-summit/","id":"a677v4h7ak6q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.3879824,33.7489954]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.koniaggeospatial.com/?p=47","title":"ESRI Federal User Group Meeting","published":{"end_time":"2011/01/18 20:04:03 -0500","original":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 01:04:02 +0000","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/01/18 20:04:02 -0500"},"description":"From the ESRI Website: Join us for the largest gathering of federal geospatial leaders, decision makers, and geographic information system (GIS) professionals.
