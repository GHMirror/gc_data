The Diversity Index shows the likelihood that two persons chosen at random from the same area, belong to different race or ethnic groups. The index ranges from 0 (no diversity) to 100 (complete diversity). The diversity score for the entire United States in 2010 is 60. This data variable is included in Esri’s Updated Demographics (2010/2015).\n\nDiversity in the U.S. population is increasing. The states with the most diverse populations are California, Hawaii, and New Mexico.\n\nThe map is designed to be displayed with a 30–50 percent semi-transparency for overlay on other basemaps as noted in the map legend. A basemap with relatively few colors, such as the World Terrain Base, works well with this map when transparency is used.\n\nThe geography depicts States at greater than 25m scale, Counties at 1m to 25m scale, Census Tracts at 250k to 1m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 250k scale.\n\nEsri's Updated Demographics (2010/2015) – Population, age, income, sex, and race are among the variables included in the database. Each year, Esri's data development team employs its proven methodologies to update more than 2,000 demographic variables for a variety of geographies. See Updated Demographics for more information. \n\nScale Range: 1:591,657,528 down to 1:72,224\n\nCoordinate System: Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere (WKID 102100)\n\nTiling Scheme: Google Maps/Bing Maps \n\nMap Service Name: USA_Diversity_Index\n\nPublication Date: December 2010\n\nUpdate Frequency: Once per year","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=36c30e3d9f00443389a5fe3312fa5a8d","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"ArcGIS.com","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=36c30e3d9f00443389a5fe3312fa5a8d","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"block,bureau,census,cloud,commerce,counties,demographics,department,diversity,doc,ethnic,federal,groups,national,of,population,race,racial,states,tracts,us,usa","published":"2010-12-16T17:00:00Z","id":90185}
