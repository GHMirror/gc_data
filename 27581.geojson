The band of Metis had set out from the Portage trail (Avenue) at \"the creek east of Silver Heights\" (Omand\\'s Creek?), cutting north-easterly across the prairie  toward the Kildonan settlements along the Red River. The Scottish men saw their party from Fort Douglas, and rode north to intercept them.  \n\nBelow is an account of the day\\'s events by a survivor of the Scotch side, John Pritchard. While we do not know how accurate or impartial his account may be, it still stands as an important piece of the history of this province, and indeed this country. \n\n\"On the afternoon of the 19th of June, 1816, a man in the watch-house called out that the half-breeds were coming. The governor, some other gentlemen and myself looked through spy-glasses, and I distinctly saw some armed people on horseback passing along the plains. A man then called out: \\'They (meaning the half-breeds) are making for the settlers, \\'on which the governor said: We must go out and meet those people; let twenty men follow me.\\' We proceeded along the old road leading down the settlement. As we were going along we met many of the settlers running to the fort crying. \\'The half-breeds! the half-breeds!\\' When we were advanced about three-quarters of a mile along the settlement we saw some people on horseback behind a point of woods. On our nearer approach the party seemed to be more numerous, on which the governor made a halt and sent for a field-piece, which delaying to arrive, he ordered us to advance. We had not proceeded far before the half-breeds with their faces painted in the most hideous manner, and in the dresses of Indian warriors, came forward and surrounded us in the form of a half moon. We then extended our line and moved more into the open plain, and as they advanced we retreated a few steps backward and then saw a Canadian named Boucher ride up to us waving his hand and calling out, \"What do, you want?\" The governor replied, \"What do you want\\'?\" To which Boucher answered, \"We want our fort.\" The governor said, \"Go to your fort.\" They were by this time near each other, and consequently spoke too low for me to hear. Being at some little distance to the right of the governor, I saw him take hold of Boucher\\'s gun, and almost immediately a general discharge of firearms took place, but whether it began on our side or that of the enemy, at was impossible to distinguish. My attention was then directed to my personal defence. In a few minutes almost all our people were either killed or wounded.\n\nCaptain Rogers, having fallen, rose up and came towards me, when, not seeing one of our party who was not either killed or disabled, I called out to him, \\'For God\\'s sake give yourself up!\\' He ran towards the enemy for that purpose, myself following him. He raised up his hands and, and in English and broken French, called for mercy. A half-breed (son of Col. Wm. McKay) shot him through the head, and another cut open his belly with a knife with the most horrid imprecations. Fortunately for me, a Canadian, named Lavigne, joining his entreaties to mine, saved me (though with the greatest difficulty) from sharing the fate of my friend at that moment. After this I was reserved from death, in the most providental manner, no less than six different times on my way to and at Frog Plain, the headquarters of these cruel murderers. With the exception of myself, no quarter was given to any of us. The knife, axe or ball, put a period to the existence of the wounded; and on the bodies of the dead were practised all those barbarities which characterize the inhuman heart of the savage. The amiable and mild Mr. Semple, lying on his side his thigh having been broken) and supporting his head upon his hand, addressed the commander of our enemies, by inquiring if he was Mr. Grant; and being answered in the affirmative, \\'I am not mortally wounded,\\' said Mr. Semple; \\'and if you get me conveyed to the fort, I think I should live.\\' Grant promised he would do so, and immediately left him in the care of a Canadian, who afterwards told that an Indian of their party had shot Mr. Semple in the breast. I entreated Grant to procure me the watch, or even the seals, of Mr. Semple, for the purpose of transmitting them to his friends, but I did not succeed. Our force amounted to 28 persons, of whom 21 were killed and one wounded.\"\n\nHistory tells that on the day after the battle, Chief Peguis and his men took the bodies of the men killed, and carried them back to Fort Douglas and buried them along the banks of Logan\\'s Creek.\n\nThe battle took place near the site indicated.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6asov08glj6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.11736,49.930561]}},{"properties":{"name":"Biggs Terrace","description":"Posted by Rgalston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/dfb49b6c066a8f4a0596fa52e163249c.jpg\">Located at 139-161 James St., the Biggs Terrace is a fine example of the evisceration of the the South Point Douglas neighborhood, and the decline of nearby Main Street, beginning in the mid 20th century.

This photo was taken one year later, in 1948.

Unfortunately, by the time the taller buildings came, architecture was governed by Modernist dogma: Rather than a building being part of a whole which creates a block, a space, and a city, each building was an entity of itself which stand-alone and has no use for neighbors. \n\nAnd so, the Childs --like the rest of this corner of Portage and Main-- was demolished in the 1980\\'s to make way for the TD tower. \n\nAccording to one report, the steel piles driven into the ground to support the Childs Building still sit there today; so strongly built into the earth that demolition crews gave up trying to get them out.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6asouszqtew"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.139332,49.895491]}},{"properties":{"name":"City Loan Office","description":"Posted by Rgalston<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6asoulu3upb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.13466,49.90357]}},{"properties":{"name":"Clint's Cafe","description":"Posted by Rgalston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/efbe0a1dc581570838c0cfcdffbb9eb7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> A remarkably preserved 1950\\'s decor at this Main Street lunch counter.

This would be the first western expansion of the Timothy Eaton\\'s department store empire. When it opened a year later, Eaton\\'s store changed the course of downtown development; shifting retail away from Main Street, and to Portage Avenue. \n\nThe T. Eaton company became an important institution in Winnipeg, and thier store on Portage was hugely popular with shoppers until well into the 1970\\'s. However, the gradual de-urbanization of Winnipeg which began after World War II, caught up to the old department store, and traffic, sales, and active floor space declined. \n\nMeanwhile, the company as a whole began to run into financial difficulties and finally went out of business in 1999, and the lights at the department store that defined Portage Avenue finally went out for the last time.\n\nThe store sat vacant for three years, until it was demolished (despite valliant and credible efforts to save it) to make way for an arena, the MTS Centre. While the MTS Centre has proven to be successful in its own right, it has thus far failed to uplift the ever-declining Portage Avenue, which lost a defining physical presence in the Eaton\\'s store.\n\nIn defence of the demoltion, the argument is often made that the store would still be standing vacant today were it not for the MTS Centre.

It\\'s construction in 1862 is by many, considered the symbollic beginning of the future city of Winnipeg. \n\nHenry McKenney was an American merchant who came to the Red River Settlement in 1859. He opened the first hotel in Manitoba, The Royal Hotel, in a building near the foot of present-day Bannatyne Ave which he purchased from Andrew McDermot. \n\nAt the time, Main St was a trail that linked Upper Fort Garry and the Pembina landing at The Forks, to Lower Fort Garry near the present-day town of Selkirk. Portage Ave was a trail that to present-day Portage la Prarie and points further west. Coming to the settlement, the Portage trail forked into two at around today\\'s Portage and Carlton intersection: one bending to the east to The Forks, the second continuing to jog north-easterly to private enterprises of Mc Dermot, Bannatyne, Ross, Logan, etc. \n\nWhere the latter met the Main road, McKenney realized potential for commercial viability; selling the Royal Hotel and building a new house where the two trails met. \n\nFew others saw what McKenney saw, and could not understand why he wanted to build what was a swampy plain removed from current commercial activity. However, property values around McKenney\\'s shot up, and within two years, several other estableshments had opened up around him, forming the nucleus of the village of called Winnipeg. \n\nMcKenney sold the in the late 1860\\'s, and it operated as a hardware store under various proprieters until 1887, when it was demolished.\n\n\nMcKenney\\'s store is on the left of this photo, taken in 1870, with the \"L.R.
