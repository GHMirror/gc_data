One night, Bojan's wife walked off into a blizzard, never to return -- leaving Bojan to drink too much to quiet his ghosts, and to care for his theer-year-old daughter Sonja alone. Thirty-five years later, Sonja returns to Tasmania and a father haunted by memories of the European war and other, more recent horrors. As the shadows of the past begin to intrude ever more forcefully into the present, Sonja's empty life and her father's living death are to change forever. The Sound of One Hand Clapping is about the barbarism of an old world left behind, about the harshness of a new country, and the destiny of those in a land beyond hope who seek to redeem themselves through love.\"<img src=\"http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/bookcovers/onehand.jpg\"> \r\nIn the novel, Sonja Buloh's impression of Hobart is:\r\n\r\n\"Sonja remembered the place as possessed of a certain violence of emotion. The wind cuffed the house with sudden wild blows, the rain fell upon their tin roof with the intensity of an avalanche, and afterwards the sun shone so bright she screwed her eyes up every time she went outside, where the steam rose from the hot blue-black bitumen yard in splendid vents between her toes. She would visit that place now, of course she would—that little hut in a backyard of a northern-suburbs home in Hobart, in which they spent that whole lifetime before this lifetime—she would, were it not that it would be disenchanting\" (Flanagan, 1997: 16) ","id":"a621qqwubrpv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[147.256622,-42.834061]}},{"properties":{"PlaceName":null,"name":"Manganinnie: Central Highlands","description":"Manganinnie (Beth Roberts, 1979)The story follows the journey of a young white girl (Joanna) and an Aboriginal woman (Manganinnie) from Tasmania's central highlands toward the west coast.","id":"a621qr74je16"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.116791,-42.116562]}},{"properties":{"PlaceName":null,"name":"Manganinnie: Central Highlands Lake District","description":"Manganinnie (John Honey 1980) was set and shot in Tasmania's central highlands Lake District as the two protagonists, the lost white child Joanna and her Aboriginal guide Manganinnie, journey toward the west coast and Joanna's home.

[…] In those cowering corrals of huts had to live the workers, for in this remote highland country of the remote island of Tasmania that lay far off the remote land of Australia, there was no other human settlement for many miles. There were just wild rivers and wilder mountain ranges and everywhere rainforest that only ceded its reign over the land to the intermittent buttongrass plains, or in the higher altitudes to alpine moorland\" (Flanagan, 1997: 4-5)\r\nLater, in 1989, her daughter Sonja Buloh visits Butler's Gorge:\r\n\r\n\"She drove along the road through the broken bush that arises after logging and fire until she came over a crest beyond which she saw the top of a dam giving way to an expanse of water so vast that it appeared an ocean. She halted, looking out past the wave-torn waters, to where rainforest and morrland and snow capped mountains merged into a single wild land stretching away as far as the eye could see. That land did not welcome her or care for her, any more than it had welcomed or cared for her parents who had come to livee here so long before. And yet this land had shaped her, shaped them all.
