Gian Paolo Guarraci said he spotted the UFO on Friday while driving home from the restaurant, located in Sicily\\'s Valley of the Temples, Italy\\'s ANSA news agency reported Tuesday. \"It was a huge object, sending out a shimmering light of different colors from its core,\" Guarraci said. \"It appeared to be pulsating.\" \"I rushed home and got my video camera. As it turned out, I needn\\'t have hurried -- it hovered in the sky for about two hours,\" he said. Guarraci said he gave a copy of his video to a local TV station that plans to air the footage. Italian UFO expert Antonio Vanadia said the object did not appear to be the result of natural phenomena. \"This is an extraordinary piece of footage. I believe we have what experts call a close encounter of the first kind,\" he said. A spokesman for Sicily\\'s UFO Center said the organization plans to view the tape sometime in the near future. A spokesman for the center said Sicily is a popular attraction for UFOs. \"There were 30 strange sightings in 2005 alone,\" the spokesman said.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi324tq6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.56738,41.87194]}},{"properties":{"name":"0009 walk - starting point","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://dje.typepad.com/photos/portland_oregon/img_0115.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> north end of waterfront parkMeet near the steel pillars at the west end of the steel bridge. 3:30pm april 6.\n\nthis auto-audio sculpture is part of a whole stretch of japanese american historical sister city cultural stuff along this strip of the park.

It broke an adjacent natural gas valve, and the resulting fire threatened to overheat the Steel Bridge structure, causing it to lose stability. Portland firefighters successfully cooled the steel until crews secured the broken gas line.\"\n-http://www.trainweb.org/mccann/union.htm\n\n\"    Union Pacific freight train derails, ignites gas pipeline fire in Portland\n\n    PORTLAND -- A three-alarm fire closed a downtown Portland bridge to cars and MAX commuters Tuesday night and caused residents to flee an apartment complex after a freight train derailed and ignited a natural gas pipeline, the Portland Oregonian reported.\n\n    Burning natural gas fueled a stubborn plume of fire for nearly three hours, with heat that firefighters estimated at up to 2,000 degrees.\n\n\tThe blaze lit up the Old Town area on the north edge of downtown at about 8:30 p.m. The fire was extinguished at 11:20 p.m. after the 16-inch gas line was shut off. No injuries were reported and the extent of damage was not immediately known, firefighters said.\n\nOne Union Pacific railcar -- apparently carrying grain -- plummeted into the Willamette River and three other railcars were destroyed, firefighters said. Five cars of the 50-car train derailed.\n\n    More than 120 firefighters responded to the explosion and fire.\n\n    Residents of the nearby McCormick Pier Apartments poured into the streets, and firefighters closed surrounding streets as a precaution.\n\n    The Steel Bridge was closed to all traffic, and MAX riders on both sides of the river were put on buses and rerouted.\n\n    Whether the bridge would remain closed this morning to cars or MAX commuters wasn\\'t known Tuesday night.\n\n    Portland Fire Bureau spokesman Neil Heesacker said firefighters sprayed water around the billowing flames to protect the bridge and nearby structures. The structural integrity of the steel on the bridge is threatened by temperatures beyond 1,000 degrees.\n\n    Because it was fueled by natural gas, firefighters let the fire burn off gas escaping from the line.\n\n    Firefighters said it was unclear why it took NW Natural Gas nearly three hours to shut off the gas line. A gas company spokesman said crews had to dig into the street to find a shut-off valve.\n\n    John Butz, who lives in the neighborhood, said the explosion turned the sky bright orange above the river. He said he saw the railcar go into the river and could feel the intense heat from the flames a considerable distance away.\n\n    The cause of the rail accident wasn\\'t known.\n\n    MAX trains that use the Steel Bridge were stopped at the Rose Garden on the east side of the river and at First Avenue and Yamhill Street on the west side.\n\n    Tri-Met used 11 buses to shuttle passengers between the two stops. In addition, Tri-Met rerouted eight bus lines that normally cross the Steel and Broadway bridges.\n\n    If the MAX cannot cross the Steel Bridge, Solberg said he expected the rerouting from train to bus for MAX commuters would continue today.\"\n-http://www.utu.org/depts/PR-DEPT/NEWS/NDigest/1999/Dec99/ND12-16.HTM\n\n\n\nstill bringing photos and historic/news paper trial<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi11y2nt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.671226,45.526953]}},{"properties":{"name":"0009 walk stop 2 - piracy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/21/26545529_ae5433db09_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/129238350_0a8705be33.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> east side promenade, portland, or, under burnside bridgeThe location where, during the construction of the promenade itself, someone i know very well, comandeered an unattended cargo boat and took it for a joy ride up and down the river before leaving it parked at the pier on the other side of the river. \n\n\"Construction started in October 1998.\n• The floating walkway is 1,200-feet long, 17-feet wide, and is the longest\nfloating walkway in the United States.

Our popularity is a combination of 101 lakes, Pokagon State Park, Tri-State University, a nationally recognized K-12 school system, and a hard working, well-trained work force. We are a community looking to the future. We have begun implementation of a high speed fiber optic network throughout our City. Both of our industrial parks offer multiple providers of high speed Internet and both offer point to point direct fiber optic connections. In addition to our Internet Service Providers and fiber optic backbone, Angola also offers access to a high speed wireless data network available at nearly every location inside the City limits which is hosted and managed by The Indiana Data Center. Whatever type of network or high speed connection you or your business might be looking for, our City has a solution that will work for you.\n\nOur nationally recognized Tri-State University, and all that it offers, helps make a community our size unique.

You can see us to the left and slightly up from the centre of the city of Meyrin.\n\nIs it located in Switzerland?\n\nPart is in Switzerland, part in France across the border.  CERN is not a Swiss institute, but an international organization. We are very close to Geneva\\'s intercontinental airport.\n\nWhat does the acronym CERN mean?\n\nThat is a long story.\n\nDoes it consist of red brick buildings with white-frocked scientists running around carrying files?\n\nNo, that is rather far from reality: we have mostly white buildings made of concrete and the scientists wear everyday clothes and they mostly do not carry files.\n\nWas the web really invented at CERN as the book states?\n\nYes, indeed, the web came from CERN, invented here by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.\n\nDoes antimatter exist?\n\nYes, it does, and we make it routinely at CERN. Antimatter was predicted by P.A.M. Dirac\\'s theory of quantum mechanics in 1928 and antiparticles were found soon after by Carl Anderson. CERN is not the only research institute to produce and study antimatter.\n\nHow is antimatter contained?\n\nWith very great difficulty. It annihilates completely when it touches any normal matter. There are two cases:\n\nCase 1: If an antiparticle is electrically neutral then electric and magnetic fields have no hold on it at all. Therefore, there is no easy way to contain neutral antimatter particles, i.e. no way to keep them away from the normal-matter walls of the vessel in which they are.  They therefore almost immediately come into contact with normal matter and annihilate.\n\nCase 2: For electrically charged antimatter particles such as positrons (antielectrons) and antiprotons we know how to use \"electromagnetic bottles\" to contain them. However:  like charges repel each other.  So it is not possible to put a large quantity of antiprotons together because the repulsive forces between them soon become too strong for the fields that hold them away from the walls.  And you cannot put a mixture of positive antielectrons and negative antiprotons together, because they will make antihydrogen, which is neutral and we are in case 1 again.\n\nSo only very minute quantities can be contained.\n\nWhat are the future uses of antimatter?\n\nAntielectrons, or positrons, are already used in PET scanners in medicine (Positron-Emission Tomography = PET).\n\nOther uses are in studying the laws of nature, as we do at CERN.  The team of the PS210 experiment at the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) at CERN made the first antihydrogen atoms in 1996. Then, in 2002 experiments managed to produce tens of thousands of antihydrogen atoms, a sufficient number to study this gas in its antimatter form.  However, although \"tens of thousands\" may sound a lot, it\\'s really a very very small amount.  You would need 10\\'000\\'000\\'000\\'000\\'000\\'000 times that amount to have enough antihydrogen gas to fill a toy balloon!  If we could somehow store our daily production, it would take us 25\\'000\\'000 billion years to fill the balloon.  The universe has only been around for 13.7 billion years...\nSo the Angels and Demons scenario is pure fiction.\n\n\nCan we hope to use antimatter as a source of energy? Do you feel antimatter could power vehicles in the future, or would it just be used for major power sources?\n\nThere is no possibility to use antimatter as energy \"source\".  Unlike solar energy, coal or oil, antimatter does not occur in nature:  we have to make every particle at the expense of much more energy than it can give back during annihilation.\n\nYou might imagine antimatter as a possible temporary storage medium for energy, much like you store electricity in rechargeable batteries.  The process of charging the battery is reversible with relatively small loss.  Still, it takes more energy to charge the battery than what you get back out of it.  For antimatter the loss factors are so enormous that it will never be practical.\n\nIf we could assemble all the antimatter we\\'ve ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.\n\nI was hoping antimatter would be the future answer to our energy needs. It seems more research is needed for this to happen.\n\nNo, the true answer is that it will never happen simply because of the entropy problem.  Creating antimatter out of energy via E=mc2 unfortunately always produces equal amounts of normal matter and antimatter. This is fundamentally built into the universe.  For any given amount E of energy you will get m/2 grams of antimatter and m/2 grams of matter.  Putting these two amounts back together and annihilating them gives back E.  But the process is not without loss:  today the loss is enormous, but even if we could make the process very efficient, we would still not have any net gain!\n\nIt is not a matter of \"more research\" or \"more advanced technology\" to find ways around these limitations. Antimatter is a fundamental state of matter.  It could only become a source of energy if you happened to find a large amount of antimatter lying around somewhere (e.g. in a distant galaxy), in the same way we find oil and oxygen lying around on Earth.  But as far as we can see (billions of light years), the universe is entirely made of normal matter and antimatter has to be painstakingly created.\n\nThis by the way shows that the symmetry between matter and antimatter as stated above does not hold at very high energies, such as shortly after the Big Bang, since otherwise there should be as much matter as antimatter in the Universe. These energies are higher than any that can be achieved on Earth at present; what future research might tell us is how this asymmetry came about, although it is extremely unlikely to lead to the possibility of using antimatter as an energy source.\n\nCan we make antimatter bombs?\n\nThere is no possibility to make antimatter bombs for the same reason you cannot use it to store energy: we can\\'t accumulate enough of it at high enough density.\n\nSociological note:  scientists realised that the atom bomb was a real possibility many years before one was actually built and exploded, and then the public was totally surprised and amazed.  The antimatter bomb on the other hand has been imagined by the public who wants to know more about it, yet we have known for a very long time that it\\'s not at all a practical device...\n\nWhy has antimatter received no media attention?\n\nIt has received a lot of media attention, though usually in the scientific press.  Also, antimatter is not \"new\":  we\\'ve been using it for decades; antimatter has been observed for almost a hundred years.\n\nIs antimatter truly 100% efficient?\n\nDepends what you mean by efficient.  If you start from two equal quantities m/2 of matter and m/2 of antimatter, then you get exactly E=mc2 as energy out.  Of course.  It converts at 100%.\n\nBut that is not the point:  how much effort do you have to put in to get m/2 grams of antimatter?  Well, theoretically E=mc2 because half of the energy will become normal matter.  So you gain nothing.  But the process of creating antimatter is highly inefficient:  when you make antimatter particles, a lot of them go astray before you can catch them.  Everything happens at nearly the speed of light, and the particles created zoom off in all directions.  Somewhat like cooking food over a campfire:  most of the heat is lost and does not go into the cooking of the food, it disappears as radiation into the dark night sky. Very inefficient.\n\nIn fact we have to use hundreds of times more energy to create the matter/antimatter pairs than the theoretical minimum of mc2, but we won\\'t ever get back more than mc2.\n\nDo you make antimatter as described in the book?\n\nNo. The production and storage of antimatter at CERN is not at all as decribed in the book:  you cannot stand next to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and see it come out, especially since the LHC accelerator is not yet in operation.  To make antiprotons we collide protons with a block of tungsten (Wolfram).  Out of this come a large number of particles, some of which are antiprotons.  Only the antiprotons are useful, and only those that fly out in the right direction. So that\\'s where your energy loss goes:  it is like trying to water a pot of flowers but you only have a sprinkler that sprays over the whole garden.  Of course, we constantly apply new tricks to become more efficient at collecting antiparticles, but at the level of elementary particles this is extremely difficult and sometimes impossible.\n\nWhy then do you build the LHC?\n\nThe reason for building the LHC accelerator is not to make antimatter but to produce concentrations of energy high enough to study effects that will help us understand some of the remaining questions in physics.  We say concentrations, because we are not talking about huge amounts of energy but enormous concentration.  The energy in each particle that we will accelerate in the LHC is equivalent to the amount of energy in a flying mosquito.  Not much at all in absolute terms, but it will be concentrated in a very minute space and inside that minute space things will resemble the state of the universe close to the Big Bang.\n\nYou should compare the concentration effect to what people can learn about the quality of a wooden floor by walking over it.  If a large man wearing normal shoes and a petite woman wearing sharp stiletto heels walk over the same floor, the man will not make dents, but the woman, despite her lower weight, may leave marks:  the pressure created at the stiletto heels is far higher.  So that\\'s like what the LHC will do:  concentrate little energy into a very minute space to make a huge concentration effect and learn something about the Big Bang.\n\nDoes CERN have a particle accelerator 27 miles long?\n\nThe LHC accelerator is a ring of 27 kilometers in circumference.  There is a lot of the technical details on its own site.  The LHC is in a tunnel about 100 m underground. You can see the round outline of it marked on a map of the area.\n\nIn fact, why do you make antimatter at CERN?\n\nThe principal reason is to study the laws of Nature.  The current physics theories predict a number of effects, and many of the effects concern antimatter.  If experiments do not observe the predictions, then the theory is not accurate and needs to be amended or reworked.  This is how science progresses.\n\nAnother reason is to get extremely high energy densities in collisions of matter and antimatter particles, since they annihilate completely when they meet.  From this annihilation energy other interesting particles may be created (this was mainly how the Large Electron Positron or LEP collider operated).\n\nHow is energy extracted from antimatter?\n\nWhen a normal matter particle hits an antimatter particle, they mutually annihilate into a very concentrated burst of pure energy, from which in turn particles are created.  These new particles can be matter particles or energy particles (photons), depending on a number of factors, with an obvious constraint that the total incoming energy is exactly equal to the outgoing energy.  Almost all of it ends up as heat.  Not very useful.\n\nHow safe is antimatter?\n\nPerfectly safe, given the minute quantities we can make.  It would be very dangerous if we could make a few grams of it, but we can\\'t.\n\nIf so, does CERN have protocols to keep the public safe?\n\nThere is no danger from antimatter. There are of course other dangers on the CERN site, as in any laboratory:  high voltage power in certain areas, deep pits to fall in, etc. but for these dangers the usual industrial safety measures are of course put in place.  There is no radioactive leak danger for the public as you might find around nuclear power stations.  There is even no indirect danger such as from thermal power stations and oil comsumption which produce longer term pollution and global warming.\n\nDoes one gram of antimatter contain the energy of a twenty kiloton nuclear bomb?\n\nA \"kiloton\" in this context means a thousand tons of TNT explosive. Twenty kilotons was the equivalent of the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.\n\nThe question is somewhat confusing:  you are probably talking about the explosive release of energy by the sudden annihilation of one gram of antimatter. Let\\'s calculate it.  A \"kiloton of TNT\" is not a metric unit, it corresponds to 4.2x1012 joules.  A 60 watt light bulb consumes 60 joules of energy per second.  The notation 1012 means a 1 followed by 12 zeros:\n\n1\\'000 = kilo = 103    1\\'000\\'000 = mega = 106    1\\'000\\'000\\'000 = giga = 109    1\\'000\\'000\\'000\\'000 = tera = 1012\n\nSo a kiloton is 4.2 terajoules or 4.2 TJ.\n\nA gram is 0.001 kg.  The speed of light is 300\\'000 km/s or 300\\'000\\'000 meter/s.  Now E=mc2 so for 1 gram we get\n\nE= 0.001 x 300\\'000\\'000 x 300\\'000\\'000 kgm2/s2 = 90\\'000\\'000\\'000\\'000 J or 9x1013 joules or 90x1012 J or 90 TJ.\n\nIf 4.2 TJ corresponds to a kiloton of TNT, then 90 TJ corresponds to 90/4.2 = 21.4 kiloton. About right.\n\nBut for the antimatter bomb we are actually talking about two grams: one gram of antimatter, annihilating with one gram of normal matter, and therefore you would release twice that amount! You need only half a gram of antimatter to be equally destructive as the Hiroshima bomb, the half gram of normal matter is easy enough to find.\n\nAt CERN we make quantities of the order of 107 antiprotons per second and there are 6x1023 of them in a single gram of antihydrogen. You can easily calculate how long we would have to work to get one gram if we could make the 107 antiparticles every second:  we would need 6x10(23-7)=6x1016 seconds.  There are only 365x24x60x60 = 3x107 seconds in a year, so it would roughly take 6x1016/3x107 = 2x109 or about two billion years!  Of course, it would be utterly impossible to contain this amount of pure negative electric charge.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphwi9l7n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[6.098095,46.22521]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cape Mears","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Houseless natural beach<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphurfjs5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.959084,45.414358]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cascadia Rising Infoshop Lending Library","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> (503) 230 8360<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphy0y0wo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.650166,45.50349]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cat's Cradle w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>Carrboro, North Carolina February, 7 2007 at Cat's Cradle w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship  300 East Main St., Carrboro, North Carolina 27510 Cost : 15Cartel, Cobra Starship, Boys Like Girls, Permanent Me<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphvcayq2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.075556,35.91]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cherry Tree","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/79534376@N00/1767674240/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2130/1767674240_d0f0b4bd3d.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> huge cherry tree, not amazingly fruitful, but very sweet dark cherries.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphx910h3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.645536065,45.5242094308]}},{"properties":{"name":"China (Texas)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>china, texasIt is named for the \"China Berry\" trees that were native to the area but have all but gone extinct today.

It lit up the sky with blue lights.\"Just two days later Lucy Smith, of Essendon Gardens, was called out into the garden at around 7.45pm by her two excited brothers Craig and Toby, 19 and 13.The 15-year-old told the WHT she looked into the sky and saw three bright red lights low in the sky. \"They were moving slowly over the houses,\" she said.\"It wasn\\'t a plane or helicopter because we couldn\\'t hear an engine and it definitely wasn\\'t fireworks because they stayed for too long in the sky.\"The dogs were going crazy.

This area would be witness to numerous troop movements over the next century as the French and English fought for control of North America. The Indian trail on the Ridge became the roadway along which English troops under General John Prideaux marched against the French at Fort Niagara. Later this same trail would carry pioneers and settlers westward. The first permanent settlement was established in 1792 along the west side of the Genesee River at King\\'s Landing, later to be named Hanford Landing.\n\nWith the establishment of the Port of the Genesee by President Thomas Jefferson in 1805, trade from the Great Lakes began to pour in. With access to Lake Ontario, the Genesee River, Ridge Road and later the Erie Canal, the Town became a transportation hub and a major supplier of farm produce to the new and growing nation.\n\nOriginally called Northampton, the Town of Greece was established by the New York State Legislature on March 22, 1822. Its name was chosen because of the current wave of sympathy toward the Greeks who were then fighting for independence from Turkish rule. The Town seat was named Charlotte for the daughter of Colonel Troup, the land agent for an English estate which owned much of western New York at the time. Charlotte itself was incorporated as a village in 1869, and was part of Greece until 1916 when it was annexed to the City of Rochester as the 23rd Ward.\n\nAgriculture would remain the dominant enterprise in Greece until the twentieth century, when Eastman Kodak Company would become the major industrial employer in the region. Most of the Town\\'s growth has occurred after World War II with the population exceeding 94,000 in 2000. The character of Greece today is of a residential suburb with modern industry and commerce.\n\nThe official flag of the Town of Greece was adopted at a meeting of the Town Council on August 17, 1954. Centered in a field of white is a circular emblem, designed by J. S. Perticone depicting the old lighthouse at the mouth of the Genesee River which was built in 1822 - the same year the Town was established. The circle represents the shield of the warriors of the Ancient Greece and the border is of characteristic Greek design. Lightning flashes symbolize energy and strength and the colors - terra cotta, golden yellow and black - are those used in old Greek pottery and artistic decorations.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi1tlk2o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.695887,43.208129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Guerrilla DIY Sidewalk Horse-Tie","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/IMG_4564small.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/IMG_4562small.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> NW 3rd near Glisan, Portland, ORmysterious metal working activist artist installed this horse-tie in a fresh municipal curb pour.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphu88fly"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673592,45.526367]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gypsy Ballroom w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>Dallas, Texas February, 15 2007 at Gypsy Ballroom w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship  2548 Elm St, Dallas, Texas 75226 Cost : 15Cartel, Cobra Starship, Boys Like Girls, Permanent Me<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphrz91wo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.8,32.783333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hammering siding, knocked kitchen cabs off wall.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/91096577_5761c453b3.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> SE PortlandMy dad just told me a story where we was attaching some siding to a house, and inside, a kitchen cabinet full of fine tea cups came out of the wall from the banging.

Propaganda leaflets and fliers now flutter to the ground as if Lebanon has momentarily found itself in a perverted tickertape parade. It\\'s just that so few people seem to be celebrating.\n\nDays back, Israeli planes dropped fliers on the soccer field at the American University-Beirut. One of the canisters that was supposed to open in mid-air and scatter the info far and wide came down intact with a thud. Many of the Americans raced after the fliers, while their Lebanese classmates mostly just stood there with indifference. Perhaps before she even knew what she was doing and why she was doing it, one of my friends had managed to collect a bunch, and she passed one along to me. I feel this flier goes a way toward illustrating the stark contrast between life in Beirut proper, where it is still possible to have typical, peacetime moments in any given day, and life in the bombarded South, where it just isn\\'t.\n\nThe leaflet is pink and depicts Hezbollah\\'s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, as a snake amidst a field of cowering people. Incidentally, Israel\\'s artists must have sat this one out, because it looks like it was drawn while inside a moving fighter jet. The text above the picture poses the question, \"The resistance protects the nation...?\" And then answers, \"No, it is hurting the nation!!!\"\n\nThe people of downtown Beirut, although certainly enduring legitimate hardships, were given a cartoon and a rhetorical question. But the people of the southern cities and towns of Sidon, Tyre and Nabatiyeh and Beirut suburbs like Dahiyeh have been given a lot more than that.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphwnx0s3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.480947,33.901989]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jannus Landing w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>St. Petersburg, Florida March, 22 2007 at Jannus Landing w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship  16 2nd Street North, St. Petersburg, Florida 33701 Cost : 4.99 ADV / 8.00 DOSw/Cartel, Cobra Starship<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphxdrgb8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.679444,27.770556]}},{"properties":{"name":"Johnson Street Mystery Underbridge Uplighting","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/41/103634458_361a8eea7d.jpg?v=0\">under the 405 overpass, NW Johnson &amp; 15th, Portland, ORthere is an almost identical setup on Kearney too<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphzhz8ad"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.686917,45.528629]}},{"properties":{"name":"Journalist freed from kidnap ordeal in Iraq","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://www.itn.co.uk/news/story963110.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> BaghdadBaghdad -

A growing number of paleontologists say that Earth-smashing meteors cannot take all the blame for the many mass extinctions that dot our planet\\'s fossil record. The true causes seem to be more complex.\"The [meteor] impact model has been so successful because it\\'s easy to explain and easy to understand,\" said Nan Arens of Hobart and William Smith College in Geneva, NY. \"However, the simple answer isn\\'t always the best one.\"At the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America this week in Philadelphia, Arens and others argued that the combined punch of volcanoes, climate change and impacts leaves many species teetering on the brink of extinction. One final blow brings collapse. The same scenario could be happening now. \"Impacts by themselves simply don\\'t cause major mass extinctions,\" she told LiveScience.The P-T extinction event, or Great Dying, occurred 251 million years ago when up to 90 percent of all species were snuffed out. David Bottjer\\'s group from the University of Southern California has studied the fossil record and found clear signs that species were in peril long before they disappeared. The reason: \"The Earth got sick,\" Bottjer said.The illness began when Siberian volcanoes triggered global warming, he explained. This reduced ocean circulation and the oxygen supply. These hazardous conditions were a boon for sulfur-eating microbes, which released toxic hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere, finishing off most of the life that remained.Common diagnosisA sick Earth succumbing to a final shock is apparently a common extinction formula. Arens and her colleagues analyzed geologic data from the last 488 million years and found more species died out when the environment was first stressed and then stung.Specifically, the researchers compared stress-inducing volcanic activity and catastrophic meteor impacts. Only when the Earth experienced both did extinction rates significantly increase.\"Periods of stress are going to reduce population sizes,\" Arens said. With reduced numbers, \"species are vulnerable to pulse catastrophes.\"On the flip side, an unstressed environment is resilient to geologic and climatic disasters because life is diverse and geographically spread out.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphzhzs4a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.164167,39.952222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Newport Music Hall w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Columbus, Ohio February, 11 2007 at Newport Music Hall w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship  1722 North High St., Columbus, Ohio 43201 Cost : 11.50 ADV 15 DoorsCartel, Cobra Starship, Boys Like Girls, Permanent Me<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphz21ck7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.998889,39.961111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nice inlaid mosaic murals of kids gettin sporty","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/103929533_85d7b8f038.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Out front of the Montavilla Community Centernice details to this otherwise blah exterior.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphod68ss"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.578765,45.52678]}},{"properties":{"name":"No Food Loitering on steps","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/747aafbc2f5f0d79cdf204713f5101c8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> next door to Tribute Pizza<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi0889rp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698048,45.529027]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nokia Theatre Times Square w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starshipp","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> New York, New York February, 9 2007 at Nokia Theatre Times Square w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starshipp  1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036 Cost : 18.50Cartel, Cobra Starship, Boys Like Girls, Permanent Me<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi4h63sc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Our eyes and bodies met at a Crash Worship show","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 520 4th St, San Francisco, CASwept away on the indescribable physiological and emotional current(s) of a particularly tribal Crash Worship show (audience members burning their clothes in a pit fire in the center of the floor), I found myself in one of those filmic situations where your eyes meet someone across the room, you approach each other, you don\\'t talk, you only dance together, erotically, for hours.

They formed the foundation for the most successful and powerful ship to shore and land station on the Pacific Rim.\"\n\nNow I visited this site in the early 90\\'s. Beautiful area, Point Reyes; I highly recommend a visit. However, there is a story here. Isn\\'t there always?\n\nFirst of all, understand that when you are out on Point Reyes, you get the distinct feeling that you are completely removed from the modern world. You are geographically isolated from society. It was also rumored at the time that there was an abandoned mental asylum somewhere nearby and the way the lonely wind cries in your ears out there makes you want to believe it. It\\'s vaguely unsettling.\n\nThe day I stopped in at the old Marconi site for a visit was overcast and a bit windy, as usual. The mood was already set, so it is no suprise that, after the fact, I felt as if I had just walked through some kind of creepy Bugs Bunny cartoon gone bad. Upon knocking, the heavy wooden door creaked open at the hand of this tiny older gentleman who looked like a miniature cross between an Lon Chaney and Hannibal Lechter, but with a smile. And a Bow tie. Behind him in the shadows was his exotic, towering assistant, obviously imported from Northern Africa somewhere. The two figures together were reminiscent of an old black an white movie featuring a mad scientist and his mute, hulking assistant. The words, \"Won\\'t you please come in?\" will haunt my ears forever. Although I\\'m sure that both of these men were just as normal as you or I, it was just wierd.\n\nAdd to this the ancient and gigantic electrical components scattered around and throughout the massive decaying structure, like the remnants of a Frankenstein experiment from ages past, and you\\'ll understand why this location sticks in my mind. I was just waiting for a bolt of lightning to strike and bring everything to horrible life. It was the perfect setting for a Hitchcock film starring Anthony Hopkins.\n\nAll in all, a very interesting place to visit, if you don\\'t mind the vague unsettling feeling that you may end up as someones dinner.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpht7np42"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.724752,37.914138]}},{"properties":{"name":"ROXY","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/38/120159061_37763e9ffa.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/36/120158924_4f6b23213f.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/120159007_654f81e993.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1121 Southwest Stark Street, Portland, OR, 97205ROXY 503-223-9160<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi34jetl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.682359,45.522257]}},{"properties":{"name":"RainTown","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73533402@N00/2078390815/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/2078390815_a485422221.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7108389@N05/2086063298/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2130/2086063298_783de664f5.jpg\"></a>PortlandCold dark and dreary<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphs35ufq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675,45.523611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Raina's former L.E.S apt with the shower in the kitchen","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/IMG_3732.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 27 Orchard St, NY 10002this is my former apartment; it was one of those typically Manhattan places with exposed pipes and... strange, cramped, with a shower in the living room! Yes, my shower was adjacent to my range, and next to the kitchen sink, and if i wanted to, shower and saute at the same time! There was also no good place for Acorn\\'s litter box, so I\\'d put it in the shower, and take it out every time i wanted to bathe. Hence the show would smell like cat poo. Even though it was tiny, I liked the feel of the apartment; it had lots of light, roof access (top floor), it was the \"penthouse\" so to speak. In the summertime most of the residents, mostly older chinese women and their grandchildren, would leave their doors open and lights off throuhout the day. I could see clear through their entire apartments; they had peeling linoleum floors and walls packed with crap. Their places were darker, seemingly smaller, and unrenovated than mine, which had had new floors, a newish kitchen, and repainted walls. I had 2 a/c units (by accident), modern furniture and lived alone; Other people in my building didn\\'t have A/C, and keeping the doors open would help circulate air, kitchen smells, and basically add another of \"window\" to the tiny apartments. Apartments that they shared with their entire families just like the immigrants who had lives in these same tenements (with 5-10 people per apartment) a hundred years before. As a Chinese American young profession, I\\'d wonder how as Chinese people our lives in America could be world different. Still do.\n\nWalking up the stairs, I\\'d smell my neighbors cooking their dinners for their grandchildren and wished they\\'d ask me over. I\\'d also pass the single Latino gentleman on the third floor, and would hear music lessons; in his packed apartment I could see an upright piano, a computer desk, and a bed. I\\'d sometimes see him teaching the neighborhood Chinese kids guitar. When I\\'d open my apartment door  sometimes Acorn would rush out into the bonsai lady\\'s apartment across the way who\\'s door was open. In the summer, all she would do in the daytime was lay on her bed, with the lights off, fanning herself, int his tiny studio apartment filled with minuature trees. \n\nThough now i live a few blocks south of Canal, not too far away in a  nicer, larger unit, I miss Orchard St a little. When my friend Erin would stay over after a late night of drinks and dancing to Morrissey, we\\'d come back and she\\'d sleep on the couch, i\\'d sleep in mybed, and we\\'d talk until we fell asleep. We\\'d talk also while I was in bed and she was taking a shower too. In that apartment two people would always be right next to each other. Proximity brings people together, its true. Ever wonder why its always so fun to be confined in a small space with lots of people, like a slumber party? In my new place, Erin sleeps on my couch but is a good ten feet down the hall. I have to practically yodal her my secrets. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphrjholw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.990946,40.715094]}},{"properties":{"name":"Reading Frenzy Book-Zine-Mag Store","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://www.readingfrenzy.com/img/reading_frenzy_interior.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.readingfrenzy.com/journal/supercrafty.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.readingfrenzy.com/img/reading_frenzy_storefront.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Heavy Hitters in the DIY publishing scene<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi4kdjdi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.680625,45.522751]}},{"properties":{"name":"Report: FDNY overlooked bogus degrees \n    (AP)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>nycAP - The city\\'s top watchdog agency has criticized the Fire Department for awarding promotions to firefighters who purchased bogus college degrees on the Internet.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi0krafn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rialto Theatre w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Tucson, Arizona February, 19 2007 at Rialto Theatre w/ Cartel &amp; Cobra Starship  318 East Congress St, Tucson, Arizona 85701 Cost : 15Cartel, Cobra Starship, Boys Like Girls, Permanent Me<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphvg3jx3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.925833,32.221667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rock!

As they have grown, though, their stubborn roots have created safety hazards by pushing concrete sidewalk slabs out of the ground.\n\nThat has prompted repair crews throughout the region to chop down rows of the dense, green-canopied trees. Replacement trees have generally been slower-growing and scrawnier-looking.\n\nBut street maintenance workers in Southern California will soon be stretching the life expectancy of the ficus by using flexible sidewalks made from recycled automobile tires.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphtypsqz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.490278,34.019444]}},{"properties":{"name":"Russia (Ohio)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/branch_russia.gif\">russia, ohioRussia (locally pronounced ROO-she), has a population made up of 39% German and 31% French decent.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphzx75y3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.409444,40.234444]}},{"properties":{"name":"SF Cable Car Turn-table","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>End of the line.

This would take three years and in that time her betrothed would convert to Christianity.\n\nThe story goes that when she and the girls returned from Rome, they were met at the shore by a horde of Huns who slaughtered them all. The girls were all decapitated and Ursula was shot with an arrow.\n\nUrsula and the virgins were collectively canonized and their feast day is October 21.\n\nThe bones in the graveyard were dug up  in 1155 by an abbot named Gerlach. He is the one who advertised them as belonging to the 11,000 virgins.\n\nEarly texts about Ursula mention fewer maidens in her company. 11 rather then 11,000.\n\nThe reliquary of the church is walpapered with skulls. They have girl-shaped reliquaries with heart-shaped cut-outs through which you can see the bones.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi0u1jhd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[6.954444,50.945833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sand Dunes","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Climb up slow, run down as fast as you can.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzphxygtxj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.973589,45.218536]}},{"properties":{"name":"Satan Hates You  -  Graffiti","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/103479013_285fee1934.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Traffic switch box, 16th &amp;

Richard and Linda Ortyl were heading from Cannock when they both saw a solid white shape on the left hand side of the road at 12.10am on Saturday. The pair, who live in south Manchester, at first thought the shape could have been an animal.They said: ?This shape was about 1ft wide by 3ft or 4ft long. It quickly glided up the side of the hedges, over the top and curled around a wide tree.?Our initial thoughts were that it was a white fox because of the shape and size but the movement was too fast, it came off the ground and the movement was not animal-like.? They added: ?The shape was also a solid white mass with no definable features of legs or tails or wings.?Shropshire UFO expert Phil Hoyle said today over the years there had been a number of unusual sightings on the A5.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi0tpew5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.449285,52.677727]}},{"properties":{"name":"Street Stallion","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/9thatcouch676.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/pearlwater.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/9thatcouch606.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/missingbigcable.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/95384055_3645efd8e4.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/97207159_eb6b890a78_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> NW 9th &amp; Couch, PortlandThis little stallion has been standing guard on this corner for a few months now.

Not only over the seas but also on land did they kindle the lovely torch of freedom.\n\nDedicatory inscription of the Colossus\n\nFrom its building to its destruction lies a time span of merely 56 years. Yet the colossus earned a place in the famous list of Wonders. \"But even lying on the ground, it is a marvel\", said Pliny the Elder. The Colossus of Rhodes was not only a gigantic statue. It was rather a symbol of unity of the people who inhabited that beautiful Mediterranean island -- Rhodes.\nLocation\n\nAt the entrance of the harbor of the Mediterranean island of Rhodes in Greece.\nHistory\n\nThroughout most of its history, ancient Greece was comprised of city-states which had limited power beyond their boundary. On the small island of Rhodes were three of these: Ialysos, Kamiros, and Lindos. In 408 BC, the cities united to form one territory, with a unified capital, Rhodes. The city thrived commercially and had strong economic ties with their main ally, Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt. In 305 BC, the Antigonids of Macedonia who were also rivals of the Ptolemies, besieged Rhodes in an attempt to break the Rhodo-Egyptian alliance. They could never penetrate the city. When a peace agreement was reached in 304 BC, the Antagonids lifted the siege, leaving a wealth of military equipment behind. To celebrate their unity, the Rhodians sold the equipment and used the money to erect an enormous statue of their sun god, Helios.\n\nThe construction of the Colossus took 12 years and was finished in 282 BC. For years, the statue stood at the harbor entrance, until a strong earthquake hit Rhodes about 226 BC. The city was badly damaged, and the Colossus was broken at its weakest point -- the knee. The Rhodians received an immediate offer from Ptolemy III Eurgetes of Egypt to cover <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bzpi0uc76d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.190918,36.332828]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Crackhouse","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://igargoyle.com/\" href=\"http://igargoyle.com/\">Nym</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_003.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_004.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_005.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_006.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_007.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_008.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_009.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_010.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_011.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_012.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_013.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_014.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Crackhouse_015.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 34.09978, -118.59803This is an abandoned house that I just explored.\n\nBefore exploring it, I tried to find out as much as I could from the locals.

Mr Slade, a chef, who went to Broadland High School in Wroxham, added: ?They made a triangular shape. I thought it can\\'t be a plane because planes have flashing lights but these were silent and it was just an orange glow. I don\\'t think it was a hot air balloon because they normally send off a flame.?Miles Ward, 26, saw the lights from outside his house in Jex Road at 11pm. He said: ?My neighbour told me to look up and then right down towards the city centre. I could see four bright red lights coming in my direction and then they stopped. My wife took a picture but they did not show up.?About 20 minutes later he saw three lights in the same place, which stayed for five minutes and then faded out. He said: ?It looked like they were above Heigham Street. They were at the same sort of height as an aeroplane but they stopped for three or four minutes and there was no noise. The way it was moving was eerie.?Heather Allen, who lives in Netherwood Green, Lakenham, saw the lights at 10.40pm above the woods near her house.The 56-year-old grandmother said: ?I saw five or six yellowy-orange bright lights in the sky at the back of the woods. They were floating. They were in a line behind each other. Then they went out towards Trowse. They were about the height of a helicopter but there was no noise. It just did not seem like anything I could recognise.?John Sayer, treasurer of the Norfolk UFO Society, said he had received two reports. He said one witness from Unthank Road saw three yellowish bright lights at 10.15pm and another person in Lakenham saw four orange lights which stopped and circled a small white light at 10.30pm. ?We are collating reports on it and interviewing witnesses. It does sound like a genuine anomalous sighting,? he said.UFO sightings:*In August this year several witnesses reported sighting a UFO flying over Hellesdon. They said a bright red ball appeared above Low Road, it glowed then turned blue. A triangular black craft then appeared 50ft in the air which pulsed various lights, but there was no sound and it eventually shot off in total silence.*In September Kerry Neal of Thorpe St Andrew spotted a similar silent hovering aircraft near Acle. She said she saw lights and an object hovering which then disappeared.*In 1997 David Spoor, from Oulton Broad, filmed several UFOS in the Lowestoft area. On one occasion he was closing the door of his home when he saw a metallic saucer-shaped object in the evening sky and captured it on film. He was later invited on an expenses-paid trip to a UFO convention in the USA to talk about his sightings.*In April 1996 the Norfolk UFO Society was swamped after sightings of an unusual bright white light in the sky came in from all over the cityHave you spotted a UFO?

Orientation to accommodate official delegations determined high requirements relating safety and service quality, which have been cultivated up to the present moment.\n\nFrom 90-ies, the hotel is being oriented towards business tourism.
