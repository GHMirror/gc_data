During the Texan Revolution, it became a fort. After the revolution, it was returned to the Catholic Church. After its annexation, the government claimed it for military purposes. In later years both U.S. and Confederate forces used the building. Then  Frank W. Johnson, first president of the Texas Veterans\\' Association, recomended that the state purchase it. They agreed.\r\n\r\n    In the actual battle, Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna stormed the old mission to crush the Texans. He began with a traditional siege with his men surrounding the Alamo. Slowly, they moved closer to the walls, where they breached them and stormed the fort. Though defending Lt. Colonel William Travis sent out requests for help, none of the forces that came could defeat Santa Anna. Heros Davy Crocket and Jim Bowie fought here, and were said to be some of the last few survivers. Although the battle was lost, Texas won their independence. The heavy loss fueled the Texans to have a great victory over Mexico.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l34xtkb4th"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.486177,29.425675]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gettysburg, Pennsylvania","description":"Posted by Southernpride<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/gettysburg_2_.bmp\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/gettysburg.bmp\">    Gettysburg is the home of the turning point in the Civil War. The Union defeated the Confederacy in the summer of 1863. Up to this point, the South was winning the majority of her battles. The battle of Gettysburg was the bloodiest battle in the war with around 51,000 casualties.\r\n    General Lee and the Confederates pushed the Union to Cemetery Hill.  Lee then ordered General Richard Ewell, now commander of Stonewall Jackson\\'s men, to attack this position \"if practicable.\" Jackson took this order to mean launch an all-out attack. Ewell was clearly not Jackson. He decided not to attack when he saw the Union army on the hill. Had he attacked and succeeded, it might have changed the course of the war. The rest of the Union armies arrived that first night. The Union established a defensive position resembling a fish hook. Lee chose to attack both ends the next day. On the right end, Union troops mistakenly shifted, leaving Little Round Top undefended. At the last second, a Union general rushed his troops in slightly ahead of the charging Confederates. After an intense and long day of fighting, the Union barely held the hill. The misplaced Yankeys were pushed back. On the left end, Ewell\\'s attack failed due to his poor leadership. \r\n\r\n    Lee, thinking the Union\\'s center had been weakened, decided to hit it first with artillery, and then with what came to be known as Pickett\\'s Charge. Stuart\\'s late cavalry was to come in behind the Union center at the same time, but the Union cavalry, led by General George Custer, held them off. After an hour of bloody fighting, the Union  deceived the Confederates into thinking their guns were knocked out. Then 13,000 Rebels marched across the field in front of Cemetery Hill, only to have the Union artillery blow them down. Lee lost more than a third of his men before retreating to Virginia. Union general Meade decided the loss of one-quarter of his men had been enough, and barely tried to pursue Lee. Lee and the remaining Confederate troops escaped to saftey. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l34xualc2j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.230968,39.830555]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jerusalem","description":"Posted by Southernpride<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/jeru_.bmp\">israel    Jerusalem is one of the worlds oldest cities.

It is also known as \"D-Day.\" With Normandy secured, the destruction of Nazi forces could begin.\r\nTanks were specially designed for this envasion. Anywhere from mine clearing to road laying tanks could be found. Operation Fortitude was set up as a massive deception. The Allies used code names and tricked the enemy into being at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Thankfully, this time it is close. \r\n\r\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese skillfully executed a brilliant plan to whipe out the US\\'s Navy. They attacked just before 8 AM. Five out of eight battleships were shortly sunk or sinking. The rest were damaged. Over 2400 Americans died. The attack was not a wise idea, since it made a powerful nation furious.\r\nIt only took the US a little while to end the Japanese attempt for control. The Us droped two A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\r\nNow, at the memorial for the battleship Arizona, evidence of the attack still remains. Oil leaks from the once mighty battleship into the Pacific. At the site, the names of the attack\\'s deceased line the walls.

It should be in Florida.\r\nST. Augustine is the nation\\'s oldest city. It is located between Northeast and Central Florida. The Castillo de San Marcos National Monument has been closely intertwined with the city and its neighboring structures.e Fort Mose to the north and Fort Matanzas to the south served as the cities outer defences. \r\nThe Castillo and the town remind us of the might of the Spanish empire in the New World. With designers paying so much attention to details, it\\'s not surprising that Castillo de San Marcos took 23 years to build from its start in 1672 to finish in 1695. This ancient city was built with  coquina, an almost indestructible limestone made up of of broken sea shells and coral. The walls of the fortress remained impenetrable through 300 years of attacks and  violent storms. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l34xrh8jlu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.608275,45.138459]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tallulah Gorge","description":"Posted by Southernpride<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/tallula_gorge.bmp\">Georgia, USATallulah Gorge, otherwise known as the Niagra of the South, was once the most popular vacation spot in the Southeast. Hard walls of granite run perpendicular to the gorgeous floor. The canyon is the deepest in the Southeast and possibly the second deepest in the nation.\r\nWhen the Georgia Power Company bought land outside of the gorge, they almost ended the beauty of the falls. Many fought to keep the dam out and nearly won. Thankfully, the dam did not ruin the falls. To help build the popularity for the falls, several people have walked, on ropes, across the gorge\\'s highest point at 1200 feet. Sadly, in one bad year, 6 hikers fell to their death. The gorge is still a popular, goreous place to visit, although walking over 3000 steps to the bottom is very tiring.

It is home to Old Faithful and many animals. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the bill to create Yellowstone National Park, making it an official park in 1872. It is a true American wilderness. 97% of the 3,400 sq. miles (2.2 million acres) remains undeveloped.\r\n    The park gets its name from the golden rock there. It can be seen in the 400 foot waterfalls of the Yellowstone River, which cut a deep canyon into the rock. While Old Faithful is the most recognized geyser in the park, there are many other sites, including hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles. The wildlife freely roam the park, waiting for a quick eye to spot them.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l34xy8hir9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.536194,43.000035]}},{"properties":{"name":"fort sumter, charleston south carolina","description":"Posted by Southernpride<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ft_sm.bmp\">south carolina    There have been a few problems with the placement of arrows on the map, so this should be in Charleston Harbor.\r\n    When the Civil War started, the fort was part of the Union. 34 hours later, that changed. The first shots were fired here, and after only a few hours, the Union surrendered. They would try for four years to regain the fort.\r\n    When I visited the fort a few years ago, they told us that the only thing that died while the actual battle went on was a horse. During the evacuation, a cannon exploded prematurely and killed one man and wounded three others. \r\n    Fort Sumter is still intact today. It is very interesting to walk through the fort and see the cannons still in place.

The sky scraper housed many different offices. It was designed to have over 10 million sq. feet of office space. Archetect Minoru Yamasaki setteled on two towers. The construction began on August 5th, 1966. It opened on April 4, 1973. For about a year it was the tallest building until the Sears tower passed it.\r\n    When terrorists attacked on September 11, 2001, both towers collapsed. Millions of people died. Two planes were flown into the towers, causing them to collapse.\r\n    There are now plans to open a memorial to honor those who died here. The site will have two pools with waterfalls around them and over 300 oak trees. There will also be a museum and the Freedom tower.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l34xplokt7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.013334,40.707931]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/284772","metadata":null,"contact_name":"southernpride","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:southernpride","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/284772","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=284772,platial:user=southernpride","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47836}
