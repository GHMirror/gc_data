What happens if your best friend is a stuffed animal? This reality can set in with the creation of one at Build a Bear Workshop. A bear becomes transformed into something you can take into your own home and cuddle up with and love. \nI proceed into the store to be mobbed with so many choices of bears/stuffed animals that I can chose from with a whole range of price. Digging through the bins filled with unstuffy bears, I finally pick the one I want who is badge in color and has more floppy ears. I recognize on the ceiling that there are signs designating different stations for the creation process. \nIn front of me, there is a machine with all this cotton that is constantly circulating like snow blowing in a snowstorm. The lady takes the bear from me and asks how soft I would like my bear to be, and what I would like my bear’s name to be. I am more indecisive right now. There is a peddle on the ground to step on to make sure the cotton adds the fluffiness to the bear. When the bear gets sown up, it is time to move on to the next station. To get rid of that excess hair, I would turn to my mom and say, “Judging from all these things, they might as well consider this to be a beauty parlor for bears.” The wonderful thing about Build a Bear is you are creating what your friend is supposed to be. \nTo dress up the bear with ranging from caps, to shoes, to skirts, to different designs, pants, etc. Too many choices and too many things appeal. Looking at all these options, it is very hard to minimize the choices and especially when it comes to figure out the bear’s name. You would never think that so many decisions would have to go into creating one single bear, but now my new friend is packaged up nicely and ready to go home with me to celebrate life. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gwaab42bkw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.30998,41.46865]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cd's House","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILFew Friends\n\nMy boyfriend’s friends Joe, Ron, and Hubert along with another friend Sandra came to hang out and have a good time.

Sandra is one of those people who feel like deadlines are essential and she can have her weird moments. She just felt like she had to have these few CD’s as soon as possible. I forget what the CD’s were, but they were obviously very important for her to have. We used a CD program like Real Player to burn these CD’s. As soon as the CD’s were done burning, we all decided that we were going to go downstairs and outside to enjoy the nice weather outside. My boyfriend sat down and entered the CD with the songs on it in one drive and the blank CD in the other drive, and hit a red button on the computer and let the computer do the rest and had all the songs transfer and burn to the other CD.

Within the chapel walls, I am in a semi-dark room, and not a pinch of sound. In front of me is a baptismal font with a tall white candle, which ultimately reminds all of us at the time of death to remember our baptism. There is another wooden skinny table in front of there with white candles (thirty-three to be exact) to make their presence known during the service. Yes even the killer was remembered. In front of the tables of candles, there is a podium with two candles on each side for students and even the preacher can speak their words.\n \nEach person present at the service had an unlit candle. One student proceeds to the baptismal font and lights his own candle and starts passing it along to the students that were the head of the service. Those students were going pew by pew and gave it to the first student in every row to pass along. The light shines up my face and represents all the life that was lost in the world the day before. I hear sniffles from other people and their eyes filling up with tears. The preacher told us to stand with our candles still lighted so we could name all the people that were lost. The array of light looked extraordinary beautiful and filled with life. In between all the names, there was a musician that had a bell and it rang after every name. That was the most emotional part of the whole service. The students were from all different classes and majors. It just questions your thinking, how could something like this happened and could have it been prevented? I hear all of our voices in unison reciting the Lord’s Prayer and asking God for prayers for the whole university community. Taking all of our prayers and respects up to God (in a church setting), at least for me was the right thing to do. I could sense other students around me doing the same thing by holding each other or patting somebody on the back. Everybody just needs to think how could something like this happened and could it been prevented? The mourning lasts forever, but there is always hope to move on. Our respect was just one of the many things that different universities and colleges were doing around this great nation of ours to show our concern, love, prayers and sympathy to all that are hurting. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gwaa35uehm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03928,41.46229]}},{"properties":{"name":"Clogging Craziness","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324With taps making rhythmic sounds, you can only think you are at a clogging practice.

My feet do a few stomps in between till the very end of the song. My group does a variety songs ranging from country to blue grass to pop music. Whatever we can set a routine to, we go with the flow.

My boyfriend and I tried to decide what we were in the mood for, and we decided to go to a well-known Mexican restaurant. The restaurant we decided to go to is right around the corner from his house. The weather was kind of cool that day, so we were both bundled up with our rain jackets and umbrella just incased it was going to rain. Around the corner, I could see straight ahead of me the sight that said “Pablo’s Mexican Restaurant” with outlines of red and orange rectangles around the sign. Getting up to the door, and going through it, we had to go through a little dining area before getting up to the counter to tell the person at the counter what we would like to eat. \nI am staring up at the light green menu trying to decide what I would like to munch on. I originally wanted to order a chicken enchilada. There was an oval glass up at the counter that you can see what their chicken enchilada looked like. The chicken enchiladas that were wrapped in a corn tortilla filled up with scrumptious green peppers, tomatoes, onions, oregano, and shredded chicken with shredded cheddar cheese along with other water tasting ingredients. Looking through the window just made me want to stick my tongue out and wanted to crave it so badly.

Part of my descent is Mexican, so I gain a lot of respect for the culture and the type of food that Mexican places serve. Even sometimes for special holidays, my family would cook up burritos, tacos or enchiladas for meals and they would be absolutely delicious. My boyfriend does respect my culture and what it has to offer. \nThe restaurant was called El Gordo. The decorations are Mexican-authentic looking and the walls are nicely accessorized with beautiful and gorgeous artwork with beautiful colors on the walls like light oranges and reds. One of my favorite pieces of artwork that stood out to me was this photograph filled with all these chili peppers of all different colors. You would not believe there is so many spices they use within Mexican recipes. Some of those spices can possibly be some of the hottest spices in the world. Looking at this restaurant compared to the other, I definitely felt like I was more in a Mexican setting mainly because even the workers were speaking Spanish and they were definitely from that part of the world. \nThere were a few waitresses wandering around that spoke very little English. They were dressed up kind of like Jennifer Lopez in the Maid in Manhattan movie, which was a gray dress with a white apron with their head nicely put up in a bun. \nIt did not bother me that she was speaking Spanish because their dialect was speaking really slowly. I actually understand a little Spanish from my high school classes. The waitress came up and took our order and I tried to use my little Spanish that I did know to let the waitress know what we wanted. There was Mexican music that was playing very softly in the background. My boyfriend was not that hungry, but I decided to order a burrito. When it was place in front of me, it was one of the biggest burritos I have ever seen. The burrito was intermixed with lettuce, tomatoes, chicken, vegetables, and beans whipped up in a big shell. Our waitress gave us a wicker basket that was filled with Tostitos chips with a side of hot and spicy salsa. Everything that I tasted in the palette of my mouth was amazing and fresh, I could feel the scrumptious food in the stomach being filled. \nWhen it was time to say goodbye, there were tears about leaving my boyfriend and knowing that I would soon be back in about two or three weeks, I tried my very best to stay strong and put on a smile even though I was hurting inside to leave. \nThis is Jenny again. I hope you enjoyed my adventures of traveling to the Chicago-based area. Hopefully there are at least some highlights of my trip that stuck out to you and amazed you.

The location of the show was very confusing to locate, but overall I expected it to be longer. From the costumes and beads, I knew that I was in the right place. While checking out all the pictures, I was able to find some commonalities that describe New Orleans culture. \nColor from the very beginning grabbed my attention. Most of the colors that people wore were blue, black and white. Seeing colors like this surprised me. I expected to see more of the traditional colors (green, gold, and purple), but knowing that this city went through a destructive disaster maybe I should not assume anything. People also were wearing masks, feathers and beads. A surprising side note is that most of the people dressed up in costumes were men. I would think that women would like to celebrate this just as much as men. Men exposing bodily hair were not a particular favorite of mine. Then again, everyone losing everything that people did not have a lot to work with. One picture I could see the mold and dirt blobs on the costumes. I could even tell what costumes were made out of the stitched and sown fabric compared to plastic containers and tarps. \nThe political significance of Katrina just reminded me of all that viewed on television. Accusations against FEMA, our presidential administration, and insurance companies were evident. A lot of mixed emotions were displayed from straight faces to happy smiles. \nA true characteristic of observing New Orleans culture is the use of drugs and alcohol. More than half of the pictures had either a cigarette or a cup filled with alcohol. The two ideas definitely define a party-like occasion. \nWith these three observations through this exhibit, it always made me wonder how a city of this proportionate could be put back on due to the circumstances. I think Mardi Gras can try to get back to where it used to be. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gwa9yy8uq4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03987,41.46468]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kid's Craziness","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl13241755 Harrison Blvd Valparaiso, IN 46385With my pencil hitting the paper, I am intentionally waiting for the kids to come into the down the hallway and into the classroom. Our classroom at St. Paul Catholic School is nicely organized with twenty-five desks, two dry erase boards, baskets filled with books, and cubbies for the kids to put their belongings. I can hear their voices and footsteps trampling down the hall. Kids enter the room with loud voices although I try to ask them to minimize the volume tone. \nConstantly hearing the tattle tale hearing one say, “So and so did this” and the other said “No I did not.” My face is filled with disgust about hearing it. There are tears dripping down faces due to bumping into things or bleeding. I try to comfort them with their injuries with the help of ice cold packs. \nWe try to proceed to the cafeteria in a quiet manner. Many stops would need to be made due to the noise level especially coming from the boy’s line. Children are eager to talk to each other, but get distracted and they do not want to eat all the food that they have in their lunch. Lining up with a tray full of scrumptious delicious food to fill their tummies, they cannot wait to be social. Proceeding to the tables, I try to keep them calm even though with other kids in there it makes the sound become unbearable. By the time a half hour hits, lunch is already over and it is time to dump all the food that is not needed in the garbage can and you hope there is no kid that comes up to my desk and says, “I am still hungry.” I make it really clear that they need to eat in order to prevent that from happening.

There is a case of movies next to the TV with a bunch of movies and we decided to pick from those which movie we were going to watch. There was a bunch of options so we needed to narrow our choices down. We were deciding between Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Click, Just Married or American Pie. We were also trying to figure out what movie we have not seen in awhile. It was a hard decision to choose. \nMy boyfriend and I decided to choose Texas Chain Saw Massacre the Beginning, which is a pretty gruesome movie filled with blood and guts. We were curled close on the couch with a couple of pillows and a blanket. I knew that we needed to stay close because we never knew when the movie was going to get scary. No movie watching was going to go along without having some Farm Hard Lemonade (maybe kind of similar to Mike’s Hard Lemonade). I think we wanted to go beyond the snacks that go with usual movie watching which is of course pop and popcorn. Knowing that Farm Hard Lemonade, we knew right there it was not high in alcohol count so we knew it was perfect for watching a movie. It would end up that we would not get too distracted from watching this movie. Both of our eyes were gazing into the TV trying to make out with what the movie was showing, and there was no conversation during the movie. We wanted to make sure that we were both paying enough attention because if we did not we would miss a big part of the movie. \nWith the lights turned out to minimize the dim effect, I do remember the most gruesome part of the movie. I especially remember a part when a man tried to avenge the murder of his girlfriend and he got knocked out and fill on the top of the chainsaw and chainsaw started and sliced throughout his body. Through being scared, I had to hide my eyes on my boyfriend’s shoulders. He had his arm around him so I could hide my face and not to look at the TV during the gross parts. He asked me, “If I was okay?” “I am okay just kind of scared” I said. Also from finishing the lemonade, I drank some Smirnoff’s Ice while my bones were shaking in the chair praying not to get scared.

This party was partially about our one year anniversary that I had with my boyfriend. Some of his favorite music is from this band called Crematory. The reason why he likes this certain type of music is because it is something different than the traditional hip hop beat like most groups have. They offer a new twist to the music industry and he likes the beats and music that this group offers. \nI know this is something very dangerous to do, but there is a unique way on how my boyfriend and I met.

I decided that I just wanted to stay within the square because if I went outside of it, my opinion would be too widespread and go off on too many tangents. The first thing I noticed walking out of the South Bend Chocolate Café, which is on the east part of the square, with a nice little setting, that all four traffic lights around the square are black. Only one is blinking on the southeastern part of the square between the Old Jail Museum and the police station. Also, hanging next to the traffic lights are green road signs that say Franklin, Washington, Indiana, and Lincolnway. In the downtown square, there is a definite direction pattern in which all drivers including tourists would have to follow. The signs are usually posted between the two traffic lights or on the traffic light post, so travelers be aware of your direction. \nWith the courthouse planted in the middle of the square, it definitely fits in with the architecture of the town. Most of the windows on the courthouse and even capturing within the whole town are either rectangular shaped or have the rectangular with the circular top. I could definitely see these window shapes in other places around the square including people’s apartments on top of the stores which range from Jano Bike Shop to Old Style Inn for families to sit down and enjoy meals together or where people can buy special valuables by peeking into the windows of Martin Binder Jewelers. All of the stores mainly on the north part of the square have a different variety of color and style starting with a dark green sign for Engstrom Jewelers to the hot pink with Bangel’s Accessories, which is a clothing store for women. \nThe courthouse is planted directly in the middle of the square with some distinct features surrounding it. The first thing that stands out to me is the stone that makes up the foundation of the building. Above the main entrance, there are pretty bulky pillars, which kind of reminded me of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. Also, in the front of the building I see three flags (one is USA, one is Indiana, the other one is a black POW Mania). There is rectangular parking around the courthouse and have benches near the sidewalks incase people need to sit down and take a break. Two benches that stood out to me are in a swivel shape with different artistic designs. The one has blocks of different colors like yellow, pink and blue and has pictures of cell phones and CD’s. The other bench has a light blue background that illustrates different places and events that go on in town, it even has the chapel tower at Valparaiso University (which coincidence is where I go to school) also it has the ruby slippers connected with the Wizard of Oz Festival and also popcorn kernels with the Popcorn Festival, both held every September. Benches like these give a unique look to downtown Valparaiso.  you’re coming out of any entrance of the courthouse, people can find walkways to lead you to all four corners of the square. \nThere are also lamp posts that exuberate some light on the night downtown scene. There are three different clocks that I noticed so I think from all corners of the square everybody can be updated on the time. Hopefully this makes people be attracted to come to downtown Valparaiso and see the interesting architecture and scenery.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gwaa094oel"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.06045,41.46757]}},{"properties":{"name":"What a Mini Fun Night","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> My friends and I are trying to decide what is a fun activity? My friend Jeff suggests, “Let’s go play Mini Golf at the fun center.” I always like to play Mini Golf in my spare time, and since I haven’t been there in a while, we all decided to make a night of it. We were sitting at the traffic light to turn into the parking lot and find a space to park. We proceed up to the building in back of the parking lot to get our clubs and golf balls. We nominated J.-P., my boyfriend to keep score since he was an expert at math. My golf ball was yellow. Jeff’s was blue. Brittney’s ball was green. J.-P.’s was red. \r\nNext to the building to get all the supplies was the putting green, there were two different trails (North and South). We decided to take the North Trail. Some of the holes were more complicated than others. One hole I remember the hole in a caved in part of the green. I had to remind myself on that hole not to hit it to hard or else it was not going to stay there and roll into the hole eventually. Some other holes had painted houses on the greens and whichever person had to shoot it up into the metal shoot and have it drop down to the next level. Once again, another hole that was completely complicated. The whole Mini Golf course had short light stands with two lights. The lights were different colors and it was pretty to see all the neat color combinations. All of us had to be very careful because there were streams next to some of the holes so we needed to make sure that our aim on our golf balls was pretty accurate.\r\n For most of the holes, I was getting an average of two strokes per hole. Jeff was getting approximately four strokes. J.-P. was usually two to three strokes. Brittney was averaging around three to four strokes per hole. We really did not care who was going to win because we just wanted to go out there and have fun. The last hole (which most of you know is the eighteenth hole) set up a certain challenge. There was a hole that was kind of on a little steep hill that you need to aim your golf ball too. If you hit the hole in wall, you would win a free round of Mini Golf on your next visit. Making sure that nobody cheated, they had a fence a couple feet in front of us with an open part so nobody would go up and cheat. Jeff, Brittney and I were unsuccessful of making it. J.-P. was able to make the hole one. That lucky duck he is. JP proceeded to go and sit on a bench nearby to total up the scores. I did not want to be antsy and go and see what he was adding up. The final result was JP beat me by two strokes. I was actually a little upset because I thought I had a wonderful game the whole way through. Although, I need to realize that we just had fun and I was not going to ruin the night for everyone. I am just hoping we can come back and have the same fun experience again.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gwaab37i3g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.46559,41.51912]}},{"properties":{"name":"Woah that is a Big Journal","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324I am about to take part on a creative play experience surrounding by tons of children ranging from five to ten years old.

For props, there is a big journal on stage that looks like one of those black and white journals filled with paperclips and a title \"Important Beezewax.\" The start character in the play is Junie B. Jones. \r\n\r\nI personally never read Junie B. Jones before, so I did not know what to expect. Junie B.

The big journal on stage folded out into different scenes ranging from a classroom to a kick ball tournament. \r\n\r\nThe journal is supposedly how Junie B. Jones communicates her thoughts. Through my eyes, the actors were filled with energy and had the most gorgeous voices. I even had a nice laugh at times. The lights were extensively dim while the lights were intensily shining on the actors on the stage. \r\n\r\nLeaving from that energetic performance, I would definitely want to go back and see another performance.
