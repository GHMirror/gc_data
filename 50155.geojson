Incorporated in 1989, AWS was founded with a vision of this “forgotten river” attaining the status of swimmable and fishable.\n\nThrough volunteer restoration activities, residents of the Anacostia watershed have been provided with an opportunity to get involved; they have invested their time in a cause, actively working for a positive change. AWS also provides advocacy and coalition building skills to emerging as well as established grass roots organizations within the Anacostia River communities. By assisting local groups, partnerships are formed and efforts to protect the local environment as well as focus decision makers are strengthened.\n\nSince its inception in 1989, AWS has mobilized over 30,000 volunteers who have planted over 11,300 trees and stenciled 1,008 storm-drains within the watershed as well as removed 458 tons of debris and over 7,500 tires from the watershed. Furthermore, AWS has educated 14,535 people with its slide presentation which explains the river’s history and the current threats it faces, as well as the different lifestyle choices and changes citizens can undertake to improve the condition of the watershed. In addition to these education and restoration events, AWS has introduced 8,200 people, of which 4,500 were children, to the river through paddling clinics, canoe adventures and pontoon boat tours along the “Kingfisher Canoe Trail,” a scenic five-mile stretch of the Anacostia River. All AWS programs teach citizens that they are integral participants in the restoration and preservation of this urban river.\n\nThe fruit of AWS\\' educational and grass roots organizing efforts is to develop an enlightened community of citizen stakeholders who are aware of their connection to the natural world and who work to promote the healing of the Anacostia River and its watershed communities. It seems that urban children, often residing in neighborhoods similar to many of those in the Anacostia watershed, have limited opportunities and sometimes turn to unhealthy or dysfunctional activities to fill their time. They have little or no regular contact with the natural world and are consequently insulated from the beauty and character-forming influences that can be found in nature. AWS’ work with urban children assists in the development of an informed and empowered generation of young people. The students are made aware of their connection to the natural world and thus begin to work to promote the healing of themselves as well as the river.\n\nAWS receives 48% of its funding from foundation grants, 20% from federal grants, 23% from cash contributions and 9% from miscellaneous contributions. The key to the Anacostia Watershed Society’s success is its large and growing network of citizen volunteers.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65grurl88wx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.941204,38.940886]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bladensburg waterfront Park","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Bladensburg Waterfront ParkMNCPPC park, built 2000, cost 0,000,000.\nalso many other improvements to River and pedestrian bridge.\nBladensburg Waterfront Park\n4601 Annapolis Road\nBladensburg, MD 20710\n301-779-0371; \n\nladensburg Waterfront Park, formerly known as Bladensburg Marina, is a newly revitalized park along the Anacostia River, nestled among the Port Towns of Bladensburg, Colmar Manor and Cottage City.

Although our three towns share contingent boundaries and a common “main street,\" Rhode Island Avenue/Route One, history often separated us by class and race. Eager to explore common interests and bridge these divisions, residents of the three towns began meeting as early as 1995 to discuss how we could work together for the betterment of our communities.
