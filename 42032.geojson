I worked all summer at McDonalds to pay for it.  It was awesome.  My parents wanted me to wear a helmet so they made me a deal that they would pay for it if I rode it in training.  I said sure but would always ditch it under our VW van when I headed out for a training ride.  On this day I t-boned a Camaro that failed to signal, broke my left arm so badly that I had to pick my left hand up with my right (it was only attached by skin).  My right hand hit the ground so hard that I was left with a \"burst wound\" on my index finger (think hotdog in a microwave too long).  I moved myself to the grass by the side of the street and laid down, gave my phone number to someone  and waited for the ambulance.  When my parents backed the car out of the driveway there was my helmet,  my Mom supposedly fainted.  Amazingly, the bike was fine.    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l74ftbaop0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.099159,39.075718]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where I was on 9/11/2001","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.musicgeek.net\" href=\"http://www.musicgeek.net\">Heavyj</a>7312 se knight st portland, orOur rented house on the edge of Mt Scott Park.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l74flqsmdq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.587751,45.480165]}},{"properties":{"name":"a bridge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.musicgeek.net\" href=\"http://www.musicgeek.net\">Heavyj</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/e607e9096cab1a9f6c0eba620f17a794.jpg\">1900 n. interstate ave. portland,orthe steel bridge as seen from interstate near the PPS headquarters<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l74fqxnbkr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.672911,45.535243]}},{"properties":{"name":"a you are here sign","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.musicgeek.net\" href=\"http://www.musicgeek.net\">Heavyj</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/1/126467362_7d7d65b778.jpg?v=0\">4001 SW Canyon Rd.
