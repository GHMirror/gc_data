To go with the quartet of flavors offered (chocolate, vanilla, and two flavors that change on a weekly basis), Big J\\'s offers loads of choices for toppings and how you want your custard served, from milkshakes to their \"Hurricanes,\" a blended mix of custard and toppings.\n\nWe had the privilege of eating both peanut butter and almond praline frozen custards, the two featured flavors of the week. While the peanut butter flavor wasn\\'t as strong as it could have been, the thick and almost chewy texture of the custard was still pleasant. The almond praline was the first of the four flavors we completely devoured, a testament to its delightfulness.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5znn0vuv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.836043,33.822721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bilboquet","description":"Posted by Fritz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/bilboquet2.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 1311 rue Bernard oeust, Montreal, CanadaThe most delicious ice cream in Montreal.

It seems there\\'s always a stream of people coming in and out of the store, a line forming all the way to the corner of the intersection where Chantilly sits. These people don\\'t seem to mind that they\\'re not at the Haagen-Dazs store just around the corner.\n\nWhat we loved above all at Chantilly were the cotton candy and strawberry cheesecake flavors. The cotton candy is a fun, almost bubble gum flavor with bright, colorful bursts of candy. We were giddy as children while we were eating this.\n\nThe strawberry cheesecake ice cream offers a very subdued cheesecake flavor, one that becomes more evident as the ice cream melts on your tongue. It\\'s light enough to have at least two scoops without getting sick of it, its wispiness contrasted by a strong strawberry flavor that complements its perfectly.\n\nThese flavors at Chantilly alone are worth the painstaking effort of trying to find parking in the nearby congested streets.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5zqw0loe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.783268,33.542061]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delicias de Mexico","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/icecream11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/icecream13.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 13466 Harbor Blvd, Garden Grove, CA714-636-7163\n\nWhile we\\'re used to ice cream flavors like the standard vanilla and chocolate, it\\'s at Delicias de Mexico in Garden Grove where the brave can really venture out and try a surprising array of flavors, from a scoop made from the tropical Mamay fruit, to a corn flavored \"paleta de leche,\" or ice cream bar.\n\nA standout in this store is the Chongos ice cream, which is like tried and true vanilla ice cream with a twist: There\\'s a hint of cinnamon in each spoonful, along with tiny, chewy flecks of sweet curded milk candy. On this hot day, the Chongos ice cream didn\\'t even have time to melt before we wolfed it down.\n\nAnd while this place has by far some of the most creative ice cream flavors, it does right by us in the standard flavors as well. Cookies and cream is a tasty surprise, with a sweet, soft vanilla flavor countered by crunchy, almost salty chocolate cookies. Out of all the scoops of cookies and cream we ate, Delicias de Mexico\\'s was the favorite.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5zpf9rz3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.920267,33.76646]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dippin' Dots","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/dippin.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 5101 Charter 18011 Newhope Street, Suite D, Fountain Valley, CAYou can get a whopping 30 servings tub of Delicious Dippin\\' Dots for party with flavors like banana split, cotton candy, mint chocolate, and peanut butter chip.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5zl4a964"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.928609,33.730738]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gelato Amore","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/201296710_15421dd86f.jpg\">4187 Campus Dr, Irvine, CAGelato Amore (949) 872-2488<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5zeka65i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.84024,33.649737]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gelato Classico","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/icecream6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 2756 E Pacific Coast Hwy, Corona Del Mar, CAA dense, decadent treat that has less fat than ice cream? It sounds almost too good to be true.\n\nBut thank heavens, it\\'s not. At Gelato Classico in Corona Del Mar, flavors are rich and vibrant. The difference between gelato and ice cream is that gelato is made with milk, ice cream is made with cream. Ice cream also has air added into it to achieve it\\'s consistency, while gelato has no air added at all, making it more dense.\n\nHere, one of the flavors to try is Coppa Mista, a blend of vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut and pistachio. Each flavor is impressive enough to stand alone, but when layered together, the final product has amazing depth. Also worth trying are a sinful burgundy cherry that made us feel regal when eating it, and the raspberry sorbetto, almost as romantic as the Italian language itself.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5zkxmun8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.872788,33.601584]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gelato Paridiso Authentic","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/gelato_nb.jpg\">401 Newport Center Dr, Newport Beach, CAGelato Paridiso Authentic (949) 718-9800<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5zqjwid0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.873184,33.614184]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hans' Homemade Ice Cream","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/190258396_eddc3ae44e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/190258542_465ef97e3a.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 3640 S Bristol St, Santa Ana, CAHans\\' Homemade Ice Cream (714) 979-8815<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lj5zjj48a6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.885664,33.699402]}},{"properties":{"name":"Joe's Italian Ice","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/JoesSmall.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 12302 Harbor Blvd, Garden Grove, CAFor years, Philadelphia residents have flocked to Joe\\'s Italian Ice in midst of summer heat waves, and in 2002, a Joe\\'s opened in Garden Grove at a place that looks like it used to be a taco stand. The red, white and green exterior is definitely an homage to Italy, but under this festive roof is where the real heart of the shop is. Flavors of Italian ice are made with real fruit juice, and there are dozens of them, from Apple Cider to Wild Cherry.\r\n\r\nThe sour watermelon is a bright cherry red, its intense color almost matching its flavor. This flavor packs a punch, making your face involuntarily pucker and leaving your tongue almost a bright a red as the ice itself.\r\n\r\nOther standouts were a cantaloupe Italian ice, like eating a frozen version of the mellow fruit. The mango flavor is every bit as refreshing as its fruit as well.\r\n\r\nItalian ice\\'s here are served in wax paper cups, and the small size can probably satiate most people.
