Within a few years, she was walking with difficulty and a weakness in her face caused her lip to droop on one side. Throughout the remainder of her life, Lidwina\\'s condition slowly deteriorated, although with apparent periods of remission. During her life and subsequently, Lidwina\\'s forbearance with her symptoms led to the development of a cult. She was canonised in 1890 and is now the patron saint of skaters. The bones of St Lidwina were discovered in 1947 and do show evidence of restricted mobility in the legs and right arm. Though it had previously been suggested that St Lidwina had MS, doubts have been cast on this and the evidence is not considered persuasive.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6nkl7bi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.400126,51.918025]}},{"properties":{"name":"1822","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Augustus.jpg\">London, EnglandThe first identifiable instance of MS does not occur until the early 19th century. Augustus d\\'Este (1794-1848) was a grandson of George III. The course of his MS, which wasn\\'t diagnosed during his lifetime, is known from the diaries and records he kept from 1822 until shortly before his death. D\\'Este\\'s initial symptom was the onset of blurred vision, which cleared up without treatment and then recurred a few years later. He later had episodes of double vision, weakness in his legs, numbness, bladder and bowel problems and impotence. By 1843 he was experiencing persistent symptoms including tremor and nocturnal spasms and in his last years became confined to his bed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6oyg0fi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"1838","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Robert_Carswell.jpg\">London, EnglandRobert Carswell (1793-1857) The first important step toward a recognition of the pathology of MS came with a discovery by Robert Carswell, a pathologist of the mid 19th century. During a postmortem, Carswell found strange lesions in the spinal cord of an unfortunate subject. Unaware of their cause, he meticulously recorded their gross appearance. Despite his major contribution in describing the pathology of MS lesions, Carswell did not record any clinical associations with his observations. The clinical symptoms of MS were not linked to the \\'diseased\\' state Carswell described until much later.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6e5t8ql"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"1842","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Cruveilhier.png\">Paris, FranceJean Cruveilhier (1791 - 1874) An eminent Parisian anatomist who also lived through the mid 19th century. Cruveilhier, like Robert Carswell, described the pathology of the lesions seen in MS and although the two men worked independently, their illustrations appeared almost simultaneously. Much debate exists as to which illustration was made first. However, Cruveilhier\\'s version, seen in this slide, was not published until 1842.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6hg1d3g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.350966,48.856558]}},{"properties":{"name":"1849","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Friedrich_von_Frerichs.jpg\">GermanyFriedrich von Frerichs (1819-1885) In 1849, the German pathologist Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs, brought medical recognition of MS a step closer by elaborating on the clinical description of MS provided by Cruveilhier and identifying specific symptoms and key features of the illness. Frerichs\\' clinical account for the first time recognised remissions as a characteristic feature of MS. In addition, he described nystagmus as a symptom of the disease, this physical sign later being incorporated into the famous Charcot\\'s triad. Frerichs also made a major contribution by providing the first medical description of mental disorders in MS, recognising the possible impact of the disease on cognitive and other higher functions of the brain.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6t50jmg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[10.451526,51.165691]}},{"properties":{"name":"1857","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Carl_Rokitansky.jpg\">Vienna, AustriaCarl Rokitansky (1804  1878) One of the most outstanding morphological pathologists of the 19th century.

Without doubt, Charcot was one of the most important characters in the history of MS, his findings representing a huge breakthrough for the clinical understanding of the disease. Charcot was the first to make definite links between the hitherto mysterious symptomatology, now known to be MS, and the pathological changes seen in post-mortem samples. For the first time, almost forty years after the discovery of the lesions, the clinical condition was described by Charcot as \\'sclrose en plaques\\' and MS as recognised as a distinct disease entity. Charcot also gave the first complete histological account of MS lesions, describing many important features including loss of myelin and proliferation of glial fibres and nuclei.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6fsy1tc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.350966,48.856558]}},{"properties":{"name":"1878","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Ranvier.jpg\">Lyon, FranceMyelin Discovered by Louis Ranvier<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6q6l1uc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.834393,45.767306]}},{"properties":{"name":"1884","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Pierre_Marie.gif\">Paris, FrancePierre Marie (1853-1940)  provided the next great step in the history of MS, by suggesting for the first time that the disease might be caused by an infectious agent.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6mcyekj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.350966,48.856558]}},{"properties":{"name":"1916","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/edinburgh.jpg\">Edinburgh, ScotlandDetailed microscopic description made by James Dawson revealed the basic damage done in MS<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6hn1zln"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.2,55.950001]}},{"properties":{"name":"1919","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/london_england.jpg\">London, EnglandBruce Fredrick Cummings (1889 - 1919) Cummings was tragically afflicted with MS and fought a constant battle against his progressive disability. Under the pseudonym WNP Barbellion, Cummings gave a moving personal account of his suffering in his book The Journal of a Disappointed Man, published in 1919. The book remains one of the finest personal testimonies of an MS sufferer, with the entries detailing the gradual incapacitation brought by the disease. Cummings eloquently highlights the cruelty of MS and his grief at being relentlessly robbed of his physical abilities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6kbuhjw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"1930","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Dr_Russell_Brain.jpg\">London, EnglandDr Russell Brain (1895-1966) Brain went on to produce a textbook entitled Diseases of the Nervous System which contained a section on MS. The textbook was first published in 1933 and then regularly revised by Brain himself until his death in 1966. rain was the first to collect statistical data concerning the incidence and course of MS. He also gave lucid accounts of the underlying pathology, so accurate that they still stand almost unchanged today. Developments in treatment for MS can be followed from the clinical narratives in each edition. His comprehension of MS was extremely precise and many of the opinions and predictions expressed in his earlier work have since been proved correct.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6je5b19"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"1944","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Derek_Denny_Brown.jpg\">Cambridge, MADerek Denny-Brown (1901 - 1981) a professor of Neurology working at Harvard, USA, provided the key to this uncertainty from experiments on damaged peripheral neurons. Denny-Brown observed that when a damaged nerve was stimulated, it failed to pass the impulse to the connected muscle. He concluded that it was the demyelination associated with lesions on the nerve that was responsible for the block in conduction. Demyclination was therefore shown to prevent or slow the conduction of impulses through a nerve.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6ggqgqi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.105,42.365]}},{"properties":{"name":"1946","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/sylvia.gif\">New York City, NYThe National MS Society founded by Sylvia Lawry<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6g1752r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"1948","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Elvin_A_Kabat.jpg\">New York City, NYElvin A Kabat (1914 - 2000) During the 1940s Dr Elvin Kabat was investigating the immunological response seen in all MS patients. Based at the Department of Neurology, Columbia University, USA, Kabat used the recently developed technique of electrophoresis to study samples from MS patients. Kabat compared the electrophoretic pattern of proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from controls and MS patients and found that the CSF from MS patients contained an increased proportion of gamma globulins. Kabat\\'s key finding confirmed an immunological component in MS, a concept first postulated in the late 19th century. Subsequent research has tried to understand why the immune system generates this inappropriate response and potential treatments have focused on trying to suppress the immunological activity which leads to demyelination.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6om0fyp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"1953","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a>Cleveland, OHThe Ohio Buckeye Chapter is founded!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6g8rfyn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.695556,41.499444]}},{"properties":{"name":"1965","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a>New York City, NYDefinite criteria for MS diagnosis developed by NMSS expert committee<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6nu1xi7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"1978","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/John_W_Prineas.jpg\">Newark, NJJohn W Prineas (1937-present) used specialised light and electron microscopy techniques to examine the detailed histology of MS lesions, providing clues about their pathogenesis. It had already been shown that MS lesions contain lymphocytes and plasma cells, suggesting the existence of a local immune response to an unknown antigen, but Prineas\\'s observations led him to conclude that both macrophages and microglial cells are required for the digestion of myelin. Prineas\\'s studies also suggest that within chronic lesions there is a continued expression and processing of antigen in the absence of fresh lesion formation.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6n427ud"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.172778,40.735556]}},{"properties":{"name":"1981","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Ian_R_Young.jpg\">London, EnglandIan R Young (1932-present) published an article demonstrating the effective application of MRI in the diagnosis of MS.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67iy6fitgqa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"1986","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\" href=\"http://www.msohiobuckeye.org\">Mpenn1</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Robert_I_Grossman.jpg\">Philadelphia, PARobert I Grossman (1945-present) found that when using the enhancing agent gadolinium-DPTA, some MRI lesions enhance while others do not.
