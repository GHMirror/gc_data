And very French. It\\'s a friendly, extremely competitive tournament and amazingly well attended, with prize pools regularly topping k and up (200 runners +).\n\nWHERE IS IT HELD?\n\nClub Poker recognises PokerStars as being the number one site for tournament poker, and so naturally chose to organize their competitions there. Because of their close relationship with \\'Stars they are able to offer larger starting stacks, longer levels, and often Pokerstars \\'big names\\' like Tom McEvoy and Isabelle Mercier jump in to their tourneys and have a go with the rest of us. \n\nOn top of all that, all tournaments results are tracked over the course of the year and the overall champion receives a fully paid up entry to the EPT (European Poker Tour) in Deauville in 2007.\n\nAll group members are welcome to come and have a go if they think they\\'re hard enough.
