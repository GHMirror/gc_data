The palace holds state events, royal entertaining and it is a major tourist attraction. It is a national landmark that is very special to the British people. It was originally known as Buckingham House and was the centerpiece, which the palace was built around. It was built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 and bought by George III in 1761 for himself. It officially became the royal palace of the British monarch when Queen Victoria came to power in 1837. When he owned the house it was known as “The Queen’s House”. Later it was sometimes called “Buck House”. John Nash and Edward Blore enlarged it over the years. The last additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th century. \r\n\r\nIn the early 19th-century interior designers used bright blues and pink lapis. Many smaller rooms are furnished with a Chinese style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House following the death of King George IV. The staterooms form the center of the working Palace and are used regularly by Queen Elizabeth II and members of the royal family for official and state entertaining.

Jackson St, Chicago, IllinoisRoute 66 is also known as U.S. Route 66, The Main Street of America, The Mother Road and the Will Rogers Highway. It is one of the first federal routes. US 66 was finished on November 11, 1926, but signs did not go up until the following year. It originally ran from Chicago, Illinois, through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, before ending in Los Angeles. It was a total of 2,448 miles long. It was not completely paved until 1938. Avery, one of the founders, wanted the route to have a round number so he asked if the number could be 60, but because of other routes Avery setteled on 66. This number would make it easier to remember and to say.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the end for Route 66 came in 1956 when they signed the Interstate Highway Act given by President Dwight Eisenhower. When Eisenhower was a general fighting in the Euoropean theater during World War II he was impressed by Germany’s high speed highways, which they called Autobahnen. Eisenhower wanted a similar system of roads for the US in which one could easily drive at a high speed from one end of the country to the other without stopping. This would also make it easier to move troops if there was a national emergency. \r\n\r\nThroughout its 60 years of existence, Route 66 was always changing. As highway engineering became more advanced, engineers constantly found more direct routes between cities and towns. When there was an increase in traffic Illinois began widening US 66 to four lanes through the intire state.. By the early-to-mid 1950s, Missouri also increased its sections of US 66 to four lanes with bypasses. Most of the newer four-lane 66 paving in both states was upgraded to freeway status in later years.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6225wlahvyw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.617442,41.878297]}},{"properties":{"name":"Savannah, Georgia","description":"Posted by Copperboom11<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/savannah_forsyth_park_dscf8610_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/trip_2003_04_02_GA_Savannah_Typical_tree_lined_walk_640.jpg\">Savannah, GeorgiaSavannah, Georgia was established in 1733 and was the first colonial and state capital of Georgia.

It is located in the rione of Trevi. In 1629 Pope Urban VIII found that the earlier fountain was insufficiently dramatic and asked Bernini to sketch new designs, but when the Pope died the project was abandoned. In 1730 Pope Clement XII came up with a contest in which Nicola Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei but because the Romans were complaining that a Florentine won Salvi was awarded the commission wnyway. Work began in 1732, and the fountain was completed in 1762, which was long after Clement\\'s death.Salvi died in 1751 so with his work half-finished, before he died, he made sure a barber’s sign would not spoil his hard work so he hide his sculpture under a vase. The Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Giuseppe Pannini. The fountain was restored in 1998 in which the stonework was scrubbed and the fountain provided with recirculating pumps.\t\r\n\r\nTaming of the waters is the theme of the gigantic scheme. One legend is that if a visitor throws a coin into the fountain they will return to Rome and if you throw two coins a marriage will occur soon. Then if you throw three coins it will lead to a divorce. It is also lucky to throw three coins with your right hand over your left shoulder. About 3,000 Euros are trown in the fountain each day and are collected at night. The money is used to help the needy in Rome. It is illegal to swim in the fountain but that didn’t stop a 40 year old tourist, Roberta from Milan. On April, 22 2007 he jumped in saying, “I was hot. The water belongs to everyone.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6225wdcimwg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.5024414062,41.869560827]}},{"properties":{"name":"Willamsburg, Virginia","description":"Posted by Copperboom11<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/williamsburg025s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/Colonial_Williamsburg_Duke_of_Gloucester_Street.jpg\">Willamsburg, VirginiaWilliamsburg is a city located on the Virginia Peninsula in southeastern Virginia.
