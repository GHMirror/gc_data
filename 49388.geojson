Long located in Elizabeth City County, Virginia near the downtown area of the lost town of Phoebus, Virginia, in modern times, it is located in the Buckroe section of the independent city of Hampton adjacent to Fort Monroe and Old Point Comfort. It fronts the mouth of Hampton Roads at the Chesapeake Bay.\nMore information can be found at may be found at http://www.hampton.gov.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vycgjls6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.2893629074,37.042298454]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chicks Beach, Virginia Beach, VA","description":"Posted by Jalbertbowdenii<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/07/1/chicksbeach.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Chesapeake Beach, also known as Chic\\'s Beach and Chicks Beach, is a stretch of beaches running about two miles from the Lynnhaven Inlet to just west of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel in Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA. What originated as a lookout post during war, the beaches eventually turned to more recreational activities. The area developed in the early 1900s as a beachfront residential community. Chic\\'s was a place where you could pick up limeade and an ice cream. Eventually, this site became what is now Alexanders on the Bay.

Along with Fort Calhoun, later renamed Fort Wool, it guarded approach by sea of the navigational shipping channel between the Chesapeake Bay and the entrance to the harbor of Hampton Roads, VA. \nBeginning by 1609, fortifications had been established at Old Point Comfort during Virginia\\'s first two centuries. However, the much more substantial facility of stone to become known as Fort Monroe (and adjacent Fort Wool on a man-made island across the channel) were completed in 1834. The principal facility was named in honor of U.S. President James Monroe. Throughout the American Civil War (1861-1865), although most of Virginia became part of the Confederate States of America, Fort Monroe remained in Union hands. It became notable as a historic and symbolic site of early freedom for former slaves under the provisions of contraband policies and later the Emancipation Proclamation. For several years thereafter, the former Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, was imprisoned in the area now known as the Casemate Museum on the base.\n\nCompletely surrounded by a moat, the six-sided stone fort is the only one of its kind left in the United States that is still an active Army post. Fort Monroe is one of several posts selected to be closed by September 2011. Many of its functions are being transferred to nearby Fort Eustis (which itself was named for Fort Monroe\\'s first commander, General Abraham Eustis, a noted artillery expert). Several re-use plans for Fort Monroe after it is decommissioned are currently under development in the Hampton community.\nFort Monroe supports a daytime population of about 2,096, including 1,105 people in uniform, 1,991 civilian and contract employees, and about 814 family members residing on post. The major tenant unit is the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).\nThe Department of Defense released a list on 13 May 2005, of military installations recommended for closure and/or realignment--among them is Fort Monroe. The list was approved by President George W. Bush on 15 September 2005, and submitted to Congress. Congress failed to act within forty-five legislative days to disapprove the list in its entirety, and the BRAC recommendations subsequently became law. Installations on the BRAC list must close within six years.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vyh8to05"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.3093185,37.0063911]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fort Wool - Fort Calhoun - Rip Rap Shoals","description":"Posted by Jalbertbowdenii<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vy99psjg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.3005638123,36.98623718]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grand View Nature Preserve","description":"Posted by Jalbertbowdenii<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vyc68fga"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.2805652618,37.094484576]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grandview Beach","description":"Posted by Jalbertbowdenii<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/07/1/grandview_beach_hampton_va_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vydvw2xn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.2775182724,37.0741143458]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Point Comfort Lighthouse","description":"Posted by Jalbertbowdenii<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vye0phhf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.3065934181,37.0017986719]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salt Ponds Beach","description":"Posted by Jalbertbowdenii<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/07/1/white_marsh_hampton_va.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vyhd5rl4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.279771328,37.0692007064]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salt Ponds Beach","description":"Posted by Jalbertbowdenii<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/07/1/salt_ponds_hampton_va.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2vy2hrbwb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.2830972672,37.0568895288]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/708183","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jalbertbowdenii","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jalbertbowdenii","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/708183","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=708183,platial:user=jalbertbowdenii","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":49388}
