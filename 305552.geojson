Feed a half-inch of the string inside the roll and tape it down, so that the string hangs out of the bottom of the paper towel's opening. With a partner, one person should, standing at the fifty yard line, look through the paper towel roll up to the top of the goal post. While the first person holds still, the second person should take a standard 180 degree protractor and hold it along the bottom of the paper towel roll so that the \"0\" degree mark aligns with the opening of the roll. The string will hang down, aligning with a value on the protractor thus creating an obtuse angle with the bottom edge of the elevated protractor as the angle's base.
