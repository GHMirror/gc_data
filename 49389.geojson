A man doing construction work hammering sheet metal to create a new seawall on the condo complex. A man not wearing protective gear. A man wearing a butt-floss-and-banana-hammock thong to work.

Bolinas is a wacky little town that is loathe to promote tourism, so much so that it\\'s residents go out to the main road and steal the road sign showing how to get there. Not to be deterred by a little thing like locals not wanting us around, we did the obligatory couple of U-turns required to get on the right road and headed in to see it for ourselves.\n\nFirst impression: cute. Lots of little gardens and hand painted signs and whatnot. The beach has an interesting sign poking out of the water reading \"GROIN.\" Not sure what that means, but it\\'s funnier imagining what it might mean, so we didn\\'t ask anyone.\n<a href=\"http://www.roamingiomi.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=36&amp;Itemid=14\"> read the whole entry on Roaming Iomi</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vtmexqze8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.686295,37.904573]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ethiopia I- Getting There","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/0/926725891_9801ac33a1.jpg\">45020 Aviation Drive Sterling, Virginia Around hour six, I got bored of wandering around and sat down by a big television set. It was tuned to CNN international and I sat in a chair with other layover folks like me. About half of them were Ethiopian Americans and the rest were from all over. The breaking news at 4:00 in the morning was that Paris Hilton had been freed from jail. CNN was playing the story on an endless loop, with live updates and the strangest, most empty interviews I\\'ve ever seen. The british interviewers kept asking, \"So, why exactly is she famous?\" and the poor harried correspondent who was reporting live from the jail parking lot surrounded by screaming fans was like, \"Uh, I don\\'t know, I guess it\\'s hard to explain, maybe it\\'s a cultural thing... she\\'s not really famous for anything in particular...\" The interviewers seemed baffled and the correspondent seemed vaguely ashamed.\n\nI remember years ago when I was leaving the country for my first trip to Europe, the international waiting room at SFO was playing an endless loop of the OJ Simpson trial. Another time when I was leaving for Israel, it was an endless loop of Monica Lewinsky. Sometimes I wish that airports wouldn\\'t play the news just before you leave the country, I wish they\\'d play something that could make me feel a little better about my home country, some kind of cultural achievement or at least the Simpsons or something. Something that wouldn\\'t make me wonder if I\\'d be asked humiliating questions about why we focus so much on stupid things when there is actually relevant news occurring elsewhere in the world. Sometimes it\\'s hard to remember from here that even if we aren\\'t so interested in watching them, the rest of the world is watching us, and when you travel you may be expected to answer to why we focus on such inane stuff. After wasting a good 45 minutes watching a seemingly endless loop of the Paris story, I had had enough and I gathered up the Suitcase Monster and continued my rounds around the airport.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.roamingiomi.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=1\">Read the rest of this entry on Roaming Iomi</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vtmbk2as2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.44878,38.958296]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ethiopia II- A very very very fine house","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/0/838852750_850e4ccb2c.jpg\">Addis Ababa, EthiopiaWe pulled our luggage out of the trunk and stood on the cobblestone sidewalk in a daze (keep in mind we had been traveling for something like three days straight). We were standing somewhere in the middle of a half mile long stretch of rusted corrugated tin fence. He said, \"Welcome home!\" and told us that this was where he grew up, that we were at his family home.\n\nThere was no doorway or house in sight.\n\nWe were confused, but, you know- going with the flow.\n\nHe rustled around in his pockets and came up with a key, I had no idea what this key was going to do for us- open the pile of rocks next to the corrugated metal fence?\n\nThen he walked down a few steps and approached the fence. He reached up into a crack and pulled out a wire with a switch on it. He pressed the switch and we could hear that it was a doorbell. Huh?\n\nJust below and to the left of that switch, I realized that there was a rectangle cut into the tin... and a handle! With a lock! It was a very well-camoflauged door. We were standing across the street from a row of mud huts and as we stood there deliriously we wondered what was behind the secret door. Trucks and cars passed by spewing noxious black smoke, and passersby stared at us.\n\nJust as he was going to open the door, the door opened on it\\'s own. I saw a flash of green grass, and then a smiling face.\n\n<a href=\"We%20pulled%20our%20luggage%20out%20of%20the%20trunk%20and%20stood%20on%20the%20cobblestone%20sidewalk%20in%20a%20daze%20(keep%20in%20mind%20we%20had%20been%20traveling%20for%20something%20like%20three%20days%20straight).%20We%20were%20standing%20somewhere%20in%20the%20middle%20of%20a%20half%20mile%20long%20stretch%20of%20rusted%20corrugated%20tin%20fence.%20He%20said,%20\">Read the rest of this entry on roaming Iomi</a>.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vtmagox7p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.746799,9.022736]}},{"properties":{"name":"Georgia: This way to fun","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/0/23880524_59485aa544_m_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Meansville, GeorgiaI took a short trip to South Georgia over the holiday weekend, and boy is it ever fun:\n<img src=\"http://photos18.flickr.com/23883188_0b73a21ce8_m.jpg\">\n\nI was lucky enough to be able to stay in a farmhouse built in the mid-1800\\'s that\\'s been owned and lived in by the same family since it was built.

I\\'ve lived in and around the area off and on for much of my life, so it\\'s more familiar to me than anyplace else. The only time I am able to see it in an even slightly objective light is when I\\'m returning from an extended leave.\n\nYou begin to see how it\\'s different from other places right when you arrive at the airport.

As a friend of mine described it, \"it\\'s like living in a beer commercial.\" You know the kind, where people walk down the street to techno music in bikinis with perfect makeup and fluffy hair, and with no intention at all of swimming? Like that.\n\nAfter much thought and observation, I have decided that the local fashion sense can be summed up as: cover as much of your face and as little of the rest of you as humanly possible. This generally manifests as enormous bug-eye glasses and huge floppy \"no autographs, please\" type hats paired with a shirt that has about as much coverage as three band-aids (over suspiciously bouyant decolletage) and a pair of shorts or a skirt that could be easily mistaken for a belt. For men: linen. That\\'s any color of shorts or white pants, and then a button down shirt, 8/10ths of whose buttons are apparently just for show and not for use. At breakfast last week, I watched one of these male miami fashion plates trying in vain to remove spilled egg benedict from his chest hair with a flimsy napkin. It\\'s hard to eat when something like that is going on at the next table.\n\nHere is a good example of the look.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.roamingiomi.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=14\">Read the rest of this entry on Roaming Iomi</a>\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vtmbk6beu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.28431,25.75939]}},{"properties":{"name":"N'awlins","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/0/30677077_9fc3e04d69.jpg\">I think the first sign of what I was in for was that people were walking around (even downtown) with plastic cups of booze. Just sauntering around with it all nonchalant, the way I carry my iced coffee around in Oakland.\n\nArmed with my very large pink drink (proper anthropological methodology requires blending in one\\'s surroundings) we ambled along toward the Hustler club. I had seen on television, of course, the types of activities that occur on Bourbon during Mardi Gras, but I hadn\\'t realized that the same kinds of things occur on random evenings in late July.\n\nI knew I wouldn\\'t be participating in any bead-earning (particularly considering that they are available in almost every shop for a couple of dollars per bundle), so I headed over to stand with the row of men below the Hustler Club balcony. I was the only female. We stood there in a row, me and all of these guys, with our cameras out. We all had a sort of guilty, nervous look on our faces, they for obvious reasons and me because I wanted to get some good shots of them while they got shots of the girls. We talked to this independent filmmaker who explained that he was getting some great footage, which he might try to sell to a documentary film company such as \"Girls Gone Wild\" but would probably just be keeping for his personal collection. Then he did an attractive little hyena laugh.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.roamingiomi.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=14\">Read the rest of this entry on roaming Iomi</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vtm6zzogx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.06759,29.95638]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spring Break!","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/0/124300282_dae95d9526.jpg\">Last weekend marks the third time I\\'ve accidentally visited Miami during spring break.
