Besides launching its first-ever program of temporary exhibitions, the Museum has created a special gallery devoted to Noguchi\\'s celebrated work in interior design.\r\n\r\nAlthough the renovated Museum has a fresh look, great care has been taken to maintain the original character of the building, which was integral to Noguchi\\'s vision for the Museum.

Since 1987, SculptureCenter’s Artist-In-Residence program has been providing artists with the uncommon opportunity to develop a new work in the exhibition space over an extended period of time. The newly established SculptureCenter Prize is awarded annually to an accomplished yet under-recognized New York artist who has produced a mature body of work and shows further potential. The recipient receives a cash award and a solo exhibition accompanied by a catalog. Off-Site projects taking place in public and semi-public venues allow artists and audiences to explore sculpture’s role in the larger environment. The In Practice program supports artists in creating new work for exhibition at SculptureCenter. Work in all media will be considered and artists are welcome to experiment with the parameters of traditional display and exhibition formats.\r\n\r\nThe Image Library includes documentation and information on over four hundred artists and is available by appointment to curators, collectors and scholars interested in contemporary sculpture. SculptureCenter also features images of four to six artists selected from the Image Library on our website on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\nEducation is integral to SculptureCenter’s mission and its programs. Seminars and workshops provide opportunities for professional and non-professional artists to expand their practice both inside and outside the studio.

She was determined to meet the neglected cultural needs of the borough’s incredibly diverse and quickly growing Hispanic community. Ms. Brito concluded her distinguished career with Thalia when she retired on December 31, 1999, paving the way for us to enter the new millennium under new leadership. MORE ABOUT SILVIA \r\n\r\nHer chosen successor, acclaimed Spanish director/writer/producer Angel Gil Orrios, has produced and directed more than 100 productions in Spain, the United States, and France in the last 30 years. MORE ABOUT ANGEL Committed to maintaining the quality that has become the hallmark of Thalia, Mr. Gil continues producing Spanish and Latin American plays, World Premiere original dance musicals, flamenco and tango dance programs and more, and the annual free Thalia al Aire Libre/Outdoors Festival in our neighborhood park. \r\n\r\nHis most important innovation is to present our productions with bilingual casts, alternating performances in English and Spanish all week long (instead of only in Spanish on weekends as before). His first production at Thalia, in April-May, 2000, was the World Premiere of PICASSO\\'S GUERNICA / EL GUERNICA DE PICASSO, a \"total theatre\" experience: a fusion of drama, music and dance with projections of Picasso\\'s famous painting-a new style suited for all audiences in a new millennium. \r\n\r\nWe are an important venue for new works by Spanish and Latin American playwrights and composers. We have produced the American and World premieres of plays by Mexico’s Carlos Fuentes and Spaniards Antonio Gala, Jaime Salom, and Jerónimo López Mozo, all of whom have attended their openings at our theatre. We also have produced masterworks by such celebrated writers as Calderon de la Barca and Jardiel Poncela of Spain and Chile’s Miguel Frank. \r\n\r\nOur BILINGUAL productions are dedicated to bringing to life onstage a canon of literature by the finest Spanish and Latin American authors for American audiences who otherwise would never know them. We commission the highest-quality English-language translations to attract students and educators as well as the general public. \r\n\r\nWe were the first Spanish theatre in New York to incorporate Folklore, which has included Mexican song and dance, Tango, and Flamenco, into its season.

The Factory\\'s 5,000 square foot facility is home to new work by the company\\'s founding artists; and provides support to visiting artists in the form of dedicated access to space and technical equipment free of charge; marketing and press assistance; administrative support; and a guaranteed artist fee. Curated by Artistic Director Brian Rogers, the Visiting Artist Program (now in its 4th year) supports new work in a variety of formats including rehearsal residencies, full engagements, and multi-artist festivals.\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Factory values the process of creation and the spirit of experimentation. The work of our founding artists and our dedication to supporting the creation of new work by Visiting Artists bears this out. theater et al, the company from which The Chocolate Factory emerged, was for many years an itinerant producing organization, renting theaters and rehearsal spaces by the hour. The Factory was founded in part to alleviate many of the challenges - lack of affordable space, lack of adequate time for creative and technical rehearsals, expensive technical equipment - typical of independent theater production in New York. The Factory\\'s founding artists needed a space in which to create and present their work on their own terms, with full technical support, over an extended period of time. Our work with Visiting Artists is an extension of this principle.\r\n\r\nArtists invited to work at The Chocolate Factory receive dedicated rehearsal and performance residencies and are encouraged to put our space and technical resources to use in imaginative ways, with very few practical limitations. To this end, our multi-use spaces are designed for maximum flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Factory\\'s founding artists emphasizes multi-disciplinary collaboration - combining movement, music, video and text to devise a means of storytelling that is immediate, collage-like, highly visual, and dependent on new technologies. When successful, our work is not easily categorized as theater, dance, new music, or video art and is rather a thorough intermingling of these disciplines. By extension, our curatorial values when it comes to Visiting Artists leads us to work that exists across or between disciplines - work that requires new methods, more time, and a new kind of audience.\r\n\r\n[1] Resident Artists\r\nThe creation of new work by our founding artists was the founding mission of theater et al (1999-2004) and is The Chocolate Factory\\'s primary program activity. Under the leadership of founding artist and Artistic Director Brian Rogers, the company begins with a large-scale social or political question (in the case of our most recent project, 2 Husbands: the beginnings and ends of life), and develops a performance which attacks that question - using movement, music, video, and text - from as many disparate points of view as possible. The result is a collage of interweaving stories and scenarios which emphasize alternative or unpopular viewpoints, and which do not attempt to answer the question at hand so much as they provide a comprehensive illustration of that question, seen from many angles; speaking, hopefully, to the concerns of contemporary New Yorkers. Over a period of months, characters and scenarios are improvised, material is generated and discarded, and a performance gradually takes shape. Typically, 10-12 months (broken up into separate rehearsal periods of 4-6 weeks, with long gaps in-between for script and design development) are devoted to the creation of each new project. Each piece is given numerous public showings in various stages of development prior to its official opening. These showings provide us with direct audience feedback on the progress of the piece, which is then incorporated as rehearsals and development continue. In this sense, our production process is a social and creative event for artists and audience alike.\r\n\r\n[2] Visiting Artists\r\nWhen not in use for resident artist productions, The Chocolate Factory provides support to visiting artists in the form of dedicated access to our space and technical equipment, marketing assistance, and administrative support. Our curated Visiting Artist program supports the creation of new theater, dance, music and multimedia performances in a variety of settings including early works-in-progress, full engagements of 1 - 4 weeks, and festivals of new work.\r\n\r\n[3] Gallery\r\nIn conjunction with our performance schedule, The Chocolate Factory presents an ongoing series of visual art exhibitions in our storefront gallery space. Approximately 8 month-long exhibitions - ranging from painting to photography to sound art and new media - are organized by Guest Curator Patrick Neal.\r\n\r\nSpace &amp; Technical\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Factory is a 5,000 square foot renovated industrial building.
