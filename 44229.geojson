It should be made immediately clear that this was, in fact, a World's Fair. In 137 days 2,554,848 people visited the 406-acre Expo, centered around Guild's Lake (now NW Portland) for 50cents per person (25cents on Sundays).  The entire Expo was staged on 46 parcels of land rented from 1904 through December 31st, 1905, and the buildings were largely temporary affairs using a lot of plaster, so only a few structures (one, actually) survive today.\n\nA map of the 1905 Expo is something I've wanted to create since finding Platial (&amp;quot;finding Platial&amp;quot;, clever!), since this is large, well photographed EVENT of which no trace exists today. Essentially every location will be approximate.  Its also the defining hubristic moment of what was Portland's golden years during the early 1900s.  \n\nThat said, I'll probably be tweaking this map a lot as I figure out how to organize information, becauses there's a ton of it to sift through. \n\nEnjoy.\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Agricultural Palace (1905)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\">Tinzeroes</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/1/Agricultural_palace.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67w5mqfg8dx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.70591,45.53795]}},{"properties":{"name":"American Inn (1905)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\">Tinzeroes</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/The_American_Inn.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> The 3-story American Inn was built by the Exposition for the Exposition, and was the only hotel located inside the Expo\\'s grounds.
