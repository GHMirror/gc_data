Therefore, vehicles from Western are always running the red and vehicles on Washington are starting out into the intersection on their green light at the same time.  WHY can\\'t this be changed?  It just takes one human to observe for 10 minutes, see the problem and make a change in the timing of the lights!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om6lczigoq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.4838178158,40.7981764163]}},{"properties":{"name":"Karl's Auto Body","description":"Posted by Nuttyright<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> In this town, these guys are saviors!
