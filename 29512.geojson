Stroll, boat, or bike along the city\\'s canals, lined with gabled houses, to experience one of Europe\\'s best preserved, photogenic, and intact historic city centers, or visit the Dutch master paintings in the Rijksmuseum. But don\\'t stop there. Always looking ahead, and reinventing itself, Amsterdam has recently emerged as a 21st-century style center. How to sample the city\\'s purely contemporary side?

But after a radical revamp for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games, Athens is enjoying a renaissance. The clash between myth and modern-day grit is an Athenian trademark: marble busts adorn souvlaki joints, Byzantine churches nestle beside bouzouki clubs, the Parthenon reigns serene above a ragged expanse of apartment blocks. More than three million people are crammed into this loud, laid-back city. With 300 days of sunshine a year, a 75-mile (120-kilometer) coastline, and 3 a.m. traffic jams, irrepressible Athens is a muse for beach bums and barflies, as much as classical scholars and art lovers.\n<a href=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/places-of-a-lifetime/athens.html\">more</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67z4xpeknq3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.729999,37.979999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Atlanta","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/staticfiles//NGS/Shared/StaticFiles/Places/Images/atlanta-dogwood-trees-006-05z1107-piedmont-park-dogwood-mi.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAFor a sprawling city with the nation\\'s ninth-largest metro area, Atlanta is surprisingly lush with trees, magnolias, dogwoods, Southern pines, and magnificent oaks. Its mix of antebellum architecture and sexy glass high-rises reflects the paradox of the place; Atlanta is an ever-evolving city, honing her identity as she grows. Though steeped in Civil War history and a devotion to Southern hospitality, Atlanta is also a hotbed of upscale shopping, creative cuisine, and an exploding arts scene. Locals are passionate about college and professional sports, but also about foie gras, collard greens, and pecan pie. Neighborhoods like trendy Virginia-Highland and upscale Buckhead share cultural space with alternative Little Five Points and East Atlanta Village. The heart of the southeast has a captivating intersection of liberals and conservatives, blacks and whites. New attractions, the Georgia Aquarium, Atlantic Station, Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center, and the recently redeveloped World of Coca-Cola, show that Atlanta, ever re-defining itself, has no plans to rest on its laurels.\n\n<a href=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/places-of-a-lifetime/athens.html\">more</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67z4xy74vf5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bangkok","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/staticfiles//NGS/Shared/StaticFiles/Places/Images/bangkok-1-wat-monks-200515630-001-mi.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> BangkokSoutheast Asia\\'s most dynamic and exciting city, Bangkok is an intoxicating and sometimes jarring mix of modern and ancient.

Historically a tolerant melting pot, as the center of Christendom for over a millennium and Islam\\'s seat for another 500 years, it remains home to the Patriarchate of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Sephardic Jewish heritage sites, and legacies of numerous ethnic groups. It sits at the crossroads of human history, a sprawling 700-square-mile (1,812-square-kilometer) hilly metropolis studded with nearly 20,000 cultural sites from the sixth millennium B.C. to present day. Flanking 19 miles (30 kilometers) of the Bosporus strait between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, it is a linchpin for trade routes in all directions. Though no longer a capital, Istanbul is the cosmopolitan heart of the Turkish Republic, its financial center and most populous city. The mushrooming population exceeds ten million, crowding cobbled-lane waterfront villages and glass-and-steel corporate districts, spirited premier soccer matches and haute couture boulevards.
