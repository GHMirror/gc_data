When the shepherds are ready to move the flock to another section of land, the sheep dogs come out and do all the gathering and turning and the sheep are off to a different place to graze.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dianejp/5659680492/","id":"14"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.750102,36.578902]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5635859741","title":"","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/19 20:20:38 -0400","original":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 17:20:37 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/19 20:20:37 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/danssordidandsundrypictures/\">Dan's Sordid &amp; Sundry Pictures</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/danssordidandsundrypictures/5635859741/\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5635859741_cb31551979_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\nFort Ord, California.\n6.23.10.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/danssordidandsundrypictures/5635859741/","id":"15"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.814002,36.639291]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5624486831","title":"","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/16 13:21:31 -0400","original":"Sat, 16 Apr 2011 10:21:30 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/16 13:21:30 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/boyghost/\">boyghost</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/boyghost/5624486831/\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5624486831_9bb32434f8_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"235\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\nKiev 60\nKodak Ektacolor 160","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/boyghost/5624486831/","id":"16"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.82383,36.652238]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5617905088","title":"","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/13 20:05:48 -0400","original":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 17:05:47 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/13 20:05:47 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/boyghost/\">boyghost</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/boyghost/5617905088/\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5304/5617905088_16a0805822_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\nYashica Mat 124G\nFujicolor Pro 400H","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/boyghost/5617905088/","id":"17"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.792674,36.647861]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5615037732","title":"","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/12 20:56:48 -0400","original":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 17:56:47 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/12 20:56:47 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/boyghost/\">boyghost</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/boyghost/5615037732/\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5615037732_bc48f72787_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"233\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\nYashica Mat 124G\nFujicolor Pro 400H","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/boyghost/5615037732/","id":"18"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.828411,36.64598]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5608081638","title":"Ring Snake","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/10 19:27:19 -0400","original":"Sun, 10 Apr 2011 16:27:18 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/10 19:27:18 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/rikschultz/\">rikschultz</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rikschultz/5608081638/\" title=\"Ring Snake\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5262/5608081638_bd9415e783_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" alt=\"Ring Snake\"></a>\n\nSeaside, CA Apr 2011\nFound this Ring Snake under a piece of metal out in the weeds","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rikschultz/5608081638/","id":"19"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.763083,36.649518]}}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"","metadata":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"source":null,"contact_phone":null},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-12T23:56:59-04:00","id":141906}
