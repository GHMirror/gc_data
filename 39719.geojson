Flora became an overnight star when she laid a clutch of fertile eggs despite never being mixed with, or mated by, a male dragon.\r\n\r\nThis groundbreaking work with Komodo Dragons is just one of the ways Chester Zoo undertakes its conservation work. The zoo works with over 500 different endangered species, both at home in Chester and in more than 40 countries around the world.\r\n\r\nKevin Buley, Chester Zoo\\'s Curator of Lower Vertebrates and Invertebrates, said: \"None of this work we do would be possible without the support of our visitors and supporters. As a charity we rely on voluntary contributions from people who care about animals to fund our vital work.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=2968132<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c50ltosvng"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.87859,53.22577]}},{"properties":{"name":"21/06/07 - Town's teen abortion rate shock","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\">Leaderonline</a>WREXHAM has one of the highest percentages of teenage abortions in Wales, new figures reveal.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics from the Department of Health, more than one abortion a day was carried out in the county borough last year, with 11.8 per cent of them on under-18s.\r\n\r\nThe rate is higher than in many other parts of Wales, and the total number of abortions carried out on women from the Wrexham area is the second-highest in North Wales.\r\n\r\nThe number of abortions carried out on under 18s in Wrexham was higher than those in Cardiff (8 per cent), Swansea (11.6 per cent), Denbighshire (11 per cent) and Flintshire (11.3 per cent). Conwy was named as having the highest number with more than 15 per cent of the total number of abortions being carried out on under 18s.\r\n\r\nThe figures show the overall number of abortions rose in England and Wales from 186,416 in 2005, to 193,737 last year, a rise of nearly four per cent. The previous year, the figures had risen by just 0.4 per cent.\r\n\r\nAcross Wales, 11 per cent of abortions took place at more than 13 weeks into the pregnancy. In this area, Wrexham\\'s figures are particularly worrying, according to experts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=2971996<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c50lq0piw2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.99227,53.04707]}},{"properties":{"name":"22/06/07 - Brunstrom's delight as everyone arrives alive","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\">Leaderonline</a>FLINTSHIRE has been singled out for high praise from controversial North Wales Chief Constable Richard Brunstrom, after he revealed there had been no deaths on the county\\'s roads in the past year.\r\n\r\nThat is a massive turnaround for the county, which just last year was condemned as having some of the deadliest roads in Wales.\r\n\r\nA report published by the Wales Centre for Health last summer deemed Flintshire among the worst counties in Wales for road deaths, with the eighth highest number of deaths on its roads, at seven per 100,000.\r\n\r\nFigures showed in 2004, 62 people were killed or injured on roads in the county, including drivers, passengers and pedestrians.
