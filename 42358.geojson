Scroll down to read about Duke Kahanamoku and to watch a some short videos about Waikiki.\n\n\n\nby <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=kahaluu808\">kahaluu808</a>       \n\n<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/clip=678\">Waikiki Scenes</a> on <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a> by <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/user:hawaii\">Hawaii</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.honolulu.gov/cameras/waikiki_beach/duke.htm\">Duke Kahanamoku</a> is the most famous name in surfing -- an Olympic champion, Hollywood actor and Hawaiian folk hero. He\\'s also remembered for his grace in the water, his good humor, and his sportsmanship.\n\nThroughout his youth, Duke strove to refine his water skills. Swimming, surfing and canoeing were his passion. When top Australian swimmers visited the islands in 1910, Duke inspected their every move. He would use what he had learned from them to perfect his swimming. Duke\\'s aquatic skills improved to such an extent that those who saw him were astonished. Bill Rawlins, an island attorney from Yale tried to help Duke get the recognition he deserved. However, to obtain official sanction for any aquatic records, swimmers had to belong to a recognized club. So Duke and his friends organized their own club in 1911 and named it Hui Nalu (Club of the Waves).\n\nDuke\\'s astonishing swim times were sent to the Mainland, but they were so startling that officials refused to believe them. His supporters decided that the only thing they could do was raise money for Duke and another Hawaiian swimmer, Vincent Genoves, to travel to the Mainland to compete.\n\nIn March of 1912 Duke Kahanamoku and fellow Hawaiian Vincent Genoves were in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to compete for places on the American Olympic team. The Olympic swim trials were being held at various athletic clubs throughout the United States. On March 13th Duke had been in Chicago where he had won the 100-yard race. Now, in Pittsburgh two days later, Kahanamoku would compete in the 220-yard indoor race and Genoves in the 500-yard indoor swimming event. Unfortunately, Duke\\'s leg would cramp when he hit the water, and he lost the race. Neither Hawaiian would win in Pittsburgh and only Kahanamoku would make the Olympic team and travel to Stockholm.\n\nDuke, who almost slept through the 100-meter dash, and who had to convince officials to delay the race long enough for him to put on a swim suit, broke the Olympic record in July of 1912. He had been clocked at sixty-three and two-fifths seconds. Pandemonium reigned and the Hawaiian swimmer became a hero. He was now the most famous Hawaiian alive, and he had done much to publicize the islands.\n\nOn January 22, 1968 the world would bid \"Aloha\" to Hawaii\\'s most famous citizen. He would be remembered as a great swimmer, surfer and all-around good guy. More than 20-years after his death memories of his achievements and affecting personable style still linger.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62oiot6kh2a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.82804,21.276656]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Lahaina Luau Cam","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/msunfire.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/old_lahaina.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/old_lahaina_luau_JPG.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/old_lahaina_dancers.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/luau102_small.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/MAUI_Luau_01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/MAUI_Luau_32.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1251 Front St, Lahaina, HI 96761The camera points right at the stage! \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62oiox3hvqx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-156.685123,20.889928]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pu'u O'o Vent Live Volcano Cam","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/L.jpg\">KilaueaMaybe we\\'ll get lucky and see an explosion.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62oiouoanah"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.283251,19.407183]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sky Diving Cam","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/DSC00006.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/JASINSKI_R1_034_15A.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/JASINSKI_R1_056_26A.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/Tumbling.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/richardnbryan2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 68-760 Farrington Hwy Mokuleia, HawaiiAfter our helicopter tour, our windsurfing, and our people watching, we might try a little sky diving...\n\nThis is a webcam at the Skydive Hawaii offices.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62oip3sczn0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-158.18759,21.580069]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/5940","metadata":null,"contact_name":"us3rname","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:us3rname","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/5940","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":17,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=5940,platial:user=us3rname","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":42358}
