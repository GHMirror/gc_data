Similar to North America\\'s Rocky Mountain district drawing a close parallel to Banff. Did a wonderful hike here to Lago Jacob and hooked up with some new friends.  As you walk past people here everybody says hola; waaay friendlier than Chile and cheaper too.

The local mayor wanted to buy our underground water system maps.  Also there were numerous run-ins with Zapatista Rebels who simply could not understand why people would want to explore cave systems.

This corridor begins on the north at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a low-lying, narrow waist of the North American continent in Oaxaca, Mexico. It angles southeastward, toward Central America, widening from approximately 25 km in the vicinity of the town of TonalÃ¡ to nearly 50 km at its southeastern end.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639g3q0wjgb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.229023,17.914716]}},{"properties":{"name":"Climbing St. Helens","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://hook.org\" href=\"http://hook.org\">Anselm</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/124053412_613d42e9e8_o.jpg\">Beatiful climb; see landscape healing.

Here I stayed on MathEngine\\'s dime with a retired chess grandmaster turned stock market analyst who was helping raise funds for MathEngine.  Ostensibly tasked with staffing up a team of 300 engineers from scratch ultimately this failed horribly but it was a fun trip and listening to the blaring marley in the air conditioned mercedes as we cruised past horrible traffic accidents and kids shitting in the streets was quite british and appropriately imperial.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639g3jfvebt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[80.24139,12.78501]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mauna Kea Temple near Keck Observatory on big island Hawaii","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://hook.org\" href=\"http://hook.org\">Anselm</a><img src=\"http://hook.org/hawaii/images/1238240798-600x450-DSC01169.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Mauna Kea Temple near Keck Observatory on the Big Island in HawaiiCame across a curious temple floating above the cloud layer.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639g3rwm8mp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.482292,19.832601]}},{"properties":{"name":"Miyajima in Hiroshima Prefecture OTorii Gate","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://hook.org\" href=\"http://hook.org\">Anselm</a><img src=\"http://hook.org/anselm/pix/mirajimasunset.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Russ and I wound our way up this sacred mountain after a fierce storm; downed trees crushed temple roofs and blocked our path.

Behind each window was a soft explosion; a set of places and possibilities. Even at a distance it was like being stroked by thistles and weeds. Somebody reached up and held a child; growing up in those spaces. People simply working, playing, eating, smoking. Somebody was putting away laundry off a clothesline; I imagined the snick snick of pegs being pulled. There was this business of living, this thing that was long forgotten. The inescapable grasp of all things. Racing away from between clenched hands, speeding away ever faster. Lives not lived, loves not had, unborn families. I travelled more and more in those days; going faster and faster. Escaping the motion of the world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639g3cfgz5q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.931763,50.68707]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/1508","metadata":null,"contact_name":"anselm","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:anselm","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/1508","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":14,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=1508,platial:user=anselm","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":43843}
