After the exposition, people wanted to tear it down, but the military wanted it to stay because it was a great radio atenna.Soon people started to like it and didn\\'t want to tear it down.\r\n     Because of the unique latticework of metal, it is more likely to trigger fear of heights in people.Some people believe it\\'s made of steel but i\\'s really made of iron.There are urban legends that some people also believe;they say U.S. gave the tower to France in exchange for the Statue of Liberty.Right now the City of Paris is the tower\\'s owner who are in charge of running it and maitinance.The color is called \"Eiffel Tower beige\" and needs to be repainted over 6-7 year periods.There is a small post office in the tower and you have to use the elevator only to reach the summit.The tower also attracts not only young lovers but depressed or suicidal people. There was nearly 400 people who jumped off the tower to kill themselves.the price to build coorsponds to about 5,000,000 US dollars in 2006 and Eiffel Tower in French is \"la Tour Eiffel\".<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2gedleyhw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.311537,48.854837]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ford's Theater","description":"Posted by Websta1021<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ft4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ft2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ft3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ft.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\">Â Washington D.C.    In 1861, a theater entrepreneur named John T. Ford started to lease out a church which he turned into a music hall.Right after that it got completely destroyed in a fire.So in August 1863 he started to rebulid it as Ford\\'s \"New Theater\".Less than two years later President Lincoln attended a performance called \"Our American Cousin\" and got shot by John Wilk\\'s Booth.                   \r\n     The public demanded closure of the theater after the death of Lincoln and made threats to destruct the building.For the next ninety years, the theater served as office space, museum, and storage facility.President Dwight D. Eisenhower then signed the Congressional act to restore the theater. Ten years later reconstruction began and finally reopened in 1968.Today, it is a historical site as well as a working theater. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2ge5bt887"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036667,38.895]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fort McHenry","description":"Posted by Websta1021<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/frt5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/frt3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/frt2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/frt6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/frt.jpg\">    Fort McHenry is located right near Baltimore\\'s Inner Harbor area.History began during the Revolutionary War in 1776 when Baltimore residents feared a British attack, so they built Fort McHenry.They named the fort after a politician who provided most of the funds for the project named James McHenry.Then during the War of 1812 British forces bombarded the fort for 25 hours and then gave up the fort because they could not destroy it.                                       \r\n     Francis Scott Key noticed the flag was still flying despite the attack, and so it was his poem that he wrote that day that was put to music and later became our national anthem.Today, there is a monument to Francis at Fort McHenry.The fort is a popular destination for for field trips by surrounding schools and tourists.There is even a Fort McHenry Guard which is a group of re-enactors who dress in period garb and help interpret Fort McHenry\\'s past and place in history.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2geftgg3k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.5802001953,39.2637592304]}},{"properties":{"name":"Golden gate bridge","description":"Posted by Websta1021<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ggb3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ggb4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ggb_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ggb6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ggb2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/ggb5.jpg\">     The Golden Gate Bridge is considered the entrance to the San Francisco Bay form the Pacific Ocean.It\\'s 3 miles long by 1 mile wide with a 4,200ft long suspension span.It took 4 years to build by starting on Jan.5,1933 and opened to traffic on May 28, 1937.The cost taday in 2003 dollars would be approx. 1.2 billion to build another one.11 men were killed during construction.Before completion, Chief Engineer Joseph B.Strauss wrote a poem called \"The Mighty Task is Done\".\r\n     On opening day, the bridge was considered by the San Francisco Chronicle \"A thirty-five million dollar steel harp!\".Since that opening day, as of June 2005, 1,779,032,891 vehicles crossed it.

Today, it is owned by the City of Philadelphia.There are also a replica bel in each of the 50 states as a gift from France to ring on special occasions.There was even a \"Liberty Bell Hoax\".I t was on April 1,1996 that a full-page Taco Bell advertisement popped up in The New York Times announcing that Taco Bel had purchased the Liberty Bell in effort to help reduce national debt.
