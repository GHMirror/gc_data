I still don\\'t, but I do know what he looked like. When you search his name online you get lots of references to the school in Rolla that bears his name, but no information about him.  Here is his picture for those who are curious. He was a cival war Col. from Illinois, and led infantry.

I can testify that that was not always the case. In late 1967 this was the site of our home. The house was old even then, a frame building with a coal oil heater in the basement, and drafty rooms throughout. Just next to our home (in the space south of the marker pin, in what looks like a parking lot) was the home of our neighbors who had real names although they cannot be remembered because my brother and sister and I all just called them Mrs. Long Hair and Mr Beard. I thought of them as our hippy neighbors. For those of you who remember, on Halloween that year, I went trick or treating as the Frito Bandito. The Highschool was just up the block and around the corner, I assume that the largish building I see East and North of our old home site is the Highschool today. When I was in second grade I attended a presentation of Androcles and the Lion, a play by George Bernard Shaw at the Highschool auditorium. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6i1a5jjwtim"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.7674094439,37.9499422051]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home from 1967 through 1968","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://mackenziesgarden.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://mackenziesgarden.blogspot.com\">Mountaincrawler</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Our Home in \\'67 and \\'68 was on Summit Drive in Richardson, Texas.

On our way home from visiting friends in Chicago in July of 2008, we stopped at Maramec so I could share it with my wife. It is just as I remember it from 40 years ago.

What fun! I guess they were right to do so. I remember Terrace Elementary as the school where I learned about  two of the three states of matter. The cafeteria had a freezer and frequently after lunch I would buy an ice cream bar. One day I got the bright idea that I\\'d save the frozen fudge bar I bought to eat on my way home from school, so I put it in my locker after lunch and went back to class. When I got out of class later that day I learned what happens to solids when they get too hot. There was liquid fudge syrup all over everything in my locker and an empty wrapper and a popsicle stick. No second grader would have made a blunder like that. Second Grade students had already been introduced to Elementary Physics and Introductory Thermodynamics. Needless to say, my dad the Advanced Degree Electrical Engineer, and Project Team Leader at TI was more than a tad concerned about my lack of grasp. \r\nI spent that summer doing arithmatic workbooks while my friends played outside.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6i1a5ibkb81"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.722535789,32.9518489251]}},{"properties":{"name":"Third and Final Home in Rolla","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://mackenziesgarden.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://mackenziesgarden.blogspot.com\">Mountaincrawler</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 66 Rose Court was the third house we lived in in Rolla.
