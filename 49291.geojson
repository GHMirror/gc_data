He encouraged all Catholics to utilize modern media to help spread the Catholic Faith. \r\n\r\nRedeemer Radio was formed in 2002 by lay Catholics answering the call of Pope John Paul II to use modern media to spread the Catholic faith.  We began purchasing airtime on a commercial radio station to broadcast \"Catholic Answers Live\" weekdays in drive-time.  Listener response was overwhelming with the show becoming the station\\'s number one rated program.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2005 Redeemer Radio purchased WLYV 1450AM - bringing full-time Catholic radio to our area. \r\n\r\nThe mission of Redeemer Radio is to employ radio broadcasting to evangelize, to bring inactive Catholics back to the Church and make good Catholics better - so that all may know, understand, live and be able to share the fullness of the faith. \r\n\r\nOur focus is greater Fort Wayne and the entire diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend with obedience to our bishop, Most Reverend John M. D’Arcy, and fidelity to the Church’s teachings. \r\n\r\nOur programming is from the heart of the Church – positive, unifying and with broad appeal, in collaboration with the diocese. \r\n\r\nChris Langford, Redeemer Radio president and co-founder, notes that “we are very excited about bringing Catholic radio to Northeast Indiana. The truth and beauty of the Catholic faith will be available to all who tune in. Lives will change.” \r\n\r\nMr. Langford goes on to say that “the very fabric of our culture is under attack by modern forces working against the good of society. This attack is often carried out through the media. It is vitally important that Catholic radio be a force in the media to defend and explain the truth about today’s critical issues.” \r\n\r\nFort Wayne Catholic Radio, Inc. (“Redeemer Radio”) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization founded in 2002 and located in Ft. Wayne, IN. Founded and led by lay Catholics, Redeemer Radio’s charter is to own and operate Catholic radio stations within the Catholic diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k345my0cpe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.202702,41.074473]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/251216","metadata":null,"contact_name":"catholicwifiradi","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:catholicwifiradi","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/251216","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=251216,platial:user=catholicwifiradi","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":49291}
