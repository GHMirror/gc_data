Fighting took place between Gadhafi loyalists and rebels at Misrata, Libya's third largest city 125 miles (200 kilometres) east of Tripoli, on Friday, according to residents.

Other UN agencies and international groups say Libya may already be on the brink of a catastrophe.\n\nThe World Health Organization says the health situation inside the country is precarious; aid agencies warn its food supply chain is at risk of collapsing; and Britains Save the Children Fund says up to one million children trapped in the capital Tripoli and western Libya are in danger of becoming war victims.\n\nThings could get worse if Col. Gaddafis troops try to cut off food to opposition-held cities and towns. They have already attempted to bomb some of the huge pipelines that carry water to Libyas main cities from aquifers buried deep beneath the Sahara Desert, hundreds of kilometres south of the populated Mediterranean coast.\n\nThe WFP was rushing assessment teams to Benghazi in opposition-controlled eastern Libya Wednesday to determine if the port can be used for emergency food deliveries.\n\nThe Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Charlottetown also set sail from Halifax on a six-day voyage to join a U.S.-led naval task force off the coast, where it will help in any humanitarian mission.\n\nEurope is watching the unfolding tragedy with consternation, fearing a massive regional displacement could trigger a tidal wave of illegal migration from North Africa.\n\nThe tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, just 160 km off the coast of Tunisia, has already been swamped with more than 6,000 would-be migrants seeking resettlement in Europe.\n\nJose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, announced a tripling of the European Unions humanitarian aid, to ease the crisis.\n\nBritain also said it will fly home 6,000 Egyptian refugees stranded on the Libya-Tunisia border. Still, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is appealing for governments to organize a massive humanitarian evacuation as conditions in Libya continue to deteriorate.\n\nUN officials are alarmed by a growing crisis on the Tunisian-Libyan border. Tens of thousands of foreign migrant workers, many from sub-Saharan African countries or as far away as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nepal, are stranded there.\n\nIn the last two weeks nearly 85,000 people have flooded across the border. Many are still waiting to be evacuated and have nowhere else to go, but are living with little food and shelter.\n\nUN officials flew in 80 tonnes of high energy biscuits to Djerba, Tunisia, on Tuesday to feed refugees and are trying to set up an emergency tent camp for 15,000 people. But the situation seems to be getting worse.\n\nAid workers believe up to 2.7 million people could flee in the coming weeks.\n\nA report by UNICEF says the first wave of evacuees was made up of male workers in the oil fields and construction. Now, growing numbers of Libyans are fleeing the country with their families, bringing increasing numbers of very vulnerable families and a higher portion of women and children.\n\nLibya, which has Africas richest oil fields, employed 1.5 million foreign workers before rebellions broke out against Col. Gaddafi on Feb. 17. Their sudden departure has caused the economy to collapse. Oil production has been halved and the centrally controlled economy has ground to a halt.\n\nLibya imports more than 75% of its food, but none of its ports have been operating properly for two weeks. Food stocks are depleted and distribution chains disrupted.\n\nTens of thousands of the migrant workers who fled worked in food distribution, meaning it could take weeks for things to return to normal even if the political situation is resolved.\n\nRight now, experts can only expect the worst. They have been unable to visit areas affected by violence.\n\nOur primary concern is getting access to Tripoli and surrounding areas where the situation is precarious, said Valerie Amos, the UNs Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.

Other UN agencies and international groups say Libya may already be on the brink of a catastrophe.\n\nThe World Health Organization says the health situation inside the country is precarious; aid agencies warn its food supply chain is at risk of collapsing; and Britains Save the Children Fund says up to one million children trapped in the capital Tripoli and western Libya are in danger of becoming war victims.\n\nThings could get worse if Col. Gaddafis troops try to cut off food to opposition-held cities and towns. They have already attempted to bomb some of the huge pipelines that carry water to Libyas main cities from aquifers buried deep beneath the Sahara Desert, hundreds of kilometres south of the populated Mediterranean coast.\n\nThe WFP was rushing assessment teams to Benghazi in opposition-controlled eastern Libya Wednesday to determine if the port can be used for emergency food deliveries.\n\nThe Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Charlottetown also set sail from Halifax on a six-day voyage to join a U.S.-led naval task force off the coast, where it will help in any humanitarian mission.\n\nEurope is watching the unfolding tragedy with consternation, fearing a massive regional displacement could trigger a tidal wave of illegal migration from North Africa.\n\nThe tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, just 160 km off the coast of Tunisia, has already been swamped with more than 6,000 would-be migrants seeking resettlement in Europe.\n\nJose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, announced a tripling of the European Unions humanitarian aid, to ease the crisis.\n\nBritain also said it will fly home 6,000 Egyptian refugees stranded on the Libya-Tunisia border. Still, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is appealing for governments to organize a massive humanitarian evacuation as conditions in Libya continue to deteriorate.\n\nUN officials are alarmed by a growing crisis on the Tunisian-Libyan border. Tens of thousands of foreign migrant workers, many from sub-Saharan African countries or as far away as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nepal, are stranded there.\n\nIn the last two weeks nearly 85,000 people have flooded across the border. Many are still waiting to be evacuated and have nowhere else to go, but are living with little food and shelter.\n\nUN officials flew in 80 tonnes of high energy biscuits to Djerba, Tunisia, on Tuesday to feed refugees and are trying to set up an emergency tent camp for 15,000 people. But the situation seems to be getting worse.\n\nAid workers believe up to 2.7 million people could flee in the coming weeks.\n\nA report by UNICEF says the first wave of evacuees was made up of male workers in the oil fields and construction. Now, growing numbers of Libyans are fleeing the country with their families, bringing increasing numbers of very vulnerable families and a higher portion of women and children.\n\nLibya, which has Africas richest oil fields, employed 1.5 million foreign workers before rebellions broke out against Col. Gaddafi on Feb. 17. Their sudden departure has caused the economy to collapse. Oil production has been halved and the centrally controlled economy has ground to a halt.\n\nLibya imports more than 75% of its food, but none of its ports have been operating properly for two weeks. Food stocks are depleted and distribution chains disrupted.\n\nTens of thousands of the migrant workers who fled worked in food distribution, meaning it could take weeks for things to return to normal even if the political situation is resolved.\n\nRight now, experts can only expect the worst. They have been unable to visit areas affected by violence.\n\nOur primary concern is getting access to Tripoli and surrounding areas where the situation is precarious, said Valerie Amos, the UNs Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. She said there have been alarming reports desperate people in Tripoli are being prevented from fleeing.\n\nThe situation in Libya could quickly spiral out of control, said Gareth Owen, emergency director for Save the Children.\n\nIn the meantime, Col. Gaddafi vowed Wednesday to fight to the last man and last woman to defend his regime.\n\nIn a sign he understands the value of food as a weapon and a publicity tool, he tried to bolster his claim to leadership by announcing he has sent 18 trucks loaded with rice, flour, sugar and eggs to rebel-held Benghazi.\n\nNational Post\npgoodspeed@nationalpost.com","verified":"NO","longitude":13.187507,"id":"432","report":139,"location":"Tripoli","incidenttitle":"Goodspeed Analysis: 2.7 million could flee Libya in weeks ahead"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.187507,32.876174]}},{"properties":{"latitude":30.51,"category":"Armed Threat","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 01:57:00 -0500","original":"1:56:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 01:56:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/04 00:00:00 -0500","original":"3/3/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/03 00:00:00 -0500"},"approved":"YES","description":"Almanara Media Mail:\nO Almanara Media!

Alex Crawford was trapped inside for two days as Col Gaddafi's tanks attacked  and were beaten off.\n\nThe town of Zawiya was like Grozny from the Chechnya war on Saturday morning. There were great holes in the sides of buildings, and smashed-in walls down the roads leading in to the town. There were broken lampposts, and total devastation.\nFor two days we have watched as tanks have come down these roads, firing shells at the buildings, apartments and houses included. But in the centre of town, in the square, the hard-core opposition people are still there and still in control, despite three attacks by columns of tanks.\nWe arrived in the town on Friday, just as 10,000 people were marching towards the eastern checkpoint on the road to Tripoli, the army's front-line, in mourning for a commander who was shot by a sniper overnight.\nAs they reached the checkpoint, the army opened fire, and the crowd turned and ran.\nAs they ran, the soldiers fired again. From then on, we were inside the rebels' position, staying in the hotel on the central square which the rebel military council, mostly made up of army officers who have defected, has turned into its headquarters.\n\nThe next morning we heard the rumble of tanks.\nWe couldn't see them coming but we saw the plumes of smoke. The rebels were all desperately tooling up and firing back.\nThey were mostly ordinary people. I saw one young man who looked like a student with curly hair and glasses being told how to hold a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and crouch and fire it. He then ran off to battle.\nWe went inside the mosque where doctors were setting up an aid station.\nThe tanks were in the square, and there were people crying, because they thought they were finished, and this was the end. One young man was reading the Koran. We were told there were 25-30 tanks in the column, and then a massive bombardment went on for three hours.\nBut then there was cheering from outside, and we went out and there was a tank on fire right there. Further away there was another tank disabled, surrounded by eight dead soldiers, and in the next square a third, with more dead soldiers. The rebels had managed to fight them off.\nPeople were jumping round, celebrating  but a sniper somewhere killed a man.\nWe made for the hospital, taking a lift in an ambulance.\nEveryone was out on the street, dancing around the captured military vehicles. But as we approached there were still soldiers around, and they started shooting at the ambulance.\nA couple of hours later, the tanks went back in again, and there was a lot of firing in the square, but again they were forced out.\nOn Saturday morning a column of military vehicles arrived with several tanks and pickup trucks full of soldiers, firing blindly into buildings on the side of the road.\nThere were horrific injuries in the hospital. A ten-year-old boy had been hit by several bullets while standing outside his house. A woman had been shot in the head while driving to find out if her mother was safe.\nOne young man came in with an anti-tank grenade still in his thigh, the fins sticking out. He was still conscious. An ambulance arrived and as about 20 medics gathered around there was a big explosion  someone had aimed at them.\nAn hour later, we saw the military column racing away again in the other direction  another attack had been beaten off. It was the third attack beaten off by the rebels in two days.\nWhen we finally left, there were eight tanks destroyed or captured in the town, and the rebels still held the centre.\n\nAlex Crawford is a correspondent for Sky News.","verified":"NO","longitude":12.736496,"id":"1481","report":448,"location":"Zawiya Libya","incidenttitle":"Inside account: On the frontline during the bloody battle for Zawiya"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.736496,32.763028]}},{"properties":{"latitude":32.116667,"category":"Armed Attack","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 10:46:00 -0500","original":"10:45:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 10:45:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/08 00:00:00 -0500","original":"3/7/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/07 00:00:00 -0500"},"approved":"YES","description":"Published 12:20 07.03.11Latest update 12:20 07.03.11\nLibya offers dialogue to end fighting with anti-Gadhafi rebels\nIn the clearest sign yet of the Libyan establishment's willingness to compromise with dissident forces, top official says talks should be initiated to 'stop the bloodshed.'\n\nBy Reuters\nTags: Israel news Libya\n\n\nA leading member of Libya's ruling establishment appealed to rebel leaders for dialogue on Monday, in the clearest sign yet Muammar Gadhafi may be ready to compromise with opponents challenging his rule.\n\nJadallah Azous Al-Talhi, a Libyan prime minister in the 1980s who is originally from eastern Libya, appeared on state television reading an address to elders in Benghazi, the main base of the anti-Gadhafi rebels.\n\nHe asked them to \"give a chance to national dialogue to resolve this crisis, to help stop the bloodshed, and not give a chance to foreigners to come and capture our country again.\"\n\nThe appeal did not detail any concessions that Gadhafi's administration would be prepared to make.

A brigade led by one of Gadhafi's sons, Khamis, is believed to be leading the assault, shelling neighborhoods with tank and artillery fire from the outskirts and trying to push troops in to the city's central Martyrs Square where rebels had set up camp.\n\nThe city hospital has been overwhelmed with dead and wounded and many houses have been damaged, according to residents who escaped the past two days. One man who slipped out of the city on Monday said pro-Gadhafi forces had seized the central square.\n\nAn adviser to the Libyan Foreign Ministry in Tripoli on Tuesday also claimed that government troops were in control, raising the green flag over the square. The adviser, who is originally from Zawiya, said he was trying to mediate a cease-fire with remaining rebels. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.\n\nBut a resident of the nearby town of Sabratha said people who fled from Zawiya on Tuesday afternoon told him fighting continued, with rebels back in control of the square. He said they reported hit-and-run attacks between the two sides.\n\nThe various reports could not be independently confirmed. Electricity, phone and Internet services have all been cut in the city, making it impossible to reach witnesses inside Zawiya, just 30 miles west of Tripoli.\n\nUNVERIFIED: News source link does not work.

At least 26 wounded were rushed to the hospital in the town, some of them with legs lost and other serious injuries, according to doctors there.\n\n\"I was hit in the arm and leg, my friend was wounded in the stomach,\" Momen Mohammad, 31, said while lying in a hospital bed.\n\nEarlier in the day, warplanes launched at least five new airstrikes near rebel position in Ras Lanouf, one hitting a two-story house in a residential area, causing some damage. None of the strikes appeared to cause casualties, suggesting they were intended to intimidate the fighters, according to an Associated Press reporter who saw the strikes.

He indicated all that is not yet in place, but the alliance is doing what he called \"prudent planning.\"\n\n\"It does not mean that we are deciding to carry out specific operational steps today, but it does mean we are watching what the Libyan regime does to its people very closely indeed, and if there is a demonstrable need, if we have a clear mandate and strong regional support we stand ready to help,\" he added.\n\nThe NATO chief said \"time is of the essence,\" but he also said the alliance should not ignore the longer term need for support for the democratic transitions in Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere in the region.

His pick-up truck bore many bullet holes, including the back of the drivers seat.\n\nLucky to be alive: The bullet-riddled truck belonging to a rebel who escaped a massacre in Libyas eastern town of Bin Jawad.\nThese young men were raped in front of local Bedouin tribes. Its a terrible humiliation in our culture. If they survive, it is something they can never ever talk about, said the rebel.\n\nBin Jawad is the town that lies just before Gaddafis hometown of Sirte which the rebels had hoped to conquer before advancing toward the capital Tripoli.\n\nControl for Bin Jawad has see-sawed between the rebels and the government in recent days. It is unclear who is holding the town at the moment.\n\nThere were many mercenaries in Bin Jawad. They were mainly from Nigeria, Mali and Somalia, said the rebel.\n\nAccording to him, many dead bodies and the injured were seen on the streets of Bin Jawad.\n\nThe mercenaries would shoot at the bodies on the ground to make sure they are dead before taking them away, said the rebel.\n\nMany of Gaddafis Libyan soldiers have deserted him and joined the opposition forces.\n\nGaddafi is currently relying heavily on African mercenaries to help him retake cities and town in the east which have fallen to the rebels since the popular uprising began on Feb 15.\n\nIn Bin Jawad, rebels said civilians were forced from their homes by the mercenaries who then used the houses as a vantage point to shoot at advancing rebels.\n\nWe retreated from Bin Jawad to prevent further loss of civilian lives, the rebel said.\n\nIn the oil-rich town of Ras Lanuf, Gaddafis forces bombarded the area with heavy artillery and bombs from air strikes.\n\nDoctors and rebels have retreated to the nearby town of Brega. It is unclear who controls Ras Lanuf but Gaddafis men appear to be having the upper hand.\n\nRas Lanuf is a three-and-a-half hours drive from the rebel capital of Benghazi.\n\nAccording to the rebels, thousands of people have died in the fighting.\n\nWe estimate some 6,000 people have died  both civilians and the rebels, said Dr Mohamed Kamal Kablan from the Media Centre.\n\nHowever, the figure cannot be independently verified. The opposition also claims many more have gone missing.\n\nAs the death toll mounts, US President Barack Obama said the world had an obligation to prevent any massacre of civilians in Libya similar to those in Rwanda and Bosnia during the 1990s.\n\nHowever, Obama did not specify what action the US would take, saying no option had been taken off the table and that the US had to balance cost versus benefit as it made decisions.\n\nThe opposition repeated their calls for a no-fly zone to stop the mounting death toll.\n\nWe just need a no-fly zone over Libya. We dont need foreign troops in here, said Yousef Feituri, a rebel commander fighting on the frontline.\n\nThree-quarters of Gaddafis strength is in the skies. The remaining one quarter is on the ground. We can deal with that and we will prevail, said Yousef.","verified":"NO","longitude":18.086542,"id":"2622","report":765,"location":"Bin Jawad","incidenttitle":"Massacre of rebels in Bin Jawad"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[18.086542,30.8002]}},{"properties":{"latitude":32.374298,"category":"Armed Threat","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 01:18:00 -0500","original":"1:17:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 01:17:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/14 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/13/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/13 00:00:00 -0500"},"approved":"YES","description":"A crack Libyan brigade commanded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Khamis was slowed by a mutiny as it advanced on Misrata on Saturday, with 32 soldiers joining the rebels holding the city, a rebel there said.

Rebel forces in turn fired several rounds of missiles towards positions held by pro-Gaddafi fighters on the outskirts.","verified":"NO","longitude":20.051561,"id":"4191","report":1207,"location":"benghazi, libya","incidenttitle":"Gaddafi launches assault on Benghazi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[20.051561,32.098636]}},{"properties":{"latitude":32.118993,"category":"Armed Threat","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 11:09:00 -0500","original":"11:08:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 11:08:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/20 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/19/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/19 00:00:00 -0400"},"approved":"YES","description":"Our correspondent saw the government tanks on a bridge inside Benghazi at around 1030 (0830 GMT), and reports suggested hundreds of people were fleeing the city eastwards as the fighting continued.","verified":"NO","longitude":20.067353,"id":"4194","report":1208,"location":"benghazi","incidenttitle":"Reports of government tanks on bridge in Benghazi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[20.067353,32.118993]}},{"properties":{"latitude":32.385896,"category":"Armed Attack","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 11:28:00 -0500","original":"11:27:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 11:27:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/20 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/19/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/19 00:00:00 -0400"},"approved":"YES","description":"Reuters reports a resident of Misrata saying pro-Gaddafi snipers have killed two people in the rebel-held city.\n\n*Note - Source is live BBC blog.\n\nNOT VERIFIED:\n\nThe Reuters source says that reports from Misrata cannot be independently verified as foreign journalists have been prevented from reaching the city.\nhttp://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE72I08020110319 (ONC)","verified":"NO","longitude":15.09904,"id":"4204","report":1211,"location":"Misrata libya","incidenttitle":"Reports of injured in Misurata"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[15.09904,32.385896]}},{"properties":{"latitude":32.374298,"category":"Armed Attack","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 11:51:00 -0500","original":"11:50:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 11:50:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/20 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/19/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/19 00:00:00 -0400"},"approved":"YES","description":"19/03/2011\n\n@Libyan4life\nJeel Ghathub\nAJE caller just said 51 have died in so far today in #Misrata and 83 injured.
