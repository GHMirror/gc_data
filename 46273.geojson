The painting in question was &amp;quot;Glassford Family Portrait&amp;quot; by Archibald McLauchlan (c 1767). \n\nBoth groups introduced themselves, then Polly and Lorraine spoke about the painting, the background, social and historical relevance and their method of restoration.\n\nYOUNG Co. members asked loads of questions and found out about the painting and the restoration process. In the spirit of a new collaboration, the group then swapped roles so that  YOUNG Co. took on the role of the experts, and Polly and Lorraine became the questioning visitors.  This evolved in a very spontaneous manner and both sides took well to their new roles. We felt that this kept true to the Contacting the World task. Eve, one of the YOUNG Co. filmed the event. This footage will be added to the YOUNG Co. page on the TAG website (see link below). \n\n&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk/index.cfm/page/29&amp;quot;&amp;gt;YOUNG Co. web page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;You can browse our map to find out about the people and places involved.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\nEach participant has answered a few questions about themselves and provided some pictures. The suggested images were to be of themselves, of something from their home and of their dream destination.

I love taking photos, rock climbing, exploring mountains, my bloke and our cat Flo. I guess my favourite thing is being happy!\n\nMY DREAM COLLABORATOR IS:\nNot an individual but a group…The Band! If only I’d lived earlier (and had a significant singing talent) then I could have been one of their amazing guests in their last concert “The Last Waltz”. If you haven’t seen it, check it out.\n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS:\nSan Francisco. It’s probably my favourite place I’ve been to. So many different areas to visit, each with a totally unique atmosphere. It also looks awesome…lots to photograph. Now that I think of it, it’s also where “The Last Waltz” was filmed.

I was lucky enough to see his production of the Mahabharata in 1990 when Glasgow was European City of Culture. It is the story of the Hindu religion, told in 9 hours, it completely blew me away. I think it was the first truly multi-cultural piece of theatre I had seen, it told a great story full of humanity, humour and more theatre spectacle than I believe I will ever see again. \n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS: \n…hard, there are too many places I haven’t seen and want to.
