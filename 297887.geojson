the period from 1998 to 2008 Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (URC) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents.","2009":null,"2010":null,"2011":null,"id":"aa7itjn1e3mv","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"statistics":null,"geo_score":0.0,"2007":null,"geography":"2","2008":null,"violations":"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services.","2009":null,"2010":null,"2011":null,"id":"aa7itjnjqa2m","geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"statistics":null,"geo_score":0.0,"2007":null,"geography":"3","2008":null,"violations":"The methodology for calculating census metropolitan area (CMA) populations was modified in 2003.

These forces report approximately one-third of the total criminal incidents for the province and include the Ontario Provincial Police and about 60 small and mid-sized municipal forces. This discrepancy resulted in an over-count of less serious criminal incidents. During 2003 and 2004, the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS) consulted with affected police services and analyzed both historical Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) data and more recent Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) microdata to determine the impact of this over-reporting. The effect at the Canada level was, on average, 1% per year from 1977 to 2000. This over-counting peaked in 1991, where it was estimated that the total crime rate for the country was over-estimated by approximately 1.8%. However, the overall historical trend changed very little. The impact in Ontario is more noticeable, but the overall trend is still very similar. On average, the effect was 2% to 3% per year, with the biggest change occurring in 1991, where the Ontario crime rate is 5% lower as a result of the adjustment.
