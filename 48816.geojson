This was one of the best times I have shared with both of my parents.It was actually the first time I drank beer(more than a sip) too, but of course I didn\\'t like the taste then. At the time, I was grossly obssesed with the Holocaust, so we made the journey out to Ausweiz and a few of the smaller camps. Seeing where the devastation occured made a huge impact on me. Germany althogether is such a historically rich place that when I cam home I had a new appreciation for traveling.  \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7awrj31dxps"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.576543,48.136022]}},{"properties":{"name":"AUSTRIA","description":"Posted by MarybethVienna, AustriaWe went through Austria in a day or two- it was a side trip from Germany.

This trip was so amazing! The company my dad works for, State Farm, actually takes a \"Millionaire\" trip every year and brings their top salesmen along who qualify. As long as I can remember State Farm has taken the Brown family on some really neat adventures, this was probably the best one so far. It was a bonding experience for the three of us. Needless to say I would go back in a heartbeat. The culture was so charming. I loved walking down cobble stone streets, with pubs linning the streets, flower boxes adorning every window.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7awriy2k6ud"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.109922,51.523758]}},{"properties":{"name":"NOVA SCOTIA","description":"Posted by MarybethI think I was about 9 years old when my parents took us on this trip.

Oh but I do remember the dads bought live lobster and we cooked them at our campsite. It was, and still is, the only time I have ever seen a lobster in pain.
