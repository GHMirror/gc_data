There are also plenty of trees lining the fairways that can alter your shots. The signature hole is #4, a 196-yard, par 3, requiring a tee shot directly into the wind and up to an elevated green. This course is located within the 1,138-acre T.O. Fuller State Park. There was a prehistoric civilization discovered on the premises when excavation began for the clubs\\' swimming pool. The\n    artifacts (from the Chucalissa Indian Village) have been partially restored and housed in an air-conditioned museum. Tee times are only reserved for weekends and holidays.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dokfkl2oay"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.113479,35.057715]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Arcade","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 540 S Main St, Memphis, TNThe Arcade (901) 526-5757<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dokfqbfi84"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.058831,35.132657]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wal-Mart Supercenter","description":"Posted by System5255 Elvis Presley Blvd, Memphis, TNWal-Mart Supercenter (901) 346-4557<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dokfoy8d3x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.025467,35.004907]}},{"properties":{"name":"Whitehaven High School","description":"Posted by Yahoolocal4851 Elvis Presley Blvd, Memphis, TNWhitehaven High School (901) 416-3000<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dokfgn77w4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.025222,35.015904]}},{"properties":{"name":"Whites Chapel Elementary School","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 3966 Sewanee Rd, Memphis, TNWhites Chapel Elementary School (901) 416-8206<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dokftqvnut"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.124099,35.041055]}},{"properties":{"name":"bohomom","description":"Posted by Ginnyowens<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/july3_008.jpg\">Southaven, MS<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dokfo4klt2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.008333,34.991667]}},{"properties":{"name":"the memphis zoo","description":"Posted by Grobilio<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/at_the_zoo.jpg\">i know this place kind of breaks the trend that I\\'ve set with my other places but this was always a big part of my life in memphis.  The zoo was the place to walk off ur hangover or the place to pay 5 dollars and just have a great time.  Overton park is right next door, we would go play football, play ultimate frisbee, go golfing, or just have a picnic in the grass.  It has gone way down hill since those days but I will always love it.  And its only place in the entire nation that Interstate 40 stops.  They were going to build straight through it but a month before some hippie discovered that an indangered species of duck lands here once a year and it needs to stay protected.
