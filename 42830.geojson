The canyon was a major thoroughfare for early settlers who settled in its scenic side canyons—Baker, Black Star, Silverado and Modjeska. \r\nTraces of Orange County\\'s earliest residents were discovered at nearby Black Star Canyon. Arrowheads and rocks pockmarked with grinder holes—signs that the Indians ground acorns to produce an edible gruel—have been found on the plateau high above the canyon, where a large Indian village once existed. \r\n\r\nBlack Star Canyon got its name in the 1870s, when Black Star Mining Company began mining for coal that recently had been discovered there. The mining operation was short-lived, though, because the quality of the coal was so poor. \r\n\r\nSantiago Creek flows into Irvine Lake, which was formed in 1931 when a dam was built across lower Santiago Canyon.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ljxteo37f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.661858,33.787708]}},{"properties":{"name":"Upper Newport Bay","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/upper.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/card_newport.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/upper_boat.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 2301 University Dr., Newport Beach, CA 92660A beautiful setting that offers outstanding outdoor activities: Bird-watching, jogging, bicycling, hiking, kayaking and horseback riding.
