I remember laughing and asking him over and over -- \"What is this?!?!\"  All he said was, you\\'ve got to go.  If you get stuck, there is a number on the back of your envelope... Call it for help.  I turn the envelope over and it says \"Phone a friend - 503-***-****\".  I was so nervous - I had no idea what this was -- and WHO\\'S number was this?!  \n\nJake gave me a kiss -- and then he was gone.  Leaving me in Baja Fresh\\'s parking lot.  So, I got in my car and headed to Northwest Portland where I was sure I was making my way towards a spa called Journey on Kearney...  \n\nHalf way to NW, I decided to phone my friend and see if I could figure out if I was heading in the right direction.  I nervously dialed the number -- half way realizing who it was (Jake\\'s parents).  Jake\\'s Dad answers the phone and says \"Hello, this is phone a friend.\"  I said \"Lance?!\"...  \"I need help figuring out where I\\'m supposed to go.\"  He gave me a few more clues which confirmed I was heading the correct direction.

I found myself at the Alano Club.  A large house in the heart of NW Portland which is the home of many recovery meetings.  \n\nI walked inside and found a front desk.  There was a woman behind the desk and I said \"Hi, my name is Christine\".  While I was expecting her to say \"That\\'s nice, can I help you?\"...  She just smiled and handed me another yellow envelope.  I thanked her for the envelope and hurried outside to open my 2nd clue.  It said:\n\nMethod air on a dare\nHow high can you ollie?\nThis jungle of plywood\nIs the Department of Folly\n\nI thought -- What?!  Wait, ok, I know this one...  This one is easier.  It\\'s the Department of Skateboarding!  Ha, I was getting better at these riddles!  \n\nSee, Jake is a skateboarder and he\\'s spent many hours of his life at the Department.  I as his girlfriend have been there a few times myself.  \n\nSo, I\\'m off...  As I\\'m driving over to DOS, I begin to wonder what is happening?  What is going on?  How long will this continue?  I actually thought that Jake would be waiting for me at the Department with a Christmas gift...  The following week was christmas and Jake and I would be spending it apart.  Me with my family in Washington and he, in PDX.  So, I thought it was very logical that he\\'d be waiting with my Christmas gifts at the Department...   \n\nOn the drive over to DOS, I also distinctively recall telling myself to \"stay in the moment\"...  See, I am very good at projecting the future -- and being completely wrong!  For a moment I thought -- what if???  But, in order to not get my hopes up, I pushed out all ideas of what was at the end of this journey and just played along.    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hdjqp9vyx5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.700418,45.529064]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Amazing Gift race -- Clue #3 (Department of Skateboarding)","description":"Posted by Christine<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/IM001872.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/clue3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 15 NE Hancock St, Portland, OR 97212I arrived at the Department feeling a bit shy as I am not a skateboarder, nor have I been there without Jake.

I knew Jason, who was working -- and said \"Ummm, do you have a clue for me?\"  He smiled and gladly handed over another yellow envelope.  I opened it and it read:\n\nSkateboards and drugs\nOnly one peaks my interest\nBuy the CCCP sticker \nThat they say is the \"pimpest\"\n\nWith my new found confidence in solving riddles, this one again, took little effort.  \"CCCP\" was the give away, Corporate Coercion Cals Pharmacy... aka Cal\\'s Pharmacy.

He give\\'s me the sticker and I pay him .50 cents.  He also hands me a clue.  It read:\n\nBulgogi and kimchee\nBooks raining from Heaven\nFind homer\\'s Odyssey\nTurn to page 57\n\nHummmm....  Ok, at this point, my nerves are shot.  My voice is a bit quivery and I\\'ve got a knot in my stomach.  Forget trying to play it cool in front of the guys at Cal\\'s -- I\\'m FREAKING out here!  I\\'m laughing nervously and trying to focus.  \n\nFinally, I realize -- I must be heading to Jake\\'s parents house.  Why?  \"Bulgogi and kimchee\"  Jake\\'s mother is Korean and these are two items that are made and consumed in their house frequently.  Also, \"Books raining from Heaven\".

He instructed me to open it.  \r\n\r\nWhat was inside was a GIGANTIC ring.... About 4\" x 3\" in size.  When I saw the ring, I finally knew what this was.  At that moment, Jake got down on one knee, and revealed another ring -- one that would fit my finger.  He asked me to marry him.\r\n\r\nThrough my tears, I said yes.  \r\n\r\n  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hdjqlu77f5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.596763,45.51579]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trezise Family Homestead","description":"Posted by Christine<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 1920 Traditional Tudor that the Trezise family has lived in since 1988<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hdjqcaw49c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.627141,45.547123]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trumpeter Swans Sighting","description":"Posted by Christine<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/trumpeter_swan1.jpg\">Went home for thanksgiving last weekend up to Skagit Valley.
