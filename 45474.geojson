In many ways the city has not recovered from the idea that this happened here in enlightened and progressive Portland. \r\nMulugeta Seraw was an Ethiopian student who went to the United States to attend college and was killed in 1988 in Portland, Oregon by a racist skinhead gang, which consisted of Ken \"Death\" Mieske, Kyle Brewster, and Steve Strasser, who were linked to White Aryan Resistance. Seraw was killed on Southeast 31st Avenue, near his apartment. \r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1988, a group of racists known as East Side White Pride brutally beat Seraw with a bat and left him in a puddle of his own blood. Seraw died in the early-morning hours of the following day. The murder was one of the most shocking crimes in Portland history. In response, hundreds of people turned out for rallies against racism. The three men who beat Seraw to death were arrested and, in 1990, Mieske was convicted of first-degree murder and Brewster and Strasser of manslaughter and assault. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a691g7yl7mr6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.63304,45.5206]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Zoo Structures Still Visable","description":"Posted by Gonzag80Dispite being removed to a far off section of the park 50 years ago, traces of the old zoo can be seen along this dirt trail above the roadway.

It turned out, the \"monster\" was just a playful 15-foot baby killer whale.\r\n\r\nThe Columbian reported thousands of people flocking to the banks of the slough daily until Ed Lessard, an ex-whaler who lived in Clark County, figured he could make a buck off the aquatic mammal. He and his brother acquired a fishing license and harpooned Ossie through the head.\r\n\r\n\"Lessard looked at the thousands who came and went on the river banks and thought of them in terms of admission, so much per head,\" the paper reported.\r\n\r\n\"Lessard will raise Oswald and put him on exhibition, minus the acrobatics, of course, for a dead whale has to be very still.\"\r\n\r\nThe brothers were taken to court over the action and convicted of violating fishing laws, but they appealed on the grounds that Ossie wasn\\'t a fish, and won.\r\n\r\nThey toured the country with Ossie\\'s body in a large metal tank, but when profits dried up, they took him to their property on Livingston Mountain and dumped him off.\r\n\r\nThe farm was sold to a man in China, and Ossie was forgotten.\r\n\r\nOver time, the location of the tank became a lost Dutchman\\'s mine of sorts.\r\n\r\nEventually, someone ran across it. News of its whereabouts spread. The box was demolished, and Ossie\\'s body was desecrated by vandals. His teeth were knocked out. His body was broken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a691g7w3odq8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.69188,45.59074]}},{"properties":{"name":"Park Bench Memorial to Burning Man Suicide","description":"Posted by Gonzag80During the early morning one day in the 1990s, a man committed suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and lighting himself at the base of the tall column here.\r\nLater on, his mother dedicated a bench down the hill in his memory.
