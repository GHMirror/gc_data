But thanks to them I loved it. Anything goes in Bangkok, and plotting the hotel on the map, makes me realise how little of it I actually saw. We were staying right in the middle of the tourist section. Th Khao San (Khao San Rd) the main backpacker market, guest house and internet cafe area was a block from our hotel (just to the south on the map). But a short walk from here and you are splashing wakes with locals selling anything and everything in their river boats to anyone, whether they be on, in or by the water. Our tour took us through the canals by houses, mangroves, temples and museums and ended in he river in view of the Royal Palace and Wat Poh (the biggest temple in Thailand). I nearly fell over, a number of times at the magnificance of these two landmarks. The thousands of coloured mirrors, statues, and gold leaf paintings. I became one of those tourist monsters that can\\'t stop taking photos, and has to keep taking the same shot until the split second where the view is clear of other tourists and the camera shutter is clicking coincide.\r\nHighlights:\r\nSeeing the solid gold buddah that I have heard so much about. It is incomparable to any other that I have seen so far.\r\nMy debit card reaching its expiry date and having to face my first logistical challenge (not really all that hard actually).\r\nHaving the best tour guide, Ming Kwan, who didn\\'t wilt in the sun, always smiled and convinced me to keep going and see the Golden Buddah.\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\nBangkok- Venice of the East\r\nMe and Ming Kwan at the Golden Buddah<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5v0l0c1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.49739,13.76007]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bruce and Jodie's House","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5ouudd5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[102.63273,17.97196]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chiang Rai","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P3220621.JPG\">From ThaTon I was hoping to get a long boat down the river to Chiang Rai, but a lack of passengers made it too expensive. So I hitched a ride with the only other potential passenger and his hotel manager. They had driven from Chiang Rai so he could take the trip in the boat. I later discovered that had we been there the day before. We would have been sharing with about 16 other passengers (you win some you lose some).\nSolomon, an Israeli, Chang, a Thai Guest House manager and I cruised down to Chiang Rai. My first impression of Chiang Rai was that it was “complete”. The foot paths were complete, there was no (or very limited) construction going on. Chiang Rai felt settled. I haven’t seen or felt this in a town for quite some time (maybe in Kuala Kangsar near Suka Suka, but otherwise not since Oz). This completed feeling extended into the surrounding country side as well. It’s the type of place you could retire to. Dinner at the night market bought me my first sight of cooked beetles and larvae for dinner (no didn’t try it!).\n\nPhoto: Bugs for dinner\n\nResolution of the map here is not great so can\\'t pinpoint anything precise.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5ii0ctm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[99.47948,19.60362]}},{"properties":{"name":"Crossing the Equator! 06-02-07","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5oraojx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[105.9,0.02]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home","description":"Posted by Abaker462 Guinea St, Albury, NSW, Australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5kzcqlf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.921252,-36.074434]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home Stay","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3080383.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3080411.JPG\">Not quite Suca Suca but with the same intentions we were introduced to some Thai country culture. A visit to the local Moonshine distillery (I think the smell was worse than the taste), offerings to the local monks and an ideal cycling tour of rice paddies, eggplant fields and mushroom farms, topped off with a visit to a clothing and accessories factory/shop (read two story barn like building with mountains of scrap material being miraculously transformed by three ladies at sewing machines into the gorgeous pants, skirts, bags, hats and purses that we find in hippy shops back home or the markets in the Thai cities.\r\nWe were also entertained by the local kids performing traditional music and dances... the intention was sweet... if you know what I mean!\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\nVery excited 13 year olds playing for the tourists\r\nMoonshine stills<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5qgr5qi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[99.63501,18.54212]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home Town","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5q9xgmn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.95313,-36.13787]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home for four years","description":"Posted by Abaker 1 MacDonald St, Paddington, NSW, Australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5i201l1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.223773,-33.881002]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel Hong Ping, Penang","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P2260139.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P2250113.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> We hit Penang at the end of the Chinese New Year festivities. Excellent timing as we were staying in China Town. Venturing out alone one night I was soon swept up in the craziness that is chinese celebrations, from extravagant floats made entirely of flowers to the two main stages being less than 20 meters apart and facing each other! Meaning the sound from each was having a full on fight to be heard by the audience trapped between them, and the fight was loud! Somehow I managed to get myself interviewed by the MC on the bigger of the two stages, maybe it was because I\\'m tall with red hair, I think they picked me for a foreigner! Still didn\\'t get to see a Lion Dance, which has been a goal since arriving in Singapore (it\\'ll have to be next year I guess)\r\nPhotos:\r\nChinese Opera- Stage 2\r\nOfferings to the Gods, last night of Chinese New Year, I\\'m standing about half way along the table.

I organized a ticket for the Slow Boat from Huay Xai (Laos) to Luang Phabang with an overnight stay in Pak Beng. As soon as I crossed over the Mekong and had my passport stamped (Yes!) I realized that the expiry date I had been reading was the date I had to enter Laos by, not the date that the visa expired on! It means that I’ll end up doubling back on myself somewhere, but that is not really a drama.\n\nA Slow Boat down the Mekong. Rivers should definitely be traveled upon slowly; this is my conclusion. Like life, you can speed through, be tossed around and splashed about  (which is sometimes fun), but really you are missing the beauty of your surroundings and the feeling of water/life. I like dragging my hand through the water as I travel along it. It feels so smooth and it looks so beautiful. In two days, I had plenty of opportunity for this. \n\nThere were about 100 passengers, all foreigners (a lot of Frenchies, which was new compared to Thailand). A third sat up the front of the very long, colourful, wooden boat, on bamboo mats, the rest sat on tiny wooden benches, which are on par with church pews for comfort, but perhaps a little more rickety. It started with everyone sitting very politely in their own personal space and very soon melted into bodies draped into any position that would offer slightly more comfort than the original and would at least be bearable for two days. We stopped overnight at a town called Pak Beng where the hawkers of guesthouses and bag carriers are unmerciful and finished in Luang Phabang a beautiful French/Laos town that has seen a boom thanks to tourism in the last few years.\n\nPhotos:\nA slow boat\nMy boat friend Jen\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5x6s63g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.41298,20.25769]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kasi","description":"Posted by AbakerAs an alternative to Vang Vieng Rebecca and I decided to break the bus ride from Vientiane to Louang Phabang at a little village named Kasi. More of a long haul bus stop than a village it consisted mainly of large noodle restaurants a couple of guesthouses and some gorgeous karst scenery. Apparently there are some spectacular caves around Kasi so we set off to find them. Heading in one direction we seemed to get some promising affirmations from locals when we attempted to ask for directions, that was until we stumbled across possibly the only english speaker in the whole town. The young school teacher. Within 15 minutes he arranged himself, his mate and two scooters to show us the caves for the rest of the day! I love fate!\r\nThe caves really weren\\'t that impressive but it was a beautiful day and we spent some good quality time at a little cave with some big buddah statues in a forest surrounding. We waited out a huge rain storm under the shelter of a little hut and I tapped into some good earth energy to help try and kick the cold/flu/whatever. It worked quite well actually.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5oj340x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[102.25,19.2333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kaula Lumpur","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/Storming_KL.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/Friendly_and_Personal.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/KL_Night_Markets.JPG\">I\\'m somewhere in Kuala Lumpur, but not this exact marker point (I can\\'t find it on this map). As with all the towns we have stayed in so far we are in China Town. \r\nHighlights: \r\nStummbling upon a Ganesh Temple and taking part in the bathing ceremony. Basically there is a whole lot of chanting, and food thrown into a fire. Then the staue of Ganesh gets a right royal bath in all sorts of good liquids, then they dress him up all pretty like, feed him and sing to him. Once he is all fat and sleepy and happy, the monks give out blessings and yummy food while the prayers give garlands.\r\n\r\nI got into the groove of the night market towards the end, especially when it was other peoples money!\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\nI\\'ll be your friendly tour guide\r\nDinner at the Night Market\r\nStorming KL\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5q5ajxl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[101.61907,3.11001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ko Samui","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P2280188.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3010195.JPG\">I felt like I was taking advantage of someone elses holiday in Ko Samui. The last time I was staying at a place like this was Southern Spain with Mum and Dad. It was all about the sun, the sand and the sleep!\r\nLike Spain though I didn\\'t think it was that pretty, too resort like for me, and lots of development (Thai style development is adding more and more phone lines until the poles fall down from the weight and building with bamboo as scaffolding). Mind you the island hopping was gorgeous. The night life... imagine the seediest, meat market of a club that you went to in uni or exists in your home town/suburb, double the size of it and put in a strip of 10 other smaller clubs. Then add kids (and a few seedy old guys) who are a very long way from home and responsibility and are thus letting free will run riot with  buckets of san jay, your starting to get the idea! Then walk out of the club on to the 2.5 foot wide footpath where there is a throng of european families, lady boys, tuk tuk drivers and market stalls, oh and watch out for the phonelines that haven\\'t managed to stay aloft on their buckling poles. It is definate a must see!\r\nThe day time tour of the island we did included the Giant Gold Buddah, the Grand Mother and Grand Father rocks (one looks like a vagina and the other a penis) and the mummified monk. \r\nI\\'ve not been to Vegas, but somehow I feel there are similarities.\r\nHighlights: Ironically enough two of the most beautiful things I have seen all trip were on Ko Samui!\r\n1) At the giant golden buddah, an English couple had bought their baby girl to be blessed by a monk. He lifted her up ontoher feet and blew on her forehead. At first she was a little confused , but then she looked up into his eyes and the most devine smile radiated up from her heart, through her eyes and into his soul.\r\n2) Letting go a massive hot air balloon like lantern on the beach. It was like this burning ball of gas was striving so hard to reach the stars, it was really beautiful.\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\nThe steps of the temple (Anna, Hapreet and me)\r\nParty time in Ko Samui (Jess, Hapreet, Anna and Paulina)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5nyesmn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[99.98477,9.58154]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lampang","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3080336.JPG\">Two words and a sound to describe Lampang:\r\nThai Massage\r\nAhhhhhhhhhh\r\n\r\nOutside of Lampang we went to an Elepant Conservation Centre, which I am very tempted to return to and spend a few days there learning to ride and instruct the elephants. But it might be a bit far out of my budget unfortunately.\r\nIt took me a while to come to a decision about the ethics of elephant riding etc. but this place is incredible. The only elephant hospital in the world and given the reduction of natural habitat a safe haven for retired/sick working elephants.

Already the myths of travelling alone have been dispelled. My last farewell at People Place and I subsequently turned to the lady at the next table and struck up a conversation that progressed into one of the most amazing conversations of my life! She, Eleanor is scottish and her partner Neil is Aussie. They have been in the Maldives for the last six months and are in Chaing Mai for a bit of RandR after the intensity of working and living in this country. Particularly difficult for females.\nThat afternoon I made my way to the west end of the city and into every day Chaing Mai life in the wonderful care of Lou Lou, another Aussie working here with Australian Volunteers International. Lou Lou is working with an HIV/AIDs not-for-profit group, and has introduced me to some of the deeper issues facing Thailand, particularly around Burmese refugees. The situation there is so complicated, but no matter how confusing one thing is clear, those people have got it bloody hard!\nSo I\\'m taking a couple of days out, catching up on this map and enjoying having a home, free internet and laundry facilities. Chaing Mai is covered in smoke at the moment. It sits in a valley and has little wind so the smoke accumulates and stagnates. But under the blanket is a great town, the old part of which is completely surronded by a moat (you can see it if you have the hybrid or satellite maps showing). As with most towns in Thailand, there are heaps of dogs, temples and traffic. But it also has the best night markets I\\'ve been to so far, influenced by the uni students, the hill tribes and the tourists.\n\nPhoto: Lou Lou and I at a fabulous vegetarian restaurant<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5j3ozmu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[98.96922,18.79696]}},{"properties":{"name":"Louang Phabang","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P3280698.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P3250678.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P3290711.JPG\">Here is a quick glance, in no particular order, at what I achieved here over the week that I stayed:\nRode a scooter (unfortunately not by myself)\nHad a home cooked meal\nGot monks (novices) to hug a tree\nAte Mekong Seaweed\nSwam in the River (not the Mekong, yet, but close enough)\nWas inspired by art\nGot my picture in the paper\nHad LOTS of photos of myself taken by a professional photographer (he has photographed the likes of the Dali Lama, Mother Theresa, Desmond Tutu, Bill Clinton and now me!)\nTaught myself some English Gramma and then done some learns on kids\nDid not see any temples\nAlmost jumped on top of a monk (novice) where if I had made contact (No.1 NoNo), it would have been with my feet (No 2 NoNo) on his head (No 3 NoNo) while I was scantily dressed (No 4 NoNo). Explanation: Jumping out of a tree into a waterfall pool with my swimmers on and not knowing he was in the water below.\nLike Chaing Mai this was a big week of reflection and pushing personal boundaries. I can happily say that here, now, I am feeling comfortable with my new life style. I am so happy. I take each day as it comes and don’t rush or worry over anything. I am not partying hard, drinking loads and generally having a wild and crazy time. I am listening deeply, to myself, others and the earth (mainly rivers). I do a bit of meditation when I can, I smile lots, I buy little, I have lots of fruit smoothies. I get scared every now and then and I grow by day.\nPhotos:\nVanhSeng Hugging a Tree\nThe house that Thongchanh built \nAt the waterfalls<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5siykfy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[102.132,19.88677]}},{"properties":{"name":"Luang Phabang 2","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5tjqdrq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[102.14,19.87]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nakhon Si Thammarat","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/Shadow_Puppet_2_.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/Anna_and_me_at_groovy_cafe.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/Pigs_head_at_Wat_2_.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/Pigs_head_at_Wat_3_.JPG\">Again, not an exact location, which is pretty weird as I can find Suka Suka, which according to the Malaysian Cartographers (people who make maps) the island is actually underwater and doesn\\'t exist!

Two weeks teaching english to villagers who live in a National Park in Laos and run guided walks to a Wild Elephant Observation Tower.\r\nBefore heading out to Ban Na (the village) I spent an orientation weekend with the Open Minds team: Toto, a hugely inspiring 24 year old who provides the local know how for getting the projects up and running, Sven the head of the organisation, who is particularly interested in how technology can assist in empowering more people more efficiently and a few other young Thai people who are getting an alternate opportunity by learning skills in admin, Thai for English teaching and any other jobs that come up at the Openmind office.\r\nOrientation included a crash course in Thai, which is very similar to Laos, so was helpful, some Thai cooking and dancing, and a pep talk on the challenges of teaching english in a park. There were about  of us on the course. Myself and Rebecca heading to Ban Na and the others heading for a school in Thailand.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5nq7i6k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[102.73933,17.88107]}},{"properties":{"name":"Peoples Place","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3100459.JPG\">The resting place of my Intrepid Trip.\r\nAm a little nervous about being alone, what I\\'ll do next (apart from a rest) I have no idea! and making it all the way to India, it seems so far away right now.\r\n\r\nPhoto: Fare thee well girls!

Well I\\'ve written about in my diary, but for the purposes of a quick update to you all, I don\\'t know where to begin! It was the first time out of a town, so I think my heart opened to it even before we arrived. Having to get there by boat across a picturesque lake helped and being welcomed by the family of three gentle Malay hosts sealed the deal. It was set up like a Bed and Breakfast, but it was run with intimacy and care so that I felt like I was a part of the family (and so did my 11 other travelling friends). We swam, we visited the nearby village, we walked to a secluded waterfall and we ate. We ate like it was the only thing we could do. Malay style is to feed your guest until they are full and then bring out more dishes. I did very well at embracing this custom I feel! We were there for two nights and I think I could have stayed for two months and not noticed the extended time frame.\r\nPhotos:\r\nThe Food!!!\r\nSuka Suka on approach<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5ij6fs8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.95526,4.95996]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sukhothai","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3060318.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3070324.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/P3070325.JPG\">A quiet little town that was he second capital of Thailand back in the 1400s. The main attraction is the old city ruins, which are pretty cool. We got push bikes and did it Thai style around the ruins.\r\nMy favourite thing though was hanging out in the bamboo huts at No. 4 Guesthouse where we were staying. The owner, Miss Neung was a guesthouse owner right out of a book. Small and grinning, she would quickly win you over with her giggles and cheeky jokes. But woe to those who get on the wrong side of her, she doesn\\'t give an inch of leniancy if she suspects you are doing wrong by her. I guess this comes from dealing with farangs (foreigners) day in day out.\r\nIt was hot and smokey, making for very moody sunsets, or pre-sunsets as the smoke engulfed the sun before it had a chance to reach the horizon. It is bushfire season here, and by the looks of the randomly burnt patches of vegetation, and the signs with unhappy cartoons engulfed in flames, I\\'d say they have as much trouble as we do in Oz.\r\nI met Gabriella at No 4 Guesthouse. She had just come from travelling solo in India and didn\\'t recommend it very highly (eek!). However, we had a lovely dinner together and shared reasons for going to India, life stories and she piled me up with a whole heap of advice (my favourite is the bottle of whisky for medicinal purposes). \r\nIn her own words, India had made her hard, and even though I\\'d known her for only a few hours I could see it. She wasn\\'t won over by Miss Neung\\'s charms, she said NO when asked if we wanted a tuk tuk, no eye contact, no confusion. I wonder if I\\'ll end up like this. No doubt my assertiveness will flourish, but I hope that I can keep an open strong heart at the same time. Gabriella opened her heart to me and I am eternally grateful to have had the opportunity to listen to her soft stories of courage and strength. I hope that I was able to share enough of me to equal what she gave to me.\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\nMiss Neung- Mistress of Guest House No 4\r\nGabriella the courageous\r\nOld Sukhothai <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5nd6ahn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[99.75,17.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tha Ton","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P3210609.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P3210607.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P3210612.jpg\">Well what started as a couple of days resting in Chaing Mai ended up being more than a week. Not because of all the sight seeing or the parties or other crazy adventures that travelers usually find themselves in, but because I was given permission to just chill out and do nothing. I realize now that in my “Slow Journey” I had been keeping to someone elses schedule (the Boat, Intrepid’s) up until this point. And so with no one to tell me where to go next, I guess I didn’t know where to go. Lucky for me, Lou Lou is wise enough to know when someone needs to just be and this is exactly what she let me do. So there was lots of time for reflection, some tears and some growth. Once ready to head out again, I headed north to Tha Ton. \n\nOn, what at first glance might appear more like an oversized aluminum can, was in actual fact my bus. And as it turned out the interview room for the Sydney Morning Herald article (I’d just like to note here that it was a public bus, I was the only foreigner and it didn’t have any airconditioning! Perfect location for the interview I think).\n\nThe whole newspaper experience was one long giggle for me. Before I left Australia I had been told about the Universal Chuckle. You see it on the face of the Dali Lama all the time. It is that chuckle that comes from pure love in every situation, the chuckle that responds to the awkward and uncomfortable with a child like amusement. I think this is what I have been feeling, and it is so cool. I’m sure Wendy the reporter and Palani the photographer would have different takes on the situation but, mine was very enjoyable and funny.\n\nwww.smh.com.au (then do a search on Wendy Frew and find the article A Slow Boat to the World)\n\nThe marker I have for ThaTon (if you zoom in) is at the top of a hill that I walked. Along the way are a number of buildings and statues operated by the main temple of the town and are possibly some of the most bizarre things I have seen. One building looks like a GIGANTIC painted easter egg, there is a cave (which  I think is man made, down to the stalactites/mites) which has a statue of what can only be described as a human size gnome, a very ganeshy looking elephant and a buddah. At the final stop is a huge statue of the Buddah dude, plus accommodation in a boat shaped building! Despite (or perhaps because, maybe they have got their Universal Chuckle down pat), it is truly a beautiful place and the long climb (4km) to the top is rewarded with stunning views. \n\nI was quite proud making it there early in the morning, and then I was completely humbled when I passed the many people from the hill tribes in the next valley that walk at least twice as far, along a foot worn track, every single day and night. No taxis or buses to get you home after a shitty day at the office or because its raining!\n\nPhotos:View from the map marker (top of the hill and Buddah statue)\nHill Tribe village in next valley\nLarge Buddah, Little Me\n\nDon\\'t know why they are on the side, you will just have to use your Go-Go Gadget necks<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5rsvwbj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[99.35546,20.07072]}},{"properties":{"name":"The River","description":"Posted by Abaker<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5smc14k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.90521,-36.08887]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vang Viang","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P7190737.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/P7190740.JPG\">Zoom in to the city\n\nI think that I didn’t give this town enough time. It is pretty tacky along the main street, its purpose is like the Ko Sammui’s of this world: to service the needs of holiday-makers. In a way I liked it though, it catches people out. As a tourist everyone wants to be different to the other tourists and touch something personal in a new land, be seen as genuine. I am definitely one of these sort of tourists. But no tourist can deny the fun that they have getting pissed and dancing and maybe getting lucky at the cheap bars, or perhaps the relaxation they get from vegging in front of one of the many TV screens in the bars showing American sitcoms and international sport. Should they have to deny it?\n\nSo my more noble participation in Tourism was to arrive in Vang Vieng after a 7 hour bus journey at break neck speed through winding mountainous roads (Hare Krishna, Hail Mother Mary I’m still alive), sleep in a  room (it did the job) and then join a “Green Discovery Eco-Trekking” tour which was kayaking down the Nam Lik river. We started an hour out of Vang Vieng and finished two hours out of Vientiane. As we haven’t quite hit the wet season the river was very low so we only got one rapid, but that was cool. I also took a leap of faith off a 9 meter rock face into the river (that was very cool). But otherwise it was a very cruisey float down the stunning Nam Lik to the tunes of my Laos tour guide’s songs and whistles. I imagine this is how Huck Finn felt a lot of the time on his journey!\n\nPhotos:\nShooting the rapids on the Nam Lik\nHuck Finn style\nP7190737<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5kp4doo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[102.4476,18.92492]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where it began","description":"Posted by Abaker<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/Rushcutters_Picnic.jpg\"> 1 MacDonald St, Paddington, NSW, Australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rlg5wck964"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.223773,-33.881002]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237617","metadata":null,"contact_name":"abaker","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:abaker","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237617","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":41,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237617,platial:user=abaker","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":30498}
