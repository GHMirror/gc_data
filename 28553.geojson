It was a bit scary, looking for a place, \\'cause every site was booked for our wedding day - Saturday, August 27. I remember my friend Stacey taking me to this Italian restaurant when we were in high school and still skating.\n\nWe chose the Sicilian Room - it just looks cooler than the Romeo and Juliet Room. We managed to reserve it for 75 people - the banquet coordinator made an exception for us. Guests cans skip going through the restaurant - by using this separate entrance. Our package came with the cake, DJ, all-you-can-eat buffet and all-you-can-drink bar.....there\\'s something for everyone to enjoy.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bm4fx2zv70"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.92422,33.874826]}},{"properties":{"name":"Akbar","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/akbar.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 44 N Fair Oaks Ave, Pasadena, CAt\\'s part of a chain of Indian restaurants in the LA area.\n\nIn Pasadena, we had friendly and helpful service plus a side of nice chill and romantic ambience.\n\nThe chill atmosphere, the ice water and the Cab were soothing counterparts to the exploding spices of the house chutney. Granted, I\\'m a bit of a wuss when it comes to spicy foods....but Mark said he found them to be a hot as well. A second opinion always helps...\n\nFirst impressions...\n\nSome restaurant folks just take lighting for granted. Our lovely server found the candlelight on it\\'s last wick-legs....so she swapped it out for a nicer and brighter one. Typically, I have to ask - but she figure - a cute couple, such as ourselves, waltz into a place for dinner - might as well make it a cozy experience.\n\nThe mood lighting and the welcoming staff inspired me to order some wine with my meal. I almost always order the chicken tikka masala on my first visit - it\\'s like my litmus test for Indian restaurants. I asked the server what type of wine she recomended for the chicken dish. She pointed out that a red would suit the sauce. So, she gave me a choice between a Zin and a Robert Keenan Cabernet Sauvignon. I thought the Zin would be too light for me...so I went with the Cab.\n\nYum! The Robert Keenan Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa had a lovely buttery aftertaste. It satisfied my craving for something rich and hearty.\n\nBefore the entrees...\nWe split the Aloo Aam Tikka (\"Potato patties stuffed with seasoned green peas and spices, served with homemade mango chutney\")and some Papadum (\"Tandoori baked lentil wafer\").\n\nThese selections disappointed me. I didn\\'t find any green peas in the potato dish....\n\n\"They\\'re kind like Indian tater tots,\" I told Mark.\n\nAnd there was something wrong with the papadum. We both agreed the wafers were too chewy. At other Indian establishments - from DC to Paris to London - the papadum always had a nice crisp texture. When you bit into one - it flakes nicely into your both - like a chip. The ones in Pasadena tasted like they were microwaved.\n\nThe only saving grace was the chutney, served on the side. I dipped a bit of the potato dish and the papadum into the mint chutney and felt an explosion in my mouth. I went through an entire glass of water - plus a third of Mark\\'s glass.\n\nThe good stuff...\n\nThe menu calls the chicken tikka masala the \"house favorite.\" It\\'s tandoori grilled chicken swimming in a yummy tomato sauce. I love it when the sauce is creamy, rich and with a cheesy overtone. Akbar read my mind, when it came to the sauce. It took a lot of self-control to manage my rice intake with this dish....simply because it makes you want to drown the rice in the sauce.\n\n(The Lamb Vindaloo is the middle the dish and the Chicken Tikka Masala is all the way on the right.)\n\nMark had the Lamb Vindaloo, which is \"prepared in a tangy tomato based sauce with potatoes.\" Another yummy choice.\n\nIf you\\'re watching your carbs...like for the South Beach bit...you should make a choice between Naan or rice. We went with rice. I know it\\'s traditional to have the tandoori baked bread along with the rice, as your sides for Indian entrees....but you really don\\'t need it. In fact, we couldn\\'t finish our meals and now we have leftovers.\n\nOverall, I\\'m happy with Akbar - a satsifying meal and a hospitality made this dining experience one worth repeating.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bm4g577xty"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.151478,34.175963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aladdin's Cafe","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/aladdinscafe.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 1021 Massachusetts St, Lawrence, KSI had kifta kabobs at Aladdin\\'s Cafe in Lawrence. I was impressed that it did a nice pace of business on New Year\\'s Day when other spots have closed up for the holiday. It was a pleasure to dig into this ground beef delight. Mark and I brainstormed ideas on how to replicate the rice - butter, saffron, curry, something? This dish reminded me of my first taste of koufta sandwiches in Paris. Just around the corner from our flat in the 3rd arrondisment, a Lebanese food stand kept serving food past 1 AM. It was the perfect antidote to jet lag. I ended up boxing Mark\\'s dish, the kifta meal, simply because I loved the sauce - savory blend of butter-like herbs and broth.\n\nDuring my DC quarter, I always had a craving for koufta and now I think I found a new place in Kansas to cure my new craving for kifta.

I remember when I brought home some laarb salad for my dad last year. He went out and replicated the dish in his kitchen. Well, I think laarb duck is a little more difficult to reproduce.

I only had a chance to check out the wine bar - but it was still an amazing experience.\n\nAccording to the web site, the tower is kept at 55-degrees F and 70% humidity. We watched the wine angels, clad in black, hook up to harnesses. The flew-up the tower and grabbed bottles for their guests. The web site said the tower’s designer created this process based on the Mission Impossible Scene. In the first Vegas episode for Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, I watched Ted Allen moonlighting as a wine angel.\n\nThe bartender told us they mostly keep cheap red wine in the tower.

Inside Bix - it has a swanky speakeasy-vibe - 1920\\'s art decor and a live band playing loud jaz music. The food was decadent and scrumptious.\n\nWe did hor d\\'oeuvres in a tapas fashion...we tried the \"Tuna Tartare on Olive Toasts\". I love the fresh fish in San Francisco. Heaven.\n\nWe also tried: \"Kampachi Crudo with Blood Orange, Fennel, Daikon Sprouts and Fiordolio Olive Oil.\"\n\nI first heard about crudo in a Vogue article by Jeffrey Steingarten. He\\'s a brilliant gourmand and he has such an evocative writing style...I also read about this Italian-style of doing raw fish in the NY Times...I think. This SF Gate article has a great way of explaining crudo: \"...crudo is shorthand for any kind of raw fish -- chopped tartares, marinated ceviches, sliced sashimis, paper-thin carpaccios. The stumpy word itself conveys little about the silky, sensual feel of eating a raw scallop glistening with olive oil and shivering under sheer fennel slices and bits of orange...\". And in this NY Post article...a chef has another way of explaining crudo: \"Crudo is basically Italian sashimi with good ingredients. Instead of wasabi, we use garlic, and instead of ginger, we use tomato.\"\n\nNow, Susan said she had really good crudo at Incanto - possibly better than Bix...As for myself, this first taste of crudo was delightful. Again, fresh fish - slice thin and marinated lightly. It melted in my mouth and left my palate swooning. I especially liked how it finished off with the blood orange - a clean citrus tang...\n\nWe also did some sliders in a gourmet fashion - \"Mini Lamb Burgers with Spicy Red Pepper Sauce\".

My choir director adored his tasting menu at the French Laundry in Napa, a while back. Then I read about Keller’s Vegas venue, Bouchon, in Anthony Bourdain’s book, The Nasty Bits. Bourdain was humbled by Keller’s technique and envious of his fries. Since I visit Sin City often, I figured I could fit in visit to this French bistro inside the Venetian.\n\nAs a Christmas present, Mark took me on a date to Bouchon.\n\nIt was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in Vegas.\n\nOur dinner had elegant and satisfying flavors plus good, knowledgeable service. This is Mark’s sauteed gnocchi. Now, I’m used to having the potato dumplings swimming a savory sauce. Bouchon serves up the gnocchi practically naked, save the ragoût of vegetables. After this meal, we learned that gnocchi didn’t need to be drowned in sauce when it’s cooked perfectly. It had this hearty roasted flavor that’s satisfying to any palate.\n\nWe started off with fresh oysters from California and Oregon. I’m always taking advantage of fresh shellfish when I’m on the West Coast.

One of the photogs said it had a great lunch buffet. This place had a great selection of dishes. Service was a bit slow for the the small population of diners - but I think that’s because they didn’t have enough waiters working. The Spinich Paneer was quite tasty. The cheese had a nice chewy texture to sop up the greens.\n\nThen my favorite dish - Chicken Tikki Masala. It’s a great introduction entree to Indian cuisine. Not as spicy as some places…A cheesy tomatoe sauce with the marinated chicken. I loved dipping the paneer nan (cheese bread) into the sauce….and both dishes were great as microwaved leftovers.\n\nOverall - Globe Indian is a user-friendly spot - it’s a good idea for folks who haven’t tried Indian food. It has familar flavors integrated into complicated spices. If anyone wanted to go veggie in Topeka - Globe Indian has some fantastic choices for the hippie in all of us. It’s not gourmet (at least not with the dishes I’ve tried in California or London) - but it could become comfort food for me. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bm4fx9zsqs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.675521,39.045848]}},{"properties":{"name":"Granite City Food and Brewery","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/ipa.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1701 Village West Parkway, kansas city, ks.I enjoy simple flavors in beer.

But I enjoy the citrus sweetness offset by the tang from the sour lemon rinds. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bm4g6fwkpd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.172356,36.11755]}},{"properties":{"name":"Long Riders Barbeque","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/longriders.jpg\">208 E Main St, glen elder, ksVery tasty bbq!
