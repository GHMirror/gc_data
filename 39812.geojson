When ever you go skating with him, you better do a maintenance check on your board because you\\'ll be sliding down a freeway bridge, underground mall parking lot, or the damaged sidewalks of Westminster. We were skating through the back of Home Depot one day where there was this long, chest-height, flat-level handrail by the loading area. That\\'s when he decided to rail slide it without giving it a second thought. We were traveling pretty fast when he suddenly kicked up his board, grabbed it, and jump up onto the hand rail, but he didn\\'t slide far because there were no slant to the hand rail at all. This is where it got bad...his board hung up, came to a halt, and he flew off it and landed on his crotch and busted his nuts on the handrail. I mean his legs didn\\'t even touch ground and it has hard. He was home-bound and out of service for two months after that.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3is801d2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.956976,33.728721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Slammed into blackberries","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://urbanverb.com\" href=\"http://urbanverb.com\">Jake</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/1/IceAge_Kelly_Butte_Flood.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> This is way back when I used to sit down on my skateboard.
