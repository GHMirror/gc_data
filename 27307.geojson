Unlike the owners of any other restaurant we know of, we are the folks sowing turnip seeds in the morning and cooking turnip greens in the evening. We supplement our harvests with those of other local family farmers and ranchers that avoid harmful chemicals and practice sustainable agriculture. Our menu, based on seasonal shifts in the field, changes as often as the weather. Our meat comes from pasture-raised animals &amp; is hormone &amp; antibiotic free. We purchase whole animals &amp; use all the various cuts of meat throughout our menu.\n\n\"We are as committed to good community as we are to our cuisine. We have an open kitchen so that dinner is a dialogue, where the farmer-chefs and diner-neighbors can have a meaningful exchange; we offer live music every night in honor of its legacy in this town; and we designed our restaurant with an eye toward the history of the 1930’s building that houses it.

In the 60\\'s and 70\\'s, vegetarian restaurants were mostly small out-of-the way cafÃ©s. There was no high profile vegetarian restaurant in the United States. Greens changed that by raising the bar, by placing vegetarian cuisine on a level with other fine dining restaurants. We have been reviewed by food and design magazines from the time we opened. Today we are surprised if a good restaurant does NOT have vegetarian options.

In 1985 we founded Del Cabo, a project in Baja California established to assist small growers by teaching organic growing practices, management and organizational skills and connecting them to markets in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Asia.

The new restaurant takes this vision even further in its new environment, designed by Olle Lundberg, overlooking the San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe food, relaxed atmosphere, riesling-driven wine list, full bar with premium brands and fresh squeezed juices, and hard-to-find Chinese teas all speak to the restaurant\\'s originality and commitment to quality. Our to-go store called \"Out the Door\" is now open in the main hall of the Ferry Building, around the corner from the restaurant. Out the Door offers prepared dishes as well as easy-to-use cooking kits that give you the opportunity to make our dishes at home.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxa8hwfuwq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.398585,37.798891]}},{"properties":{"name":"Theo's Restaurant","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\" href=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\">Tanabutler</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3101 North Main Street, Soquel, CA, 95073Theo\\'s Restaurant 831-462-3657<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fxa8s57m6h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.954871,36.989744]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thomas Family Farm","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\" href=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\">Tanabutler</a><img src=\"http://smallfarms.typepad.com/photos/beautiful_farms/12_thomasshed.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> 1690 Pleasant Valley Road, aptos, california 95003Jerry and Jean Thomas\n831.724.4013 \n \n\nMailing Address:\n1690 Pleasant Valley Road\nAptos, CA 95003 \n\nThe Thomas Family Farm grows field flowers, garlic, seasonal vegetables, and fruit .
