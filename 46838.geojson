The development site would be from the marker I placed on the map up to Holcomb Bridge Rd. It\\'s going to be offices, condos, shopping, lakes, walking paths and European-style plazas. They are coining it a \"green urbanism\" development as the plan is to keep a significant majority of the land green-space with an easement along the river. In order to do all these wonderful things on 107-acres, however, they are planning 19 high rise buildings towering as high as 27 stories. I think it will be an attractive addition to Roswell\\'s otherwise unattractive shopping options but there\\'s a whole lot of controversy. Some people are concerned that more high rise buildings will start sprouting up, making Roswell another high rise haven instead of a residential community outside of the city. There are sewer issues already plaguing the neighboring community of Martin\\'s Landing without the additional 3000 residential homes proposed, and of course, traffic is a major concern as well. It\\'s already bad. They have mentioned that new freeway on and off ramps will be put in but I can\\'t imagine that\\'s going to be enough. They had better sell Roswell on a much better flow of traffic on and off the freeway. Just getting to the freeway in the morning can take 20 minutes and I live within a mile of the entrance ramp.\r\n\r\nThey expect the 2.1 billion dollar development plan will increase the price of Martin\\'s Landing properties that are literally across the street. I would imagine that our proximity to the redevelopment would also make our land value rise as we are a very short drive or a nice walk to the future site but if traffic gets any worse, it will be a deterrent for people looking to Roswell to escape the city life. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s a most interesting time to be living in Roswell. I\\'m happy to witness the changes and be a part of it all. Roswell may prove to be a lucrative place to live in the next few years. There will be many months of deliberations in the meantime and if approved, a couple years of development. We likely won\\'t see the impact on Roswell for several years to come.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65isvwea0sm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.32796,34.01276]}},{"properties":{"name":"Historic Roswell","description":"Posted by Emilyjanehorton<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/3/278506913108_0_ALB%5B1%5D.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/3/478506913108_0_ALB%5B1%5D.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/3/678506913108_0_ALB%5B1%5D.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/3/848506913108_0_ALB%5B1%5D.jpg\">What a charming set of shops, restaurants and old homes turned into businesses.We enjoy coming here to search through the antique stores and eat at the restaurants. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65isvqbdzlw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.36247,34.02862]}},{"properties":{"name":"J Christophers Breakfast Spot","description":"Posted by Emilyjanehorton<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/3/locations_bar.jpg\">Rob and I love coming here for a weekend breakfast.

We got a private tour of the interior of the oldest house in Roswell. Then took a walk along the property outside to see the out houses. The Smiths owned the land as far as the eye could see in the early years harvesting cotton and crops. They stayed afloat selling off parcels of land to new comers who seemed to congregate down Mimosa Blvd. There you will see several gorgeous antebellum mansions.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65isw2edznw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.35796,34.02645]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trader Joes Roswell","description":"Posted by Emilyjanehorton635 W.
