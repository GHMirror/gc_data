Walking around along Sumner St last night, around 11 or 12, listening to a podcast. I hear such a loud screaming sound that I take off my headphones and am standing directly in front of the tree pictured here. Some kind of feral brutality was going down.  One growling, snorting, snarling, deep, nightmarishly terrifying beast could be heard high up in the tree shaking around a terrified, squealing, shrieking, screaming animal for a duration of no less than 2 minutes.  Neighborhood dogs started barking at the noise, but no humans came to investigate. Then what had previously only been auditory exposure, changed. I saw the branches at the very top of this tree bend out, and the treetop began to shake violently. At first I thought the aggressor must be a raccoon, but the size of the disruption was more along the lines of what you\\'d expect from something almost human in scale. It was huge, it was wild.  \n\nThen the screaming stopped.\n\nThen I heard the monster descending very rapidly within the branches of this very tall tree, and started to consider what would happen if a bloody predator, of any size, came barging over the fence and towards me.\n\nThe dogs were still barking. I noticed there were a lot of dogs, behind a lot of tall fences.  In fact every house on the block was actively protecting itself from the threat of invasion.  Could this monster be a known phenomena? Known yet suppressed? After all, not a single person came to see what the noise was, what all the noise was about.  Had they learned their lesson the hard way? Should this beast be ignored?  Should I not have stopped? <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0hraddhnx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.644825,45.560325]}},{"properties":{"name":"Halo Thai","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>1625 Ne Alberta St, Portland, OR<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0hqvwf97s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.648374,45.559237]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hardware Store","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0hqwropc0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.661398649,45.5514621628]}},{"properties":{"name":"Junior Embassador Food Cart","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/t.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/seal.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/01/1/2129209656_639d9753af.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Ice Cream and snacks of <a href=\"http://www.mostlandia.com/index.htm\">Mostlandian</a> Origin, including chipotle strawberry, asparagus, or maple bacon<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0hqy9befd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.674798965,45.5575661961]}},{"properties":{"name":"King Elementary School","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 4906 Ne 6th Ave, Portland, OR<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0hqybz1ja"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.659303,45.558577]}},{"properties":{"name":"Post Office","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0hr9udt8b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.659204602,45.5626142002]}},{"properties":{"name":"Space Bike RV Guy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebikeFullView.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebikeRearView.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebikeFrontView.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebike1.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0hr34m8vx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.661709785,45.539293438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steakadelphia","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Philly Cheese Steaks, but tons of choices, some with Cheez-Whiz!
