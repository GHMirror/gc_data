In addition to Hungarian inhabitants, four ethnic groups have been present in the city for centuries: Croats, Germans, Roma, and Serbs. Mohacs offers various kinds of education services such as kindergartens, primary schools, basic arts education, colleges, secondary schools, and a technical institute for children from the city and its micro-region. The biggest challenge - beyond unemployment - is the lack of social mobility for local Roma who live in a segregated area in the citys eastern district. A crucial dimension of this, acknowledged and tackled by the city, is the lack of access to adequate education.","latitude":45.99593,"mayor":"Jozsef Szerko","award - color code: 1 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze":1,"title":"Strategy to Eliminate the Segregation Program in Primary Schools and Establishing a Moh?cs Area Common Education Center","country":"Hungary","sector - \ncolor code: education red, employment brown, housing blue, comprehensive purple, sustainable efforts orange, integration of roma immigrants green":"Education","population":19000,"share of roma population, %":9.0,"the mayor":"Mr. Jozsef Szeko (born 1954) is a Hungarian politician from the FIDESZ party and has been mayor of Mohacs since 1998.

A grant from the EU, aimed to change this. The plan and timing of the interventions is included in the Public Education Plan for Equal Opportunities. Mohacs has made several innovative and radical efforts to improve preschool and primary education by regrouping students in non-segregated schools, supporting this change with new pedagogical methods, training teachers in special education, cooperation with the family center and nurses, and extracurricular community activities with parents, students, and NGOs. Both the mayor and the deputy mayor have played a major role in upholding these policies. In addition, both the mayor and the deputy mayor hold roles of paramount significance in upholding these endeavours, to an extent that the impact of the program on desegregation and integration is now visible, despite initial resistance. All school children have been affected by the policy - the last four enrolment years especially."},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[18.67985,45.99593]}},{"properties":{"the municipality":null,"latitude":42.19,"mayor":"Georgi Georgiev","award -
