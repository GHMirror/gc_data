The locations of public and charter schools were derived by address-matching the table published by the New Jersey Department of Education in 2012. Private school locations have not been updated in 2012, so the old NJDOE data of 2010-2011 publication list were used this time. Most of the public schools were located in 2003 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Numerious of the locations were checked in 2007-2012 by the NJ Office of Geoographic Information Systems (OGIS), other organizations and volunteers. Closed schools are excluded from the data set. Charter schools were located in 2011 and checked in 2012 by OGIS. There were two main sources for those school records: the NJDOE table of school districts, which also lists charter schools; and a list of contact information for all charter schools including new proposed, planned to be open in 2011-2012. New public and charter schools were address-matched, located and checked against the 2007-2010 orrhophotography, by driving directions, web-site photos, or site visits. The process of locating and checking ended October 2012.The process of private schools locating and checking was ended July 31, 2010, prior to the updated information on non-public schools that was released at the end of August, 2011.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"X":{"max":650281.039179,"variance":9797280220.49034,"mean":507583.695498137,"stdev":98981.2114519232,"min":202218.139047,"median":537289.969886},"Y":{"max":894076.377096,"variance":28641236855.5929,"mean":587478.634108736,"stdev":169237.220656665,"min":38803.8524087,"median":640862.514759}},"features":[{"properties":{"ADDRESS1":"413
