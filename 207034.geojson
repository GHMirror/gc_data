Sen. Scott Dibble of Minneapolis said the DFL bill is aimed atcurtailing the idea that corporate entities have the same rights as humanbeings.The bill, SF683&lt;https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bin/bldbill.php?bill=S0683.0.html&amp;session=ls87&gt;/HF914&lt;https://www.revisor.mn.gov/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=House&amp;f=HF0914&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2011&amp;ls=87&gt;,puts forward a simple question to voters: “Shall the Minnesota Constitutionbe amended to define ‘person’ to mean natural person?”“Corporations have been allowed to funnel vast sums of money into electionswhich distorts our elections and really amounts to buying elections,” Dibbletold the Minnesota Independent. “No other entity could begin to match theamount of money that corporations are capable of spending.”And he warned that next year will have even higher levels of corporatespending than did 2010. “I think we will see that times ten in 2012,” hesaid.He pointed to Justice Paul Stevens’ dissent in the Citizens United case thatsaid allowing corporations to intervene in elections will corruptself-governance.“The Court’s opinion is… a rejection of the common sense of the Americanpeople, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from underminingself-government since the founding,” wrote Stevens, “and who have foughtagainst the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneeringsince the days of Theodore Roosevelt.”But, Dibble said, the bill isn’t only about elections. Further recognitionof corporations as persons could give them rights that conflict with actualpeople in many areas of law, he said. For example, the Supreme Court iscurrently weighing alawsuit&lt;http://www.propublica.org/blog/item/as-citizens-united-turns-1-u.s.-supreme-court-considers-corporate-personhoo&gt;filedby AT&amp;T which is asserting that corporations have a right to personalprivacy under the legal concept of corporate personhood.“Corporations are an artificial construct,” Dibble said. “They shouldn’t beable to trump actual living human beings’ rights.”The constitutional amendment being offered would hit the ballot in 2012 ifit passes the legislature (amendment bills don’t go through the governor).Dibble said he and House author Rep. Bill Hilty of Finlayson will press forcommittee hearings. Dibble expressed some skepticism that the bill wouldpass, but added that some in the Tea Party have been sharply critical of theCitizens Uniteddecision.&lt;http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/02/some_tea_partiers_are_expressing.php&gt;Hewonders whether Tea Party-backed Republicans in the legislature findcommon cause with the DFL on corporate personhood.Currently the bill is sponsored solely by DFLers.In the Senate: Dibble along with Tony Lourey of Kerrick, John Marty ofRoseville, Sandy Pappas of St. Paul and Tom Bakk of Cook.In the House: Hilty along with Carlos Mariani of St. Paul, Karen Clark ofMinneapolis, Andrew Falk of Murdock, Tim Mahoney of St. Paul, Linda Slocumof Richfield, Michael Nelson of Brooklyn Park, Alice Hausman of St. Paul,Tom Anzelc of Balsam Township, Tina Liebling of Rochester, Jean Wagenius ofMinneapolis, Lyle Koenen of Clara City, Jeff Hayden of Minneapolis, KathyBrynaert of Mankato, Phyllis Kahn of Minneapolis, Sheldon Johnson of St.Paul, Frank Hornstein of Minneapolis, Erin Murphy of St. Paul, John Persellof Bemidji, Rick Hansen of South St. Paul, and Carolyn Laine of ColumbiaHeights.","id":"46","Address":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.100891,44.954353]}},{"properties":{"name":"Minnesota Coalition of Peacemakers","description":"The Minnesota Alliance of Peacemakers passed a Resolution on August 9, \n2011, at its Delegate Council Meeting: Seeking to Abolish Corporate \nPersonhood by an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.MAP RESOLUTION: TO SEEK THE ABOLISHMENT OF CORPORATE PERSONHOODWhereas, government of, by, and for [real] people has long been a cherished American value, andWhereas, corporations are not mentioned in the U.S.\n Constitution, and The People have never granted constitutional rights \nto corporations, andWhereas, corporations have \nfor 125 years acted under the illegitimate premise of having the rights \nof “persons”, which was ruled official by the U.S. Supreme Court on \nJanuary 21, 2010 in the Citizens United decision, andWhereas, this ruling by the Supreme Court and its \nruling that “money is speech” has effectively rolled back the limits on \ncorporate spending to influence elections, candidate selection, policy \ndecisions and sway votes, andWhereas, large corporations own most of America’s \nmass media and use that media as a megaphone to express loudly their \npolitical agenda, andWhereas, tens of thousands\n of people and municipalities across the nation are joining campaigns to\n abolish corporate personhood, and guarantee democracy of, by, and for \nThe People,Therefore, be it resolved that the Minnesota \nAlliance of Peacemakers (MAP), hereby calls for Congress to forge an \namendment to the U.S. Constitution to Abolish Corporate Personhood and \nreturn our democracy, our elections, our communities back to America’s \nhuman persons and thus reclaim our sovereign right to self-governance.Be it further resolved that MAP member \norganizations call on other communities and jurisdictions to join with \nus in this action by passing similar resolutions.Be it further resolved\n that MAP member organizations take action to increase public awareness \nand discussion of the threats to our democracy posed by Corporate \nPersonhood.
