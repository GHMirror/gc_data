Serrada restructures the complex concepts of De \r\nCuerdes into an organized teaching methodology.\r\nSerrada Escrima encompasses twelve angles from which any attack can \r\nbe classified.  The countering actions to these attack angles are based on \r\nmovements that utilize the short stick(22-24 inches).  After one year of \r\nconsistent training, a student can feel confident in possessing a \r\nfoundation that will protect him/herself in most self-defense situations.\r\n\r\nFrom day one, students are drilled in following up attacks and eliminating \r\ntheir opponents offensive tools.  In a sense, there are no strict forms of \r\nSerrada, only application drills.  From Serrada\\'s basic foundation, a \r\nstudent can quickly counter and overcome a multitude of weapons, open \r\nhand attacks, as well as kicking and grappling techniques.\r\n\r\nAdditionally taught are the arts of Tae Kwon Do and Hapkido.\r\nInstruction is available in these arts for children 6 years and older.  Adult \r\ninstruction is also available.\r\n\r\nTae Kwon Do and Hapkido are Korean arts of self defense with a rich \r\nhistory.  Both of these arts can be devastating all in of themselves.  \r\nHowever, when combined they will give anyone a tremendous edge in \r\ntournament competition, or in self defense situations.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642d5xpjrc3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.648537,38.766478]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dr. C.

He developed a teaching system using concepts instead of techniques, to ensure a high level of retention among the students.\r\nTraining in the Filipino art of Escrima teaches a person to use everyday objects as a weapon or in more civil terms, “leveling the playing field”.   Escrima teaches the basic and logical concepts in using weapons (focus, speed/timing/distance, power, balance and transition),   These concepts are so logical and pure that a person can actually use them in living their everyday life.  For example, the most important concept is balance.  Balance is the foundation of Escrima as well as most tasks we perform throughout our lives.  Knowing how to obtain it, and when you get off balanced, how to get it back. Balance is a key that opens the other concepts necessary in the martial arts.  Balance is truly multi-dimensional.  Think of balance in terms of learning how to ride a bike.  There is more then just getting on, peddling and keeping the bike upright.  The bike has two wheels, and the main objective is to keep it going forward by balancing the front wheels against the stationary back wheels while moving forward.   If there is too much weight to the left or to the right, the bike will tip over.  The rider must be able to balance their focus to make sure they don’t ride into a ditch or a tree, and also looking ahead at the cars on the road, people walking, plus being aware of what is coming up from behind.  So far that seems pretty easy but now there is an issue of speed and controlling speed so that the fast approaching tree won’t be the collision point.  And what about those traffic lights?  Eventually there has to be a time to stop.  This is the braking point, which also has to be balanced.  When there is sudden braking applied to the front of the bike, there is a chance the rear of the bike could easily become the front of the bike, or even flip over.  If there is too much brake in the rear and not any pressure on the front, this may not be enough to stop.   All these tasks have to be balanced or it becomes unsafe to ride a bike for both rider and everyone else who occupies the road.   If you look closely to this objective of riding a bike, the Escrima concepts are exactly the same.  There is the balance which becomes the foundation of the system.  Speed (timing, distance) is the element of execution as to when you can hit your attacker.  Power is driven by the foundation of balance, dictated by the distance and the speed of the attack or offense movement.  Your focus is expanded to look at the person as a whole rather then just focusing on the on coming attack.  In other words if you look too much at one hand, you may never see the other hand.   Transition is the ability to use a comb, brush or keys without radically changing any physical movements you already know.   The objective is to neutralize the situation, not focus upon whether the attacker throws a right hands or a left hand, the main objective is to nullify the attacker. \r\n\r\nEscrima makes use of concepts as the main catalyst of learning and increasing the rate of information retention.  In Escrima, techniques are used as a device to practice concepts.  Techniques teach a person how to apply the concepts in a practice setting.  Concepts are applied as needed, in various circumstances and this provides more flexibility and adaptation in the execution.  This is Latosa Escrima.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642d5nro2ca"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.816008,38.528813]}},{"properties":{"name":"Light Therapy Company","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/1/kevin_smallest_2_.jpg\">1202 North West Street Wilmington, Delaware 19801-1026Purchase light therapy equipment from Dr. Kevin Keough’s company. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642d60231nt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.54952,39.748652]}},{"properties":{"name":"Marc Animal MacYoung","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/marc_macyoung_small.jpg\">200 S.

Our goal is is to assist you achieve personal safety.  The information we provide is tailored for your needs in the modern world. You will find a wide spectrum of crime prevention  information, including  home security, property protection, robbery prevention and self-defense. \r\n\r\nAn overwhelming majority of our recommendations are  non-violent and should have no negative impact on your lifestyle. While the ability to defend yourself is important, we believe that common sense preventative actions are a far more reliable way to ensure your personal safety and the safety of your family. You don\\'t have to pay money, learn a martial art, buy a gun or become paranoid in order to be safe. All you need are to know the details of the  problems  and then use a little common sense. After that, it\\'s easy. When it comes to crime and violence, the old saying \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" is not only true, but a potential life saver. The hardest part is doing your homework before you find yourself in a situation -- and that is what you are doing now. \r\n\r\nHaving said this, however, if you are currently in a dangerous, or  potentially dangerous, situation then obviously the necessary steps will require more effort on your part.  If you are in a \"hot\" situation, the required actions will be more intense; you are aren\\'t trying to prevent a problem, you already have one!\r\n\r\nIn this case, what you are going for is damage control. Making this \"mental shift\" is critical for your success. Things are not going to go back to \\'normal,\\' nor will the problem \"just go away\" as so many people hope it will -- and are at a loss when it doesn\\'t. Even in these extreme circumstances, the most effective steps to ensure your personal safety are not necessarily confrontational. They are measures to indemnify yourself, deter him, and failing that, to hinder him, give yourself early warning and call in help.\r\n\r\nThis is a large site with lots of information.
