Lamb for William Fox, who made sure his wife, decorator Eve Leo Fox, was kept at arms length.\r\n\r\nThe Fox was meant to be a part of a large office complex, which was never finished.\r\n\r\nAccording to \"Great American Movie Theaters\" by David Naylor, the Fox was similar, but more grand, in detail to two other Lamb designed theatres, the Midland in Kansas City, Missouri, and the Loew\\'s Jersey in Jersey City. The Fox was apparently copied in 1932 by S. Charles Lee for the Los Angeles Theatre. The Los Angeles looks much like the Fox, just on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nDue to the decline in people going to the movies in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Fox was demolished and replaced by a modern skyscraper. Before demolition, the interior funishings and decorations were auctioned off. The books written about the Fox demolition are now considered rare and are worth over a hundred dollars for a single copy. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInto the life of San Francisco and all California, comes the Fox Theatre, art institute of amusements, as an addition to the artistic and pleasure-loving life of this great metropolis.

Set in 18th century Vienna during the reign of the Empress Maria Theresa, the opera features a fearless baron who seeks to marry a young woman to share in her newly ennobled father\\'s riches. Meanwhile, his cousin, a princess, discovers with great poignancy that love may not survive the relentless passage of time. Probably the most popular opera of the 20th century, it combines great sentiment with colorful comedy, featuring some of the most exquisite writing for voices and orchestra and some of the most memorable waltz melodies. The opera will be sung in German while English surtitles are projected above the stage; it will be fully staged and costumed, with orchestra. Music directed by Channing Yu, stage directed by Edward Eaton, produced by Sarah Eggleston. There will be eight performances with alternating casts. The LOWELL HOUSE OPERA, in existence since 1938, is the longest continually performing opera company in New England, bringing Harvard students and Boston area professionals together to create fully staged opera performances.
