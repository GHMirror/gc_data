N, Seattle, WAthe best park i\\'ve found in seattle.  it is exceptionally beautiful there (as long as you can filter out all the runners).  especially good on really cold days or rainy days when the runners arent clogging it up.  in the summer people swim here.  a few open pipes leading into the lake itself have made me think this isnt a good idea.  you can also rent little paddle boats during the more sunny months.  you can see rabbits here (unfortunately abandoned pets), and also sometimes rats (some of them also obviously abandoned) if you look hard enough.   nice park areas all around,
