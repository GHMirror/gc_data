The rightmost (monochrome) photo on the left is circa 1900, the middle one is circa 2003 and the (color) one on the left is how it looks today. \nThe site originally held a wooden hotel, \\'The Spaulding House\\' which burned in the 1860s. It was replaced with another wooden structure, which by the 1880s had become so rundown that the owner decided to tear it down. In 1887, he chose to replace it with the brick building you see on the site today. \n\nThis site was originally developed as a hotel on the plank road leading from Detroit to Lansing. Today this building is residential apartments on the second and third floors, and commercial space (a video rental store and jewelry store) on the ground level. This redevelopment was largely due to the efforts of the Williamston Downtown Development Authority (DDA) in the 1980s.\nIn the 1970s this building had fallen into great disrepair (I\\'m being generous there ... there were holes in the roof!), and its fate polarized the community: more \\'progressive\\' groups including the local newspaper wanted to see it razed, and championed replacing it with an Esso gas station which would have allowed us to \\'get rid of that old eyesore\\' and put something \\'fresh and modern\\' in the center of town. Largely because the economics didn\\'t work, (but also because the then City Council refused to modify ordinances to allow a gas station on this site) that plan failed, and a private group attempted to renovate the structure. This group was underfunded, and failed, however, their attempts attracted the attention of the DDA and (now owner) Gil Wilkins, who leveraged state and local grants to restore and re-purpose the building.  \nI for one, am glad that the \"we need to be modern and business friendly and let the gas station happen\" camp failed to enact its vision of what Williamston should become. When you pass by, think good thoughts and pray history and tradition won\\'t pass forever, and marvel as the building presides in its THIRD CENTURY of existence at the main four corners of town with grace and a bit of grandeur. \nThey just don\\'t build them like this any more -- enjoy the peek into the past this building offers.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64n9cm1g3jj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.283324,42.689395]}},{"properties":{"name":"George Beeman House","description":"Posted by Mkvz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/beeman.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/01/1/Beeman_House.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Yes, this too is to remind me to write something -- it is a work in progress so I\\'ll post my \\'notes\\' here -- excuse the rough grammer and appearance for now!\n\n\n\n\nThis Second Empire home is the \"George Beeman House\" which was built in 1876.\n\nGeorge Beeman, originally from Steuben Co., N.Y., settled in Washtenaw County in the fall of 1836. In 1843 he moved here and purchased land in section 2, Wheatfield Township (110 acres), and subsequently 160 acres in section 1, on the opposite side of the road. The previous owner of the land in Section 1 had built a log house, which was destroyed by fire in 1846. After the destruction of his log house (and after building and renting out a shanty on the property for 2 years!) in 1848 Mr. Beeman built the frame dwelling still standing on the west side of Williamston Road for his own use. \n\nIn 1876, he erected this fine brick mansion across the street from his old house to provide a \\'more suitable\\' home for his wife and family. An 1880 book (<b>History of Ingham and Eaton Counties, Michigan</b> by Samuel W. Durant) said, with typical understatement: <i> \"Mr. Beeman\\'s buildings and improvements are equal to any in the township.\" </i>\n\nOf note concerning this building is the local legend that the Beeman House was a stop on the <b>Underground Railroad</b> during the Civil War. This myth was spread by people who apparently had \\'history impaired logic\\' as it is factually impossible. (Slavery was outlawed in the US by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, passed in December 1865. A house built in 1876 is 10 years too new to have been used to hide run-away slaves!)\n\nAs an interesting aside, the original records of Wheatfield  Township, including those from Brutus Township (from which Wheatfield was separated out in 1840), unfortunately, were destroyed by the fire mentioned above. H.C. Davis the township clerk, was occupying Mr. Beeman\\'s house, and had the records in his home when it was destroyed.\n\n\n\n\nrestoration/reclamation after rental period\n\nCurrently in private ownership. Still a working farm -- barn historic as well as house!\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64n9cvf4muw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.2819166183,42.677387508]}},{"properties":{"name":"Methodist Church","description":"Posted by Mkvz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/0/MEchurch.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/01/2/MEChurch_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/01/1/Methodist_church_3_.jpg\">Photos as it appears today, in the 1950s, and circa 1900. Note the difference in the bell tower -- see below for details on why the change.\n\n\nIn June 1871, the Episcopal Methodists purchased this land, and erected a small wooden church on it to serve their congregation. By the mid 1890s they had outgrown this facility, and the church trustees voted to construct a new, larger building on the site. In 1896, the old wooden church was sold for 20, and moved on long poles to its current location just north of the Railroad tracks on S Cedar Street (q.v.), where it was remodeled for use as a commercial building, and later as a residential structure, which is how it is still used today.\n\nDuring the year between moving the old church and dedication of the new, services were held at the local Opera House on Grand River next to the Town Hall. The new stone church was dedicated in October 1897, and cost the congregation ,252.37 plus an estimated ,000 in donated work, field stone and other materials, which was paid in full in August of 1899. The new structure had several interesting architectural features, including leaded glass windows (which are preserved and still visible today) designed by WA Rossback of the Jackson Glass Works using glass from Chicago, as well as a 500 pound bell originally purchased for the old church, but which was hung in an ornate bell tower, and extensive decorative stenciling on the walls. \nInterestingly, the field stone came from the surrounding farmland and was gathered in large part through a \\'great stone bee\\' organized by the congregation as a cost-saving measure, and embraced by the local farmers as a way to rid themselves of pesky large rocks they kept having to deal with when plowing fields. \n\nThe history of the building has not, however, been all ‘rosy’. For example, in the early 1900s, probably between 1910 and 1920, a fire charred the chancel, and in June 1919, lightening struck the steeple. During this time, leaks in the roof were frequent, and by the late 1920s the condition of the tower was questioned, however, at least one trustee disclaimed there was any need to be concerned, as “this tower will still be standing long after we are all dead and buried!” Unfortunately, by 1946 almost one quarter of the tower had to be removed as it was judged a menace to the community and was condemned. Repairs of the rotting roof timbers and the removal of the top of the tower was “a needless expense” according to the pastor in the 1940s citing 20 years of neglect when the need for repairs was first pointed out to the trustees.\n\nFortunately, this lesson was learned, and the building was maintained somewhat better in the interim. Ongoing repairs and renovations were made in the 1940s-1960s, at which time an addition for the Education building and fellowship hall were constructed. Maintenance of the building continued however, with the addition of acrylic shields to protect the original leaded glass, and re-pointing and re-roofing of the structure being accomplished in the 1970s - 1990s.\n\nSome 100 years after construction was finished, in 1998, there were extensive interior restoration, including removing layers of paint, and restoring the original stencil work on the interior of the sanctuary, as well as more mundane work such as structural renovation, and the addition of a handicap access ramp. The cost to renovate the ,250 structure was in excess of 40,000 in 1999 dollars, but the efforts were worth it from the perspective of anyone interested in the architectural integrity of the site.\n\nAnd in the Spring of 2007, as a \\'crowning touch\\' a historical marker was placed and dedicated acknowledging the place of the building and the congregation in the life of Williamston. This is the <i>last</i> marker approved for placement by a religious structure before the State of Michigan changed its rules and said \\'no more churches with historical markers\\'.\n\n\nAlthough the classic tower is gone, the remainder of the church as fared pretty well in this age of ‘tear it down and build a new one’ mentality, and as a side benefit, if you know where to look you can even still see the old wooden church too.  If you go on Sunday be sure to stop in for the services so you can admire the sanctuary -- I will wager you’ll get an invitation to coffee after the service if you don’t rush off!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64n9cmvpu1j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.2826461792,42.6878298779]}},{"properties":{"name":"National Block Hotel","description":"Posted by Mkvz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/1/2004_National_Block_sm.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/1/1887c__National_BLock_sm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> What would you think of someone who thought it would \\'improve\\' an ant to cut off part of it\\'s thorax? \nI don\\'t know of many ants that could survive such treatment, and yet people do similar things to inanimate things all the time in the name of \\'modernization\\' and \\'improvement\\'. The sad thing is that such surgery generally does not help inanimate things any more than it does animate beings. \nCase in point: The National Block Hotel shown here as it looked shortly after construction circa 1887, and as it stands today (2004). \nAs you can see, this was originally a \\'triplet\\' building made of fine brick in the high victorian style, complete with mansard roof, impressive entrances and large display windows. This building was built as a hotel and a site for the Crossman and Williams State Bank by Daniel L Crossman JB Waldo and JW Waldo (q.v.) and served that purpose for many years. Today the westernmost third is a travel agency, but the outside brick has been replaced with a more modern variety on that third, and the upper story removed. \nThe other two thirds of the building are currently vacant, and need help. \nSome perspective here may help though: If you think the way this building has been \\'remuddled\\' looks a bit sad, at least it looks better than the Lesia mansion a block south of this location, which was razed in the 1960s to make way for a \\'modern\\' bank building and parking lot.  This \\'damsel in distress\\' desperately needs some TLC, and co-incidentally enough is in the process (as of December, 2007) of being purchased by a group experienced in architectural restoration, so there may be help for her yet.

They often traveled ten miles by carriage or horseback on rutted, muddy roads to St. Patrick Church in Woodhull (present-day Shaftsburg) to worship. \n\nIn 1866 two brothers, Jerome and James Waldo (who were also instrumental in building the National Block Hotel, q.v.), entered into a contract with Detroit Bishop Peter Paul Lefevre, stipulating that they would sell a plot of land in the village of Williamston to the diocese for twenty-five cents, provided that a church worth at least one thousand dollars was built within three years. During the winter of 1868 - 69, Owen Brannan and Peter Zimmer cut and hauled timber to construct the first of three Catholic churches on this site. And in 1869 a frame church costing eleven hundred dollars was completed on this site and named Saint Mary. Saint Mary Church became a parish in 1879, upon the arrival of the first resident pastor, Father John Lovett. \n\nFrom 1889 to 1898, despite its growing membership, the parish did not have a full-time priest and it became a mission. In 1895 the original wooden church burned. A larger, brick, Neo-Gothic building was erected the same year. (see photo) Under the leadership of Father John J. Connolly, who served from 1898 to 1905, Saint Mary regained parish status. It comprised the church: a cemetery, founded in 1873: and a new rectory, erected in 1902. In the 1920s and 1930, community activist and priest, Father Francis McCormick was the pastor of this parish, and he has left a lasting impression on the community, not only for his pastoral work, but also because he organized and spearheaded the reclamation of the city dump on the riverfront adjacent to the church, and helped turn it into the park which bears his name today.\n\nIn 1948 a parish hall was built and in 1956 a convent was established for the sisters of Saint Joseph who staffed the school that opened in 1959, and continues as a K-6 school today (although the nuns are gone). \nThe present church was built, and the gorgeous Gothic church razed in 1985, however, the old bells were preserved, and remain on the site and in use today. \n\nDescendants of St. Mary\\'s founding families continue to worship here.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64n9cl33ccp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.2808437347,42.6898487439]}},{"properties":{"name":"VanBuren Ice House","description":"Posted by Mkvz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/4bc2c9363bbd4b12f79a0890a58bf70d.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/1/interior.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/1/IMG_2164.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/1/FPVB.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 200 Elevator St, Williamston MIThis building (shown in the monochrome photo circa 1910, and the color one as it stands in 2007) originally served as a \\'cold storage\\' facility for Frank P. VanBuren\\'s egg and grocery business. Mr VanBuren (yes, that photo is his portrait) bought eggs and produce from the area farmers, and sold them throughout Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Conveniently located near the railroad, and yet close to the river, this building was in an ideal location both for transport of the produce and eggs to markets, and for ease of obtaining the ice necessary to preserve them.\nIn the days before refrigeration, ice was cut from the Cedar River a few blocks north of this site, and hauled to this building where it was packed with straw. The thick (two-three feet thick!) horse-hair insulated walls and straw insulation would keep the ice well into the summer, allowing preservation of perishable goods like eggs and fresh groceries. Ice was also sold from this facility for use in the community.\nThe City of Willaimston\\'s TIFA recently purchased this building to help preserve an architecturally unique building, and intends to rehabilitate it, and begin using it for an appropriate purpose consistent with its history, and the community needs. (Discussions have run from an art exhibition area, to a multi-modal transportation center, to a folk music venue -- we\\'re still looking for ideas and nothing has been firmly decided!)\nA close look at this building reveals that the trite \\'they don\\'t build them like this anymore\\' is incorrect in this case: They <b><i>never</i></b> built them like this!

Grand River, Williamston MIWilliamston\\'s City Hall, was built in 1890 by the Village of WIlliamston and Williamstown Township as a meeting hall and polling place to comply with the then new Federal Voting Act which required secret ballots. The building was completed, and the first public meeting (A joint village/township meeting) was held on November 3, 1890.\n\n Early histories claimed it was built as a GAR Hall, but that is incorrect, although it did serve that function later. It has also served as the town fire hall, and police station at various times, and was built with both in mind, including two iron cells to hold prisoners which were only recently removed (to make room for a handicap accessible restroom). The photos show the structure as it looked circa 1918, and today (2006).\nThe structure was built by Hiram Higbee, a local builder of note in the late 1800s, and at that time, in addition to the Village and Township hall, it was designed to house the horses and fire engines used by the fire department. (The current City Manager\\'s office was the horse stable!) The building suffered as most buildings through \\'remuddling\\' in the 1960s and 1970s, however, it was sensitivily (if not perfectly) restored in the 1980s. \n It is still in use today as the City Hall, although it is \\'bursting at the seams\\' as the City has grown. \nThe \"pocket park\" out front (which was part of the original design) holds a time capsule buried in 2003 which includes items such as a commemorative dish from the community\\'s centennial in 1971, a 2003 edition of the Williamston Enterprise newspaper and the like. \nGot a question or comment?

Farmers needed a way to turn wood into lumber and grain into flour, and Williamston\\'s location on the Cedar River provided a ready source of power to make those chores less labor intensive. \n\nThe Williams brothers, James Miles, Oswald and Horace settled in the Williamston area in 1839. The next year they erected a dam across the Cedar River, and a Sawmill on the north shore to convert trees into usable lumber. in 1842, they doubled the usefulness of the dam by erecting a gristmill to grind grain into flour on the South side of the river. At the time, the next closest mill was in Dexter, near Ann Arbor. \nThis mill burned early on, and was replaced by the one shown in the photo below.
