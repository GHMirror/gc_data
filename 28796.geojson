The planning part of my move was not very strong: I had never been to Portland, I didn\\'t have a job in Portland, I had barely enough money to get there, there were concerns as to whether or not my car would make it, etc.  Anyhow, the point being that my plans were quite fragile.  Also at the time I didn\\'t have car insurance.  The fine for this is quite hefty (in excess of ,000 I believe), and they can tow your car if they really want to be mean about it.  When the cop pulled me over I thought my plans were done for, and I was pretty angry about it.  The first thing that cops usually do when they pull you over of course is, \"license/registration/proof of insurance.\"  This cop said, \"why did you run that red light?\"  me: \"i didnt.\"  her: \"yes you did.\"  me: \"no i didnt.\"  She then asked if I had been drinking, I said no.  Then she told me to be safe on the road and left.

I was driving up to Portland from Phoenix and once we hit these mountain ranges, it was unbelievably foggy.  I couldn\\'t see more than 2 to 3 feet in front of my car, if that.  All I could hear were the noises of trucks surrounding me.  I tried to follow the lines as best as I could see them in the road, but apparently I was following on the wrong side of the line.  I saw that I was about to run into a road sign, stopped, and realized that just after the road sign was a very steep drop off.  Thank god for road signs!  After a while we were able to make it back onto the road and I followed inbetween two trucks that I was able to find via sound and then via their brake lights, and they guided us down through the mountains.  It was very dark, very foggy, very scary, and I was very tired.  I would recommend not going through this mountain pass 1) during the winter 2) at night, in winter or otherwise, or 3) when you are tired.  Soon after you clear the mountains, you get around the Myrtle Beach area which is one of the most beautiful areas of Oregon in my opinion.  It is a nice consolation prize.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76eo0zu4ew5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.437134,41.446844]}},{"properties":{"name":"Audiovariancision, Atomic Cafe, circa 1997","description":"Posted by Wept<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/d81354048baf3af89d22a8d03cda6bd7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 8005 E.

The outfits he/they wore and the stage was just straight out of the 80s - it was hilarious.  This show is definitely in my top 10 list of shows.  After a while, I stopped caring that it was about 20000 degrees inside.\n\nSide note: after a very bad experience after a Skinny Puppy concert where I thought that I had permanent hearing damage, I am a real nazi about wearing earplugs at all concerts I attend.  Surprisingly the music was mixed so well and the levels were so perfect, I rarely felt I needed to wear my earplugs - except, for when the songs were over.  The crowd was so goddamn loud and insane (and the average age was around mid-30s, maybe even 40s!  I think we were some of the youngest people there.)

Prick was the opening band.  We were picking up a notoriously late girl on the way to the show.  Before the show I said to everyone, \"if she is not ready, we are leaving her ass there.\"  \"Okay.\" says everyone.  Yeah right.  She is, of course, not ready.  It takes her literally AN HOUR to become ready.  Then, we get in a goddamn accident on the freeway.  Needless to say, when we arrived Prick was finishing their last song in their set.  Then, I had to sit through Lords of Acid and Thrill Kill Kult.  This was almost completely unbareable.  Not only physically, due to it being the middle of the summer in Arizona with a place that was violating the law by not having free water available and me being too poor to have any money to buy any, but also because TKK and LOA are SO HORRIBLE.  Lords of Acid is the biggest cliche on earth - their lead singer (female of course) was simulating sex with a blow up doll on stage.  Of course, everyone was loving it (well, all the guys at least), and that\\'s why she does it.  But jesus, when did going to a music show turn into going into a strip club?  This was a really miserable experience all around.  I was so pissed off.  Thinking about it still pisses me off.

Then I remembered that Bush was coming to town for something or other, and judging by the cops on all the overpasses, I figured this was why no one was on the freeway.  I pulled off near the Gateway Transit Center to watch, as many people already were.  This Presidential motorcade was a lot longer and more incredible than the one I had previously witnessed downtown.  First, about 5 motorcycle cops cruised down the freeway way ahead of the motorcade, then probably about 7-10 normal cops, followed by about 3 suvs with guys hanging out of the back with guns, followed by 3 Presidential limousines (with two flags on either side of the front of the limousine), followed by pretty much the mirror image of what had just preceded them.

It was one of those concerts where I could look around, and everyone in the place was as happy as they could possibly be.  They played a LOT of their old material, as well.  It was truly great.  A not so great story that accompanies this concert is this one:  To get tickets, I sat outside a mall for hours, starting the night before.  There were about 5 people ahead of me.  Because it was so damn hot outside, my friends and I took turns driving around the mall in the air conditioned car so that we wouldn\\'t die.  Anyhow, around the time the doors are about to open this hick pulls up, gives this guy that\\'s been waiting in line some sum of money, and takes his place in line.  Weird, I think.  The doors finally open, we rush to the ticket counter, and this bastard isn\\'t even buying tickets to The Cure, he\\'s buying tickets for some goddamn country concert!  AND, he\\'s clearly a scalper.  He is not just buying one, he is buying like 30, and he wants to hand-pick these seats.  I was closer to murder that day than probably any moment in my entire life.  Seriously.  I was indescribably pissed off.  Each seat that he picked to his crappy ass country concert was taking the time equivalent to a full row of Cure being wasted away.  By the time I got to order my tickets, I still got floor seats, but very far in the back.  Some people I knew who were waiting at another mall to get tickets that were similarly placed in line, but did not have said ticket scalper in front of them, got 2nd or 3rd row seats.

Apparently someone wanted to build a business park here, and only got so far as to building an entrance, lining the place with some now-dead palm trees, and building some fountains (which are now dubbed \"The Metal Things\").  You can get an incredible variation of sound through these.  There is a whole lot of metal in a lot of different configurations.  The fountain is vertical so there are a lot of echoing possibilities.  You can also get inside of them and bang away.  There are metal and plastic pipes inside as well.  Be sure to bring marching sticks!  It is far enough from busy streets that no one knows what you\\'re doing, and police seem to be surprisingly tolerant of this activity (I actually had an encounter with two Phoenix police officers while drumming away on the metal things and they said it was okay).

i dont think i even knew what a riptide was exactly.) \n\nim not sure if this is how drowing in the ocean happens or not, but i went through a few phases of trying to keep afloat.  the first was essentially just kicking my feet and staying afloat like normal, just like you would in a pool.  after a while, that got extremely tiring, especially after i had just swam so much trying to get to shore.  also around this time, i started getting hit by a lot of waves which was making breathing a lot more difficult.  i embarked on a new plan: slowly letting myself drift down to the bottom of the ocean floor until i needed air, then swimming up to take a breath of air, keeping my head up as much as i could, trying to time it with wave crashing, and then slowly drifting down again - and repeat.  \n\nduring this last stage i became painfully aware that i was getting into a situation where i could easily drown.  i remember being very scared, but also feeling like there was nothing i could do about it as i was completely out of energy.  those two feelings kind of counteracted each other.    i just kept bobbing.\n\nabout the same time that i had pretty much resigned myself to the fact that i was going to die, i heard someone yelling.  \"you are caught in a riptide!  swim diagonally!  follow me!\"  a lifeguard had apparently seen me and apparently many others - although i had no idea anyone else was around..  they were mostly all on surfboards, it seemed like.  \n\ni dont remember if i told him that i could no longer swim, or if he just knew, but he threw me that little orange thing they always carry around.  i grabbed it and he started swimming for the shore.  i could not believe how this guy could swim - i was making a huge wake as i was being dragged to the shore.  \n\nwhen we arrived on shore i was about 3/4 to 1 mile away from where i originally started.  the lifeguard asked me where i was from, and told me to be safe.  i didnt know what to say - he had literally just saved my life.  i said a simple \\'thank you\\'.  it was the closest to death i think i\\'ve ever been.  i have a new respect for the \"no lifeguard on duty\" signs i used to laugh at.  i haven\\'t swam in the ocean since this incident.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76eo0qeykv2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.257595,32.703533]}},{"properties":{"name":"amazing drum beat from construction noises","description":"Posted by Wept<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/89ba7936cb02599f1c701bf16962ee66.jpg\">downtown portlandi was walking with my manager to our colocation place, and a nearby construction crew was using one of those things (i have no idea what it\\'s called) that is basically a huge pole that goes up and down via air pressure to smash things into the ground, or to level ground.\n\nsince it was pneumatic, it made an very loud SSHHHHHHHH sound every time the thing went up, and of course made a rather incredible sound when it hit whatever metal it was driving into the ground.  this is a somewhat common sound downtown.   however while we were walking, we came across this specific area where the timing of the construction noises and the echoes off of the buildings came together in perfect unison to create one of the most amazing drum beats ive ever heard.  my manager at the time was talking to me about something or other and i just told him to stop talking and i stopped there and enjoyed it for the few brief moments that it lasted.  it was incredible -
