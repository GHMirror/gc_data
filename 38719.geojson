While they were away a car collided with a mail truck and then ran into the fire hydrant on the corner. Water shot into the air and then ran down the street, beckoning the neighborhood children to the scene. I watched as a portion of Walley\\'s front yard fell into a swirling whirlpool and wondered if he was having a good time in Bermuda. The second accident occured one day as my friend Jim drove his freshly painted Renault around the corner. The car slid across the gravel-covered asphalt and into the soft dirt on the side, which abrubtly stopped the car\\'s momentum causing it to roll over on it\\'s side in the middle of the street.
