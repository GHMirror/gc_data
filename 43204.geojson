Vivian, who is hesitant to compliment anything said last night, \"I think their pasta is the best I\\'ve ever had.\"\n\nAlmost every time we go, the restaurant is nearly full.  Last night it was overflowing with two large parties.  We sat at the bar.  \n\nWhen we left the office last night I said, \"I need Stracciatella\".  It was all I wanted but the special breaded steak, I could not say no too.\n\nVivian had the Spaghetti Alle Vonogle, which is on a very generous portion of clams cooked with a butter and herb sauce.

We arrived at 5:15. By 6 the joint was packed. It is small, shared tables and a cozy feeling. The slate front of the metal woodfired oven is an impressive shot as you come in the door and the restaurant backs on to the Dahlia Bakery\\'s bakery with glass windows. It was too late in the day for watching, but I\\'ll come back for lunch to watch the bakers ate work. \n\nThe pie? Sublime. Thin but sturdy crust, a little less chewy than my favorite point, but great flavor. We split a roasted beet salad and a caramelized onion, gorgonzola and rabe pizza - olive oil, no red sauce. It was rich, I could taste each ingredient. Our very nice waiter said \"I you are hungry you should each get a pie.\" With salad, we were very happy with one (except for coveting our neigbors\\' pies. I wanted just a bite to try the other pies!)\n\nThe salad was yummy but could have used a bit more salt and pepper. The red beets were the best. The almost white beets had a great texture, but much less flavor. So I\\'d go with the flavor over the visual appeal of the two colors of beets. It was lightly dressed in olive oil, a winey vinegar (not enough for my taste - I like the bite) and chopped mint. \n\nWe were both pretty tired so we split a glass of wine - a nice pino grigio whose name I forget. I know, two middle aged women SPLITTING a glass of wine? Well, if we had both gotten one, we would have both finished our glasses and never made it through the flower show. \n\nHere\\'s the kicker. Our waiter poured our wine into two half glasses. That was the capper to a very nice evening meal.

I was a fan and supporter of his band, Rumors of the Big Wave and was sad when the band split up. His voice has mellowed and taken on a new resonance and maturity that suited the songs he sang. And the drummer with his amazing drum/stool/thingie - oh, I want to play with one of those!\n\nThe Doganauts (did I spell that right?) had some great musicians in the mix. I didn\\'t dig all the songs, but the labor-of-love essense trumped that. Again, the musicianship in Rouge was top notch, while I was less engaged with the lead singer\\'s presentation. It could be I was just getting tired as it was a long day. \n\nOn the food side, the Triple Door serves from the Wild Ginger kitchen - at least that is my understanding. I loved our entrees. The lamb chops were nummy. The fragrant beef is one of my Wild Ginger favorites. But like upstairs at WG, the quality is really variable. (WG used to be a favorite restaurant to go to and to recommend to out of towners, but I don\\'t any more. The service in the restaurant has always been terrific. I wish the same could be said for downstairs at the Triple Door.) \n\nPrimarily, the appetizers were bland. We had a vegetarian Budda roll while we were waiting for the gang to show up. The dipping sauce was almost tasteless. They used to have a spicier sauce and a peanut sauce option. The squid was barely lukewarm and visually a mess on the plate. The roti was barely warm. \n\nService was variable. At first our guy was attentive and helpful. Then it seemed like a major effort to get his attention. At the end of the evening, we had to flag a busser in the dark to get our bill. Oh, and the heartbreak, I was all set to have the dessert souffle of the night, mango coconut. But they only had five and they were sold out. \n\nOnly had five? Gimmme a break. Dont\\' tease me then send me home empty! Oi!\n\nAs the designated driver in our family, I can\\'t testify to the drinks, but my husband seemed to be enjoying the beers he tried!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640xek2myxb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.337872,47.608529]}},{"properties":{"name":"Update on Theo Chocolates","description":"Posted by Choconancy3400 Phinney Ave. N.
