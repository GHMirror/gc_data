It would also become known for construction faults which led to a partial collapse, as well as for a fire during which a wooden outbuilding burnt down in 1942, killing 39 people (41 according to some sources). The victims were trapped in a locked ward.\n\nThe asylum was less than 20 miles north of Dunedin and close to the county centre of Palmerston, in an isolated coastal spot, within a forested reserve. The site is now divided between the Truby King Recreation Reserve, where all historical buildings have been demolished and most of the area still remains dense woodland,[3] and The Asylum backpacker hostel, which uses some remaining hospital buildings.\n\n(From Wikipedia)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzdtj8el"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[170.622242,-45.67741]}},{"properties":{"name":"The old 24 Hour Church of Elvis","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/120159310_49eccc7cc0.jpg?v=0\">SW ankeny &amp; 8th ave, Portland, ORThe classic wedding spot, late night escapades, surrounded by drunk freeloaders, chillin with the live elvis.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzoy9ht3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.678243,45.522526]}},{"properties":{"name":"UFO Museum","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\" href=\"http://www.witchdoctorcomic.com\">Dj10ninjas</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> W corner of NW 21st and Hoyt<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzkybyek"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.69465,45.52642]}},{"properties":{"name":"Urban Hike","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.39forks.com\" href=\"www.39forks.com\">Symplvision</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/3d68dc7bb3306f8533a790da6fb65423.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Go to this place and try a 10 mile urban hike.

Due to road construction, Mill Ends Park (24 inches across and located at the intersection of downtown Portland\\'s Southwest Taylor Street and Naito Parkway) will be moved 80 feet from its current location. The park will reside in the plaza area of Portland\\'s World Trade Center complex for approximately six months.\n\nAccording to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation officials, a move was necessary to protect the tiny green space from the threat posed by the much larger construction equipment. (What Portlanders won\\'t do to protect the environment.)\n\nWhen the Naito Parkway roadway improvements are completed in six or seven months, the park will be moved back to a new location on Naito Parkway, 7.5 feet east of its current home. The big - or little - move takes place on Tuesday, Feb. 7. Some sort of \"mobile platform,\" perhaps an all-terrain vehicle, will be used to move the park in its entirety. Mill Ends Park, which was dedicated as an official city park in 1976, is one of 200 parks managed by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Note: At this time, the city has no plans to move Portland\\'s 5,000-acre Forest Park. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzrbcgru"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673286,45.516136]}},{"properties":{"name":"clothing optional beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzoajqae"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.793999,45.834099]}},{"properties":{"name":"padlocked shed with busted out windows","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/120159194_ed154b6968.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> NW 12th &amp; Flanders, Portland, ORthe padlock really isn\\'t doing much good.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzcn7eka"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.683012,45.52572]}},{"properties":{"name":"sidewalk fossils of fallen leaves","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/19/111570950_e7cb3f3a49.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/55/111570874_0c3f605f55.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/52/111571002_44d66708a4.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> nw 23rd near marshall st, portland, orapparently laid in the autumn, this sidewalk patch is decorated with an amazing plethora of nearly pristine oak and maple leaf fossils.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzk7je6y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698478,45.530177]}},{"properties":{"name":"urban iditarod","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/urbaniditarod/images/abw.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> SE water &amp; madison, under the hawthorne bridge, portland, orThe 5th Annual Portland Urban Iditarod will be run Saturday, March 4th, 2006. Show up at 11am. We mush at 11:30am sharp. You can pre-register by sending e-mail. The event is held on the same date the \"real\" race each year - the first Saturday of March.\n\nIn the Alaskan Iditarod, more than sixty dog sled teams race across the frozen tundra from Anchorage to Nome. In our urban version, teams of \"dogs\" lead by a musher will pull their sleds (shopping carts) through some of Portland\\'s most scenic areas. These teams of barking humans must negotiate through the unrelenting and unforgiving dangers of Portland\\'s urban frontier. As an incentive to run, dogs and mushers alike will have several \"rest stops\" to replenish lost fluids and discuss tales of mayhem. The course is over four miles, so dogs and mushers alike need to be ready and able to run their tails off.\n\nThe 5th annual Urban Iditarod will start at the Fire Station on S.E. Madison right next to the Willamette River and follow the same basic course as the 2005 event. The course map will be posted on the website as well as passed out at the race start once the \"rest stops\" are confirmed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nzjx9rc9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.665889,45.513001]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/12830","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dj10ninjas","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dj10ninjas","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/12830","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=12830,platial:user=dj10ninjas","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":40295}
