The public database consists of four tables. One of the tables is a spatial table: INTERMODAL_FACILITY. The three other tables consist of attribute data for the database: INTERMODAL_CARGO, INTERMODAL_COMMODITY and INTERMODAL_DIRECTIONALITY. This database was based on the requirements from the Commodity Flow Survey and with the different modes of DOT, supervised by RITA/BTS. The database will extend its design to support all of the modes within the DOT and in reference to modes involved with Intermodal transfer.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":null,"metadata":null,"contact_name":"Office of Geospatial Information Systems","contact_address":"1200 New Jersey Ave. S.E., Washington, DC, 20590","source":"Research and Innovative Technology Administration's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (RITA/BTS)","contact_phone":"202-366-DATA"},"source":null,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":null,"limit":1000000},"state":"errored","tags":"","published":"2003-01-01T17:00:00Z","id":309749}
