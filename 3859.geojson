The days covered are from 5th of August to 9th August, 2008. The air quality monitors measure levels of Nitrous Oxide, Sulphur DiOxide and Particulate Matter that is 10 micron or less in size. Much of the haze in Beijing is attributed to the high levles of particulate matter also referred to as PM10. Much of the airborne particulate matter is due to construction and landfill dust, vehicle exhaust, fires etc. Level of 50 or more microns per cubic meter is considered as harmful. \nBetween 5th and 10th August, 2008, all stations have registered levels higher than 50 microns/cubic meter of air, the so called WHO standard for air quality.
