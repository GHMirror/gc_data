It is smaller than small, wedged perpendicular to 14th Avenue among the shops of Dinkytown, near the University of Minnesota. Customers waiting for one of the fourteen stools at the counter stand hovering just above and behind those who are seated and eating. In the narrow space between the counter and the back bar, where Al’s hash slingers race to and fro with seasoned aplomb, decor consists of pictures of Elvis and Wayne Newton, foreign currency, and a sign that advises, \"TIPPING IS NOT A CITY IN CHINA.\" Also behind the counter is a pile of meal ticket books, each inscribed with someone\\'s name. Many of Al\\'s customers buy these books and keep them here, so they know they can come eat, using coupons instead of dollars, even when their wallet is empty.\n\nThe specialty of the house is blueberry pancakes, which are made with either a whole wheat or buttermilk batter, and are also available studded with walnuts or corn kernels. We chose blueberries and buttermilk -- an enchanting balance of sweet fruit poised in their faintly sour medium, infused with butter. They were just barely sticky, delicate-textured, and profoundly satisfying, especially when lightly drizzled with maple syrup. Al\\'s flapjacks are sold as a short stack (2), regular (3), or long (4); and you can also have your waitress garnish them with sour cream and/or strawberries.\n\nThe short-order chef up front spends his time poaching eggs, constructing omelettes, and griddle-cooking corned beef hash and crisp hash browns. It is an old-fashioned pleasure to watch this guy work, handling about a dozen orders at a time, always snatching whatever he is frying, poaching, or grilling away from the heat at the peak of its perfection.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62fe7qi6ko4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.23557,44.981025]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aunt Else Aebleskivers","description":"Posted by Golfinginthesun<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/08/0/aebelskiver_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 702 2nd Street South, Minneapolis, MN8:00 AM - 1:00 PM  \nEvent: Mill City Farmer\\'s Market  \nLocation: 2nd Street &amp; Chicago Avenue - Downtown Minneapolis  \nComments: Celebrate local food at the Mill City Farmer\\'s Market!

They know not of what they speak. The real butter burger, the king butter burger, the only butter burger worth eating is the stupendous little slider at Bar Lurcat. To make this adorable little critter, chef Adam King sweats lots of onions in butter with loads of fresh thyme, then combines those onions with a specially ground meat, and forms them into wee little patties which are grilled till they crisp. These patties are then tucked into well-griddled potato rolls graced with a swipe of red-wine-shallot butter. The result is the best techniques of French cooking combined with the best ideas of American fast food. Order two sliders, pair them with some of the state’s best French fries—gold beauties so crisp outside and so tender inside that it’s almost like they’re candy-coated—and know it doesn’t get any better than this. Unless you add fresh, hot doughnut holes. How could a restaurant so French-sounding have achieved this trifecta of American road-food perfection?

When it comes to burgers, the answer is a resounding yes!  Opened only since last year, Buster’s is a great, already-classic burger joint by and for the microbrew generation. Slip into a dark, cozy wooden booth and order one of the 100 or so microbrews—or one of the more than two dozen tap-beer offerings (including all of the local Surly beers)—and prepare to be dazzled. The burgers here have a deep, well-charred, truly steak flavor, and are complemented by fresh, substantial buns from the notable A Baker’s Wife’s Pastry Shop, which happens to be around the corner. Bite into a Buster’s burger and you find the implicit promise of so many burgers made real: It’s a steak—for cheap (if you call  for a half-pound burger cheap, which I do in this case because the gorgeous burger comes with a robust pile of truly gorgeous French fries). Nice work, Buster’s. The hipsters are doing it for themselves.

We had just judged the small town’s pie-baking contest, and after sampling eighteen of the finest apple, rhubarb, and berry pies imaginable, all we could imagine for supper was a green salad!\n\nCafé Latte filled the bill perfectly. It is a breezy cafeteria that offers all sorts of fresh, healthy salads to order, i.e. Indonesian rice salad, grilled chicken Caesar salad, asparagus-lemon salad. It is entirely possible to eat a meal of which any nutrition warden would approve. There are lovely sandwiches available, different interesting soups every day, and small-size pizzas ranging from au gratin roasted vegetable to a “Mediterranean” with olives, cheeses, artichokes, and basil-flavored sauce.\n\nWhat we forgot when we headed for Café Latte to find relief from our pie-eating pig-out was that this place also happens to make the best cakes on earth: chocolate banana, German chocolate, orange chocolate-chunk cheesecake, chocolate kahlua torte, English pecan triple sec fudge, and the king of all pastries, turtle cake. Inspired by the candy of the same name, turtle cake is three chocolate layers gobbed with an obscene amount of caramel frosting and loaded with walnuts. It is a dessert no sweet tooth can refuse, even after eating eighteen pies.\n\nAs the restaurant’s name suggests, all sorts of espresso-based drinks are available (as are wine by the glass and afternoon tea, the latter served with scones, cookies and little sandwiches). The fancy coffee beverage of our choice is a Mandarin cocoa latte with candied orange slivers and chocolate sprinkles.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62fe7pne5tn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.135762,44.939963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Capitol Grill","description":"Posted by Golfinginthesun<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 801 Hennepin Ave., Minneapolis, mn7 - Capitol Grille - Minnesota - Monthly\n\nInherent Awesomeness: 34\nI tried every single big steak-house burger for this roundup, and the Capital Grille was the absolute shocker: It’s stupendous. The meat was rich, thunderously beefy, and sweet; the brioche bun was the ideal complement, while the savory French fries, graced with truffle-oil and gran padano cheese, were exceptional. Each bite of the burger was more astonishing than the last. It was as good as great carpaccio, as good as great steak tartare: lush as a berry, profound as an exceptional Barolo. Could it seriously be this good? Yes. As I tried burger after burger for this story, the Capital Grill’s only grew in stature: It really was richer, livelier, and sweeter (not in terms of sugar but in terms of an irresistible wealth of flavor). As chef Jeff Ansorge explained, it also may be the purest gourmet locovore burger in town. The grass-fed beef is from Thousand Hills Cattle Company in southern Minnesota, ground-up with a certain amount of bacon from Fischer Farms in Waseca. The meat is mixed with Walla Walla or Vidalia onions, grilled, and served on a housemade brioche bun. “I tried to do a little more—localize it, and highlight every piece of it,” Ansorge told me. Mission accomplished.

Not the biggest or the best-dressed, not-stuffed with foie gras like the 00 oddities made by show-off chefs, not so lean it\\'s dry nor so greasy it is unctuous, this is a thick, bun-sized patty sizzled to crusty perfection on an extremely well-oiled grill. It oozes juice and radiates beefy savor, and is especially good topped with a mantle of melted cheese and/or California style (with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise). Other available toppings include bacon and mushrooms; or you can have a Plaza Burger, which comes with sour cream, chives, and chopped onions and is sandwiched in a dark bun, which the menu boasts is just like the one \"featured in the Plaza Bar of Madison, Wisconsin.\"\r\n\r\nFor burgers alone, we\\'ll happily make the pilgrimage to this 1934-vintage diner in Edina; but we can guarantee our California cheeseburgers will be accompanied by French fries. Beautiful fries: cooked until honeytone brown, each serving a mix of cream-centered, full-size sticks and darkened crunchy little twigs and burnt ends of delicious potato debris from when the spuds are hand-cut in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nOn the side you want a malt. Huge and so thick that they must be spooned from their silver beaker because pouring is impossible, Convention Grill malts are available in a rainbow of flavors: chocolate, wild blueberry, butterscotch, strawberry, coffee, banana, vanilla, caramel, honey, hot fudge, butterfinger, mint, and Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup. For fifty cents extra, you can have fresh banana added. The only problem with ordering a malt is that it makes it less likely you will have the stamina to have a hot fudge sundae for dessert. That was our problem when we visited, but we couldn\\'t help ogling the sundaes at the next table. They come in the typical broad tulip glass with plenty of fudge underneath the ice cream and a mountain of whipped cream on top; and on the side is a good-size cup of extra hot fudge to pour on as you eat your way through.\r\n\r\nAll this excellent Roadfood is dished out by a staff of white-uniformed waitresses who are utterly efficient and, in our experience, omnipresent. It was Lynne Rossetto Kasper, host of \"The Splendid Table,\" who said we needed to go here; and while Lynne is best known as an expert on Italian food, this suggestion alone earns her an exalted chair in the Burger Lovers\\' Hall of Fame. \r\n\r\n5 - Convention Grill &amp; Fountain - Minnesota Monthly\r\n\r\nInherent Awesomeness: 38\r\nCynics call nostalgia the longing for a time that never was. The neat trick of the Convention Grill is that it makes you nostalgic for an American past of wonderful diners serving perfect fries, malts, burgers, and Happy Days cuisine—and then it actually delivers them as good, if not better, than they were in their heyday. The Convention Grill burger is hand-pattied, never-frozen, and boasts a glorious, flat-grill-given char; the deeply golden, hand-cut fries are super fresh and wholesome; and the Kemp’s ice-cream shakes and malts couldn’t be any thicker or more perfectly encapsulate what’s great about Midwestern living.

Jack Riebel is one of those chefs who every chef in town knows and respects, but he doesn’t get a lot of public recognition. He ran the lunch at the dearly departed Goodfellow’s for 10 years, and while there, he created a burger to honor his fellow chefs: The Cobb Salad burger. He would take the trim from various high-end cuts—strip loins, rib eyes, and such—blend those with chuck, and cook it. Then he would top the burger with Goodfellow’s famous pico de gallo tomato relish, a special guacamole created by one of his Latino line cooks, and an onion relish that he credits to Isaac Becker, who is now chef and co-owner at 112 Eatery. He added smoked bacon, hard-cooked egg, and—because it’s a burger—some buttermilk battered onion rings. It became the off-the-menu sensation that every chef in town was clamoring for. “When Tim McKee [of La Belle Vie] was opening Solera, he’d call ahead: ‘I’m bringing in eight cooks, we need eight Cobb burgers. Can you do that?’” Riebel told me. McKee made Riebel promise that if he ever opened his own place he’d put the Cobb burger on the menu. Since Riebel took over the kitchen at the Dakota three years ago, his Cobb burger has been on the menu. It’s magnificent: A sturdy, beefy, gorgeously charred patty is rested on a slab of grilled Pugliese bread and surrounded by everything mentioned above, as well as a chiffonade of thinly cut Bibb lettuce leaves. All the various relishes and toppings come together to make every bite lively, fresh, and vibrant, but they never obscure the basic campfire meatiness of the burger at the core. The Dakota serves a mean basket of fries, too. If you want to know how five-star chefs make burgers for other five-star chefs, look no further.

And that’s why, for almost 50 years, city folk have made the Hi Hat a destination stop on the way to cabins Up North. “Consistency is the key here,” explains owner (and son of Gordy) Dan Lundquist. “People say, ‘I want a cheeseburger,’ and it better taste the way it did last fall.

The potatoes are available as a dish unto themselves, and they are less like the Swiss spuds that are their namesake than they are glorified hash browns, the shreds of potato mixed with bacon, sweet onions, chives, and scallions and grilled in sweet cream butter. A few other breakfast specialties: lemon ricotta hotcakes, extra-spicy maple-glazed bison sausage, and a quarter-pound caramel pecan roll featuring extra-crunchy pieces of nut and a refined glaze that is a sweet tooth\\'s dream.\n\nProbably the most unusual and perhaps the most delicious dish on the breakfast menu is Mahnomin Porridge, a recipe that the promethean Mr. Omer came up with from reading accounts of native Cree Indian meals that featured wild rice.

Maybe it’s the well-worn plywood booths. Or the church-basement chairs. Or the pull-tabs. No matter. Order a burger and you’ll see why the parking lot here is always full. The fried onions on the Sewanee burger are soft as butter, the bun is big and bready and makes you feel like you’re eating a whole platter’s worth of meat. The burger itself is gorgeously charred, but tender as tears. The fries aren’t much to speak of, but if you’re taking Highway 52 anywhere, the House of Coates will forever fix in your mind that the middle of nowhere can be somewhere worthwhile.

It\\'s time to make that phone call and find out what you\\'re bringing for Thanksgiving. According to in-house City Pages research, eight out of ten of you are bringing dessert. If this describes you, please know that it is your lucky year. A few years ago you had to place your pie order weeks in advance, but now you have all the way until the Monday before Thanksgiving to make up your mind.\n\nAs I see it, you have two pie options. On the traditional, homemade, rustic, and artisanal front there is Turtle Bread, about which I have written so many raves that I am kind of at a loss to speak of the place anymore, but let\\'s just say that if you could hear the American landscape of apples, pumpkins, and raspberries as a symphony conducted by sweet, organic butter using a baton of the Midwest\\'s best ground grains, that symphony would sound as dazzling as the pastry cases at Turtle Bread look. Okay? And they\\'re taking pie orders through the 23rd of November.\n\nOptions, for those of you new to their magnificence, include a gorgeously heavy pumpkin pie; their classic apple pie; a puckery raspberry; silky, weighty, crunchy pecan; overstuffed blueberry; cherry; and, new this year, a pumpkin cheesecake. Pies cost 8.99, not including an additional .50 refundable deposit for the pie tin. Remember, you can also reserve Turtle\\'s award-winning, marvelous breads. The Turtle Bread Company, 4762 Chicago Ave. S., Minneapolis, 612.823.7333; 3421 West 44th St., Minneapolis, 612.924.6013; or downtown in the Minneapolis skyways, at One Financial Plaza, 612.455.2552.\n\nIf you\\'re less interested in artisanal America, but more interested in European pastry nirvana, Patrick\\'s Bakery is taking orders for desserts until Monday the 22nd. Options include a traditional pumpkin pie, which will not be ordered by anyone reading this column because--get this: There is now also a special Patrick\\'s pumpkin pie, in which the bakers place six--count \\'em, six--chocolate-covered, gold-foil-gilded chocolate mousse pyramids on top of the pie. Did you hear me? I said gold-foil-gilded pyramids of chocolate mousse! If this doesn\\'t make your damn cousin stop yammering about how much better life is on the East Coast, nothing will. Unless it\\'s the cranberry meringue or strawberry rhubarb meringue pies, in which that devastatingly buttery crust is topped with a layer of vanilla flan, which is then layered with either cranberries or the strawberry-rhubarb combo, after which the whole thing is topped with that airy, buoyant, photo-perfect meringue. Prices for Patrick\\'s pies run from 9.95 to 3.95; they also have lovely rolls and excellent whole quiches. Patrick\\'s French Bakery; 2928 66th St. W., Richfield; 612.861.7570.\n\nBut what if you don\\'t want fancy highfalutin pies, but want the old-fashioned, real Minnesota pies like your grandma used to make? In that case, make your way east of the river to Jerabek\\'s, where they make the pies that live deep in your subconscious--the French silks, banana creams, lemon meringues, and even that old-fashioned classic sour cream raisin. Now, you might not know about sour cream raisin, and if not, please know that once upon a time in the winter heartland there were no refrigerators, no fresh raspberries, no fancy French chefs, and no gold foil on nothing. What there was was a lot of fresh dairy and a precious few sweet things, like raisins. Hence the sour cream raisin pie. This is my call for the pie most likely to bring a tear to Great Grandma Lena\\'s eye, and if you ever want her to knit you an afghan, you better special-order one of these.\n\nIf you have a Southern grandma, consider charming her with Jerabek\\'s update of the classic shoofly pie--they call theirs the shoo-bee, and it\\'s made with espresso, molasses, and brown sugar. There isn\\'t space to list them here, but please know that Jerabek\\'s seems to have about as many pie recipes as an afghan has knots. Your other options include basic pumpkin, scads of different apple pies (not limited to apple-maple-cream, apple-pear-cranberry, and caramel apple), lemon meringue, key lime, cream (including banana, coconut, and chocolate), rhubarb (including strawberry rhubarb and new blueberry rhubarb), cherry, blueberry, triple-berry (raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry), and more, more, more! Even mincemeat, which, if you don\\'t know, used to contain some meat, back in the Middle Ages and all, but nowadays tends to be just another old-fashioned, meatless, American classic fruit pie--but with extra, extra nuts. Jerabek\\'s mincemeat filling includes walnuts, apples, raisins, and a hint of orange peel.\n\nCan\\'t make up your mind? You\\'ve got until 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday the 23rd to decide. And even if you totally blow it, rest assured that the good folks at Jerabek\\'s plan to have a bunch of pies on hand for those of you who read this whole article and still never manage to place an order. Oh, and Jerabek\\'s also has old-fashioned pricing; pies tend to cost between .99 and 1.99. Jerabek\\'s New Bohemian Coffee House &amp; Bakery; 63 W.

Seriously all-American. Located across the highway from the Miesville Mudhens stadium, King’s is as American as baseball, if not more so. Picture an original turn-of-the-century carriage stop unrecognizably updated with a knotty-pine-paneled bar surmounted with an odd, roof-shingled overhang, a hodgepodge of contemporary beer signs, and mirrors resplendent with scenes of pheasant–hunting. Guys in construction vests split pitchers of beer, bartenders insist one television stays tuned to the Rachael Ray Show to make sure the church ladies at the big table stay comfortable, and a roll of paper towels sits on every table. Those paper towels are necessary, at least if you want to dig into any of King’s 37 burgers, the best of which are the most elaborate. The awesome Triple Play, for example, is topped with bacon, Cheddar, Swiss and pepper-jack cheese, green olives, and sour cream—yeah, there are four separate kinds of dairy on that burger. Take a gander at all the dark blue Harvestore silos that mark the location of prosperous dairy farms nearby and you’ll get the connection. This is a dairy burger in dairy country. How does it taste? Perfect. The thin burger patty has a slight, yet important gloss of char to it, though it’s still tender as anything. The bun is buttery and well-grilled. And the whole thing comes together in a way that’s so cute, lovable, and devourable that the burger may as well stand up and tap dance across the table. Sure, the fries are forgettable, but even the plain old hamburger is scrumptious, and if you want to know what the sweet, sweet taste of America is, look no further. Build your visit around a Mudhens game, and you’ll see why those 135 residents of Miesville are some of the luckiest people on earth.

(If you’re an out-of-towner, the Jucy Lucy—purposefully misspelled—is made by crimping two beef patties around a filling of cheese and cooking it all until the cheese becomes like molten lava. This tastes loads better than it sounds.) Sure, the thought did cross my mind: What if Matt’s was off its game? What if they didn’t make the cut? There was no need to worry—it would have been like going to Paris and finding the Eiffel Tower missing. This place is as critical to the heart of south Minneapolis as Lake Nokomis. A recent visit found Matt’s in all its glory: The guys at the bar were a mix of the old and cowboy-hatted, the young and dreadlocked, and the middle-aged and computer-bag toting. They were all eating Jucy Lucys and half-orders of thin, pale fries. There was even a recent Chicago transplant at the bar: “All the burgers downtown are 0,” he said. “I have a problem with that. My employees told me, ‘Go to Matt’s.’ I’ve been here three times in five days. You put crack in these things or what?” Spoken like a true out-of-towner. Crack? Please. Matt’s Jucy Lucys are bigger than crack. It’s all about the grill. For about 15 minutes, Matt’s Jucy Lucy sits up on the hot, ancient, always-in-service grill and sizzles, sizzles, sizzles until it gets crisp and well-charred on the outside. That makes all the difference. Matt’s has been making these well-charred, unspeakably delicious Jucy Lucys, the best in the state—the best, no doubt, in the world—since, legend has it, 1954.

Settle in at the copper-topped bar and contemplate the majesty of the dining room—the rows and rows of glittering, glamorous bottles that back the bar.

Roadfood is, after all, served in little roadside diners, or small homey places in the middle of town, known to all of the locals, and a few lucky outsiders. Roadfood is served at the truck stop just outside of town, the one that many of the locals drive out to get to. Road food is also the stuff served at the souvenir stand, or the gas station with the museum, rock garden, or reptile garden. Roadfood is cheap, fast, good, and real. Roadfood is an adventure and a delight. Though Murray’s is hardly what you would call a truck stop, and is not what most people would call cheap, it certainly qualifies in the other respects. I have noticed reviews of two other fine steak houses at which I have eaten, the Million Dollar in Jackson, and the Big Texan in (where else) Texas. Murray’s is the equal of either of these places. \n\nFor five years we have been coveting a meal at Murray’s; finally, we got one. It was everything we had hoped it would be. It seems that every year, when we come for the State Fair, a trip to Murray’s finds it either full, or closed. Bad timing on our part is to blame, a consequence of always coming during a holiday weekend, but this year was different.\n\nMurray’s is a classic steak house, a traditional full service restaurant. As soon as the hostess escorts you past the full service bar and into the subdued lighting of the curtained, mirrored, and crowded dining room, you know you are in a place where they do things the right way. After being conditioned to standing in line for plastic assembly line food, served by sales clerks, for most people a place like Murray’s is a revelation. This is why people go out to eat. You don’t come here to fill your face, and sate your appetite, though one of Murray’s steaks will certainly accomplish this; you come here to dine.\n\nA full service restaurant goes beyond a well-appointed dining room, linen tablecloths, and good food. It comes from the efforts of a competent and professional staff. We sat very near the kitchen but heard no clatter of pans, shouts, or other distracting kitchen noises. The busboys did not crash, bang or throw dirty dishes onto the trays, though they did manage to keep our water glasses full, and get our plates as soon as they were emptied. The servers did not drop trays, forget items, spill, or bump into things as they walked (at least not that I could see). Everyone was friendly, polite, and accommodating. The dining room itself, though busy and full of activity, held no sign of the chaos that seems a natural part of so many modern restaurants. These people know what they are doing.\n\nMurray’s does not have a dress code, much to our relief, though I noticed most of the other diners, were quite well attired. We went in jeans and polo shirts. Though the place is not fancy in the pretentious manner of many gourmet or haute cuisine places, it is certainly upscale. Neither elaborately fancy, nor quite what I would call casual, the word that springs to mind is proper. This is where grownups go to eat when they get tired of fast food, indifferent service, and chain restaurants that strive to be average.\n\nOur waiter, Nick, was friendly, fast, and seemed genuinely to enjoy what he does. A four-year veteran of Murray’s, he managed to tread that fine line, so often missed, between being obtrusive, and not being around when something was required. Pleasant and outgoing, he hammed it up for the camera a bit, when I asked if photography was allowed. \n\nThe menu is not entirely a selection of steaks. There are a few pasta dishes, chicken entrees, and a selection of seafood, including lobster. I would wager that all of these offerings are tasty, well-prepared, and nicely presented. I couldn’t say for certain though; I ordered steak. You are probably doing yourself and Murray’s a bit of a disservice, at least on your first visit, if you order anything else. This is, after all, a steak house. You can expect to pay between 0 and 0 for a steak, though there are entrees going down into the low teens, and up over 0.\n\nWe had planned to order a prime rib and a New York Strip but ended up deciding differently. What changed our selections was seeing a waitress at a nearby table bring out what looked like a roast, and carve it, before arranging it on two plates for a pair of hungry diners. This was one of the steaks for two, a specialty of the house. Our particular selection was a Silver Butter Knife Steak, which is available in two-person or three-person portions. Preceded by a reasonably good Caesar salad and a tasty bread tray, the steak was delicious. I prefer my steak on the well-done side, while my brother likes his rare. Nick recommended that we order it medium. He carved it at the table, doling out the rarer inside pieces to my brother, and giving me the more well-done sections towards the ends. \n\nWe plan to make Murray’s a regular part of our trips to the Twin Cities. Coming once a year for the next twenty years or so hardly qualifies me as a regular customer, though. Were I a resident of the Twin Cities, I would probably make a visit to Murray’s once every month or two. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62fe7om16i9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.272535,44.978341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Newt's","description":"Posted by Golfinginthesun<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 216 First Ave. SW, Rochester, MN16 - Newt\\'s - Minnesota Monthly\n\nInherent Awesomeness: 29\nNewt’s is not easy to find.

The draw? Great burgers and a strange ju-ju that makes it feel like you’re drinking in Vermont circa 1978. There’s tragic, sepia-and-milk-chocolate colored stained-glass lighting, darkness everywhere, and—on the floor—popcorn thick as wet snow. There’s also a lot of 1920s-feeling black-and-white photos on the wall and a jukebox pumping out the Who and Neil Young. There are loads of microbrews available, and the fries arrive by the pound, in a perfect pale-golden mound: not too crisp, not too soft, lightly seasoned and okey-dokey in every possible way. And the burgers? They’re the lightest big burger in the state, which may seem like an odd compliment if you haven’t actually tasted one. The buns are white, fluffy, and almost a bit dry. They serve as the perfect foil for the beefy, airy, not overly seasoned, half-pound patties that seem to be held together by nothing but the thinnest veil of exterior char.

Because the Nook is home to the definitive bar burger: Well-charred, meaty but tender, wrapped in a soft white bun, and served with a mess of fresh-cut fries in a plastic basket.

After all, they offer glimmering fresh seafood, a fat French wine list, and distinctly Gallic dishes like escargot and tarte tatin. But to Salut regulars, the place is actually a big old burger joint with lots of benefits. Name another French restaurant that serves 120 burgers each weekday, and some 200 each day on weekends. The Salut burgers are just delicious. They’re made with fresh meat, ground daily and laced with a top-secret spice blend that lends a zesty liveliness, and are served on crusty ciabatta buns made at the restaurant’s own bakery. In fact, these burgers have a balance to them that makes them seem inevitable and necessary. The homemade, hand-cut fries don’t hurt either. But you know what’s weird? This is the one burger on this list that goes better with red wine than a beer. Must be a French thing.

If you’ve never been here before, you’ll think she’s asking if you want a spoon with your milk shake. No, she means with the burger. It’s loose meat, meaning that it’s filled with steamed crumbles of beef, kind of like a Sloppy Joe without the sauce. Of course, you can pick up the whole burger in its wax-paper wrapper and shove it in your mouth without the spoon. If you do, you’ll experience the simple, unadorned taste that people have been wild about since 1938. But, really: Put the burger down and use the spoon. Why?

It gets no respect. Why? Perhaps it’s a familiarity-breeds-contempt thing: The German restaurant has been there for so long (since 1965) that people have gotten used to taking its food for granted. That should stop. The place has a burger for the ages: beefy as a roundhouse punch, gorgeously well-charred, served in a big, thick, house-baked bun that’s unlike any other in the state. This thing is the king of the heavyweight burgers. The fries aren’t kidding around either: Ultra-crisp, russety-brown, very fresh hand-cut beauties that are just right for sitting alongside such a weighty, earthy, oniony, truly significant burger.

It’s seared till glossy bits of char speckle the rich beef, which burble inside with that particular savory, rich meatiness that food types call umami (a Japanese word meaning something like “a  rainbow of glorious, indescribable ultra-meat,” which is exactly what this burger is).
