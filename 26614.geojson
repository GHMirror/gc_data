The shooting took place shortly after 6 p.m. in the 7300 block of Pitt Street, near Lowerline Street, police said.\n\nThe Orleans Parish coroner\\'s office identified the victim as Leyon Gaines, 32, of New Orleans.\n\nArea residents reported hearing at least three shots. Gaines fell onto the pavement near an idling car in the middle of the block. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHe died from a gunshot wound to the head, New Orleans police spokeswoman Shereese Harper said. Police had no motives or suspects, she said, but a red compact car was seen leaving the scene.\n\nGaines pleaded guilty in 1997 to possession of crack cocaine, according to court records. He was arrested early last month for possession of a stolen vehicle and for being a felon with a firearm. He had an April court date pending.\n\nWithin minutes of the shooting, dozens of grieving people flocked to the site.\n\nSeveral people, all wearing memorial R.I.P. shirts, said Gaines and some friends had attended the funeral of a relative earlier in the day. - from the Times-Picayune<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63e4uumdkt4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.075,29.954444]}},{"properties":{"name":"03.09, 530PM","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\" href=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\">Nolafugees</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1400 FrenchmenDominique Weber, 16.

Laird said he moved into the neighborhood in January and recently witnessed a small group of people in the Gilmore Park apartment complex, part of which fenced off by razor wire, shooting a gun in the air and in the ground \"for no reason.\"\n\nHe said he called the police to report the incident, but the police didn\\'t find the weapon.\n\n\"It\\'s always been a problem with the guys who live there,\" Laird said.\n\n-Times-Picayune<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63e4uwk1toa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.024343729,29.9399953002]}},{"properties":{"name":"08.28 1AM: Thomas Byrne, 40","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\" href=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\">Nolafugees</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63e4uviuo2e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.0575387478,29.9804199843]}},{"properties":{"name":"08.28: Bludgeoned Woman's Decomposing Body","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\" href=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\">Nolafugees</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> New Orleans Police have opened a murder investigation into the death of a woman whose half-naked, bludgeoned body was found weeks ago inside an abandoned bowling alley in eastern New Orleans.\n\nReal estate agents exploring the former Sugar Bowl Lanes at 7716 Chef Menteur Hwy. made the grisly discovery on Aug. 28., authorities said.\n\nThe Orleans Parish Coroner\\'s office first released information on the death on Wednesday.

Jack had been walking down North Rocheblave Street, heading to the store on an errand for his mother, according to a police report about the Marcelin case.\n\nAs he walked in the 2000 block of North Rocheblave Street, Jack saw Kevin Harrison, 22, confront Marcelin outside a FEMA trailer next to 2050 N. Rocheblave, the report said. Harrison demanded money he believed he was owed, according to the report.\n\nMarcelin responded, \"I ain\\'t giving you any money, \" according to the report. Harrison then pulled out a gun, firing several times. Marcelin was shot in his head and torso. Eight spent .40 caliber casings were found at the crime scene.\n\nJack quickly walked past the shooting scene and went to the Richards Food Store on the corner, he later told police. When he left the store, Harrison was waiting for him outside.\n\nHarrison told him, \"If you say something, you\\'re gonna be next, \" Jack told police.\n\nWhen interviewed by police in January 2007, Jack could not identify Harrison by name, saying he knew him as \"Christopher.\" But he picked Harrison out of a photograph lineup and identified him as the killer in court during a preliminary hearing in April 2007, according to the court records.\n\nThe second-degree murder case against Harrison was supposed to go to trial Sept. 2, but was postponed because of Hurricane Gustav, which hit the day before.\n\nA spokeswoman for Orleans Parish District Attorney Robert Freeman said the office could not comment about any aspect of the case because it is pending in court.

He had been raising the children mostly on his own because their mother never played much of a role in their lives, Savoy said.\n\nJarrow, who attended Alcee Fortier High School, had a criminal record dating back to 1992, when he was convicted of burglary and illegally carrying a concealed weapon, according to court records. In 1996, he spent time behind bars for possessing crack cocaine.\n\nThough a lull in his criminal troubles coincided with the birth of his children, he was in trouble again in 2002, when he pled guilty to an attempted possession of a firearm charge. In 2006, he faced weapons and drug charges, but prosecutors declined to pursue the case.\n\nWith the help of his family, he tried his best to raise his children, Savoy said.\n\nJarrow, an automobile mechanic, was able to send his kids to school by fixing cars on his own and by working for local body shops. He also took on carpentry jobs to pay for their schooling, Savoy said.\n\nDuring his down time, Jarrow would take his three kids to the park and play with them. When relaxing indoors, the 33-year-old gearhead would leaf through automobile books and magazines with them, teaching them what motors were in what cars.\n\nSavoy said he, his sister and mother will split the duties of raising the children.\n\n\"We\\'re family,\" he said. \"We can\\'t leave them stuck out. They\\'ve been crying a little bit, but they\\'re handling it. We\\'ll stay close to them.\"\n\nRamon Antonio Vargas can be reached at rvargas@timespicayune.com.\n-The Times-Picayune<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63e4v53hqen"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.1333701611,29.95680296]}},{"properties":{"name":"11.21, 1130AM: male, mid-20's","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\" href=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\">Nolafugees</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> One man was killed and another wounded this afternoon in a shooting near the intersection of Cambronne and Spruce streets in the Carrollton neighborhood, police said.\n\nWhile there is still no information about exactly what led to the shooting, a police spokeswoman said the deceased was found in an alley between shotgun houses near the intersection.

One of the victims was dressed in women\\'s attire, he said.\n\nRiley noted that the investigation is in the preliminary stages and that it would take time for crime scene technicians to process the area. The shotgun double home sits in the middle of the block.\n\nIt is unclear when the shooting took place.

The club was formerly known as Club Dream.\n\nA police log said a security guard apprehended a man with a gun fleeing the club just after the shooting. Police spokeswoman Shereese Harper said this man was Hunter.\n\nIn a news release, Harper said Hunter\\'s arrest can be credited in part to citizen cooperation with homicide detectives.\n\nThe man, who New Orleans EMS paramedics pronounced dead inside the French Quarter nightclub, appeared to be around 20 years old, said Jeb Tate, an EMS spokesman. John Gagliano, the chief investigator for the Orleans Parish coroner\\'s office, said they are still working on identifying the man.\n\nThe woman, who had been shot in the abdomen, was taken to University Hospital in stable condition.\n\nParamedics took three others to Tulane Hospital with minor injuries they sustained as they tried to escape the club, Tate said.\n-The Times-Picayune<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63e4v2x3e6q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.0654566288,29.9538841344]}},{"properties":{"name":"12.17 530PM: Brian Urby, 17","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\" href=\"http://www.nolafugees.com\">Nolafugees</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> What sounded like an argument to neighbors led to the shooting death of a Sarah T.
