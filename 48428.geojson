Following a lifelong passion for food and agriculture, she graduated from the University of California in 1967 with a degree in French Cultural Studies. Alice then trained at the Montessori School in London, followed by a seminal year traveling in France. Her appreciation for classical French technique coupled with\n\nAlice opened her signature restaurant, Chez Panisse, in 1971. The Berkeley restaurant featured a five-course, fixed-price menu that changed daily. To this day, the set menu format remains at the heart of Alice\\'s philosophy of serving the highest quality products according to the season. Over two decades, she has discovered and encouraged a network of farmers and ranchers who now ensure Chez Panisse a steady supply of pure and fresh ingredients, almost all organically grown. The upstairs cafe opened in 1980, and features an a la carte menu--with an open kitchen and a wood-burning pizza oven. In 1984, Cafe Fanny, named for her daughter, opened a few miles from the restaurant.\n\nOver the years Alice has garnered countless awards and accolades, including James Beard Foundation awards for best chef and best restaurant, lifetime achievement awards from Bon Appetit and The Ritz-Carlton Corporation, and even awards from the United States Senate.\n\nA nationally recognized and prized humanitarian, Alice is currently involved with developing a food-based curriculum at Berkeley\\'s Martin Luther Kings Junior High School. This project seeks to involve children directly in planting, gardening, harvesting, cooking, and eating, with the goal of illuminating the vital relationship of food to their lives and teaching them respect for each other and for the planet. It is intended to be a significant part of the school\\'s curriculum, and to help resuscitate its lunch program. This King Junior High Edible Schoolyard is being conceived as a pilot project to serve as a model for schools across the country.\n\nAlice also has ongoing extensive involvement with the Horticulture Project at the San Francisco County Jail and its related program, the Garden Project, a job- training organization and market garden. These programs teach organic gardening to prisoners and parolees in order to renew their self-esteem and install community responsibility.\n\nAlice is married to Stephen Singer, a wine and olive oil merchant and a painter, and has a daughter, Fanny.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gasqxvkq2r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.271667,37.871667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Daniel Boulud, Café Boulud","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/danielboulud_190.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Manhattan, New YorkDaniel Boulud was raised on his family’s farm near Lyon, where he grew up surrounded by the rhythms of the seasons, the wonders of produce fresh from the fields, and of course, his grandmother’s inspiring home cooking.\n\nAfter being nominated as a candidate for best cooking apprentice in France, Daniel went on to train under renowned chefs including Roger Vergé, Georges Blanc and Michel Guérard. Following two years in Copenhagen where Daniel worked as a chef in some of the city’s finest kitchens, he made his way to the United States. His first position here was as chef to The European Commission in Washington, DC. Next, Daniel opened the Polo Lounge at The Westbury Hotel and later Le Régence at the Hotel Plaza Athenée in New York City. From 1986 to 1992, Daniel served as Executive Chef at New York’s Le Cirque. During his tenure there, the restaurant was regularly chosen as one of the most highly rated in the country.\n\nIn 1993, Daniel Boulud opened his own much-heralded restaurant DANIEL on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Here his inspiration remained the seasonal ingredients drawn from the best local purveyors. In just a year after opening, the restaurant was rated “one of the ten best restaurants in the world” by the International Herald Tribune.\n\nIn September 1998 Daniel Boulud opened Café Boulud, named for the gathering place his great grandparents tended on their farm outside Lyon at the turn of the century. The contemporary Café Boulud is a French restaurant with an international accent welcoming Manhattan’s café society to a spot with the cosmopolitan chic of a Parisian rendez-vous. In December of the same year the chef-restaurateur relocated DANIEL to its new Venetian renaissance inspired setting in the former Mayfair Hotel on Park Avenue and 65th Street. Since the restaurant’s re-opening, Daniel Boulud has been named “Chef of the Year” by Bon Appétit Magazine and the restaurant has received Gourmet Magazine’s coveted “Top Table” award. On March 14, 2001 the New York Times awarded DANIEL a coveted four-stars, while in the fall of 2003, DANIEL received both Wine Spectator’s “Grand Award” and New York City’s top ratings for cuisine, service and decor in the Zagat Survey.\n\nIn June 2001 the Chef opened DB Bistro Moderne in the City Club Hotel on West 44th Street. \"DB\" is a casual and contemporary restaurant in the heart of midtown, just steps from the theater district. Here, Daniel Boulud\\'s latest menu offers updated bistro cooking rooted in French tradition.\n\nThe chef opened a second Café Boulud in July 2003 at Palm Beach’s legendary Brazilian Court hotel. The menu parallels that of its sister restaurant in Manhattan. The new restaurant accommodates 130 guests, offers a lounge and bar as well as two elegant private dining rooms.\n\nDaniel’s other endeavors include Feast &amp; Fêtes, the exclusive catering department of DANIEL and his “Daniel Boulud CONNOISSEUR” line of Caspian caviar and smoked Scottish salmon offered via direct mail. Daniel was one of the founding partners of Payard Patisserie &amp; Bistro and sold his interest in the business to François Payard in September 2000.\n\nIn September 2003 Daniel launched his own line of professional quality kitchenware, aptly called Daniel Boulud Kitchen (DBK), including knives, enameled cast iron cookware, stainless steel cookware and tools, and kitchen textiles such as oven mitts, aprons and kitchen towels.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gasr3cnm73"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.980278,40.759167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Giada de Lauentiis @ South Coast Plaza","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/giada06.jpg\">3333 South Bristol St, Costa Mesa, CA 92626From Williams-Sonoma:\r\n\r\nPlease join us for a special book signing event at your local Williams-Sonoma store. \r\n\r\nOur book signings are a unique opportunity to meet leading chefs and authors, get signed copies of the latest cookbooks, and take home fresh new ideas for cooking and entertaining.

In his years at Executive Pastry Chef at Le Cirque, he elevated his craft to an art form with presentations that were always creative, often whimsical, and sometimes even architectural, making dessert the focal point of the dining experience. Now Jacques has fulfilled his own fantasy - he is a master chocolatier at his own Brooklyn based chocolate factory, Jacques Torres Chocolate.\n\nJacques entered the world of baking in his hometown of Bandol in the southern region of Provence at the tender age of 15. After two years as an apprentice at a small pastry shop, he completed his apprenticeship requirements and graduated first in his class. Jacques Torres, the artist/chef, was on his way.\n\nIn 1980, on a bet with a friend, Jacques approached the Michelin two-star chef Jacques Maximin at the Hotel Negresco and asked for a job. Maximin gave him an hour to return with a chef\\'s coat. An eight-year association with the Negresco began which took him around the globe. At the Negresco, he refined the skills and nurtured an intuitive sense of confectionary artistry, which has been the cornerstone of his career.\n\nFrom 1980-83, Jacques studied for the degree of Master Pastry Chef after which he taught at a local culinary school in Cannes. During this time, he honed his skills and, in 1986, was awarded the prestigious Meilleur Ouvrier de France medal, the youngest chef to earn the distinction.\n\nThe list of culinary awards and achievements grew from there including the 1986 French Championship of Desserts and a gold medal from the Japanese Pastry Chef Association. Jacques served as a consultant to Cointreau and Valrhona chocolate, participated in the rededication ceremonies of the Statue of Liberty with Presidents Mitterand and Reagan and spent culinary weeks in Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne and Spain. In 1988, Chef Torres moved to the United States where he opened The Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage. Soon thereafter, Sirio Maccioni invited him to join Le Cirque where he would oversee an impressive custom-built pastry kitchen. At Le Cirque, Jacques\\' creations delighted guests from around the world including presidents, kings and celebrities.\n\nIn addition to his role as chocolatier and business owner, Jacques serves as Dean of Pastry Studies at New York\\'s French Culinary Institute. He has also opened his kitchen to aspiring students and generously donated his time to many national charities including Meals on Wheels, the American Red Cross and God\\'s Love We Deliver. Chef Torres has participated in Julia Child\\'s Master Chef television series, Pierre Franey\\'s Birthday Celebrations and \"Merci Julia\", a salute by the world\\'s top culinary professionals to Julia Child. In recent years, he has been named the James Beard Pastry Chef of the Year, the Chef\\'s of America Pastry Chef of the Year and one of Chocolatier Magazine\\'s 10 Best Pastry Chefs. His shows on the Food Network and his two cookbooks have been great commercial successes, testaments to his never waning popularity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gasr3c47m1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.95,40.65]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Vong","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/vongerichten.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> New York<b>Restaurants:</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/99791\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/07/1/106966322_135w128h128.jpg\" alt=\"Vong\" height=\"77\"></a>\n\nInternationally reputed for his innovative, groundbreaking cuisine, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has emerged as one of the country\\'s leading chefs. Acclaimed by critics as \\'formidably gifted,\\' a \\'residential genius\\' and the \\'enfant terrible of modern French cooking\\', his culinary vision has consistently set new standards and helped define today\\'s generation of cooking.\n\nIn 1986, Jean-Georges Vongerichten burst onto the New York dining scene at the Lafayette in the Drake Swissotel, dazzling diners with his innovative interpretation of classic French cuisine and earning four stars from The New York Times at the age of 29. In the first of many bold moves that has established him as a culinary trendsetter, Jean-Georges traded in this formal 4-star dining room for paper-clothed tables and opened his charming bistro Jo Jo in 1991.\n\nAt Jo Jo, he introduced us to his \\'vibrant and spare cuisine\\' whose intense flavors and satisfying textures he created by eschewing traditional meat stocks for vegetables juices and fruit essences, light broths and herbal vinaigrettes. Jo Jo was named Best New Restaurant of the Year by John Mariani in Esquire and earned three-stars from The New York Times, which summed up his contemporary French cuisine in the sentence \"His food took my breath away.\"\n\nJean-Georges\\' next venture, Vong, paid homage to the spices and flavors of the East, a passion he developed during the three and a half years he lived and worked in the Orient. Using over 150 different herbs and spices to create his unique take on Thai- inspired French cuisine, the menu at Vong wowed both critics and patrons, earning yet another three-star review from The New York Times for his \"explosively flavorful food.\" In an adjacent space to Vong, Vongerichten also opened The Lipstick Cafe, a stylish cafe that caters to the midtown business crowd and serves breakfast and lunch in a casual, upscale setting.\n\nA year and a half later in November of 1995, Vongerichten opened a second Vong in the Knightsbridge area of London, earning a three star review and the 1996 vote for the London Evening Standard\\'s Newcomer of the Year. In September 1997, he opened Vong in The Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong, where he has already received accolades from local media. A fourth Vong opened in April 1999 in Chicago.\n\nIn March of 1997 Jean-Georges opened restaurant Jean Georges in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, earning a 4-star review from The New York Times less than three months after opening; he was also awarded the coveted Chef of the Year award from John Mariani at Esquire magazine and the Best New Restaurant award by the James Beard Foundation.\n\nHis most recent New York City project (July 1998), The Mercer Kitchen at the stylish Mercer Hotel in SoHo, features an American-Provencal menu and Ecommunal style tables in the open kitchen area where hotel guests and diners may choose to eat, converse and watch the kitchen\\'s activities. In October of 1998 Jean Georges opened Prime, a steakhouse located in Steve Wynn\\'s much-anticipated Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gasr1zzrsg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jody Adams, Rialto Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/jody3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Somerville, Massachusetts<b>Restaurants:</b> \n<a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/65032\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/04/2/partyw128h128.jpg\" alt=\"Rialto NYC\" height=\"77\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/66068\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/04/2/default_photow128h128.jpg\" alt=\"blue restaurant\" height=\"77\"></a>\n\nJody Adams\\' passion for food began at her family\\'s dinner table. Her mother relied on traditional New England staples during the holidays, such as standing rib roast with Yorkshire pudding at Christmas and baked salmon with peas on the Fourth of July. But, for other special celebrations her mother would make soufflés, curries, gnocchi or a favorite dish from Elizabeth David, like Daube of Beef with Oil-Cured Olives. When Jody\\'s father took the entire family to England for a sabbatical year, Mrs. Adams made a point of locating and visiting local markets for new and unusual ingredients. \"If she came across a batch of fresh, wild mushrooms, then that\\'s what we\\'d have for dinner,\" recalls Jody. \n\nJody inherited her mother\\'s fondness for cooking, but it wasn\\'t until she was a college student at Brown University that her interest in food took a professional turn. \"I had a part-time job with Nancy Verde Barr, a professional food writer and teacher. After a while, I learned I was much happier in Nancy\\'s kitchen learning French and Italian cooking techniques than I was in anthropology class.\" Jody became Nancy\\'s apprentice and, eventually, her class assistant. She also helped Nancy test the recipes for her book on Italian immigrant cooking, We Called It Macaroni (Knopf, 1991). \n\nJody\\'s culinary career in Boston began in 1983 at Seasons restaurant under Chef Lydia Shire. Three years later, at Hamersley\\'s Bistro, she became Gordon Hamersley\\'s Sous Chef. She moved to Michela\\'s in 1990, and was executive chef there until 1994. While at Michela\\'s, Jody reputation grew for her carefully researched regional menus that combined New England ingredients with Italian culinary traditions. \"I have an enormous amount of respect for local cooking traditions. Regional cuisine has had time on its side - it\\'s taken centuries to figure out how to make the best of what\\'s available nearby. Technique, on its own, doesn\\'t count for much. A new technique or personal interpretation only becomes part of the tradition when it enhances the taste of the dish\\'s ingredients.\" In September 1994, Adams opened Rialto with restaurateur and partners Michela Larson and Karen Haskell. The new restaurant allowed Jody the freedom to expand her culinary expertise. Four months after the new restaurant\\'s opening, the Boston Globe awarded Rialto four stars, the newspaper\\'s highest rating, proclaiming that, \"eating Jody Adams\\' food at the stunning new Rialto is like stepping into a winter greenhouse just at the moment a spectacular hothouse orchid bursts into bloom, filling the senses\" \n\nJody opened her latest venture, blu, in November of 2001 with Larson, Haskell and Gary Sullivan - all partners in The Sapphire Restaurant Group. Located in The Sports Club/LA in downtown Boston, blu is set 100 feet in the air, looks down on a brilliant urban street scene and up to a beautiful expanse of Boston sky. The restaurant serves sophisticated American classics based on traditional European cuisine. \n\nIn addition to opening another restaurant, Adams recently published her first cookbook, titled In the Hands of a Chef: Cooking with Jody Adams of Rialto Restaurant (HarperCollinsPublishers; January 2002). She co-wrote the book with her husband, Ken Rivard. It is a collection of recipes that she describes as \"artisanal home food,\" which follows her passions and palate as she cooks for family and friends. \n\nOf her success, Jody says, \"If you\\'re going to work in the restaurant business, you have to love it. The stress is high, the hours are long and the pay is nominal. The reward is in the culture. It\\'s full of interesting, creative people who excel in the art of performance and making people happy. I can\\'t imagine doing anything else.\" \n\nJody Adams resides in Somerville, Massachusetts with her husband Ken Rivard and their two children, Oliver and Roxanne. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gasqwl5w8p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Judy Rodgers, Zuni Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/judy_rodgers_zuni.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> San Francisco, CA<b>Restaurants:</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/36462\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/04/2/pic_5204w48h48.jpg\" alt=\"Zuni Cafe\" height=\"77\"></a>\n\nCo-owner and chef Judy Rodgers had the fortuitous experience of living with the Troisgros family, whose restaurant has three stars, near Lyons, France as a foreign exchange student. Perhaps it’s the smelling, tasting and living with perfection that has influenced her cooking today. Or, perhaps it was training at Chez Panisse, or cooking in France, Italy or Thailand. But, most likely, her signature style reflects her own desire for perfection. She believes in purity of the food. French food is French Food, not French mixed with Italian or Thai. She’s said to make the perfect roasted chicken. After graduating from Stanford with an art degree, Rodgers went straight to work at Chez Panisse, cooked and traveled around the world, then in 1987 became a partner in Zuni Café.
