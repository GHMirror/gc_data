The estimated number of working days in the year (250) is in line with other research in the field. This number assumes that the typical full-time employee works a 5-day week - indeed, the 1995 Survey of Work Arrangements showed that 75% of full-timers had a 5-day week - and is entitled to all statutory holidays (around 10 days a year). Thus, the potential annual labour supply of a typical worker would be 52 weeks multiplied by 5, less 10 statutory holidays, or 250 days. This allows the days lost per worker in a year to be calculated.","table 279-0029 absence rates of full-time employees, by sex for canada, provinces and census metropolitan areas (cma), annual(1,9,10)":"4","column_3":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.3,65.5]}},{"properties":{"column_4":null,"geometry_id":"aa56i57luq73","id":"aa6a9rcdd1gv","column_2":null,"table 279-0029 absence rates of full-time employees, by sex for canada, provinces and census metropolitan areas (cma), annual(1,9,10)":"Source:","column_3":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.3,65.5]}},{"properties":{"column_4":null,"geometry_id":"aa56i57luq73","id":"aa6a9r6xczqq","column_2":null,"table 279-0029 absence rates of full-time employees, by sex for canada, provinces and census metropolitan areas (cma), annual(1,9,10)":"Statistics Canada.
