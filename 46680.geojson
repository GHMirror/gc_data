I was headed tto the Kwik Shop to get my mom something. Milk or cigarettes or something like that. It was a short ride. Our little neighborhood hardly gets any traffic. I was just slowly pedaling along and I somehow got very deep indeed into a daydream. I remember that I was also watching the pavement move beneath me, something I used to do a lot when I was a kid. All of this while riding my bike.\n\nI was worlds away. I was probably not even really inside my own body anymore, mechanically pedaling my daydream forward. \n\nThen, suddenly, I was sitting on the trunk of a parked car. I had been so deep in my thoughts that at first I thought that I had been hit by a moving car. When I realized that I had actually just ran into the back of a parked car and been tossed (fairly gently, I wasn\\'t going very fast) onto the car\\'s trunk, my first reaction was to look around and check if anyone had seen me do it. I felt exposed and embarassed.\n\nThe bike was fine. I was fine, though it is always jarring to be yanked out of your own reality into \"real\" reality so violently. I felt oddly ashamed and didn\\'t ever tell anyone about this accident until I was in my 20s.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63elckqd4ac"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.176435,42.499377]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sledding Hill- Mason Drive","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> This used to be a pretty good sledding hill when I was a kid, but now there\\'s a fence blocking access to it and it\\'s all overgrown with trees.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63elckxg10n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.176521,42.498998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Taco TICO Mexican Restaurant","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/logo_sm.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 319 South 29th Street, Fort Dodge, IA, 50501This was my absolute favorite restaurant as a kid.
