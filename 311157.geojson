The provincial Department of Public Safety reported that approximately 200 homes and businesses were damaged, including those of the Tobique First Nation.

The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk.  The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.","link":"http://cdd.publicsafety.gc.ca/dtpg-eng.aspx?eventId=588&amp;cultureCode=en-CA","updated":{"end_time":"2011/07/04 09:18:11 -0400","original":"2011-07-04T13:18:10Z","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/04 09:18:10 -0400"},"geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"title":"Flood : Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (Richelieu River) QC","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/22 01:00:00 -0400","original":"2011-04-22T04:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2011/04/22 00:00:00 -0400"},"geo_score":0.0,"id":"abgqbuc60zfb","description":"Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (Richelieu River) QC, April 22 to June 15, 2011.

Approximately 300 m of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. This is a spectacular landslide because it not only flowed downstream, but crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres.

A supercell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 km. The heat and humidity hanging over Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared.  At the same time, a squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across Ontario. This system produced straight-line winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto and destructive tornados in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornados were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of supercell thunderstorms was spawning tornados in portions of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay, and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day's weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. That was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/Central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing an 11-year-old boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp.  About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge, were damaged. Thirty-eight were demolished and declared unsafe. Major flooding occurred along the lakeshore, and at the peak of the storm Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers had lost power.","link":"http://cdd.publicsafety.gc.ca/dtpg-eng.aspx?eventId=526&amp;cultureCode=en-CA","updated":{"end_time":"2011/08/09 16:53:49 -0400","original":"2011-08-09T20:53:48Z","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/08/09 16:53:48 -0400"},"geo_precision":"unmatched"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"title":"Tornado : Déléage to Mont-Laurier","published":{"end_time":"2009/08/04 01:00:00 -0400","original":"2009-08-04T04:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2009/08/04 00:00:00 -0400"},"geo_score":0.0,"id":"abgqbut8kewf","description":"Déléage to Mont-Laurier, August 4, 2009.
