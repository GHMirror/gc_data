Our activities program has brought the residents to a Luau, a Manor Olympics, Mardi Gras, and many other fun and stimulating events.\n\nIn addition, our Manor was recognized with a letter of Exemplary Care following our annual state regulatory survey required of Medicaid funded nursing homes, including health care centers at retirement communities.\n\nCurrently under remodeling to help make care and service delivery more efficient in the resident – centered programs, we\\'re all looking forward to the new look and adding to our capacity to care for residents who need our highest levels of care.\n\nPresbyterian Manors Retirement Communities Offer Services for Today and Tomorrow\n\nMost of our Presbyterian Manors of Mid – America retirement communities are what is called a continuing care retirement community or CCRC.

We refer to it as \"independent living,\" but it\\'s much more than that. It\\'s the freedom to do what you enjoy most, without worrying about home maintenance and chores.\n\nAssisted Living provides short – term extra assistance if your physical needs change. We offer several levels of assisted living with programs and services to encourage improving independence.\n\nIn the health care center, you can recuperate after surgery or we\\'re here for you if there is a significant change in health conditions. We can take care of you at our highest levels of care. In several of our locations, we also provide memory care for those with Alzheimer\\'s, dementia, or similar illnesses.\n\nWe offer financing options for our retirement communities that help you make a move that fits your budget and desire to have funds on hand for future care needs.\n\nThat\\'s one of the advantages of a continuing care retirement community, should the need arise in the future, you and your family aren\\'t making decisions about where you live at a time when you may be in a health crisis.
