It is made of 2,300,000 blocks of stone, each one averaging at 2 1/2 tons in wieght. No side is more than 8 inches different in length than another, dispite the maker\\'s few tools and supplies. The entire structure is perfectly positioned to the points of the compass. Until the 19th century it was the tallest building structure in the world and it is 4,500 years old. It\\'s the only one of the famous \"Seven Wonders of the Ancient World\" that still stands today.\r\n\r\nA English mathematician, John Greaves, visited the pyramid in 1638. He discovered a narrow shaft, hidden in the wall of the pyramid, that connected both the Grand Gallery with a descending passage. Both of the ends were sealed tight and the bottom was blocked with debris. Some archaeologists believe this route was used by the last of the Pharaoh\\'s men to exit the tomb after putting him to rest. After that, granite plugs had been put in place to prevent theives from entering the tomb to steal Pharos treasures.Since the size the passageway was so small and the great amount of debris, it seems that there wasn\\'t a massive amount of treasure hidden in the tomb.  \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2g1ce01cx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.133816,29.979119]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mt.

These presidents include: \r\nGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. These masterpiece is called Mount Rushmore. It is a monument to American History.\r\n\r\nThe man who hatched such and idea in 1923, was a South Dakota state historian Doane Robinson. Congress passed legislation authorizing the carving project in Harney National Forest Preserve (which is now Black Hills National Forest). Robinson hired a man named Gutzon Borglum to help him with this project. Borglum inspected the mountain and found it to be to whithered and thin to support such a sculpture. The men were forced to abandon the project or find a new place to carve, but then they heard about Mt.

In December of 1835 Ben Milam led Texian and Tejano volunteers against Mexican troops quartered in the city. After 5 days of house-to-house fighting, they made General Marín Perfecto de Cós and his soldiers surrender. The very victorious volunteers then took over the Alamo.\r\n\r\n  Now there is a museum for the Alamo called \"The Alamo\". It shows and teaches about the heroes who fought there. Inside the old church at the museum there are exhibits displaying artifacts linked with some Alamo Heroes. Davy Crockett’s buckskin vest, a flintlock rifle used in the battle; a period Bowie knife, and many others are displayed in the old church. \r\n  I went on the site for The Alamo museum and it looks very interresting and educational.

Chares had been experienced in building large scale statues before. He started out constructing small figurines and statues that were only about 3 feet high as practice. When it was completed, the Colossus stood at the harbor entrance for 56 years. Every morning the sun caught its smooth, polished, bronze surface and made the statue of the god shine. Then a terrible earthquake hit the city of Rhodes and the statue was destroyed. Huge pieces of the figure lay across the harbor for centuries. \r\n\r\nIt has been said that an Egyptian King offered to pay for The statue to be rebuilt, but the Rhodians refused his offer. They feared that somehow the statue had offended the god Helios, who was responsible for the earthquake that ahd threw the statue down. \r\n  \r\nLater in the 7th century A.D., the Arabs took over Rhodes and broke the remainder of the Colossus up into small pieces and then sold them as scrap metal. Some accounts says that it took 900 camels to carry away the Colossus\\' pieces.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2g18cgjrn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.220115,36.433722]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Great Pharos Lighthouse","description":"Posted by Spaz92<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/light_house_platial.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/platial_lighthouse_5_.jpg\">In fall of 1994 a team of archaeological scuba divers began studying the waters off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt. They searched the bottom of the sea for artifacts. Very large underwater blocks of stone were marked with floating masts so  an Electronic Distance Measurement station that was located on shore could find out their exact positions in the water. Global positioning satellites were later used to futher fix the locations of the blocks of stone.\r\n\r\nThe designer of this magnificant lighthouse was Sostrates of Knidos. Being very proud of his work, Sostrates wanted to have his name inscribed into the foundation. The ruler of Egypt refused his request and wanted his own name to be the only name on the building. Sostrates, being a clever man had this  inscription carved in the building: \r\n\r\nSOSTRATES SON OF DEXIPHANES OF KNIDOS ON BEHALF OF ALL MARINERS TO THE SAVIOR GODS \r\n  \r\nSostrates chiselled it into the foundation, then covered it with plaster.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2g1lpkpk5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[29.90650177,31.2128014583]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Hanging Gardens Of Babylon","description":"Posted by Spaz92<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/196/485956298_abc0eab7e8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/208/485986933_5bd80d48e2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/87/232968544_c172f3d83e.jpg\">MesopotamiaHerodotus, a historian in 450 B.C., wrote this about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, \"In addition to its size, Babylon surpasses in splendor any city in the known world.\" According to Herodotus, the outer walls of the gardens were 56 miles in length, 80 feet thick and 320 feet high. Wide enough, he said, to allow a four-horse chariot to turn.  Inside the walls were fortresses and temples containing large statues and figurines of solid gold. The famous Tower of Bable rose above the city.\r\n\r\nMany say that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon was built by King Nebuchadnezzar II, the ruler of Babylon in 605 B.C. for 43 years. Some others argue that it was built by the Assyrian Queen Semiramis during her 5 year reign starting in 810 B.C. \r\n\r\nAccording to many accounts and records, Nebuchadnezzar built the Gardens for his homesick wife Amyitis. She was forced to marry Nebuchadnezzar to form an alliance between her father\\'s nation, Medes,and Babylon. It was said that Amyitis\\' home in Medes was lush and green with mountianous regions, and she looked at the flat, sun-baked land of Mesopotamia as depressing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2g1mnxfi0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.313057,5.890535]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus","description":"Posted by Spaz92<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/platial____.bmp\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/placial_maus.bmp\"> Asia MinorThe city of Halicarnassus was the capital of a small kingdom along the Mediterranean coast of Asia Minor. In 377 B.C., after the ruler of Halicarnassus died, his son Mausolus took over with his queen Artemisia.\r\n\r\nTogether they ruled over Halicarnassus and some other surrounding territory for 24 years. Even though he was descended from the local people, Mausolus spoke Greek and loved and admired the Greeks way of life and their government. He founded many Greek  designed cities along the coast and he encouraged Greek democratic traditions. \r\n\r\nThen in 353 B.C. Mausolus died, leaving his queen Artemisia devastated. She decided to build him the most splendid tomb in the known world as a tribute to him. It remained untouched when the city fell to Alexander the Great in 334 B.C. and also after attacks by pirates in 62 and 58 B.C. It stood above the city ruins for some 17 centuries. Then a series of earthquakes shattered the columns and left the Mausoleum in ruins. By 1404 A.D. only the very base of the Mausoleum was left and reconizable.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2g1ld4jd5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[137.86911,60.474129]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Statue of Zeus at Olympia","description":"Posted by Spaz92<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46159968@N00/419624620/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/161/419624620_f2a091b11b.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/92645015@N00/508503953/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/231/508503953_5ed7937956.jpg\"></a>The First Olympic games were first held in 776 B.C. at the shrine to Zeus located in a region called Peloponnesus on the western coast of Greece. The Shrine was simple in the early years, but as time passed and more games were held there it became more and more important. It was clear to the Greek people that a temple that was fit for such a god should be built. Between 470 and 460 B.C., construction on a new temple began. The designer of this project was Libon of Elis and his masterpiece was completed in 456 B.C. \r\n\r\nInside this great temple was the shrine itself. Its sculpter was a man named Phidias. He had already created a forty-foot high statue of the goddess Athena for the Parthenon in Athens, and some other sculptures inside the temple. So you could say he was very skilled!\r\n\r\nan evacuation in 1950 uncovered some of Phidias\\' work on the statue of Zeus. Under an early Christian Church Archeoligists found sculptor\\'s tools, clay moulds, a pit for casting bronze, modelling plaster, and even a portion of one of the elephant\\'s tusks which had provided the ivory for the statue.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2g1e32cth"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.71056,37.98372]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Temple of Artemis","description":"Posted by Spaz92<img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2179/2111685189_1efb2931ed.jpg\">Greece The first shrine to the Godess Artemis was most likely built around 800 B.C. on a marshy strip of land near a river in Ephesus. The Ephesus goddess Artemis, also called Diana, is the godess of fertility. The shrine was destroyed and rebuilt many times over the next few hundred years. \r\n\r\nBy 600 B.C., Ephesus had become a major port of trade and a very skilled architect named Chersiphron was inspired to build a new large temple. His design included very high stone columns. This temple did not last very long. In 550 B.C. King Croesus of Lydia conquered Ephesus and other Greek cities of Asia Minor. During the violence and fighting, the temple was destroyed. King Croesus wanted to show he was a gracious winner, so he had a new temple built. This temple was built by Theodorus, and it was 300 feet in length and 150 feet wide with an area four times the size of the previous temple. This new temple was the pride of Ephesus until it was burned to the ground by a man named Herostratus (who was determined to get his fame in some way or another). Shortly after this horrible tragedy, a new temple was commisioned. Its architect was Scopas of Paros, one of the greatest architects of his day. His temple was recorded as 425 feet in length, and the width at 225 feet. Aso there were about 127 columns, 60 feet in height, that supported the roof. Ephesus stayed peaceful for the next few centuries after that.\r\n\r\nThe Goths destroyed the Great Artimis Temple during a raid in 262 A.D. Both the city and the religion of Artemis were in ruins. When the Roman Emperor Constantine rebuilt alot of Ephesus a century later, he did not want to restore the temple, because of his Christian religion and his little interest in pagan temples.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2g1isz91t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.80708,38.278603]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/285360","metadata":null,"contact_name":"spaz92","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:spaz92","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/285360","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=285360,platial:user=spaz92","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48958}
