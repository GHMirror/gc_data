Rising 7,500 m above the ocean floor, it is regarded as the world’s third-tallest volcanic structure and stands in a spectacular environment. The visual impact of the site is all the greater due to atmospheric conditions that create constantly changing textures and tones in the landscape and a ‘sea of clouds’ that forms a visually impressive backdrop to the mountain. Teide is of global importance in providing evidence of the geological processes that underpin the evolution of oceanic islands.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62jwpvyy7t1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-16.6147613525,28.2608441148]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Alahambra and Parador de San Francisco","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 1000 - What Wonders Lie Within\n\n-site (Alahambra)\n-hotel (Parador de San Francisco)\n-event (International Music and Dance Festival, June 25-Jul 12)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62jwq6zm0f3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.58832359314,37.1760774358]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Caves of Altamira and Santillana del Mar","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 1000 - Fragile and Invaluable Link to the Ice Age\r\n\r\n-site (Caves of Altamira)\r\n-experience\r\n-town (Santillana del Mar)\r\n-hotel (Parador Santillana Gil Blas)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62jwq3vk53i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.10806059837,43.3906724461]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Way of St. James and the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 1000 - The Oldest Tourist Route in Europe\n\n-experience (pilgrimage)\n-town (Santiago de Compostela)\n-site (cathedral)\n-hotel (Hotel Reyes Catolicos)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62jwpzp14e7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.54625821114,42.8806656359]}},{"properties":{"name":"Title or search term","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Carrer Montcada 15-23, Barcelona1000 - Tracing the Evolution of Genius\n\n-site (museum)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62jwq33nkpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.18086,41.385108]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tower of Hercules","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Tower of Hercules has served as a lighthouse and landmark at the entrance of La Coruña harbour in north-western Spain since the late 1st century A.D. when the Romans built the Farum Brigantium. The Tower, built on a 57 metre high rock, rises a further 55 meters. It is divided into three progressively smaller levels, the first of which corresponds to the Roman structure of the lighthouse. Immediately adjacent to the base of the Tower, is a small rectangular Roman building. The site also features a sculpture park, the Monte dos Bicos rock carvings from the Iron Age and a Muslim cemetery. The Roman foundations of the building were revealed in excavations conducted in the 1990s. Many legends from the Middle Ages to the 19th century surround the Tower of Hercules which is unique as it is the only lighthouse of Greco-Roman antiquity to have retained a measure of structural integrity and functional continuity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62jwq7wa22m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.406644,43.38576]}},{"properties":{"name":"University and Historic Precinct of Alcalá de    Henares","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> Founded by Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros in the early 16th century, Alcalá de Henares was the world\\'s first planned university city.

It was designed by the Basque architect Alberto de Palacio and completed in 1893. The 45-m-high bridge with its span of 160 m, merges 19th-century ironworking traditions with the then new lightweight technology of twisted steel ropes. It was the first bridge in the world to carry people and traffic on a high suspended gondola and was used as a model for many similar bridges in Europe, Africa and the America only a few of which survive. With its innovative use of lightweight twisted steel cables, it is regarded as one of the outstanding architectural iron constructions of the Industrial Revolution.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62jwpuujk9o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.01729202271,43.3231483668]}},{"properties":{"name":"Works of Antoni Gaudi","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Seven properties built by the architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) in or near Barcelona testify to Gaudí’s exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
