The last few times that I went (around 2002), it was pretty marginal, frozen/canned tasting vegetables.  And it became expensive (&gt;0 for lunch).  According to some articles that I\\'ve read, it was closed in  2004 because of a rental dispute.  Now, it seems to be open again at a new location.  I\\'m willing to try it one more time to see if they have rediscovered the magic.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rvi4al87ki"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.666607,45.548936]}},{"properties":{"name":"Esparza's Tex Mex Cafe","description":"Posted by Datashaman<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 2725 SE Ankeny St, Portland, OR 97214-1817<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rvi4d0dgis"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.637861,45.52194]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gartners Meat","description":"Posted by Datashaman7450 N.E.
