Location: Market and 30th just to the left of the train station (with your back to the Schuylkill). Had the \"large\" fried chicken for .50. Small was  less and unless you\\'re feeding two people, I\\'d strongly recommend sticking with a small. Large was 2 entire thigh/legs and 2 heaping servings of sides. The chicken was piping hot, tender, with a crispy coating, covered with hot sauce (optional) comparable to tabasco in terms of flavor and bite. The crust had no extra salt, allowing the flavor of the chicken and the batter to shine through. The true test of perfect fried chicken -- the skin and coating were still crispy after the whole meal was done.\n\nSides: Tried the green beans which were fresh, hot, a bit salty but not overly so, and had a touch of onions I believe. Yum. Also had the candied yams -- perfectly soft but not mushy, sweet but not too much so. Overall - sides were done right.\n\nThe chicken was the highlight of the meal though and this was the best fried chicken (if not best chicken period) I\\'ve had in recent memory, and that includes several trips from San Francisco to the East Coast passing through the Deep South, so take that! Denises\\' will do ya right! Almost forgot to mention -- I didn\\'t order it, but for  you get 32oz of homemade ice-tea in a plastic tub. Other menu items include fried fish, jerk chicken, and a variety of sides, but they\\'ll all have to wait because I\\'m still full from the chicken.\n\nOther: No atmosphere to speak of, but remember this is a lunch truck.

But they can be boring. Hence last year\\'s creation of Once Upon a Nation, a year-old initiative of the nonprofit Historic Philadelphia, Inc., designed to make our city\\'s history more relevant and fun. Once Upon a Nation deals primarily in tours and storytelling, but now they also do miniature golf. And what\\'s more fun than miniature golf?\n\nOpen until 9 p.m., a new Philly-themed mini golf course, and its companion Franklin Square carousel and playgrounds, helps meet Once Upon a Nation\\'s other goal of creating more things for tourists to do at night, when those boring buildings and museums are closed. Three years in the making, the 18-hole course includes interactive reproductions of the Love sculpture, Benjamin Franklin Bridge and the Chinese Friendship Gate. On the eve of Franklin Square kiddyland\\'s opening we spoke with Ruth Rosenquist of Studio Productions in Tempe, Ariz., the company charged with transforming Philadelphia icons into playable pop art.\nSTONE FREE: There are no cobblestones <b><i>in play</i></b> on the Elfreth\\'s Alley hole.\nSTONE FREE: There are no cobblestones in play on the Elfreth\\'s Alley hole.\n: Michael T. Regan\n\n\t\n\nCity Paper: How did you decide on these particular buildings and subjects? Were there things that didn\\'t make the final cut?\n\nRuth Rosenquist: We designed the course with Castle Golf in Mesa [Ariz.] and Once Upon a Nation. A lot of ideas got thrown around and it was a group decision which ones to keep and which ones we weren\\'t able to use. I know there was talk about the Franklin Institute\\'s heart and a Philly food hole with a soft pretzel loop-de-loop. That would have definitely been a different style than the world-class, museum-quality realistic representations we\\'re known for. But with most [of the cuts] it came down to budget and space and time.\n\nCP: The Philadelphia sports hole is a par 3. Given our sports teams\\' records, wouldn\\'t it have been more realistic to make that hole impossible to do in the 6-stroke limit?\n\nRR: Since Philadelphia is home to the great underdog story of Rocky , the course designers felt a par 3 was warranted. There isalways reason for hope in the world of sports! CP: Why didn\\'t you put the cobblestones in the putting area of the Elfreth\\'s Alley hole as well as on the sides?\n\nRR: We talked about it. But we were worried about people tripping and falling. We also worried about what it would do to wheelchair access. [The course is wheelchair accessible.]\n\nCP: What are the most challenging holes?\n\nRR: I think the Benjamin Franklin Bridge is a lot of fun and more interesting than the typical two- or three-part hole. There\\'s only about an 8-inch height clearance on the bridge opening. If you don\\'t make it you drop in the Delaware.\n\nCP: Any insider tips?\n\nRR: My colleagues at Castle Golf, the Arizona company that designed the play of the course, call the Ben Franklin Bridge hole a touch shot. The turf on the bridge is shorter, which makes the ball roll more easily than on the other turf surfaces. Be sure to hitthe ball with enough force to get it over the high point on the bridge\\'s arch, or it will roll back, costing you a stroke.\n\nCP: Which holes were the most challenging to design?\n\nRR: The Museum of Art with the Rocky steps. The original design had the ball dropping down the stairs, which is the more typical way to deal with stairs in mini golf. There is a danger in putting up — the ball can become a boomerang. [But when Once Upon a Nation requested that the balls had to go up the stairs like Rocky] we were able to come up with a compromise that lowered the angle of the putt that didn\\'t take too much away from the grandeur of the stairs.\n\nCP: Do you think it\\'s a good course?\n\n\t\n\nRR: It\\'s one of the most interesting courses I\\'ve ever seen. I love the way it blends the educational with the historical. I know a lot of players will be attracted by the bells and whistles — like how the Liberty Bell rings when you putt into it and the snippets of songs that play on the Sound of Philadelphia and Rocky holes. The water also adds excitement. [In the Benjamin Franklin Bridge hole, the Delaware River is a water hazard, but on the Boathouse Row hole putting into the Schuylkill River spillway is the best way to get to the hole.] I also think the nighttime lighting on Boathouse Row and the Ben Franklin Bridge is really neat.\n\nCP: Are you embarrassed or proud to say you help make mini golf courses?\n\nRR: Proud, absolutely. Especially with this project. It tapped the creative juices of our staff in a way that few other jobs have. To have this located right in the heart of the historic district the way it is, we feel like we\\'re playing a part in the city\\'s history.\n\ndaily through Sept. 4, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. (last tee time at 8:15 p.m.), weekends from Sept. 5-Oct. 31, -, Franklin Square, Sixth and Race sts., 215-629-4026, www.onceuponanation.com.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66gjccjikek"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.14945,39.95456]}},{"properties":{"name":"Philly Roller Girls, Millennium Skate World","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1900 Carman Street, Camden, NJ(from Daily Candy) \t\nJune 2, 2006\nRoll Out\n\nRemember Xanadu?
