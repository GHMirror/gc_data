It was used as a prison during the Second Seminole War and St. Augustine was a prime fighting ground during both Seminal Wars. St. Augustine is the oldest city recorded in United States and was established on September 8, 1565 by Pedro Menendez de Aviles for Philip II, the King of Spain. The Fort was equipped with cannons and much protection. It even had a moat but supposedly never filled with water until those who controlled it thought it would be nice to have it filled, but soon after that the walls of the moat started cracking. At ground level the moat isn\\'t visible, it was made this way purposefully to surprise attackers. \r\n\r\nThe Fort was held by the Spanish until it was handed over to the English in 1763. At that time it was called Fort Marion. Soon after, it was given back over to the Spaniards for forty more years. Finaly, in 1842 Castillo de San Marcos was handed over to the Americans. To this day, anyone who visits the Old Fort can meet some of the original Spanish forces who are actually there to re-enact and shoot off a cannon for tourists.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om7tgg0in4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.31431,29.89202]}},{"properties":{"name":"George Washington","description":"Posted by Swimmylivey44<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/image_other_side.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/Halloween_party_and_DC_342.jpg\">Mount Vernon, VirginiaMount Vernon, George Washington\\'s estate, is set on 40 acres of land overlooking the Potomac River in Alexandria, Virgina. It has several gardens and a fair amount of the original furniture and family relics. The graves of both George and Martha Washington along with many other memebers of the Washington family are buried there. The estate was built back in 1743 by George Washington\\'s half brother, Lawrence Washington. The house was named after Lawrence\\'s comander, Admiral Edward Vernon, in the British navy. \r\n\r\nMount Vernon was George Washington\\'s home from 1747 until he died in 1799. He inherited the masterpiece in 1754. The estate had been enlarged multiple times between the years of 1759 and 1787. The Mansion is a wooden structure of Georgian design and is two and a half stories high. Washington was alive when slavery was a normal part of life. Mount Vernon was estimated to have held up to 300 slaves judging from the slave quarters of the estate. After Washington\\'s death the house was restored by the Mount Vernon Ladies Association. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om7tijx1zu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.104119,38.711953]}},{"properties":{"name":"Golden Gate Bridge","description":"Posted by Swimmylivey44<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/istock_000002817912xsmallgolden_gat.jpg\">San Francisco, CaliforniaSan Francisco contains one of the largest bridges ever built, the Golden Gate. It took over four years to build this suspension bridge and cost over 0 million. May 28, 1937 was the first day traffic was allowed to travel across the masterpiece. The bridge\\'s main suspension is 4,200 feet long and the two towers ascend 746 feet. This incredibly famous bridge connects San Francisco with Marin County, and stretches 1.7 miles.   \r\n\r\nDuring the construction of Golden Gate only eleven workers were killed, which at the time was a new record. There was also a net hanging under the floor as a safety unit. Nineteen men were saved by this innovation during construction and are called the members of the \"Half Way to Hell Club.\" In the earlier days of the bridge Captain John C. Freemont gave it the name \"Chrysopylae\" meaning \"golden gate.\" The construction actually began on January 5, 1933 and was completed on until May 27, 1937.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om7teua0ev"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.418333,37.775]}},{"properties":{"name":"Great Wall of China","description":"Posted by Swimmylivey44<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/great_wall_of_china_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/china_great_wall_big.jpg\">ChinaThe Great Wall of China was built by Qin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of China during the Qin Dynasty, over 2000 years ago. The wall is called \"Wan-Li Qang-Qeng\" which means 10,000-Li Long Wall in Chinese. (10,000 Li = about 5,000 km) The Great Wall is one of the largest structures ever completed. It stretches across the mountains of northern China and cuts northwest of Beijing. It actually is not just one continuous wall, but a multitude of shorter walls that follow the hills on the southside of the Mongolian plain.\r\n\r\nThe first set of walls was built to keep Mongol nomads out of China during the Qin Dynasty. It went through constant expansions and remodeling in later periods. However, the major modifications of the walls began in the Ming Dynasty. \r\nIt was a motivated development and took over 100 years to finish. The architects in the era of the Ming Dynasty were recognized for their distinctive and creative design. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om7tm3tjsq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Liberty Bell","description":"Posted by Swimmylivey44<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/Liberty_Bell.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/LIBERTY_BELL_INSCRIPTION_193x238.png\">Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaThe Liberty Bell resides in Philedelphia, Pennsylvania today. In July 8, 1776 it was to ring out from a tower in Independence Hall to beckon all of Philadelphia to come here the first reading of the Declaration of Independence by Colonel John Nixon. The bell was originally ordered for the 50th anniversary of William Penn\\'s 1701 Charter of Privelages (Pennsylvania\\'s original Constitution.) Abolitionists were the ones who gave it the name \"Liberty Bell.\" Originally it had been called the \"State House Bell.\" The abolitionists came up with the name because of the inscription that is printed on the outside of the bell: \"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants therof.\" \r\n\r\nThe crack on the bell has brought up much dissagreement of when exactly the crack came to be. There had been many hair-line cracks but they had been covered up to avoid growth of the split. However, the final development of the crack was concurred to have happened on Washington\\'s Birthday in 1846. This concluding fracture ended the ringing life of the bell. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om7tf6yz7z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.164167,39.952222]}},{"properties":{"name":"London, England","description":"Posted by Swimmylivey44<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/050_Windsor_Castle_Sunset___Nov_2006.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/crimsonrwc.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/windsor_castle.jpg\">windsor castleThe Windsor Castle is the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world. It has stood for almost a millennium. William the conqueror was the first to reside in the castle during the 11th century, and the current ruler Queen Elizabeth II lives there today. At first the establishment was used primarily for defense purposes until it was rebuilt with stone by Henry II. In circumference the mansion is almost one mile and is by far the largest in Britain.\r\n\r\nOn November 20, 1992 a destructive fire damaged over 100 of the rooms in the home. Although, during the renovations of the castle there were many discoveries. Under coats of plaster in St. George\\'s Hall were remains of Antonio Verrio\\'s mural (17th century) for Charles II. Also renovators found an ancient well that reached all the way to the Thames river.

The faces of four of our past presidents, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, are carved into it.  The sculpting started in 1927 and continued for 14 years. More than 350 people helped in the making of the memorial. At first they were thinking of carving famous old western icons into the mountain such as Buffalo Bill and Sacagawea. A special commision decided against it because they figured our presidents represented the \"foundation, expansion and preservation\" of the United States better. \r\n\r\nGutzon Borglum was requested to design Mount Rushmore and decided to set the memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He died before the masterpiece was finished but his son, Lincoln, finished his work. 90% of the mountain was carved out of dynamite and the rest was done out of air hammers. Washington\\'s face was finished in 1930, Jefferson in 1936, Lincoln in 1937, and Roosevelt in 1939.

The monument is dedicated to all those who lost their lives in the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941. The Japanese planes came in two waves, one at 7:53 AM the other at 8:55 AM. 2,403 soldiers were killed and 188 planes were destroyed. Only about 3 hours later another attack was planted on the Philipines. Farther west, the Japanese continued, bombing Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Thailand. \r\n\r\nThe USS Arizona itself took 1,300 lives down with her after it was hit. It only took just a few short minutes before the ship sank to the bottom of the harbor. This was only one of the many attacks of World War II. The memorial is set floating above where the USS Arizona sank, and you can still see oil from the ship wreck on the surface.

There are approximately 3,300 people buried in this church. A few of the more famous are Sir Isaac Newton, David Livingston, and Charles Darwin. \r\n\r\n  Back in 1050 was when King Edward the Confessor decided to build an abbey. There are only parts of the church that are still in tact, dating back from 1065. Most of the abbey today is from the years of 1245 and 1272 when Henry the VII made a choice to rebuild Westminster in a more gothic style. There are multiple rooms consisting of The Chapter house, The Cloyster, The Nave, Henry the VII Chapel, etc.  The newest part of the abbey is the North entrance, which was completed in about the 19th century.\r\n  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om7ts2w0a1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116667,51.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"White House","description":"Posted by Swimmylivey44<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/whitehouse_back_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/washington_dc_white_house_s.jpg\">Washington DCThe White House resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.. It was designed by James Hoban, and architect who won a competition organized by Thomas Jefferson and George Washington in 1792. The competitions were held to decide on who would design the two most important buildings in Washington D.C., the president\\'s house and the Capitol. Washington was there when they were constructing the building, but never got a chance to live in it. John Adams was the first resident to ever live in the White House. There were many presidents who were not impressed and complained that it was too big.\r\n\r\nWhile James Madison was president from 1809 to 1817 the White House was torched in the War of 1812 by the British. All that was left were the charred walls and some interior bricks. Madison called Hoban back to rebuild the mansion, it took three years to finish. During this construction, was when the house was painted white and the North and South porticos were added. \r\n\r\nIn all, there are 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels in the mansion. There are 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 8 staircases, and 3 elevators. Also, in the past the White House had many different names such as the \"President\\'s Palace,\" the \"President\\'s House,\" and the \"Executive Mansion.\" Theodore Roosevelt came up with the current name, the White House, in 1901. \r\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6om7tqp0wke"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036667,38.895]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/86760","metadata":null,"contact_name":"swimmylivey44","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:swimmylivey44","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/86760","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=86760,platial:user=swimmylivey44","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47717}
