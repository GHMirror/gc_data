Our aim is to establish a high profile design institute that will encourage a multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary environment – providing an international setting for new thinking in design and technology.\n\nThe structure of the institute will incorporate an integrated plan of teaching, research and consulting – all in the same building, at the same time – allowing the different areas to influence each other in their vision and philosophy. We believe there is a high demand for interaction design education worldwide and the school and research lab will provide a platform for a strong educational program and innovative research projects. We believe in new research models that interface with both academia and industry – as design is a major innovation driver towards a knowledge-based economy.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ie024mah8u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.588121,55.702426]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ixda.org\" href=\"http://www.ixda.org\">Ixdamaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/design_logo.gif\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ie01y4lkrd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.942789,40.442701]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dept. of Industrial Design KAIST","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ixda.org\" href=\"http://www.ixda.org\">Ixdamaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/Picture_18.png\">Daejeon, KoreaThe main educational aim of our department can be summarized by the following.\n\nFirst, through well-balanced and systematic education of humanity, science and engineering, and formative arts, students are to develop intelligence, creativity, originality, and artistic sensibility.\n\nSecond, a deep understanding of the history, nature, and scholastic phase of design is sought along with the shaping of ethical values to be responsible towards human and society.\n\nThird, design problem solving methods are taught to develop the ability to understand the structure of design problems and solve them creatively.\n\nFourth, the ability to precisely present an idea through writing, drawing, and modeling is sought, as well as the ability to use computer and other digital media as a design tool.\n\nLastly, the ability to run and manage a design organization and its process while cooperating with professionals of other fields and users who are taking part in a product development process is fostered.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ie027idq99"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[127.434402,36.324299]}},{"properties":{"name":"Domus Academy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.ixda.org\" href=\"http://www.ixda.org\">Ixdamaps</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/image_display.php?id=361&amp;table=JT_IMMAGINI\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/Picture_14.png\">milan, italyDomus Academy was born in Milan in 1982 as an open project around the Italian design and fashion experience.

The projects can be short workshops introducing new skills, such as electronic and software prototyping, or they can last several weeks and so allow for a more prolonged engagement with a particular perspective.\n\nDuring the second year, students are expected to initiate their own projects, and to build up a body of work that reflects the professional context in which they wish to practise. Many students work closely with people outside the College, be they experts or volunteers, in order to identify hidden or neglected desires and needs, which are then reflected in design proposals for new products and services.
