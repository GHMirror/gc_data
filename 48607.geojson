Upward we went and suddenly we were caught in a strong windstorm that blew us northwest. We came down the next day in a cornfield, and later we found that we were in Elgin Illinois.

A passenger on the train told us about a famous ballerina performing at the Sanger Theater in Montreal. We went to the performance and were amazed. Afterwards we went back stage and met the prima ballerina, and later asked her out for a cup of salad. ( I have heard that ballerinas only eat two cups of salad and fruit everyday).

After seeing Hairspray, Wicked, The Lion King, Rent, Chicago, Phantom of the Opera, and Beauty and the Beast, we knew the shows were all great. After each evening performance we met the actors and actresses, then later went out to dinner. My most favorite restaurant was Bubba Gump Shrimp. After this exciting journey we knew it was time to head back to Maui. We hopped on the plane, and before you knew we were back on the ground in Maui, Hawaii.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ueizqtg2n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9599609375,40.7805414319]}},{"properties":{"name":"6.
