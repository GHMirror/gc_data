It’s been a few different places in my many years here, and it really doesn’t matter what it’s called now.  They have booze there—and the occasional game of “Texas hold ‘em.”  \r\n\tI stopped regular gambling when I got married because there was nothing left to gamble, but I catch a game three or four times a year.  They’re cheap…mostly for fun, but you can win a little bit if you play.  Perhaps it’s the camaraderie—but sometimes I could swear he plays so often to survive—gambling and unemployment being his only income.\r\n\tHe’s taken to drinking hard alcohol with his beer.  His claim is that beer will not get him drunk anymore.  He has become immune.  He’s partaken of the poison so long that he has neutralized its effects on his system.  It’s alcoholic Darwinism.  He’s becoming the perfect beast.\r\n\tHe’s out of the game quick (bad beat)—but for him, life is a series of bad beats—so he doesn’t dwell on it.  When he heads back into the night, he realizes someone has stolen his bicycle, and if he didn’t hate cops, he’d call one—but he does so he won’t.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gxce6jxp34"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.46302,41.55577]}},{"properties":{"name":"A Brother","description":"Posted by Jpavich1A Brother \r\n\r\nOne day, I walked into the basement of the library to check my email, and there, in the corner office, was Mark Sharp.  He works for the University as a web designer—or something computer oriented.  Anyway, I’m sure he knows what he’s doing.  Mark’s from Highland too.  He and I actually graduated a year apart.  We have several friends in common, although we never hung around together all that much.  He gave me a team in his fantasy baseball league.  Helluva guy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it’s really great to have someone around who understands what that place has done to my head and the heads of all the people I discuss here and everywhere I discuss people.  In other words, Mark knows why I do what I do and say what I say.  I don’t have to explain to him why, or feel the need to apologize or explain.  Mark’s office is a little house with a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter’s night (I think that’s REO Speedwagon I stole that from).  I enjoy our few minutes we can hang out everyday.\r\n\r\nHe told me his theory of “the sphere of influence,” which basically is that if you stayed in town for any extended period of time after high school, you remained in “high school” in your mind.  The “sphere” holds your place in time and perpetuates itself within the personalities of those who failed to break from its grasp.  Awesome.  True too.  \r\n\r\nAnd so I asked him about a mutual friend, whom I believe has a theory that a Vietnam Vet and a friend of mine are trying to have him killed.  The Vet, by the way, was not in Vietnam.  So Mark says—“oh yeah, and what about the aliens?”  I say, “what aliens?”  And he says, “There’s not enough time now, come and see me later.”  So I will see him later.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gxcebqgrbv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04468,41.44067]}},{"properties":{"name":"Another Bar","description":"Posted by Jpavich1Another Bar\r\n\tDown 45th Avenue there’s another spot, but I think an outstanding tab has curtailed recent visits.

We had a small radio...we\\'d put on a little Queensryche or Megadeth...and tight line fish with whatever my brother decided would work.  He knew the fish.  He was one with the fish.  I\\'d ask if the music would scare them, and he\\'d say...\"the fish can\\'t hear.\"\r\n\r\nThe others would come out hours after we would.  They were mostly folks from the Highlands apartments...I think they tore those down.  They loved my brother.  They said \"y\\'all out here early \\'gin?  That\\'s when they catch \\'em most.  Gotta git out early uh Ivan.\"  When they\\'d leave, Ivan told me \"fish don\\'t tell time.\"\r\n\r\nWe\\'d use corn from cans, dough balls, hot dogs, ham, anything my brother brought.  If we ran out, he\\'d walk up the bank and get a burger from the King.  We\\'d use whatever was on it.  We were fishing for carp.  Ivan said \"the fish can\\'t taste it anyway.\"\r\n\r\nWe\\'d leave the poles on the bank and lay back and talk about metal.  When the rods pulled toward the river, we\\'d run them down and pull in the fish...big carp, one or two feet long maybe.  He\\'d give me a stringer of three and I\\'d take them up the bank and trade them for malt liquors and Old Styles.  \r\n\r\nThe fish literally stunk...the smell was unbelievable, like they were dead on the inside.  The guys down the bank said \"gotta know how ya clean \\'em to eat \\'em,\" but Ivan said \"can\\'t eat the fish...whatever they do with them...they ain\\'t eating them.\"\r\n\r\nBy noon we were baked in every way one can be baked and we\\'d go home.  We had separate freinds and we had different lives.  I haven\\'t seen him in years, but I guess he\\'s still fishing somewhere.  He was a great fisherman, at the Little Cal or anywhere.

I’m 34 years old—half way done.  That makes me 34 to Katy’s 2.  When she’s 18, I’ll be 50.\r\n\r\nLast night, I was on the couch in my living room.  Sometimes, Katy gets mad at me—she’ll turn her back and tell me “go on the couch daddy!”  Once, I made her mad, and as I sat down to dinner at the dining room table, she said “no daddy…eat on the couch.”  It’s funny, I know.\r\n\r\nSo I guess Katy’s “place” for me is on the couch.  She spilled a juice box on it this morning.  She was very embarrassed and ran into her room before I could say anything.  I wasn’t sure if she peed on the couch, or spilled the juice box—so I went in and asked her.  She said “no peed daddy—I so sorry.”  And I said “you spilled juice, so what?”  And then she said “your couch daddy—I so sorry.”  \r\n\r\nA little later she said “happy birthday” and then tried to ask me what kind of cake I liked, but I couldn’t understand her.  Mommy had to translate.  I said “whatever you like Kate.”  “I’ll get daddy cake, mommy” she says to the wife.  I had to go.  I always have to go.\r\n\r\nAnywho…like I was saying, I’m on the couch last night—and Becky (aforementioned wife) was yelling at me for something.  I don’t recall what for.  Well, last night—around 10:30—Katy starts yelling for mommy.  She goes in there and here Katy say, “daddy put in my movie and turned on my princess light.”  And Becky says “daddy’s nice huh?”  And then Katy said “you screamed at daddy on the couch.”  Becky said “I’m sorry about that.”  Katy tells her “be nice to daddy, mommy.”  When Becky came back to bed she told me her eyes were all welled up with tears.  She said we just can’t fight around Katy anymore.  OK then.\r\n\r\nNow I’m writing this in the library at school with at least thirty people around…and you guessed it…I’m crying.  I happy Katy.  And tonight we’ll have the cake you picked out.  Fuck school, fuck homework, and fuck anyone who tries to tell me there’s anything else more important than cake.  There’s not you know.

She hails from Rochester, Michigan—and because every state on the map contains a “Rochester”—clarification was solicited and received.  Rochester is near Detroit, Michigan.  This Rochester is four hours by automobile from the campus of Valparaiso University, where we conducted this interview.\r\n\r\nI asked stock questions and received stock answers.  Laura runs cross-country for the university—she’s a Lutheran.  I asked if she considered herself a “Midwesterner,” to which she answered yes.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, if you look up “Midwestern” in the dictionary, you very well may find a picture of Laura as a representative form of Midwestern females.  Historically, farmers chose wives in the Midwest based on “sturdiness” or general health.  Indiana (Northwest in particular) is no exception to this historical fact (if “fact” can be defined as something I may have read once).  \r\n\r\nReference to Detroit bothers Laura.  She will use Detroit as a point of reference, but seems to prefer not being seen as “of Detroit.”  As a Chicago Blackhawks fan, I don’t blame her—but somehow I get the feeling no one would mistake her for a city-dweller.\r\n\r\nThere’s a small town honesty that makes me nervous.  When I look up—she is looking directly at me, as though she has nothing to hide.  I don’t trust her, but I also have a tremendous amount of respect for her if she really has nothing to hide—so I say very little.  Now I’m feeling self-conscious about what I am hiding.  I think the word might be disarming, but I don’t know for sure.  She may be disarming if that word can be deemed complimentary.\r\n\r\nAt the end of our discussion, she tells me she chose Valparaiso because it’s close, but not too close—her sister is in Chicago, but not in Valparaiso—her parents a day trip north.  This way, she is on her own, but not abandoned.  Interesting.  If I were the psychological type I may have some grist for the mill—but I am not.  \r\n\r\nAs a member of the founding families of the great region of Calumet—I hereby  bestow upon Laura honorary citizenship in Northwest Indiana based on her exemplary attributes pertaining to everything Midwestern.

He was laid-off for winter, and now he is never to return. His boss was one of his childhood friends. They grew up blocks from each other on the other side of town. He mentions “matter-of-factly” that this employer was particularly upset that he paid to get his car fixed, and that he left it to die in the driveway rather than use it to get to work. He also explains that he was warned that “no call—no shows” were grounds for three day suspensions, which he began using like weeks of vacation over the course of last summer. I ask whether he knows that this is his fault, and he agrees—to a certain extent. I ask what he will do, and he tells me unemployment benefits extend for another two or three months. After that? He sees no “after that.” He will not discuss it any further than saying he will no longer work for anyone—he will not subject himself to the will of others any longer. In this town, there are few that will put him up for any extended period of time—seeing as how most have over the course of the last ten years.

Keith would conjure up dishes with whatever we still had lying around.  He was MacGyver in the kitchen...I\\'m alive today thanks to his culinary cunning.  \r\n\r\nOne morning, we were lying around and started discussing the hunger.  We made light of it, but it was starting to get to us.  It was 10AM and I was drinking Old Style (yes, we had beer) when Keith came in from getting the mail. \r\n\r\n\"I\\'m in deep with the government,\" keith said flinging a letter in my direction.\r\n\r\n\"What can they do to you that hasn\\'t already been done?\" I replied as I opened the letter.  \"Hey...it\\'s a check.  Did you file a tax return?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must\\'ve!\"\r\n\r\nKeith took me to Woodmar and bought us both a pair of low cut Pumas...black.  We went over to the \"Bread Basket\" on Indianapolis Blvd.  We ate like kings.  We had real shakes and huge sandwiches.  We drank all night, and went for breakfast at the \"Golden Bowl\" on 169th.  The money lasted about a week, but the memories lasted a lifetime.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gxce4xj56g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.44602,41.589]}},{"properties":{"name":"This One is Gonna Sting","description":"Posted by Jpavich1I knew a girl that lived here.  When those of us who went to Our Lady of Grace in Highland first hit the public schools, I was introduced to her through a mutual friend.  She was truly \"otherworldly\"--as in not of my world, although I guess you could say we hung out in common circles.  \r\n\r\nI called her one night out of the blue...no plan, nothing to say.  We talked some that night, and that night turned into frequently...which turned daily.  We were friends.  I cared about her.   \r\n\r\nIn my youth, I carried around odd ideas of what relationships were like and how they were supposed to be carried out.  Attraction was coupled in my mind with intimacy--physically--but emotional intimacy was attached to nothing as I hadn\\'t felt it yet.  Somehow, I felt like being emotionally intimate should be regarded as sacred and physical intimacy was somehow \"degrading\" to emotional love.  I know it sounds crazy, but I never really discussed these things with people.  What this does, or did--was make it impossible to feel \"love\" as I felt for her and still attempt an intimate relationship.  To have both was to defile the other.  If this makes no sense to you as a reader...you are sane, because basically you can\\'t have sex and love together.  I was 15 or 16...\r\n\r\nBut I was learning.  I\\'d never felt \"love.\"  I\\'d never been in love.  I was confused.  I also trusted her completely, which made things begin to take shape in my muddled mind.  Yes, I can trust...yes, she can trust me...this is healthy...this is what it\\'s all about...I had it, and of course, I\\'m telling this story because I lost it.\r\n\r\nHow it happened is based on place oddly enough.  It has to do with tracks--train tracks actually.  You\\'ll hear it someday if you don\\'t know it already...\"wrong side of the tracks.\"  Some would say that one of us lived on the wrond side of the tracks, but to me, we both lived on the wrong sides.  There\\'s no right side in a case like this.  \r\n\r\nThese lines exist everyplace.

I rode up Grace Street heading towards Ben’s on Garfield, and I happened to pass by Tim Ispas’.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young buck, Ispas’ was famous for the two Chevelles Timmy’s brother kept out front all summer.  They must’ve been late-sixties to mid-seventies Chevys.  They were both beautiful.  One was red and the other yellow.  I passed them every day on my way to Damon’s, and on the way to Pettit Park with him on the way back.  We both loved those cars.\r\n\r\nTim was 12 when I was 9 (almost 10).  I was moved from the Little League “minors” to “majors” a little before my ninth birthday.  I was a little too young, and a little too small—but they couldn’t keep me where my age warranted because I didn’t fit there either.  Anyway, I didn’t know the older kids.  Tim was the best player on our team—and because he “took me under his wing” so to speak—I was almost instantly accepted.  Tim was a good guy.\r\n\r\nAs always, the story I have has filtered through the Highland rumor mill, so I can’t be sure I have the story straight.  It’s probably safe to say that Tim was involved in a hunting accident.  The story is that Tim was shot on purpose by someone over property or trespassing while hunting.  I heard he was on a duck boat and drifted somewhere where someone thought he shouldn’t have been.  I don’t know for sure.  All I know is that he’s in a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nI went by quickly, but I can surmise from seeing him in the driveway that he can’t use his arms and legs.  He was in the middle of the driveway facing the garage door with his back to the street.\r\n\r\nI rode out to Kane Field at Homestead Park before I went to Benny’s to check something.  I rode to the side of the building behind home plate where the signs are with the names of everyone that won state championships.  In 1988, my team won.  My name is right there in alphabetical order after Ozelie, Mark.  In 1986, as I suspected, there was the name Tim Ispas.  \r\n\r\nI’ll bet, judging from my own experience, that winning that title seemed real important to Tim in ’86.  Now—I’m not so sure it matters to him at all.  I wonder if he even follows the game anymore.  I wonder what kind of things Tim considers important now.  But I’ll never know, because the guilt hits me so bad every time I see him that I can’t bring myself to tell him who I am.   \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gxceijrgq3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.48138,41.58463]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valpa (for Johnson)","description":"Posted by Jpavich1Valpa (for Johnson)\r\n\r\nI read somewhere once that Michael Stipe of REM fame bought up many of the historic buildings of Athens, Georgia because they were in danger of being torn down and replaced.  I doubt that would be necessary in a town like Valparaiso, Valpo for short…or Valpa to Johnson from Von Tobel Lumber in Schererville, Indiana.\r\n\r\nIn Valpo, they probably have certain laws that govern how you can renovate the buildings in the “downtown square.”  Even if you were to own a building outright, you’d likely be forced to adhere to certain codes to make sure the buildings retain a certain amount of their original appearance.  Hell, even the houses near the square probably have acertain historical significance.  I’ll bet they do.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I mention it…if you live in any number of subdivided areas around the town, you may be asked not to put up a chain-link fence.  You may not be allowed to put up a TV antennae, you may be told what type of dog you can have, and where he might do HIS business.  Anyway…\r\n\r\nWhat you see on the square is the same as the square in Crown Point, Indiana—about 15 miles or so from here.  It’s the same as a square in southern Indiana, where I went with my friend Steve Helm to recruit some players for his team at Ancilla College in Donaldson, Indiana.  He pulled over to ask a couple with two children where Larry Bird used to live, and they completely ignored him.  Well, they looked at him, but they didn’t answer.  Wonder what that was all about—huh.  Anyway, it’s nice, but it’s not special.  I’ve seen two just like it in this state, and I don’t get out much.\r\n\r\nFor a small town, Valpo is large, but it’s still a small town.  I should know.  I’m a small town guy.  I’ve always lived in small towns.  The difference, politically, is that you can look the guy that’s doing what he’s doing to you in the eye while you grill a brat—that’s it really.  Actually, that distance in the throng is probably the only thing that makes the city a better place.  The anonymity.  Here in Valpo…I’ll bet everyone knows a little something about everyone.\r\n\r\nAnd the square…well, I think it’s like a Hollywood movie set.  Charming on the outside, but just a shell in a way—not real, like when you’re hiking somewhere and you can hear a train in the distance, and it snaps you back into the reality that you’re cornered.  You’re cornered  by progress—or something calling itself civilization.  Nothing against Valpo.  I like Valpo as much as the next guy, but Mayberry, North Carolina doesn’t exist either—as much as we’d all like to try and recreate it’s success.\r\n\r\nBut if you asked Johnson—he’d maybe tell you something else.  He came here years ago from Iraq.  I’m talking years ago too.  He calls it Valpa.  Valpa’s probably a very different place from the Valpo I write about. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gxce2nsobf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05292,41.47875]}},{"properties":{"name":"testing...","description":"Posted by Jpavich1this is only a test.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gxce8qtpau"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.44493,41.58855]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237242","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jpavich1","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jpavich1","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237242","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237242,platial:user=jpavich1","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":40657}
