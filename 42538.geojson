They have a clean, modern interior with some cool art on the walls and a shiny new Nuova Simonelli espresso machine...and that\\'s about it.  The coffee is imported from Ohio and not served with what I would call the greatest of care (pre-ground espresso in the dosing chamber, no pre-shot rinse, barely a whisper on the tamper in the pf basket, etc.)  But there\\'s certainly potential.  Drive-thru is available, which is good because this location is definitely a commuter location, not a destination in itself.  Menu is run of the mill.  Overall, some nice touches but the coffee, man, the coffee!  Yawn. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6nf5rsqa5bo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.1079101562,29.6880527499]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafeggio Coffee","description":"Posted by Txcp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> Cafeggio has some things going for it, a La Marzocco Linea being one of them.  But that\\'s almost about where it ends for coffee.  Everything else is ho-hum Starbucks knock-off.  Their main advantage is that they serve coffee from two decent roasters.  Intelligentsia does their espresso, House and Breakfast Blend.  The Brown Coffee Company does their single origins.  Good panini.  Run of the mill pastries.  Free Wi-Fi...blah, blah, blah.  One of millions of other places.  And the baristas are mostly young and just want a job at a \"cool\" place to work.  Will definitely do in a pinch but not going to launch any fireworks in anyone\\'s mind.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
