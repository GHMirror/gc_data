On the Via Carisma side of the corner, there are two date palms planted between the sidewalk and the curb. The residence at this location has many fruit trees overhanging from their property (cherimoya, apple, banana, among others). However, it is not advisable to pick from these trees as the owner gets grouchy about it. Though, sometimes there is perfectly good fallen fruit. The trees I mentioned that are between the sidewalk and curb (apple and date palm) are perfectly fine to pick from.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6q5mp4rz3dw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.719729,34.398327]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jodi House","description":"Posted by Stacylouise<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> 1235C Veronica Springs Road, Santa Barbara, CA 93105Back into this meandering cul de sac of local non-profits there is much public space that is unused.
