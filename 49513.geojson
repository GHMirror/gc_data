You don\\'t know the half of it. This is one seriously comprehensive art museum that doesn\\'t bother with petty period constraints; If an object was created between the Stone Age and now, it may well be in here. The Met is the preeminent American museum of art, and its collection of European works is matched only by that of the Louvre.\n\nIf you\\'re trying to decide how much time to spend, know that the museum holds over two million pieces of art. At a rate of a minute per piece, you\\'ll need roughly four solid years of viewing time, so you had best get started. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdaz7wedd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.963008,40.779372]}},{"properties":{"name":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","description":"Posted by Patterson<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 5th Avenue, Manhattan, New York<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdays1qxp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.963008,40.779372]}},{"properties":{"name":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","description":"Posted by Shoutlove<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 5th Avenue, Manhattan, New YorkI didn\\'t make it here but I hear it\\'s amazing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdayfltv6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.963008,40.779372]}},{"properties":{"name":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","description":"Posted by Petershieh<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/metropolitan_museum_of_art_01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 5th Avenue, Manhattan, New YorkThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, often referred to simply as The Met, is one of the world\\'s largest and most important art museums. It is located on the eastern edge of Central Park in Manhattan, New York City, United States. The Met also maintains \"The Cloisters\", which features medieval art.\n\nThe Met\\'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world. The collection\\'s holdings range from treasures of classical antiquity, like those represented in its Greek and Cypriot galleries, to paintings and sculptures from nearly all the European masters, to an extensive collection of American art. The collection also contains extensive holdings of Egyptian, African, Asian, Oceanic, Middle Eastern, Byzantine and Islamic art. An encyclopedic collection of Musical Instruments [1]from all over the world is also on view, as are a number of recreations of notable interiors, including one by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The Department of Arms and Armor displays a collection of antique weapons and armor from around the world, primarily Europe, but also Japan, the United States, and the Middle East, with extensive holdings from other cultures and periods in the study collection.\n\n- from wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdauhn5ra"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.963008,40.779372]}},{"properties":{"name":"Momofuku Noodle Bar","description":"Posted by Kenziegirl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 163 First Avenue, New York, New York NYMag: This is Japanese ramen by way of a Carolina whole-hog barbecue, with more than a soupçon of French technique, deriving its super-porky flavor as much from hot, fatty slabs of succulent Berkshire pork belly and deep-pink shredded shoulder as from the long-simmered stock (made from 70 pounds of chicken legs, roasted pork bones, ham hocks, and bacon). Almost in atonement, the toppings are conspicuously fresh and nourishing—the chopped scallions and slivered snow peas, the chewy preserved bamboo shoots, the optional (but highly recommended) Greenmarket corn, briefly sautéed and still crunchy, the delicate sheet of nori propped on the rim. Sure, the noodles could be a little firmer. But there’s even a bit of performance art, as a cook gingerly cracks a slow-poached egg and its golden yolk oozes at the prod of a chopstick over the the whole glorious affair.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdaqqm1cf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.984476,40.728963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Momofuku Noodle Bar","description":"Posted by Connubialmaracas<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 163 First Avenue, New York, New York reviewed favorably in Times by Asimov and in blog by Bruni.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdauq64tw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.984476,40.728963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Momofuku Noodle Bar","description":"Posted by Vrunka163 First Avenue, New York, New York <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdb1unzt4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.984476,40.728963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Momofuku Noodle Bar","description":"Posted by System163 First Avenue, New York, New York Momofuku Noodle Bar (212) 475-7899<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdaop8kco"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.984476,40.728963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Momofuku Noodle Bar","description":"Posted by Olivia613163 First Avenue, New York, New York <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pbdambgv62"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.984476,40.728963]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Museum of Modern Art","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/MoMA_Marron_Atrium2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 11 West 53 Street, New York, NY 10019-5497MoMA, as it is affectionately known, was founded in 1929 to be a breath of fresh air in the stuffy traditional world of museums.
