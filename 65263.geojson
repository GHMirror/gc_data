The water flowing past Big Break Regional Shoreline through the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers drains half of California's watershed, and creates the largest estuarine environment on Pacific shores. This \"Inland Coast\" is home to 70 species of birds, and provides valuable habitat for beavers, muskrats, and river otters.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"/&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Getting There&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;From Highway 4 in Oakley, go north on Big Break Road. Take the first right just past Vintage Parkway and follow the road to the Big Break Pier. You can also enter the park by walking in on Marsh Creek Regional Trail, just adjacent to Marsh Creek off E. Cypress Road in Oakley, east of its intersection with Main St./Highway 4.\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Public Transportation&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Tri Delta Transit #300 provides service to Vintage Parkway and Big Break Road on weekdays.

Birdwatchers are drawn by the constant birdsong from the marshes, and everyone comes to enjoy the solitude and escape from the nearby urban landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Fishing/Boating&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bass fishing is currently the most popular recreational activity at Big Break. The 100-foot fishing pier is very popular with local anglers. A California fishing license is required to fish from the pier or shoreline, but an EBRPD fishing access permit is not required. While shore fishing offers less success, boaters offshore catch primarily largemouth bass and striped bass, with some white catfish, bluegill, sunfish, and sturgeon also caught.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;General boating also takes place at Big Break estuary due to its accessibility to the rivers and sloughs of the Inland Coast.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Hiking&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Big Break Regional Trail, which runs along the southern edge of Big Break through the Ironhouse Sanitary District, provides access for hikers, bicyclists, and equestrians to the southeastern edge of the estuary. The trail connects to the northern end of the Marsh Creek Regional Trail, providing access to Brentwood and Oakley. The Marsh Creek Regional Trail connects to the Delta de Anza Regional Trail via West Cypress Road, providing access to Oakley, Brentwood, Antioch, Pittsburg, and Bay Point.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Delta Discovery Experience&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This facility is in the planning phase and will be located in the area of the park accessible from Big Break Road.
