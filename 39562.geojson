The basement extends deep into the bedrock and is said to contain a tunnel used by the underground railroad for smuggling slaves out of the US.\n\nThe tunnel is a bit of a mystery, but one with a tragic history. A young slave, escaping from the US, is said to have drowned when the rising tide flooded the tunnel. The youngest son of Captain Forsythe, who owned the building in the late 1800s, also drowned inside the tunnel. After that, Captain Forsythe bricked up the tunnel entrance.\n\nTo this day, no one has discovered where the opening may be.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298yxydi1x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.914826,42.931727]}},{"properties":{"name":"Buffalo Insane Asylum","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/01/1/buffstate.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 400 Forest Ave., Buffalo, NYSome say in the Richardson building (Buffalo Psychiatric Center) possible ghost or other paranormal events take place.

Many photos taken show orbs, ectoplasm, and actual ghostly apparitions. Property was in operation from 1827-1974 as county home, and stood empty until 1992,when opened as antique and craft mall. 3rd floor of west wing, that housed the nurses, is very very haunted.

The murders, subsequent trial, and following trial by media became a cause célèbre. The fame of the incident has endured in American pop culture and criminology. Although Lizzie Borden was acquitted, she was at the time (and is to an extent today) widely believed to be guilty; no one else was ever arrested or tried, and she has remained notorious in American folklore.

The tunnels were sealed over for safety reasons in 1967.\n\nSeveral apparitions have been reported, including that of a woman standing behind a chair in the waiting room (which is now a studio), and that of a man standing near one of the studio doors before vanishing.\n\nDoors have been known to open and close on their own.

While the well probably came in handy as a source of water for the troops during the many battles that took place at the fort, it best known for its role in the legend of the headless ghost of Ft. Niagara. It seems that during the period when the fort was under French control, two young officers from the fort fell in love with a young indian maiden living in a village near the fort. The rivalry betwee the two eventually eventually led to a sword fight that ended in the death and decapitation of the loser. According to legend, the head was thrown into the river and the body dumped into the well.

How she got there, though, is a matter of some debate:\n# A farm house located on the far side of the tunnel caught fire one night. The family\\'s daughter attemted to flee through the tunnel. Unable to extinguish her flaming clothes and hair, she collapsed, screaming, and died inside the tunnel.\n# A custody battle ended in violence when a a young girl was set ablaze in the tunnel by her father.\n# A young girl was raped inside the tunnel, and her body burned to cover the evidence.\n# A butcher kidnapped a young girl and held her captive inside his home near the tunnel. She escaped one night, but the butcher (wearing a pig\\'s mask) chased her into the tunnel and burned her alive.\n\nGenerally, it is the burning farm house that is believed to be the most accurate tale. The family is said to be buried in Warner Cemetery (on the opposite side of the QEW).\n\nIn the original Dead Zone movie (1983), Christopher Walken take refuge inside the tunnel.\n\nThe sound of a young girl\\'s screams can be heard in the tunnel.\n\nFlames lit in the centre of the tunnel are immediately extinguished, even on the calmest day, while extreme cold spots can be felt nearby.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298ytderop"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.168568,43.141659]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Bonaventure University","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 3261 West State Road, St. Bonaventure, NY 14778<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298yil9ywv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.477936,42.079937]}},{"properties":{"name":"Waverly Hills Sanitarium","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/01/1/apparition1_300x273.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 4400 Paralee Lane, Louisville, KY“Nurse” Apparition<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298ytzv22u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.843821,38.130589]}},{"properties":{"name":"gibby","description":"Posted by Simplethings50shanghai<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298yl8vig6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[121.470001,31.229999]}},{"properties":{"name":"k45377","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/2/749198975.gif\">Vandalia, Ohio<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298ylw6na3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.187479,39.882371]}},{"properties":{"name":"simplethings50","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/2/jackparr52_120_jpg_2_.gif\">Dayton, Ohio<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298yjfukq9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.191667,39.758889]}},{"properties":{"name":"webmaster","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/2/skunk_2_.png\">Dayton, Ohio<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6298ylwopef"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.191667,39.758889]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/560144","metadata":null,"contact_name":"simplethings50","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:simplethings50","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/560144","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":24,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=560144,platial:user=simplethings50","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":39562}
