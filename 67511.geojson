Built in 1668, The Old \\'76 House had a profound effect on the outcome of The Revolutionary War. Through its long use as a meeting place for patriots, The Old \\'76 House established itself as safe ground for Americans when the air was rife with revolution and the tavern itself served as the \"prison\" of the Revolution\\'s most notorious spy, Major John Andre. That is why The Old \\'76 House is often referred to as \"Andre\\'s Prison\", not a real prison, in fact never having been a place of incarceration for anyone before or since. On the contrary, The Old \\'76 House has been a haven for many a weary traveler for more than two hundred years. This great tavern has accommodated on various occasions, every General of the west wing of the Continental Army including Commander-in-Chief General George Washington who, with his chief provisioner Samuel Fraunces, dined in the comfortable atmosphere of The Old \\'76 House.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63odv135kli"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.950677,41.028933]}},{"properties":{"name":"Arnolds Tavern - c1764","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/Picture_16.png\">Arnold´s Tavern once stood on the Western side of the Town green and served as General Washington´s headquarters during the winter encampment of 1777. It was here that Washington issued the proclamation requiring all people in America to swear allegiance to the United States. The tavern is believed to have been built by Samuel Arnold before 1764, and operated for approximately 100 years, until the first floor was converted to retail shops. During the 1880s the building was scheduled for demolition until a horrified Julia Keese Colles purchased and moved it to Mount Kemble Avenue. There it served first as a boarding house and later as All Souls Hospital until the structure burned in 1918.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduxs2h2t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.4804,40.79762]}},{"properties":{"name":"Black Horse Tavern - c1740","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/Picture_19.png\">In 1740 Ebenezer Byram renovated this old farm house into a prominent guest house. In the over 260 years that have followed, the BLACK HORSE TAVERN has catered to the discriminating tastes of its customers. Much of this history is still alive as you can see for yourself each time you enter any of the three magnificent buildings that make up this unique dining landmark.\r\n\r\nA stroll through the BLACK HORSE TAVERN today continues to conjure up images of its illustrious past. The ceiling beams in The Pub were part of the original stable in the late 1700\\'s that was the main stagecoach stop between Newark, New Jersey and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Much of the 18th century artifacts on display come from behind the walls of the Blacksmith Shop. These and other century-old antiques lend tradition and heritage to the warm atmosphere that one experiences even today in both The Pub and The Tavern.\r\n\r\nThanks to the efforts of expert restaurateurs Anthony Knapp and his son, A.J., a graduate of the Cornell School of Hotel and Restaurant Management, and a superb staff of professionals, the tradition of excellence continues. Why, there are days when, if you listen closely, you would swear you hear the stagecoach wheels rolling across the courtyard or the merry laughter of naughty prohibitioners discovering five gallon jugs hidden behind covered trap doors in the floor.Come to the Black Horse Tavern, Pub, &amp; MacKenzie\\'s - share the tradition, and the experience.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63odunn09vo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.60206,40.77645]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blue Anchor Tavern - c1750","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/3_metro2004_0202AB.jpg\">High Street and E Broad Street, Burlington NJ.\r\nSite of the historic Blue Anchor Tavern, established 1750. This famous hostelry was used as a public house where food, drink, lodging and a place to meet and exchange ideas were available to locals, and visitors. During the Revolution, this building served both Colonial and British forces. A stage line ran from the Blue Anchor to points north. The current structure has also served guests of national fame. The Belden House, as it was later known, was a favorite lodging place for stars of the American Stage performing at the Opera House located nearby. Republicans utilized this building as a headquarters during Abraham Lincoln’s presidential political campaign. The bar within is the site of a legendary arm-wrestling match between candidate Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. Also known as The Metropolitan Inn, and Alexander’s Inn.

It began life in 1816 as a simple boarding house for summer visitors to one of America’s earliest seaside resorts. Its owner, Thomas H Hughes, called his new boarding house \"The Big House\". The local people had other ideas, though. Convinced the building was far too large to ever be a success they nicknamed it \"Tommy’s Folly\".\r\nHotel guests and the general public are welcome daily for breakfast, lunch or dinner in the two distinctive dining rooms of the Blue Pig Tavern. The Tavern is tucked in the corner of Congress Hall that fronts on Congress Place and Perry Streets. Its name derives from a gambling parlor sited in Congress Hall in the mid-1800s. Earlier still, in the 1700s, Elias Hughes operated a tavern for whalers on this site. It was the first tavern in Cape May. Each of the two dining rooms in the Blue Pig Tavern provides a different mood. One has an open, airy garden feel, with a large skylight providing dramatic views of the colonnade and Congress Hall’s historic façades. The second room is reminiscent of a cozy tavern, with dark green paneled walls, a large fireplace, natural wood floors, and comfortable banquettes. Both dining rooms serve the Congress Hall restaurant’s signature American fare – nostalgic, simple and fresh – utilizing local seafood and produce in creative, accessible ways.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduuvzwai"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.925463,38.930199]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brownstone Inn","description":"Posted by Chris<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 625 Wyckoff Ave, Wyckoff, NJAlso known as the Van Voorhis-Quackenbush House which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984(#84002578).

It was built in 1719 as an elegant residence for the merchant Stephan Delancey and his family. In 1762, the home was purchased by tavern-keeper Samuel Fraunces, who turned it into one of the most popular taverns of the day. Though it is best known as the site where Washington gave his farewell address to the officers of the Continental Army, in 1783, the tavern also played a significant role in pre-Revolutionary activities.

In 1784, at the French Arms Tavern at King and Second Streets, Congress met to deliberate naming Trenton the capital city of the nation. Trenton served only briefly as the presidential and cabinet seat for John Adams. The French Arms and later the Sign of the Golden Swan were each, for a time, Trenton’s most suitable place for large gatherings. Other popularly frequented institutions included the Rising Sun, the Indian King, the Phoenix Hotel, and the City Hotel, all on King Street (Warren Street). Today, the Trenton House (#59), the American Hotel (#60), and the Sign of the Golden Swan (#55) remain standing. A Federal style building originally built probably as a residence in 1815 served as the Golden Swan Tavern between 1826 and 1855. It then served as newspaper offices of the True American, predecessor to the Trenton Times, and is presently a custom tailor shop. At the corner of North Warren and Hanover Streets, the American Hotel, dating from 1847, has accommodated such luminaries as President James K. Polk and Daniel Webster. One of the country’s most historic hotels, the Trenton House stands across the street. The Tremont House (#7), built in 1847 at the corner of East State and Canal Streets, served travelers on the Camden and Amboy Railroad.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduoimds8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.76643,40.22011]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gladstone Tavern - c1847","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/Picture_17.png\">Gladstone Tavern was originally built as a farmhouse in 1847 by Andrew Rarick. He’d be happy to know that he left his mark, as his signature was discovered on a main supporting beam during our recent renovation. By the turn of the century the farmhouse became a familiar stop on the stagecoach route to Morristown; an addition was added and it opened to the public as the “Gladstone Hotel,” with a tavern on the first floor. Shortly after World War II, the hotel was purchased by the Somerset Hills Elks Club and served as their meeting place for decades. In 1971 the “Willow Tree Inn,” a tavern and rooming house, opened. A few years later the Karner Family opened “The Brass Penny.” They added a new dining room, kitchen, terrace and our beloved antique horse statue crowned “Sir Pennysworth,” that resides on our porch today. Chatfield’s opened in 1989 as a popular bar and restaurant featuring live music until closing on New Year’s Eve, 2002.

Richard Southard bought his grandfather\\'s farm in 1777. The small wooden mill supplied flour, meal and feed to the Continental Army encampment at Jockey Hollow, Morristown during the winter of 1779-80, with the barn used to store its supplies. Hence, where the grain was stored is today\\'s \"Grain House Restaurant\".\r\nIn 1929, William Childs purchased the property and converted the structure to an inn. In 1930, the structure was moved across Route 202 and meticulously restored without touching its solid frame. Remnants of its past are seen today: the William Childs Dining Room was once the machinery room; the Grain Room is the former grain storage area; the Coppertop Pub was the horse stable; and the second floor dining rooms were each a bent in the towering haymow. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduwu3knw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.540116,40.732635]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lambertville House Historic Inn - c1812","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/nsklamb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 32 Bridge St, Lambertville, NJ\"the Lambertville House has provided discriminating travelers with luxurious accommodations and gracious hospitality for almost 200   \r\nyears. \r\n\r\nCaptain John Lambert built the Lambertville House in 1812.

The Landmark dates from 1868 and looks the part. The bar itself was carved in 1839 from a single mahogany tree; the front door is the original speakeasy door. History at the Landmark is dyed into the wood. Legend accounts at least three ghosts on the premises. One is an Irish girl who arrived starving during the Great Hunger, only to die on the third floor of the Landmark when that floor was designated as a flophouse. Another ghostly presence is attributed to a Confederate soldier who was mortally wounded in a bar fight and died in a bathtub on the second floor. In its speakeasy days the Landmark was frequented by George Raft, the gangster/actor who grew up in New York\\'s Hell\\'s Kitchen.

Of the 2400 American bars that existed when McSorley’s first opened its doors, it is the sole survivor. Prohibition? Don’t make me laugh. In a city where laws are treated as suggestions, McSorley’s remained the favorite of politicians and police. The only change in operation during that dark time was to brew the beer in the basement.

When he passed away in 1769, Judge Leonard\\'s elegant town residence became a hostelry, called by its new owner \"College Inn\". The first proprietor was Christopher Beekman, whose natural talent as an Innkeeper soon developed the establishment into the center of the town\\'s life. \r\n\r\n \r\nWine and argument flowed freely in Christopher Beekman\\'s taproom, or drinking room, where his wife helped tend the punchbowls. During these parlous times, students and townsmen drank eagerly of the news and opinions of honored guests such as Paul Revere, Robert Morris, and Thomas Paine, who stayed the night more than once at the hospitable public house.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the Committee of Safety met at College Inn, and a few weeks later, delegates were stopping overnight on their way to the first Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Signers of the Declaration of Independence, passing through Princeton in 1776, rested at College Inn. \r\n\r\nAs the war began, military men took the place of travelers. Officers of the Continental Army, also the British and Hessians (depending upon which side was in possession of the town), whiled away their time in the taproom. Months later the Battle of Yorktown and the signing of the Peace Treaty were properly celebrated over College Inn punchbowls. When the Continental Congress met in Princeton in 1783, the national celebrities of the day were guests of the Inn, which were just a few steps from the historic session in Nassau Hall. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduqby5kv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.660855,40.3495]}},{"properties":{"name":"PJ Clarke's - c1864","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/PJClarkes.jpg\">915 3rd Ave, New York, NY19th-century tavern, P.J.

Not even Prohibition force Pete\\'s to close its doors: it remained open disguised as a flower shop.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduxwp2ik"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.986699,40.736528]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pittstown Grill &amp; Inn - c1760s","description":"Posted by Chris<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/pittstown_06.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 350 Pittstown Rd, Pittstown, NJThe Pittstown Inn, in various incarnations, has been hosting residents and travelers since the 1760\\'s. The Inn was originally called Hoff\\'s Mill, named for an early founder of the area now known as Pittstown. The Lawrence Hoff farm was a large holding, which included the property where the Kingwood Presbyterian Church now stands. Pittstown was known, in fact, as Hofftown in the 1700\\'s. The name was changed during the revolution to honor William Pitt, Earl of Chatham. \r\n\r\nIn those days, the local tavern served as an informal Town Hall and community center. Local taverns like the Hoff\\'s Mill Inn also served as stagecoach stops, mail delivery points, and lodging for travelers.\r\n\r\nThe tavern was reopened in 1800 by Moore Furman. Furman had purchased most of the village prior to the Revolution. He was Deputy Quartermaster General for the Revolutionary Army and used Pittstown as his supply depot. During the war, Pittstown was important in furnishing supplies to General Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Inn was almost completely destroyed in a fire in 1913. Known then as the Century Hotel and owned by L.N. Burnham, the entire contents were destroyed, leaving only the 18\" walls. According to a letter written by Mr. Burnham\\'s daughter, the bartender had left a lantern atop a whiskey barrel in the cellar, which then exploded. The building was gutted but the owners rebuilt the interior, repointed the stone walls, and were back in business in 7 months. Still open and operating today!

The Tavern was the site of many meetings of the “committee of safety” as well as Washington’s Army. It is now roughly the site on which the Pluckemin Inn stands. In fact, General George Washington, our nation’s first President, spent significant time in the village of Pluckemin, New Jersey. On Sunday, January 15, 1777, General Washington was on hand for the burial of Captain William Leslie, son of the Earl of Leven, Scotland.

Built in 1668, The Old \\'76 House had a profound effect on the outcome of The Revolutionary War. Through its long use as a meeting place for patriots, The Old \\'76 House established itself as safe ground for Americans when the air was rife with revolution and the tavern itself served as the \"prison\" of the Revolution\\'s most notorious spy, Major John Andre. That is why The Old \\'76 House is often referred to as \"Andre\\'s Prison\", not a real prison, in fact never having been a place of incarceration for anyone before or since. On the contrary, The Old \\'76 House has been a haven for many a weary traveler for more than two hundred years. This great tavern has accommodated on various occasions, every General of the west wing of the Continental Army including Commander-in-Chief General George Washington who, with his chief provisioner Samuel Fraunces, dined in the comfortable atmosphere of The Old \\'76 House.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduy59dth"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.950677,41.028933]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Village Inn - c1726","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/Village_Inn.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Corner of Main and Water Streets in Englishtown. During the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778, Englishtown was the headquarters for the American Army. The Village Inn  (pictured here),  which was built in 1726, was headquarters for General Charles Lee who commanded the army of nearly 5,000 men. In the dining room of this inn, General Washington and Lord Stirling drew up the court martial papers citing Lee for his conduct during and after the battle. The inn served as a stage-coach stop offering food and lodging to the weary travelers between the cities of New York and Philadelphia. In later years it was renowned for it\\'s excellent cuisine. \r\n\r\nThe night after the battle General Washington and his officers were invited to the home of Moses Laird to partake of a special \"collation\" prepared by his wife and daughters. This house is now the Hulse Memorial Home, Main Street, which was built by Moses Laird as a two room tavern before the revolution.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 one of the Monmouth County\\'s main roads ran from Monmouth Court House, now Freehold, to Englishtown and on into Middlesex County. Because Englishtown was on a main highway it became a trading center for the surrounding country side.

In actuality, Thomas made it back to the Chelsea Hotel and finally expired days later at St. Vincent\\'s Hospital, so it\\'s not unlikely that his last words were considerably less memorable (perhaps the final utterances were complaints about the cut and style of his hospital gown). Nonetheless, Thomas, who frequented the White Horse Tavern when he was in town on poetry-reading tours late in his life, left an enduring mark. Established in 1880, the White Horse is sometimes called the second-oldest bar in New York. It has slick black painted beams and is broken up in to a number of small rooms, like a British pub. In nice weather a hamburger at an outside table along scenic Hudson Street can make for a nice lunch. \r\n\r\n   Drawn to the Dylan Thomas legacy, the White Horse was the place to be for beat poets. Bob Dylan       frequented in the early 1960s, followed by others including John Belushi. Belushi\\'s SNL partner, Dan   Akroyd, is said to have visited the White Horse at closing time after Belushi\\'s death. He had the doors closed and bought the house a round.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63oduq6jzdo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006116,40.735549]}},{"properties":{"name":"Widow White's Tavern c1700s","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/Picture_18.png\">Widow White\\'s Tavern, named after Ebenezer White\\'s wife Mary Brown White, became the centerpiece of Revolutionary War history on that day, because It was on this most unfortunate day for General Lee that General Lee became a prisioner of the British Army, leaving General Washington in a precarious position.

Since that time it has served as a pub, a polling place, a pool room, a package store, a political forum, a speakeasy, a hotel and a restaurant. In 1893 a man named Willie Howard came to Gladstone with Charles Pfizer and served as huntsman for the Essex Hunt. In 1898 Willie and his wife, Bertha, upon Willie’s retirement, purchased the Bedminster Hotel, as it was called, for ,000. The hotel was renamed the \"Howard Hotel\" and in 1912 the first indoor plumbing was installed. The name was later changed to Willie\\'s Tavern....where you can still grab a sandwich and a pint today! It is even noted that one of Pfizer’s favorite horses, named after his daughter, was buried behind the hotel.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63odv1zd6bf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.64506,40.68139]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/23566","metadata":"","contact_name":"veehikle","contact_address":"","source":"platial:veehikle","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/23566","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":27,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":67511}
