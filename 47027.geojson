Although this action hurt the British economy, it also damaged the French economy and was not a decisive factor.\n\nPortugal did not comply with this Continental System and in 1807 Napoleon sought Spain\\'s support for an invasion of Portugal. When Spain refused, Napoleon invaded Spain as well. After mixed results were produced by his generals, Napoleon himself took command and defeated the Spanish army, retook Madrid and then defeated a British army sent to support the Spanish, driving it to the coast and forcing withdrawal from Iberia (in which its commander, Sir John Moore, was killed). Napoleon installed one of his marshals and brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, as the King of Naples, and his brother Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Spain.\n\nA contributing factor to the British loss could have been the fact that it was using more of it\\'s forces to fight the Luddites that to fight Napoleon.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jewxovjcpk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.152344,40.178873]}},{"properties":{"name":"Luddite battle English Military, 1812","description":"Posted by Luddite<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/westhoughton.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Westhoughton mill, , UK It was rumoured at the time that agent provocateurs employed by the magistrates were involved in stirring up the attacks.

A gathering of some two or three hundred men (stockingers, quarrymen and iron workers), led by Jeremiah (\\'Jerry\\') Brandreth, (an unemployed stockinger and suspected Luddite), set out to march to Nottingham. They were lightly armed, with pikes, scythes and a few guns, and had a set of rather unfocussed revolutionary demands, including the wiping out of the National Debt.\n\nOn the way Brandreth shot a farm servant dead, the one casualty of the night. They were met by a force of Hussars and the ring-leaders captured. Thirty five were arraigned for high treason and tried at Derby. Three were executed, and many of the remainder, after pleading guilty, were transported.\n\nThe Government of the day reacted harshly to the event as a harbinger of a wider revolution; it had had extensive prior information from an informer, William Oliver, who may also have been acting for the Home Office as an agent provocateur.\n\nE. P. Thompson in The Making of the English Working Class sees this rising a transitional event between the earlier Luddite actions and the later populist Radicalism of 1818-20 and 1830-32.

P. Thompson\\'s view of Luddism\n\nIn his work on English history, The Making of the English Working Class (1963), E. P. Thompson presented an alternative view of Luddite history.\n\nLuddites are often characterised, and indeed their name has to some become synonymous with, people opposed to all change—in particular technological change such as that which was sweeping through the weaving shops in the industrial heartland of England. They are often characterised as violent, thuggish, and disorganised.\n\nE. P. Thompson advances many arguments against this view of the Luddites. He shows that the Luddites were not opposed to new technology, but rather to the abolition of set prices and therefore also to the introduction of what we would today call the free market.\n\nThompson argues that it was this newly-introduced economic system that the Luddites were protesting. For example, the Luddite song, \"General Ludd\\'s Triumph\":\n\n    The guilty may fear, but no vengeance he aims\n    At the honest man\\'s life or Estate\n    His wrath is entirely confined to wide frames\n    And to those that old prices abate\n\n\"Wide frames\" were the weaving frames, and the old prices were those prices agreed by custom and practice. Thompson cites the many historical accounts of Luddite raids on workshops where some frames were smashed whilst others (whose owners were obeying the old economic practice and not trying to cut prices) were left untouched.\n\nSecondly, Thompson counters the view that the Luddites were thuggish. There were remarkably few Luddite arrests and executions, and yet they operated highly effectively against the forces of the state. Thompson\\'s explanation for this is that they were working with the consent of the local communities (or indeed were part of those communities).\n\nThirdly, Thompson argues that the Luddites were not disorganised. He notes that some of the largest Luddite activities involved a hundred men.\n\nIn short, Thompson feels that in caricaturing the Luddites as \\'thugs\\' who just wanted to smash up new technology we are simply continuing the propaganda of the time. The reality, in Thompson\\'s view, is that the Luddites were normal people who were protesting against changes of which they disapproved.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jewxhgi3ze"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Luddite raids throughout Nottinghamshire 1811","description":"Posted by Luddite<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/EnglandNottinghamshire.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> nottinghamshire, ukNottinghamshire is the county around Nottingham.

The character seems to be based on a local folk tale about someone whose motives were probably quite different (frustration, and not anti-technology zealotry).\n\nThe work by Binfield is particularly useful in placing the Luddite movement in correct historical context - organised action by stockingers had occurred at various times since 1675, and the present action had to be seen in the context of the hardships suffered by the working class during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe movement began in Nottingham in 1811 and spread rapidly throughout England in 1811 and 1812. Many wool and cotton mills were destroyed until the British government harshly suppressed them. The Luddites met at night on the moors surrounding the industrial towns, practising drilling and manoeuvres and often enjoyed local support. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jewxgnj10c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.1493,52.955073]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/228206","metadata":null,"contact_name":"luddite","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:luddite","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/228206","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=228206,platial:user=luddite","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47027}
