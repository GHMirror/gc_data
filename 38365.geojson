Though many bottled water brands come from the same source as public tap water, they are marketed as somehow more pure. Whatâ€™s more - bottled water corporations sell water back to the public at thousands of times the cost. Plastic bottles also require massive amounts of fossil fuels to manufacture and transport. Billions of these bottles wind up in landfills every year. \n\n\nYou can help reverse this trend. At events and over online networks tens of thousands are supporting the efforts of local officials to reduce the social impact and environmental harm of bottled water by prioritizing public water systems. Taking the Think Outside the Bottle Pledge is quick, easy, and sends the message that water is a human right, not a commodity.\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Ann Arbor, MI - Banned spending on bottled water","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\" href=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\">Vonnielim</a>ann arbor, miBanned spending on bottled water<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67v9b0xgyfy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.745833,42.283333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Austin, Tx- Commissioned an audit on spending on bottled water","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\" href=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\">Vonnielim</a>Austin, TXCommissioned an audit on spending on bottled water<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67v9b03h2qi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.742778,30.266944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Berkeley, CA- Took the Think Outside the Bottle pledge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\" href=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\">Vonnielim</a>berkeley, caTook the Think Outside the Bottle pledge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67v9b1e8cft"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.271667,37.871667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blue Mountains, ON - Banned consumption in town buildings","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\" href=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\">Vonnielim</a>blue mountains, onBanned consumption in town buildings<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67v9ax7v7ew"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.456917,44.557518]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boston, MA - Took the Think Outside the Bottle Pledge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\" href=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\">Vonnielim</a>boston, maTook the Think Outside the Bottle Pledge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67v9av43anm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.060278,42.358333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brainerd, MN - Took the Think Outside the Bottle Pledge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\" href=\"http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle\">Vonnielim</a>brainerd, mnTook the Think Outside the Bottle Pledge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67v9b89jdp8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.200556,46.358056]}},{"properties":{"name":"Burbank, CA  The city's new bottled water policy calls for city employees to use tap water during official meetings and city hall proceedings.
