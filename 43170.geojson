It\\'s a small deli with a row of stools for dining in. Most folks ordered out for take-away at lunchtime. As for myself, I loved eating there and working on postcards.\n\nI\\'m grateful folks at Johin would let me special order items that are not part of their lunch specials: coconut soup and rice. The soup was so rich and the rice sopped it up nicely. At times, I would add some sushi to my lunch orders. But most of the time, I would get full on the soup and rice. \n\nWhen I couldn\\'t finish lunch, I would heated up the soup and rice separately at home. For breakfast, I would then dump both into one bowl. It\\'s a tasty breakfast for a gal like me who doesn\\'t have much of a sweet tooth in the morning.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69k9nf7zx6e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.11281,51.521143]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Terrasse","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/terrase.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2, pl Ecole Militaire, 75007 Paris, FranceThe first dinner for global journalism students was at La Terrasse on Sunday night.
