Walking through the building, you would think that it was fall break because no one is to be seen or heard.  All of the doors are closed and no lights are on.  There is only one reason for this in January.  It was time for Grey’s Anatomy.\r\n\tAt this time every Thursday, one can find 10 or more girls up on the third floor lounge all sitting around the TV just waiting to see what is going to happen next.  Last weeks episode was “to be continued” so there was more anticipation in the air than normal.  There were 3 people on the couch, 2 people on the big soft chairs, which would fit 2 if you wanted to share, there were 2 more people on the chairs that were supposed to be around the table, and there were 3 people on the floor.\r\n\tEverything was the same, the lounge smelled like burnt popcorn because someone burnt their popcorn 5 minutes before we got there.  All of the blinds were open because no one wanted to shut them.  Everyone was talking about last week’s episode, trying to catch people up who did not see it.  It was 7:58, a few of the girls left to go to the bathroom before the show started because when it was on, you did not go anywhere.\r\n\tThe show started at exactly 8:00, the whole room was silent.  No one moved or made a sound.  We were all watching the show with anticipation of what was going to happen with George’s dad, or if Addison and Kerev were going to kiss.  Then a commercial came on.  Ever one liked the commercials because that is when you were able to talk.  Everyone was talking at the same time, we could have been heard on the second floor, but we did not care.  Even though everyone was talking, we were all paying attention to each other and we were able to differentiate between each other’s voices.  \r\n\tWhen the show started again, everyone stopped talking and started watching.  It came to the part that George’s dad died, there were sniffles and even though no one would admit it, there were even tears.  It was sad, every one could feel the pain that George was going through.  That is how the episode ended.  We all sat around for a minute or two to regain ourselves, then got up and went back to our rooms.  We will all get together next Thursday and do the same thing.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uxv0jv5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04247,41.4658]}},{"properties":{"name":"Airport","description":"Posted by Bambi1185Chicago, ILIt was Sunday March 6, 2007 and Sarah Adam was getting ready to go with her mom and dad to Puerto Vallarta for my spring break.  Sarah is an ordinary twenty-two year old college student, who loves to travel.  Sarah has been to Europe a few times, and has even spent a whole semester abroad, but this trip would be different for her, it would be her last Spring Break trip.  Ok, let’s not think about that right now,” she say to me when talking about her trip.  She knew it was going to be a lot of fun because she have been on many different trips with her family, but this one was going to be different too, because the youngest brother, Luke, could not go.  He was in school, and could not miss his classes, even though he wanted too, and his family wanted him to also.  Anyways, they, Sarah and her mom and dad, were all super excited to go to a place where it is warm all day and night, and were very happy to be leaving a place where the sun didn’t shine for over a month, Lombard, Illinois.  It was in the pretty early in the morning when the Adam family arrived at O-Hare airport in Chicago.  It was crowded as usual.  People were traveling everywhere, and everyone was in such a hurry to get there, even if they didn’t want to go to where ever they were destined for.  There were families saying goodbye and crying, then there where businessmen traveling by themselves.  You could always tell the businessmen from the other people, because they were all in nice suits and walked with a fast pace with their heads down toward the ground.  They were also the men traveling alone and only had one piece of luggage.  The flight was at 1:30 in the afternoon, so Sarah and her family arrived early, around noon so they could check their bags and get through security without missing the flight. It took a little while to get through airport security, maybe a half an hour to forty-five minutes, but there were no problems, Sarah was not sure though because she lost track of time somewhere between home and the airport. They rushed to the gate where the plane was got on and left.  After a few hours, direct flight and some really good conversations about life, school and politics with her parents, along with some reading of the Di Vinci Code, and listening to her favorite different kinds of music, they finally landed in Mexico.  Sarah knew she were in Mexico when she saw the beautiful ocean and beaches.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2v2acik2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.65,41.85]}},{"properties":{"name":"Another Sleepless Night","description":"Posted by Bambi1185\tMany thoughts are going through my head.  I cannot hold still.  I am nervous, worried, and just plain frustrated.  Nothing could get me to relax.  I baked cookies, I cleaned my room, which didn’t really need cleaning, and I also tried reading one of my favorite books, but nothing helped.  My mom used to call what I did “keeping my hands busy so I wouldn’t get into any trouble.”  I just really wanted to be home, out of Scheele.  It was 2 in the morning and people were running up and down the hallways screaming and talking very loudly.  I just wanted to be alone, but at the same time I wanted somewhere there with me.  I was all alone in my room.  The TV was on and some Christmas lights that me and my roommate have put up just for fun.  My room smelled like cookies and honeysuckle, that’s the scent of our air freshener.  It was comforting, but nothing could take my mind off of what was happening.  I had the place all to myself, except for some other people on my floor that came back around 2:30 after being out at a bar.  They made the halls smell like smoke so I was very glad that I was in my room with the cookie smell.  Then it got quiet.  No noise, no nothing, just me any my thoughts.  I tried listening to music and dancing, I mean no one cared because my roommate was not there, and I wasn’t being loud.  I’m getting very tired now; it is 3 in the morning.  Everyone was asleep, except me.  I opened my curtains to look out side.  Nothing, just the twinkling of the snow on the ground that just fell today.  It was so beautiful with the light from the moon shining down on it, and the passing of random cars.  A few more hours went by and I finally fell asleep.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uy22tye"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04268,41.46556]}},{"properties":{"name":"Downtown","description":"Posted by Bambi1185The town of Puerto Vallarta was much different then the strip where the resorts and hotels where at.  There were so many different types of people there, any where from upper, which the people wore very nice clothes, to very lower classes, these people were begging for food and money, because most people that lived in the area where rich or poor, very few in between.  There were many different types of stores and buildings all around, some authentic, but most were there to cater to the tourists.  Most of the buildings were beautiful, like this one that looked like it could have been one of the oldest in town, but it just had that feel to it that made me think of other countries that Sarah had been too.  They were brightly colored, and brick, and they had flowers all around them, she was not sure what kind of flowers though, but they were yellow and red and white mainly, well most of the buildings did.  It was actually kind of a dirty place, there were cars, and taxies and buses everywhere Sarah looked, “I was kind of appalled by this site of all the trash and just garbage everywhere,” Sarah told me.  It was also a very crowded city with very few tourists because no one really left their all-inclusive hotel or the beach, because they had everything that they needed there, and just were to lazy to actually see what authentic Mexico was.\r\nAll around town there were these little flea market type of shops where you did not pay full price for anything.  The secret, so she learned the hard way, was to ask how much something was, then say that you only have a certain amount of money to pay for it, Sarah was not very good at doing this, but her mom was awesome, and got everything for a cheap price, so she only shopped there a few time, most of the time she stayed with the Wal-Mart and Targets that were both located just up the road from the hotels.  The good thing about being here was that you did not need to know Spanish, although someone should know a little so they do not get ripped off at one of the shops, and pay four times as much for something that you could buy at Wal-Mart.  When Sarah first entered downtown Puerto Vallarta she was expecting a lot of American culture, but they actually did a very good job mixing the American and Mexican culture and not letting just one dominate, like over in England. Here, they made an effort to kept most of the feel of Mexico, but everyone knew English.  She did learn something very fascinating about the area where she was staying, if someone knew English they would get paid more, and they would almost be guaranteed a job.  “So if nothing works out for me in the USA then I could always go to Mexico and find a job, just kidding,” Sarah said, just playing around.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uxkmfzd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.25005,20.618]}},{"properties":{"name":"Espressyourself","description":"Posted by Bambi1185There is a little hole in the wall coffee shop named EspressYourself.  It is not a very big place, but it serves the best coffee, and smoothies, if you want to pay for it.  When you first walk into the place, you smell all different kinds of coffee, and it makes your mouth water, even if you do not like coffee.  There are a few tables along the back wall with a couch with two very comfortable chairs that surround a fire place that is always going.  There is also jazz music in the background, but not too loud, just loud enough to hear it, but to where you are still able to get work done or have a conversation with having to yell.  The place is very welcoming, that is why I spend 5 hours there every Sunday doing homework with my friends.  I get more work done there then I do anywhere else.  I just at the same table every time, the second one to the front, and I watch people.  Many different kinds of people come into the place.  Some stay and some are in a hurry, but I can never figure out why they come in, get coffee, and just leave.  This is a type of place where you want to stay.  Also, I was surprised to see younger kids there, like high school aged kids.  They were just sitting on the couches and talking, and eventually they fell asleep, but no one seemed to notice, and if they did, no one cared.  They slept all day and did not even order any food or drink.  I thought that was weird.  But I guess that is just how relaxed this little hole in the wall coffee shop is.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uuh7m5c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0615,41.46804]}},{"properties":{"name":"Going Back Home","description":"Posted by Bambi1185Going back home was kind of sad.  Sarah really did not want to leave Mexico, but she did not want to stay there either.  She missed her friends at school and she missed her things at the house, but she did not want to go back.  Going back meant only having a few more weeks of school with her friends, then Sarah will be graduating never to see a lot of the people that are so called friends.  “It was bittersweet,” she told me with tears in her eyes.  Sarah and her family packed their things, and headed for the airport.  Security was not as bad here; so it did not take them long to get through to the plane.  They got on the plane in the morning.  She wrote in a journal most of the way back home, slept part of it, and talked to her family telling stories of this vacation compared to ones from the past.  It was a good time to reflect, and a good time to relax.  After a vacation where all you did was relaxed, sometimes you need a vacation from your vacation; this was the plane ride for me.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2v06pg8o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.71484,41.64008]}},{"properties":{"name":"Interview","description":"Posted by Bambi1185“This school is very German and Lutheran.” Ellen said when I asked her what she thought about this school, Valparaiso University.  Ellen is a typical freshman who likes to go out and have fun, but she also knows when it is time to study.  It took her a few months to actually get used to all of the people here, because they were all so Lutheran and German as well. It also took her awhile to get used to the buildings on campus also, but she actually likes campus now.  The biggest thing that she did not like was the bells that go off every fifteen minutes.  The bells that I am talking about are the ones that are between the Chapel and the library.  They ring every 15 minutes to let us, the students, know what time it is.  They are the highest structure on campus, and they can be heard no matter when you are on campus.  Also, hopefully you are not walking under them when they go off or you will become deaf, not really.  \nIronically though, one of her favorite places on campus is in the library.  Not just any place in the library though.  She goes to the top floor and sits on a couch that looks out over the sidewalk between the Chapel and the library.  From this spot, she also sees the bells.  When she hears or sees the bells now, she does not mind them, she actually kind of likes them.  I guess she can thank the spot in the library for helping her see the beauty of the bells.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uzoaal0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.00897,41.45611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Miller Hall...AkA The Nut House","description":"Posted by Bambi1185At 8:00 in the morning, Miller Hall can feel really creepy, I thought to myself as I was walking through the building to drop off something.  No one was there, or at least that is what it felt like. When I walked into the building the first thing that I saw was that there were no lights on downstairs, and that is where I had to go. I never thought about it before, but when I was walking down the semi-long hall way to get to the room that I needed to be, I felt like someone was going to jump up to one of the little windows on the doors and scream to have me let them out.  I felt like I was at a crazy house, an insane asylum, or something.  The building needed to be a part of some sort of horror movie when someone patient that died there many years ago and still locked in their room, runs up to those little windows, that are no bigger then a 6 inch by 6 inch square just high enough to see what is going on in the room, and yells and taps on them. It was a really scary site, and come to think of it, all the walls in the building are white, and it is located really close to the hospital. Maybe there is something that someone did not tell us about Miller Hall, or maybe it\\'s just me letting my imagination get the better of me.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2v2lhhw9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04736,41.46675]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina","description":"Posted by Bambi1185New Orleans is a very amusing and enjoyable place with a lot of drinking and smoking.  Mardi Gras is a chance for people to go out and dress up in different costumes.  A lot of men dress up as women and women put on wigs and provocative dresses.  This is a time for a carefree life when no one cares what you do.  There are street parades and food everywhere.  There is also a drink and cigarette in everyone’s hand.  There are a lot of purples, blues, and yellows through the city of New Orleans.  Well, this was until Hurricane Katrina hit.  After Katrina hit, New Orleans became a place where mold and government protest were seen all along the streets.  Now, Mardi Gras is still fun, but people are trying to make a more political message out of it.  Instead of men and women wearing beautiful dresses, they wear dresses that look like they have been in water and have mold on them.  Also, the costumes are made up of FEMA tarps and people are “insurance agents from hell.”  There are even people with signs that say how bad President Bush is and how the government sucks.  There is still a lot of drinking and fun, but it will never be the same again.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uv4mqd7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04021,41.464]}},{"properties":{"name":"Night","description":"Posted by Bambi1185Standing in the dark, all alone.  Not a sound to be heard.  It was the perfect night just to stand there.  There were tons of stars in the sky and the moon was bright.  The snow looked like glitter on the ground, sparkling like one million diamonds on the ground.  I walked around the campus, on ever sidewalk that I walk everyday, but it just felt different.  Nothing was wrong; it was perfect.  I walked a little more, getting lost with every step.  I had no clue what time it was and I really did not care for the first time in a long time.  I see a rabbit just standing there also, but why was he just standing?  Did he have no place to go?  Was he scared of me?  I like to think that he was just enjoying the beautiful night.  The temperature was 4 degrees, but that did not matter because I did not even realize it.  I was in a trance, which was brought about by the feeling of relief, relief from the hard day of school and work, and the relief that everything will be okay in the end.  I just keep walking letting all of my worries and fears leave me.  I did not want to leave the peacefulness outside, but I was getting cold, so I had to start walking back.  I was pretty far away from Scheele, so I still was able to keep the moment.  When I got back, all of the stress and anxiety of school, homework, and work came right back.  Oh well, at least for the hour that I was walking in the night, all was good.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uvtb5sl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0409,41.46344]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nuevo Vallarta","description":"Posted by Bambi1185Puerto VallartaSarah arrived in a town called Nuevo Vallarta, which happens to be in another state then Puerto Vallarta.  I found this bit of information to be very interesting, because traveling to Puerto Vallarta meant leaving the state; it was kind of like going from Valparaiso to Chicago, but in a different country.  When she arrived she was surprised to see all of the different kinds of people there, because Sarah have been to Mexico before, but a different part of Mexico.  Sarah thought that there would be a lot of upper class people, rich and stuck up, but she thinks there were actually more people from the middle class and lower middle class then anyone else.  It was not hard to tell who was from what class, she said.  The upper class people had money and you could tell by their clothes (if they were wearing name brand or not) to how they acted towards other people there.  And the middle to lower classes were loud and just really excited to be there, because most of them probably never have been there before.  Sarah was talking to her dad about that and he also thought it was weird, but then he explained that it doesn’t cost a lot to stay in Mexico, therefore more people will travel to Mexico then to any other part of the world because they don’t have to worry about the cost.  There were also a lot of Canadians there too, but the only way that Sarah knew this was because she over heard one talking about being from Canada when someone asked where they were from, when they were heading toward the hotel.  I guess the people that travel to that specific place are people from the states and Canadians, or at least that is what I gathered from the pictures that Sarah showed me of her “Canadian friends.”  When they picked up their luggage, Sarah and her family went to go to the hotel they would be staying at all week.  All of the hotels and resorts were on a strip called “hotel row.”  It was a very secure road were a few guys stood at the entrance and made sure that everyone who went down there either worked at one of the resorts or was staying at one of them, if not then no one even thought about going down there.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uyj5umt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.25,20.616667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pipis","description":"Posted by Bambi1185The only restaurant that Sarah and her family went to was named Pipis.  Pipis was located in Puerto Vallarta, and is very americanized; she really thinks that she could have gotten more authentic food from here (the USA) then at this restaurant.  The menu had things on it like Chilis would or TGI Fidays.  That means tacos, burritos, and even hamburgers.  It was a brightly colored place with a lot of reds, yellows, and purples with posters on the walls that were in Spanish and of course the television programs that they had on were in Spanish.  The only thing that was not Spanish was the food that they were serving.  Everyone who worked there knew English, and all of them knew how to entertain.  Sarah felt like she was at El Salto on  margarita night.  She was rather appalled by this, because she wanted authentic Mexican food, and not something that she could have gotten anywhere else.  Sarah, her mom, and dad all ordered hamburgers, this is what this restaurant was famous for; so they thought they would be worth trying.  The food was not that good, and they were disappointed in their choice of restaurant.  The only good thing was that the service was fast, and the people were nice.  This was the only restaurant that they went too, because our hotel was all-inclusive, so after eating at Pipis they decided that they did not need to eat anywhere but at the hotel, they had better food anyway.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2usnxclr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.24962,20.61804]}},{"properties":{"name":"Riu Vallarta","description":"Posted by Bambi1185The hotel that Sarah and her family stayed in was brand new.  It was built within the last four months, and the palm trees were not even open yet.  The building even smelled new still.  It was a beautiful building with six floors, four different restaurants, a buffet, and two pools; that were both very big. They started out on the fifth floor, but then got moved down to the third floor.  She was unsure why they got moved around, but the rooms on the third floor where better anyway.  The room was very beach like.  In other words, big open rooms with tile in the bathroom and the kitchen, then carpet in every other room.  There was also a full kitchen and bathroom.  Also, included in every room, there was a refrigerator that was full of food and drinks, and everything was free, and the maids would switch them every two days.  There was also two chairs on the balcony and a little table, which Sarah started calling her table, because that is where she would sit when her mom and dad where outside also. The resort was located right on the beach, so when Sarah opened the window she was staring right at the Pacific Ocean and smelling the salt water as well.  Anyway, the beach that the hotel was located on was a walking beach, which means, you could walk down the whole beach and not get stopped by gates or anything else that would indicate that you were in another hotel’s beach, so Sarah and her family, along with the rest of the guests, had the whole strip of beach to explore and enjoy.  When walking on the beach, however, Sarah encountered many different vendors spread out trying to cover most of the beach.  These vendors where there just for the purpose of selling things to tourist, but it was mostly junk they were selling, you could get most of it at Wal-Mart for way cheaper.  The one thing that Sarah loved that vendors were selling was candy.  This candy was not in bags, but was just sitting out waiting for someone to come up and buy it by the handful, and not by an actual weight.\r\nThe front of the hotel was just as pretty as the back.  There were plants and flowers everywhere; it was some of the most beautiful landscaping Sarah had ever seen.  Also, there were mountains as far as the eye could see, I don’t really remember which mountain they were that she told me, but Sarah said, and “they were really a site to see.”  The air smelled like salt and in some places even fire, but soon Sarah found out the reason why.  Where they were doing construction, they would burn down the shrubs and grasses where the new building would soon be.  There was so much construction everywhere, it reminded her of being back on campus, but it never took away from the site of the ocean and the mountains.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uw66oie"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2507,20.61732]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Canopy","description":"Posted by Bambi1185One of the tours that Sarah and her family went on, with the hotel or course, was a view from the canopy; at least that is what she called it.  It was only a twenty-minute drive from the hotel to this place.  What happened when they got there, you would go up on these cables, get hocked on with your feet dangling and then go more of less “fly” over the jungle area.  It was really a great experience.  “I felt like I was flying, at first I was scared, because I say that people could get going to 50 miles an hour down, but then I realized that it was totally safe and I just need to enjoy the view from the top,” said Sarah when she was showing me pictures of her mom and dad “flying.”  The jungle was so beautiful with every green that you can think of, and many different colored flowers as well, at least that is what I saw in the pictures.  There were so many different kinds of trees and plants that she had never seen before; of course there were the usual palm trees and pine trees, you can never seem to get far enough way from pine trees.  “ It was a once in a lifetime experience that I would defiantly do again if I had the chance,” said Sarah.  The cool thing that she learned from this was that the jungle that she was over was the same place where Predator 2 was filmed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2uufx5iy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.24932,20.61788]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Math Class from Hell","description":"Posted by Bambi1185Sitting in math class looking around, I see the same expression on everyone’s face, the look of distress.

The first thing that happens when entering the building, you will get a history lesson of how this one family makes tequila, it is how most people make tequila, but this one is special, she just could not remember why though.  Then you will get a very brief tour of the place, then the best part, you get to taste the finished product.  Sarah is not a fan of tequila but she tried some anyway.  “It was good, well for as good as tequila can get,” she said while crinkling up her nose.  There were only about twenty-five people in the store, and that is counting Sarah and her family, and if she had to guess Sarah would say they were all from either the USA or Canada, because of they were all dressed as if they were on vacation there, flip flops, tank tops, and sun burns, and no one had an accent from another part of the world.  When walking around the place, Sarah noticed that there were only three or four guys running the whole place, she found this to be weird because in the US there is always more people then are needed working at one place at a time.  These guys were talking to the people trying to get them to buy everything, a few people bought things, but she did not buy anything because everything was free at the hotel.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2utt0yjl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.24958,20.61828]}},{"properties":{"name":"Visit Downtown Valpo!","description":"Posted by Bambi1185Valparaiso, IndianaWhen traveling through Northwest Indiana, make sure to stop and visit the little town of Valparaiso.  Valparaiso is a not a small town, but it is not a big city either, some would say that it is just right.  There are many different things to do in Valparaiso, downtown and otherwise.  When first entering Valparaiso, you come upon Valparaiso University. The campus is very old, and classic campus, with trees and flowers everywhere to be seen. So, stop by and get some coffee at the library or stop by the book store for something to remember your trip by. Then, as you head into downtown Valpo, the first thing you will see is that everything is centered around the court house. There is one main road and many different side streets that also have many different kinds of shops on them. Valpo has almost every shop that you can think of, from banks to coffee shops, and jewelry stores to place to by new and used clothing. It is a wonderful place to go and spend the day.  Also, there is one building when you enter the downtown area that has a big and beautiful mural painted on the wall. The painting shows the many different kinds of people that live in the town, along with the different things the city is known for, like the college.  There are many different kinds of people to see also. These people range from business men in nice, expensive suits to poor college students, but if you ever need help find a place, just ask someone and they are sure to tell you where to go, if they know.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2v3bmth2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05418,41.46976]}},{"properties":{"name":"Walkin around campus","description":"Posted by Bambi1185It was eight o’clock at night, and I just finished working out with my friend.  We decided that the weather was too nice to just sit inside, so we decided to go walking around campus.  Taking walks around campus was my favorite thing to do my freshman year and most of my sophomore year too, but not now.  I have not actually been walking around campus in almost a year, and I could not remember the real reason why.  I thought it was because of all the construction, and most of the reason is, but not the whole reason.  The reason why is not clear, but once I stated walking nothing else mattered.  Of course, right as soon as I stepped out of my dorm, the first thing I saw was all of the fences.  They are EVERYWHERE!!! There is no place to walk any more, but my friend proved me wrong.  She took me to her favorite part of campus, and I know see why.  It is the only place where there is no construction!  The grass is green; there were flowers, and even trees!  It was so beautiful.  “Why haven’t I been there before?” I asked myself.  I could not come up with the answer.  I have been around that part of campus so many times, but I never realized how pretty it was.  I guess it takes something ugly (like construction) to make someone realize the beauty in something else.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g2v359lsg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04146,41.46286]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237304","metadata":null,"contact_name":"bambi1185","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:bambi1185","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237304","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":18,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237304,platial:user=bambi1185","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41767}
