Imagine my surprise when, having been distractedly waiting for the bus and counting to be sure I had all my packages, I looked across the street and suddenly came head-on with a different sort of package, this one belonging to an extremely large young man in tightie whiteys! There\\'s an even more suggestive vision of a young man in his stinkies a bit further down at Market and Van Ness but my heart palpitations were such that I was unable to focus on photography. To get the full-on impact, you really must see these ads at night when they\\'re backlit to reveal the soft young manflesh in all its glory.\n\nPity an avid admirer was blocking my view. I believe the ad was for Abercrombie and Fitch, but it could have been for CK. And really, who cares? The army of brightly lit hard-bodied young men aren\\'t really selling underwear, now are they? At any rate, I am simply glad to see that Bebe\\'s campaign featuring sexy pouting anorexic five-year olds covered in sparkles seems to have ended. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wbsymcicz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40778,37.784314]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafe La Boheme","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/platialmission2006_012.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 3318 24th Street, San Francisco CAKak.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wbss48wqh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.418882,37.752241]}},{"properties":{"name":"DANGEROUS INTERSECTION!","description":"Posted by Wendolyne<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/spank.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> This is where I saw a clueless cell-phone-talking driver hit a man on a bike who had his child in a little rumble  seat behind him!

(AP) --\n\nTwo middle school teachers resigned after students saw them having sex in a classroom, the school district said.\n\nFrances J. Sepulveda, 30, and Bryant J. Wilburn, 29, said they had sex in the classroom during school hours on \"one or two occasions,\" according to an investigation by the Hillsborough County school district.\n\nThey resigned last month after two students at Coleman Middle School reported they saw the teachers having sex. The classroom door was locked and a window was covered with paper, but a boy and a girl told school officials they could see inside.\n\n\"These teachers showed appallingly bad judgment,\" school district spokesman Steve Hegarty said Wednesday. \"We dealt with it quickly, and the teachers are no longer welcome in the Hillsborough County classroom.\"\n\nState officials will determine if the teachers will be allowed to work in other schools.\n\nBoth teachers have unlisted phone numbers and could not be reached for comment Thursday. Wilburn told the St. Petersburg Times he was embarrassed by the incident.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wbt2dc1vz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.458611,27.947222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lowe's: If you can't say anything nice...shop elsewhere!","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/4/easteriscanceled_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/4/easteriscanceled_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/4/easteriscanceled_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/4/easteriscanceled.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/4/easteriscanceled_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 1340 El Camino Real, San Bruno, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wbt14dce0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.422799,37.639438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lucky Cafe","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.allguinness.com\" href=\"http://www.allguinness.com\">Gpwieland</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1111 21st St, Sacramento, CAThis used to be a pretty good spot , but the last coupld of times I have been there the service has been really terrible.  like forty-five minutes just to take the order.

There was a cute gentle occasionally barking dog that got muzzled my her owner during our tenure there, the dog could tell we had pity for her, so she stretched her leash over the sidewalk and lay in the sun close enough to our table that the kids could reach down and pet her.\n\nThe coffee was amazingly disappointing, i think they don\\'t do brewed coffee, so they made us 2 way-too-watery americanos.  bummer.\n\nThe place seemed cool, murals everywhere, and we walked in during a very energetic birthday song being performed by the entire staff (including apron donned cooks).  \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wbt3zfbes"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.412637,37.758951]}},{"properties":{"name":"Naughty Customers Expect to be Seated at Empty Tables!","description":"Posted by Wendolyne<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/coditacast.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 399 Grove Street, San Francisco, CA, 94102We arrived between breakfast and lunch. The stoic host resolutely refused to allow us to be seated until each and every table was emptied from breakfast and set for lunch. He cared not a whit that I was feeling faint, nor did he shed a tear that the opera rehearsal would begin soon. He begrudgingly suggested waiting at the bar where the only possibly available seating was laden with coats of those perched on nearby stools. I guess I could have dealt with all o\\'dat, but the last straw was when we were finally seated (much to the poor host\\'s chagrin, I imagine) and the waitress asked if we\\'d like bottled water or if tap water would be sufficient. I really hate how snooty restaurants present this choice by intimating that if you\\'re a cheap bastard who doesn\\'t care about your health, well then, by all means--go with the tap water. \n\nSure, say I\\'m being too harsh, but when kindly asked if we could just simply have a seat at a table and hold off on ordering until they were ready for lunch, the host maintained that we\\'d simply have to wait. So we stood and waited like good citizens.\n\nHad I not had an opera engagement and been in need of nourishment beforehand, I\\'d have marched out, but as it was with being rushed, feeling faint, and waiting for a friend I was caught like a rat in a trap.\n\nAs it is, Citizen Cake is banished from my kingdom. \n\nI will admit to enjoying the marshmallow in my mocha, but no more than that. Fancy treats aren\\'t worth putting up with rude hosts, and there are far too many delicacies beckoning from elsewhere for my attentions. \n\nDisclaimer: A delightful old comrade of mine once worked here and maybe still does.
