This product will aid in the visualization of an NHC official track forecast, the forecast points are connected by black line segments. The track line(s) are not a forecast product, however, and because there are an infinite number of ways to connect a set of forecast points, the lines should not be interpreted as representing a specific forecast for the location of a tropical cyclone in between official forecast points. It is also important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, and that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the center.The NHC official track forecast in shapefile format is intended to aid in the visualization of an NHC official track forecast. \n\nUploaded into Geocommons as shp, dbf, and shx files.
