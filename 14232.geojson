Of course it's held on Monday nights. Sign up starts at 5:30 sharp and the show is run by Barbara Cloyd. The list is filled lottery-style. It's not as cutthroat as open mic at the Sidewalk, but make no mistake, Nashville songwriters are serious business. A great place for prospective players and Folk fans alike.","street":"4104 Hillsboro Pike","phone":"(615) 383-1461","longitude":-86.817411,"id":"a64ddl9vn1vd","state":"TN"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.817411,36.101983]}},{"properties":{"openmicvenue":"Club Passim - Cambridge, MA","city":"Cambridge","zip":2138.0,"latitude":42.373901,"description":"Club Passim is one of the top Folk clubs in the country, if not simply one of the most pleasant.

If you're on tour, you should call a couple of weeks ahead and let them know you want to sign up for open mic. The winner gets to participate in a \"shootout\" which takes place every month. They'll record your set for $10. The competitive element means the players are generally fantastic. It's an outstanding show for spectators.

It's been a few years since I was there, but it was certainly memorable. It's a non-profit space, and you can choose between paying the $2 cover or bringing canned food to donate to charity.","street":"1702 E Glendale Ave","phone":"(602) 997-9795","longitude":-112.045219,"id":"a64ddl576io1","state":"AZ"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.045219,33.538351]}},{"properties":{"openmicvenue":"Hopvine Pub - Seattle, WA","city":"Seattle","zip":98102.0,"latitude":47.623404,"description":"It's not one of the most popular open mics in the country, but it's still one of my favorites. Wednesday night open mic is one of the only outlets for Seattle's underappreciated Folk scene, which, believe it or not, is thriving. The players that make it out for open mic at Hopvine include downhome Bluegrassers and frat boy rockers. A really bad player is extremely rare.

Open mic is preceeded by a songwriter's showcase featuring an artist hand-picked by my favorite open mic host, Mike Meldrum. Mike's been running this show for a long time, and he's got it down to a science. The open mic starts at 9, and the list is first come, first served. Performers range from old local Folk and blues guys to college kids and the occasional poet.
