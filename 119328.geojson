over three years since a business operated at 728 Prospect. The address most recently was home to The Waterhouse, but before that it housed Phil the Fire and Diamondback Brewery. If all goes as planned, the new tenant will be up and running by the time the Cavaliers host their home opener in late October. Described by its owner as a high-energy American saloon, RJ Boland’s will combine a sports bar design with upscale pub grub. Partner and executive chef Doug Fulton, opening chef of McCormick &amp; Schmick’s, says guests can expect familiar but high-quality food dished up in a casual environment. Minor cosmetic changes will be made to the space, including dark-wood accents and the addition of numerous flat-screen TVs. If the proposed “American saloon” décor sounds a bit like BlackFinn Saloon, a 10-shop chain destined for Cleveland, it is no coincidence. Boland’s owner Rossi Penney is a former operating partner with that organization. Down the road, locals can look forward to Martini Suite, an ultra lounge-style club with bottle service to be opened upstairs.","id":"a68b3d1prx0k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.693253,41.499851]}},{"properties":{"name":"dean supply","description":"","id":"a68b3d0ebh9m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.66526,41.490868]}},{"properties":{"name":"whole foods in cleveland, oh","description":"","id":"a68b3d691cpi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.537354,41.50145]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dominic&amp;#39;s Santos Italian Restaurant","description":"","id":"a68b3d7oi3nh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.858231,41.44334]}},{"properties":{"name":"Das Schnitzel Haus","description":"","id":"a68b3d2tu9oh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.742378,41.406555]}},{"properties":{"name":"Melt (east)","description":"","id":"a68b3d46hexh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.55619,41.501492]}},{"properties":{"name":"willow coffee house in cleveland","description":"","id":"a68b3d2m3p5d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.768379,41.476925]}},{"properties":{"name":"jimmy buff%27s in new jersey","description":"","id":"a68b3cwt03hb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.34687,40.820744]}},{"properties":{"name":"top dog in cos cob, ct","description":"","id":"a68b3cz5e1b1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.590843,41.042252]}},{"properties":{"name":"tommy%27s italian sausage in elizabeth, nj","description":"","id":"a68b3cw3hs3l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.205338,40.65921]}},{"properties":{"name":"syd%27s in union, nj","description":"","id":"a68b3cvw1dbu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.288879,40.720379]}},{"properties":{"name":"katz%27s in new york","description":"","id":"a68b3d6rm5cg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.987343,40.722645]}},{"properties":{"name":"little chef pastry shop","description":"","id":"a68b3davuu41"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.658585,40.350327]}},{"properties":{"name":"porchetta in new york","description":"","id":"a68b3d5g506b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.984711,40.726379]}},{"properties":{"name":"zuzu ramen in new york","description":"","id":"a68b3d7mfvjv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.982124,40.678558]}},{"properties":{"name":"Num Pang","description":"","id":"a68b3db6xuip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.993164,40.73407]}},{"properties":{"name":"locanda verde","description":"Andrew Carmellini","id":"a68b3d7dls6a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.010246,40.719685]}},{"properties":{"name":"acme fish in new york","description":"","id":"a68b3cxd7p3s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.956314,40.724682]}},{"properties":{"name":"bark hot dogs in new york","description":"","id":"a68b3czuoj6n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.975601,40.68084]}},{"properties":{"name":"hostel","description":"","id":"a68b3d38zpf6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.966965,40.799332]}},{"properties":{"name":"franny%27s in new york","description":"","id":"a68b3d5og0ql"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.973724,40.678925]}},{"properties":{"name":"lincoln park, chicago","description":"","id":"a68b3cxlsr1l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.647766,41.921646]}},{"properties":{"name":"bobs subs in willoughby","description":"","id":"a68b3cyypbzj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.405991,41.642517]}},{"properties":{"name":"Verve","description":"was Juniper Grill\n\nrelocating to?

gone.\n\n“I’ve always lived beyond my years,” says the 21-year-old Andrew Casey. With the ink on his Culinary Institute of America diploma still wet, the young chef will set his sights on the next big challenge: overhauling the food at D’Vine Wine Bar (836 W. Saint Clair Ave., 216/241-8463, dvinewinebar.com). “A lot of people are surprised to learn that we serve food,” he laments. “I definitely want to change that.” For his externship, Casey worked at the acclaimed Napa Valley eatery, Bouchon. He also spent a few years cooking at Lolita. He describes his style as “simple and clean, with a focus on American regional cuisine.” He intends to stick with the small-plate format, while upgrading quality, presentation and preparation. New items will include pork meatballs with buffalo mozzarella, grilled anchovies with fennel-apple ragu, and pan-fried perch with spaetzle.

Rather, the soot-covered green paint, high ceilings, and aging business cards on the wall have elevated the place to iconic status.\n\nEnter through the creaky screen door and time slows: Most likely, you will stand in a long line to get your meat . . . you will reach the counter . . . you will order by the pound. When I went at noon on a Saturday, the fatty brisket measured up to the highest standards. The fat melted, and the slices could be cut easily with a fork edge. (The same couldn’t be said for the lean brisket, which had reached its eat-by date before we sat down.) Still, the beef rib was the best choice. The thing was as big as my forearm, and the server sliced it four times so my guests could sample the chunks that fell right off the bone onto the butcher paper. Bobby makes the 100 percent–beef sausage himself. The jalapeño variety was my favorite: A lasting kick and a skin that crackled took it over the top. The traditional, homemade sides and spicy, vinegar-based sauce were as great as always.\n\nNow, I’ll admit I winced a little when I saw the line of out-of-towners stretching from the counter to the front door. But newcomers are a good reminder that this is no average ’cue joint; without them, I might easily forget how transcendental and relaxing this place really is, how it can leave me feeling light-headed and blissed-out no matter how much meat I just put away.

Your searching has brought you here, to the company of fellow pilgrims in the snaking line.

Aware of your unworthiness, you push open the swinging door.\n\nThis is barbecue’s holy of holies: City Market’s dark pit room, located in a back corner of the main dining hall. Clouds of post oak incense have been rising from its five pits for fifty years, and the smoke envelops manager Joe Capello Sr. and his crew as they slice your order—a choice of brisket, ribs, sausage, nothing else—onto butcher paper. You pay at the blackened cash register (bread comes free, onions, pickles, and peppers for pocket change), then reemerge into the dining area, where staff at a central counter sell sides and liquid offerings: vessels of potato salad and beans; hunks of yellow cheese; an array of beers, Big Red, IBC Root Beer.

A handwritten notice proclaims the righteous requirements of the meat before you: “No forks—use your hands.”\n\nYour first bite of a generous rib is a revelation. It is tender, salty, fall-off-the- bone succulent. The brisket, perfectly crispy yet moist, emanates an addictive woodsmoke flavor. And, oh, the homemade beef sausage! Epic.

You’ll end up in the parking lot behind the boxy brick building anyway, doing the Smitty’s shuffle: At peak hours, the lines invariably stretch out the back door. Patiently, you inch your way forward, passing the waist-high brick pits and perusing the list of post oak–smoked meats (brisket, pork ribs and chops, shoulder clod, sausage, prime rib).\n\nSalivating, you finally place your order for a pound or so of meat (in this ancient hall there are no platters or sandwiches).

At last, faint from hunger, you squeeze in at one of the long communal tables and tear into some of the finest barbecue in Texas.\n\nSmitty’s began around 1900 as Kreuz Market, a German butcher shop that sold fresh meat during the week and smoked whatever was left over on the weekend. The Kreuz name endured even after Edgar “Smitty” Schmidt bought the business, in 1948. It was still in use in 1999, when a dust-up among the late Edgar’s three children caused his son Rick to take the Kreuz name to a new building down the road (see page 126). Fortunately, daughter Nina Schmidt Sells and her son, John Fullilove, kept the fires burning and reopened under the current name. They made a few concessions to modernity, such as repainting the dining room and offering sauce (you have to ask for it).

The humble brick building off the courthouse square in Lockhart had turned out divine smoked meat since 1900. But just as churchgoers nowadays worship in larger halls, so too does the visitor to the new Kreuz Market, which opened in 1999 in a gigantic building at the edge of town. (The old building now houses Smitty’s.)\n\nKreuz (pronounced “Krites”) does 45 percent of its business on Saturday. The rest of the week it feels like some kind of meat monastery. You enter, footsteps ringing out in the vast, vacant space, and head down a long hall to the pit room, over which a thin haze of smoke perpetually hangs. Roy Perez, the pitmaster, who has not taken a day of vacation in 21 years, is likely to be tending the fires. The counterwomen are friendly, but solemnity pervades the transaction. The atmosphere is not convivial—you sit alone in a room, capacity 560, bent quietly over an array of absolutely beautiful meat, with no fork, sauce, or plate to disrupt the communion.\n\n“We do things the hard way,” explained owner Rick Schmidt, who samples his fare at least once a day, usually for breakfast. “We don’t use these auto pits, where you load some sticks in, set your thermometer, and come back in eight or nine hours. What we do takes attention. You’re constantly working the fire, and you need to know how the meat’s supposed to look and smell and sizzle. It’s all feel and sight. We don’t even have a thermometer.”\n\nThe product is simple and potent. The brisket’s so smoky you can imagine the tree. Swoon-inducing pork ribs are encrusted with huge chunks of black pepper. The pork chop is submissive and the jalapeño-cheese sausage addictive. A pleasant surprise is the sauerkraut, which goes so well with brisket it ought to be more of a barbecue standby. My only complaint was with the regular sausage, the filling of which was ground so fine it slid out of the casing without much encouragement.\n\nWhat sets Kreuz Market apart is its maniacal devotion to tradition. Noting the rise in the use of commercial smokers in Texas barbecue, Schmidt told me, “I call those things ‘no-brainer pits.’ What they do is give you consistent mediocrity. It’s easier. But as long as we can find people that want to learn, we’ll keep our way going.” Jake Silverstein","id":"a68b3dazksxy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.67099,29.889658]}},{"properties":{"name":"LLANO Cooper’s Old Time Pit Bar-B-Que","description":"Chain alert: According to recent reports, Cooper’s will soon open a franchise in New Braunfels and has two others in the works.

Arthur administration, fending off developers as a forest of gleaming skyscrapers has grown up around it. \n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;PJ’s cattle are specially selected for the restaurant and their burgers are made from chuck steak ground on-site; the thick-but-not-too-thick patties of obscenely flavorful beef--so tasty they’re only seasoned with salt and pepper--come on classic white buns and are best topped with cheddar and bacon, though the Béarnaise Burger (topped with béarnaise sauce) is a worthy bite too.

Bobby George, president of the George Group of Lakewood, has a contract to buy the downtown Cort Shoe Building that housed the controversial nightspot. He hopes to lease part of a nearby parking lot and the back of the Bolton Pratt building on West Fourth Street to make enough room for a new tenant: the Barley House pub and restaurant. The restaurant, with outdoor seating and a basement lounge, will be modeled on Akron's popular Barley House, one of many eateries launched or owned by George's family. His father, Tony, is a prominent businessman who helped create sports bar chain Slam Jams and the Harry Buffalo bars, which serve buffalo meat.\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;The George Group's other divisions include real estate investments and a sports marketing business that works with large corporations and professional athletes.\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;Barley House will be Bobby George's first foray into the Warehouse District, but it might not be the last. The 27-year-old developer is pursuing the Liberty Textile Building, a rare vacant entertainment district property owned by James Kassouf.\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\"We want to do the right thing for Cleveland,\" George said, \"and the right thing is to develop and grow.\"\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;Some downtown boosters are relieved to see Spy Bar giving way to a new business.
