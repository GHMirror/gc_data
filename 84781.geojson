Though she was not born in Tempe, both her mother&amp;apos;s and father&amp;apos;s families were pioneers in the Tempe area. Her family moved back to Tempe in 1944. They lived in the Barrio al Centro until the mid-1950s, when the neighborhood was demolished for the expansion of Arizona State College.\n\nMs. Urbano has taken a leading role in preserving Tempe&amp;apos;s Hispanic heritage for more than ten years. In the early 1980s, she formed an organization that became known as Los Amigos de Tempe which collects personal memoirs and sponsors biennial reunions of the families that used to live in the Tempe barrios. She was actively involved in the planning of the Barrios exhibit and many related programs at the Tempe Historical Museum.\n\nIn this interview she talks about growing up in Tempe in the 1940s and &amp;apos;50s, and her involvement in the founding of Los Amigos de Tempe.\n\t\t\t","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"El Barrio de la Central","description":"...it wasn't even called the barrio.
