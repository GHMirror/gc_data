That one might be a good memory because my dad asked her if it had her name on it.

My parents used to make a huge cooler of ice water and we would play softball in this field...me and the other kids my age in town. It was so much fun!!

When I was 12 I got a job through the JTPA working to clean up the school and campus to get it ready for the following school year.  Mr. Skrantz worked us hard but it was worth it.

It also has a few covered places to barbeque as well.  It is beautiful.

He was there 7 years before he was diagnosed with severe heart disease and told not to work anymore.  But in those 7 years, my dad built a reputation in that town of being honest and a great mechanic.  A few in town too advantage of him by not paying the bill after he worked on their car.  He trusted that they would make notes on the bill, as they promised.  These people took advantage of my dad\\'s trusting spirit.  What goes around comes around.  But I loved going there to visit.  I used to walk next door to the Burger Hut, which was owned by the Solar family.  It was such a cool place.  The tables were white with gold sparkles.  I thought they were beautiful.
