It is a popular place during the fall and spring times when fall colors are blooming and the Wisconsin snow pack is melting away.  But don\\'t forget to check out the AMAZING ice formations the punch bowl has to offer during the winter months as the natural springs freeze.  The best way to get there is to go west on Highway 29 across the Red Cedar River. Turn left onto County P for a couple of hundred yards. Turn left onto Paradise Valley Road for about 2 miles. There is a small parking lot on the left side of the road.  This location is a true Stout gem! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6okdhzrvvwt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.9485282898,44.8524005982]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dunn County Family Planning","description":"Posted by Uwstoutcast<img src=\"http://dunncountywi.govoffice2.com/vertical/Sites/%7B8D65D186-760D-414B-890C-7C4376A23107%7D/uploads/%7B0328C0E5-FB48-45B2-A829-9C3458172DFF%7D.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> 800 Wilson Avenue Menomonie WI 54751Dunn County Family Planning is on the lower level of the government center.

Log Jam is for those students who enjoy getting dressed up for a casual drink with friends. Don\\'t forget the all-you-can-eat .99 BBQ ribs on Thursday and all-you-can-eat fish fry on Friday.

The Bottoms are a place where Stoutonians play frisbee, have picnics, go swimming and in general have a good time on the sand dunes!  The railroad track depicted on this map is now a dirt road, this is the road you take to get to The Bottoms!  Plenty of beach space to lay out and enjoy some UV rays or have a raging bonfire.  The tradition that is set in stone here is if your a student and goto the Bottoms, you have to jump off the railroad bridge that crosses the river.  ***DISCLAIMER, Stout Media does not encourage bridge jumping, this activity is very dangerous.  ***<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6okdi1mrv8s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.8697035313,44.7059143107]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Great Escape Bar &amp; Grill - VFW","description":"Posted by Uwstoutcast<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2909 Bongey Dr Menomonie WI 54751Most commonly known as the \\'VFW\\' among students, the Great Escape Bar and Grill is known for its Wednesday Wing night, all you can eat wings for .50!
