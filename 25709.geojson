Tabor\r\n\r\nJake\\'s parents wished me well and I was off.  Leaving Jake\\'s parent\\'s house, I tried to focus and remember how to get to Mount Tabor -- A route I\\'ve traveled many times before, however, at this point, I felt as though I was in a foreign city.\r\n\r\nWas it really happening?  Am I going to be able to find in at the Park?  I was so happy that I was going to find him -- all of this anticipation will finally be over...  \r\n\r\nI park my car and peak my head over the ledge, overlooking the amphitheater to see if he\\'s there.\r\nHe was.  He said, \"Get down here!\"  \r\n\r\nI ran to him an noticed him standing next to a gift wrapped in Christmas paper.  The box was about 8\" x 8\".  He instructed me to open it.  \r\n\r\nWhat was inside was a GIGANTIC ring.... About 4\" x 3\" in size.  When I saw the ring, I finally knew what this was.  At that moment, Jake got down on one knee, and revealed another ring -- one that would fit my finger.  He asked me to marry him.\r\n\r\nThrough my tears, I said yes.  \r\n\r\n  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
