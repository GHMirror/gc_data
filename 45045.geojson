We were able to get off the boat and walk around a lot which was great because we saw some amazing things. There are beautiful mountains there! I even got to walk on a giant glacier. We drove onto the glacier in these huge trucks that had some serious spikes on the tires and then got out to check out the ice. The craziest thing about Alaska during the summer though is the sun. The sun wouldn\\'t set until about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning and then it would rise at about 5:00 or 6:00, just a few hours later. So I would be wandering around the boat at 1:00 am not even realizing what time it was because it seemed like it was only 3:00 in the afternoon! It was so great to see another part of the country that\\'s so different from Ohio.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ktxsa3438s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-154.570999,61.288314]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amsterdam","description":"Posted by Lizkru<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/amsterdam.jpg\">amsterdamThis is where my family and I started our vacation this summer. We flew into the Amsterdam airport and we stayed outside Amsterdam in a small town called Hoofdorp. In Amsterdam, the streets are really crowded and small. The buildings are all close together, there are hardly gaps between them except for streets and they are all really narrow. There are a lot of great museums there, besides what everyone thinks of Amsterdam. It\\'s a great city though.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ktxs41066k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.889999,52.369998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bangkok","description":"Posted by Lizkru<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/me,_noha.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/river_view.JPG\">BangkokIn January of my junior year I went with 16 other people from my school (including 3 adults) to Thailand for three weeks. We stayed in Bangkok for a few days then traveled around. We went to Chiang Mai (which is an awesome city), Nakornsritammarat, and some other places. My english teacher who was on the trip with us had been in the peace corps in Thailand so we went to the school he worked at and we taught english for three days to the kids there. At this school, I had an unfortunate run in with some monkeys. While hiking around with some of the student at the school we came across some monkeys sitting in the middle of our path. (Monkeys ran around there like squirrels do in America) To make a long story short, before I knew it, I had monkeys trying to climb up my skirt and scratching at my arms and legs. I was saved by my friend swinging her camera case to scare them off. I walked away with a few scratches (don\\'t worry, no rabies) and a major scare. We also went to an island for a few days called Koh Samui. That was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. It was such a great trip, I was there with a lot of my friends and three teachers that I really liked. I will never forget that trip and I hope to go back to Thailand some day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ktxs0ki7hr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.5,13.729999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Canada","description":"Posted by Lizkru<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/vancouver.jpg\">Vancouver BCMy family went to Vancouver and this general part of Canada. We chose this place because it was my parents 20th anniversary that summer and this is where they went on their honeymoon. This was another trip full of beautiful mountains and landscapes as well as insteresting wildlife. I saw a lot of moose on that trip. I was young when we went on this trip so I don\\'t remember it as well as the other trips I have been on. I remember it being a really fun trip.

We saw all the common sights of Paris like the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Notre Dame and more. Paris is a great city to walk around in. We also took the bus and subway a lot too. On this trip we also went around northern France and saw the Mont Saint Michael, the beaches of Normandy where the soldiers came in on D-Day, and a bunch of chateaus in the Loire Valley. It\\'s was a great trip, even though it was really stressful with my family driving around in a Euro Mini-Bus with 5 maps telling us to go different ways.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ktxs1r59yn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.351019,48.856662]}},{"properties":{"name":"Perrysburg, OH","description":"Posted by LizkruThis is where I live in Perrysburg, Ohio.

We generally take a skiing trip or two every year as a family. Boyne Mountain is about 6 hours from where I live. I can snowboard (as you see in my account picture) and I can ski. I\\'m much better at skiing, but I can make it down the hill without falling on a snowboard too. As much as I don\\'t like really cold weather, I always love skiing with my family because it\\'s a fun trip.

I was in a small town about an hour from Stockholm called Sala. I stayed with a girl that I had hosted for two weeks in February of that year. Her name was Linnea and she had a younger brother and sister. Her mom used to work as in the American Embassy but is now a nurse at a hospital in Sala, her dad worked in Stockholm and stayed in a small apartment there during the week and came home on the weekend. We rode our bikes everywhere in the town, on average we did about 10 miles a day just going from place to place. We took the train to Stockholm a couple times during my stay and a few times we went to Uppsala which is another city in Sweden on the way to Stockholm from Sala. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ktxs4n74gz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[18.070707,59.329556]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tanzania","description":"Posted by Lizkru<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/crater1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/crater3.jpg\">In 7th grade I went to Tanzania with my mom and some high schoolers from my school. We were there for two weeks. Arusha was the city we flew in to. We did a lot of touring around in this huge truck thing. We didn\\'t have a lot of us on the trip, but it was the safest and most efficient way to carry our stuff. To cut down on costs, we camped most of the time. We even camped out on the Serengeti, which is a huge Savannah. One of the nights we could see lion eyes through the weeds about 100 yards away from our campsite. We never had a problem really with animals. One time though, when I was in the shower (which was just a curtain hung up with a bucket of water) I heard a commotion around me so I peeked over the curtain and I saw a giraffe just walking right through our campsite! When we were staying at top of the Ngorongoro Crater we had to have armed guards guarding our site the whole time we were there from the animals because they just wander up from the crater occasionally and they were there to keep us safe. We saw a whole herd of elephants not too far from our site one day when we were coming home from tour! This was also an amazing trip and I would LOVE to go back.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ktxs7akdel"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.681976,-3.371542]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/234028","metadata":null,"contact_name":"lizkru","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:lizkru","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/234028","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=234028,platial:user=lizkru","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":45045}
