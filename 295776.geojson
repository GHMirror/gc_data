During the week, TWU staff may need to let you in the front of the building. On weekends, when the building occasionally will be closed, we will be set up in the rear of the building, in the parking lot, to receive donations and dispatch volunteers for weekend work-days.\n\nFor now, volunteers are needed to help set up our new space and establish systems for tracking inventory, dispatching supplies and volunteers, and managing the flow of people and vehicles. Please call the number listed to volunteer, or show up this weekend.\n\nThis weekend, we will mainly be deploying volunteers directly into the field before Saturday morning (either by email, phone, or during Friday night's nightly conference call), but on future weekends we will be arranging large-scale deployments of volunteers to the hardest hit areas of New Jersey. We fully expect the people of Philadelphia to rally to this cause with as much passion and dedication as the people of New York City have, if not more, so we are certain that Local 234's union hall will become a buzzing hive of activity over the coming weeks.\n\n\nSUPPLIES REQUESTED: \n\nNote: These are VERY SPECIFIC REQUESTS (we are not accepting most clothes or food at this location).

Then on SATURDAY, we're seeking at least 20 volunteers for an informal canvass of residents found cleaning up their homes or viewing their properties, taking detailed needs-assessments in order to provide aid on an individual basis (come to OFFICE address on Saturday morning, or as early in the afternoon as you can). \n\nVolunteers will be needed for house guttings (or \"muck-outs\") and other demolition on Sunday, Monday, and beyond. They should bring as much of the following as possible: OSHA N95/N92 face-masks, waterproof boots, waterproof work-gloves, hazmat suits, heavy-duty work clothes, tarps, waterproof plastic bins, pry-bars, headlamps, batteries, and garbage bags. A change of clothes is a good idea. Contact the on-the-ground P.O.C. to arrange details in advance.\n\nIf any VOLUNTEER ORGANIZERS (preferably with experience in Occupy Sandy NYC or NJ) are willing to relocate here for at least a week, their help would be most welcome. This hub has lots of volunteers already, but few organizers and little capacity.

Please call the number listed to volunteer, or show up this weekend.\n\nThis weekend, we will mainly be deploying volunteers directly into the field before Saturday morning (either by email, phone, or during Friday night's nightly conference call), but on future weekends we will be arranging large-scale deployments of volunteers to the hardest hit areas of New Jersey. We fully expect the people of Philadelphia to rally to this cause with as much passion and dedication as the people of New York City have, if not more, so we are certain that Local 234's union hall will become a buzzing hive of activity over the coming weeks.\n\n\nSUPPLIES REQUESTED: \n\nNote: These are VERY SPECIFIC REQUESTS (we are not accepting most clothes or food at this location).

preparation for a regional distribution of supplies and food to evacuees in six area hotels. Meet at the CHURCH: 2901 18th Ave., Wall, NJ. Then on SATURDAY, we're seeking at least 20 volunteers for an informal canvass of residents found cleaning up their homes or viewing their properties, taking detailed needs-assessments in order to provide aid on an individual basis (come to OFFICE address on Saturday morning, or as early in the afternoon as you can). \n\nVolunteers will be needed for house guttings (or \"muck-outs\") and other demolition on Sunday, Monday, and beyond. They should bring as much of the following as possible: OSHA N95/N92 face-masks, waterproof boots, waterproof work-gloves, hazmat suits, heavy-duty work clothes, tarps, waterproof plastic bins, pry-bars, headlamps, batteries, and garbage bags. A change of clothes is a good idea. Contact the on-the-ground P.O.C. to arrange details in advance.\n\nIf any VOLUNTEER ORGANIZERS (preferably with experience in Occupy Sandy NYC or NJ) are willing to relocate here for at least a week, their help would be most welcome. This hub has lots of volunteers already, but few organizers and little capacity. Occupy Sandy is working hard to expand their capacity and improve their ability to provide much-needed mutual aid to a devastated part of the New Jersey coast. Interested volunteers should contact Dawn, the current on-the-ground point-of-contact, to arrange local housing. \n\nSUPPLIES NEEDED:\n\nWith an eye toward expanding their capacity to deliver aid they've already amassed, they're seeking a BOX TRUCK for transportation and a large temporary STORAGE FACILITY (either on-site or nearby). \n\nThe same supplies needed in most other places are welcome here as well (baby supplies, socks, underwear, water, cleaning supplies, muck-out supplies, and winter clothing), but the capacity is limited for now, so large donations may need to be turned away until more storage becomes available.","contact info":"Dawn\n(917) 892-1132","dateandtimes":"Contact P.O.C. for hours","geo_accuracy":null,"hide_on_map":null,"ignoretimestamp":null,"longitude":"-74.058937","link":null,"id":"aa3r2abdxazs","address":"OFFICE: \n2517 Highway 35 \nBuilding 1, Suite 203\nBelmar, NJ 07719 \n\nCHURCH :\n2901 18th Ave.\nWall, NJ","geo_precision":"unmatched","state":"New Jersey"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"status":null,"timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/11/10 18:40:01 -0500","original":"11/10/2012 18:40:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/11/10 18:40:00 -0500"},"latitude":"40.577659","region":null,"title":"Gospel Assembly Church","show (0) / hide (1)":null,"type marker":"large_blue","type":"Volunteer and Drop-Off","geo_latitude":"44.8491330219522","geo_score":0.0,"default (0) / urgent (1)":null,"geo_longitude":"-91.4885322841514","description":"Dispatch, Distribution and Donation Collection Relief Site","contact info":null,"dateandtimes":null,"geo_accuracy":"house","hide_on_map":null,"ignoretimestamp":null,"longitude":"-73.995535","link":null,"id":"aa3r2a7ifm6n","address":"2828 Neptune Avenue","geo_precision":"unmatched","state":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"status":null,"timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/11/10 18:40:01 -0500","original":"11/10/2012 18:40:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/11/10 18:40:00 -0500"},"latitude":"40.586574","region":"Rockaway","title":"7400 Shore Front Parkway","show (0) / hide (1)":null,"type marker":null,"type":"Unknown","geo_latitude":"40.5865550207846","geo_score":0.0,"default (0) / urgent (1)":null,"geo_longitude":"-73.8035986382527","description":"Operating in the laundry room","contact info":null,"dateandtimes":null,"geo_accuracy":"tertiary","hide_on_map":null,"ignoretimestamp":null,"longitude":"-73.804027","link":null,"id":"aa3r2ac2unzi","address":"7400 Shore Front Parkway","geo_precision":"unmatched","state":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"status":null,"timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/11/10 19:02:01 -0500","original":"11/10/2012 19:02:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/11/10 19:02:00 -0500"},"latitude":"40.604223","region":"Far Rockaway","title":"Library","show (0) / hide (1)":null,"type marker":"large_blue","type":"Volunteer and Drop-Off","geo_latitude":null,"geo_score":0.0,"default (0) / urgent (1)":null,"geo_longitude":null,"description":"Volunteers will be needed during all or part of that time, particularly in the mornings.
