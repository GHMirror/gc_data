A fifth-field of classification (watershed) and sixth-field (sub-watershed) are currently under development. The United States and Caribbean are divided into 21 regions, 221 subregions, 378 accounting units, and 2,264 cataloguing units. A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points. Hydrologic units are only synonymous with classic watersheds when their boundaries include all the source area contributing surface water to a single defined outlet point. Hydrologic Unit Code: Each hydrologic unit is identified by a unique hydrologic unit code (HUC) consisting of two to twelve digits based on the six levels of classification: 8-digit HUC (Cataloguing Unit) 2-digit HUC first-level (region) 4-digit HUC second-level (subregion) 6-digit HUC third-level (accounting unit) 8-digit HUC fourth-level (cataloguing unit) 10-digit HUC fifth-level (watershed) 12-digit HUC sixth-level (subwatershed). This layer represents the 12-digit HUC sixth-level (subwatershed).","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.nbii.gov/far/nfhap/","metadata":"http://metadata.nbii.gov/clearinghouse/send/xsltText2?fileURL=d:/mercury_instances/nbii/nbii/harvested/www.nbii.gov_metadata_mdata_NASA_nasa_d_NFDIMetadata.xml&full_datasource=Metadata%20Clearinghouse%20Principal%20Node&full_queryString=%20text%20:%20NFDI","contact_name":"Andrea Ostroff","contact_address":"        Physical\n        12201 Sunrise Valley Drive MS 302 Reston, VA 20192-0002\n        Reston\n        VA\n        20192\n        USA\n       Email: aostroff@usgs.gov","source":"USGS-Core Science Systems -Biological Informatics Program","contact_phone":"703-648-4070"},"source":"http://www.nbii.gov/far/nfhap/","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-13T00:46:47-04:00","id":112517}
