The Bronx Bar, which has been on the corner of Second and Prentis for as long as anyone can remember, quietly went from being an underappreciated dive bar that kept odd hours to being a positively hip, dark-as-a-mine shaft watering hole that keeps wee-hours hours. Most important, though, are two jukeboxes that will endear themselves to hardened music freaks. Early ’80s post-punk, classic hip hop, deep soul, indie-rock favorites, and a slew of Detroit bands make up a dumbfounding roster of lovable non-hits.

Location: Market and 30th just to the left of the train station (with your back to the Schuylkill). Had the \"large\" fried chicken for .50. Small was  less and unless you\\'re feeding two people, I\\'d strongly recommend sticking with a small. Large was 2 entire thigh/legs and 2 heaping servings of sides. The chicken was piping hot, tender, with a crispy coating, covered with hot sauce (optional) comparable to tabasco in terms of flavor and bite. The crust had no extra salt, allowing the flavor of the chicken and the batter to shine through. The true test of perfect fried chicken -- the skin and coating were still crispy after the whole meal was done.\n\nSides: Tried the green beans which were fresh, hot, a bit salty but not overly so, and had a touch of onions I believe. Yum. Also had the candied yams -- perfectly soft but not mushy, sweet but not too much so. Overall - sides were done right.\n\nThe chicken was the highlight of the meal though and this was the best fried chicken (if not best chicken period) I\\'ve had in recent memory, and that includes several trips from San Francisco to the East Coast passing through the Deep South, so take that! Denises\\' will do ya right! Almost forgot to mention -- I didn\\'t order it, but for  you get 32oz of homemade ice-tea in a plastic tub. Other menu items include fried fish, jerk chicken, and a variety of sides, but they\\'ll all have to wait because I\\'m still full from the chicken.\n\nOther: No atmosphere to speak of, but remember this is a lunch truck.

They make tough days easier, go great with most foods, and you can always use another.\n\nArtist Julie Goldstein understands your thirst for just the right tee — and is doing her best to satisfy it with her appropriately named line, Perfect.\n\nSince the versatile and wearable shirts and tanks feature one-of-a-kind prints, no small amount of work goes into each one. Goldstein spends anywhere from eight hours to two weeks creating an original woodcut, which is then used to apply the print — either to the individual top or a patch that is later sewn on.

But they can be boring. Hence last year\\'s creation of Once Upon a Nation, a year-old initiative of the nonprofit Historic Philadelphia, Inc., designed to make our city\\'s history more relevant and fun. Once Upon a Nation deals primarily in tours and storytelling, but now they also do miniature golf. And what\\'s more fun than miniature golf?\n\nOpen until 9 p.m., a new Philly-themed mini golf course, and its companion Franklin Square carousel and playgrounds, helps meet Once Upon a Nation\\'s other goal of creating more things for tourists to do at night, when those boring buildings and museums are closed. Three years in the making, the 18-hole course includes interactive reproductions of the Love sculpture, Benjamin Franklin Bridge and the Chinese Friendship Gate. On the eve of Franklin Square kiddyland\\'s opening we spoke with Ruth Rosenquist of Studio Productions in Tempe, Ariz., the company charged with transforming Philadelphia icons into playable pop art.\nSTONE FREE: There are no cobblestones <b><i>in play</i></b> on the Elfreth\\'s Alley hole.\nSTONE FREE: There are no cobblestones in play on the Elfreth\\'s Alley hole.\n: Michael T. Regan\n\n\t\n\nCity Paper: How did you decide on these particular buildings and subjects? Were there things that didn\\'t make the final cut?\n\nRuth Rosenquist: We designed the course with Castle Golf in Mesa [Ariz.] and Once Upon a Nation. A lot of ideas got thrown around and it was a group decision which ones to keep and which ones we weren\\'t able to use. I know there was talk about the Franklin Institute\\'s heart and a Philly food hole with a soft pretzel loop-de-loop. That would have definitely been a different style than the world-class, museum-quality realistic representations we\\'re known for. But with most [of the cuts] it came down to budget and space and time.\n\nCP: The Philadelphia sports hole is a par 3. Given our sports teams\\' records, wouldn\\'t it have been more realistic to make that hole impossible to do in the 6-stroke limit?\n\nRR: Since Philadelphia is home to the great underdog story of Rocky , the course designers felt a par 3 was warranted. There isalways reason for hope in the world of sports! CP: Why didn\\'t you put the cobblestones in the putting area of the Elfreth\\'s Alley hole as well as on the sides?\n\nRR: We talked about it. But we were worried about people tripping and falling. We also worried about what it would do to wheelchair access. [The course is wheelchair accessible.]\n\nCP: What are the most challenging holes?\n\nRR: I think the Benjamin Franklin Bridge is a lot of fun and more interesting than the typical two- or three-part hole. There\\'s only about an 8-inch height clearance on the bridge opening. If you don\\'t make it you drop in the Delaware.\n\nCP: Any insider tips?\n\nRR: My colleagues at Castle Golf, the Arizona company that designed the play of the course, call the Ben Franklin Bridge hole a touch shot. The turf on the bridge is shorter, which makes the ball roll more easily than on the other turf surfaces. Be sure to hitthe ball with enough force to get it over the high point on the bridge\\'s arch, or it will roll back, costing you a stroke.\n\nCP: Which holes were the most challenging to design?\n\nRR: The Museum of Art with the Rocky steps. The original design had the ball dropping down the stairs, which is the more typical way to deal with stairs in mini golf. There is a danger in putting up — the ball can become a boomerang. [But when Once Upon a Nation requested that the balls had to go up the stairs like Rocky] we were able to come up with a compromise that lowered the angle of the putt that didn\\'t take too much away from the grandeur of the stairs.\n\nCP: Do you think it\\'s a good course?\n\n\t\n\nRR: It\\'s one of the most interesting courses I\\'ve ever seen. I love the way it blends the educational with the historical. I know a lot of players will be attracted by the bells and whistles — like how the Liberty Bell rings when you putt into it and the snippets of songs that play on the Sound of Philadelphia and Rocky holes. The water also adds excitement. [In the Benjamin Franklin Bridge hole, the Delaware River is a water hazard, but on the Boathouse Row hole putting into the Schuylkill River spillway is the best way to get to the hole.] I also think the nighttime lighting on Boathouse Row and the Ben Franklin Bridge is really neat.\n\nCP: Are you embarrassed or proud to say you help make mini golf courses?\n\nRR: Proud, absolutely. Especially with this project. It tapped the creative juices of our staff in a way that few other jobs have. To have this located right in the heart of the historic district the way it is, we feel like we\\'re playing a part in the city\\'s history.\n\ndaily through Sept. 4, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. (last tee time at 8:15 p.m.), weekends from Sept. 5-Oct. 31, -, Franklin Square, Sixth and Race sts., 215-629-4026, www.onceuponanation.com.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawldxkhez"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.14945,39.95456]}},{"properties":{"name":"Philly Roller Girls, Millennium Skate World","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1900 Carman Street, Camden, NJ(from Daily Candy) \t\nJune 2, 2006\nRoll Out\n\nRemember Xanadu?

Stop by and snag some tees by Plan and spray paint, and pick from Rarebreed’s selection of records and CDs to create a soundtrack for your urban art extravaganza.\n\nThe cleaner, whiter, brighter walls also double as an art gallery; the opening show, up through July 10, features the work of Philly’s own A.I.D.S. (And It Don’t Stop) crew.\n\nSo anyone concerned that old-style street art was a thing of the past can rest assured …\n\nThe writing is definitely on the wall.\n\nRarebreed, 530 South 15th Street (215-280-5599 or rarebreed215.com).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawl0mo7rc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.167095,39.944036]}},{"properties":{"name":"Reading Terminal Market","description":"Posted by Shannonor12th and arch streets, philadelphia, pa<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawleyh2sm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.159435,39.953953]}},{"properties":{"name":"Renaissance Center","description":"Posted by Shannonor400 Renaissance Center Detroit, MI 48243Okay, so this is where they\\'re working.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawkz1cnei"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.040686,42.329939]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rescue Mission Thrift Store","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 480 W Bonanza Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89106<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawldgf7u3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.148026,36.177787]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rescue Rittenhouse Spa Lounge","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\">  255 South 17th Street, Philadelphia, PA(from Daily Candy)\nAugust 3, 2006\nCleanseCrafters\n\nSo your idea of taking care of yourself is ordering Diet Coke with your Big Mac and super-size fries. And your definition of exercise is a lively trot from one bar to the next.\n\nIt’s not like the damage is irreversible.\n\nEspecially if you book yourself into Rescue Rittenhouse Spa Lounge for their Ultimate Rescue Detox.\n\nYou’ll start with a full-body sugar scrub, which sloughs away dead skin. Next, you’ll be treated to subdermal massage, which breaks down cellulite with suction and infrared light. Finally comes the detoxifying algae wrap. After smearing warm sea mud onto your body, they wrap you in a Mylar sheet and blankets to draw impurities to the surface (making them easier to flush out).\n\nWhile mummified, you’ll get a ten-minute facial massage using restorative oils. After which you’ll be shown to the shower to rinse off the green stuff.\n\nAfterward, hit up Rescue’s tea bar for an invigorating Elixir Tonic.\n\nThat should keep you out of the local tavern for at least the next few minutes.\n\nAvailable at Rescue Rittenhouse Spa Lounge, 255 South 17th Street, mezzanine level (215-772-2766 or rescuerittenhousespa.com).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawl7ybjwl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.169461,39.948048]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ricklin's Ace Hardware","description":"Posted by Shannonor203 Haverford Ave,  Narberth, PA 19072 Sunday 05/13/07<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawlemjnlj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.261924,40.005094]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rite Aid","description":"Posted by Shannonor5911 Ridge Ave 1912824 Hours - Store and Pharmacy\n\nAlso has a really great GNC supplement section if you\\'re looking for weird health-food-store stuff.

It’s too steamy for those bodices Keira wears, but Artemisia jewelry will definitely help you get in the booty-hoarding spirit.\n\nDesigner Marisa Lombardo collects charming items from all over the world — turn-of-the-century perfume vials, antique watches, military medals — and embellishes them (with, say, an offset charm or a hanging bell) to create pieces that look borrowed from the set of a swashbuckling blockbuster.\n\nAnd because they’re made of authentic relics, the treasures are a good investment for your hard-earned doubloons.\n\nAs for how fellow pirates will react to your new

And without all the ache, you’ll find moving around to be a far less harrowing experience.\n\nFor one thing, you’ll be able to look both ways before crossing the street.\n\nThe Shiatsu Studio, 2001 Frankford Avenue, enter through Rocket Cat Cafe (215-668-4076).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawl0mgcz6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.130376,39.978653]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Soul Spot","description":"Posted by Shannonor302 Atlantic Ave, brooklyn, nyHours\n\n    * Daily 6:30AM-11PM\n\nRestaurant\n\n    * Cajun\n    * Home Cooking\n    * Soul Food\n    * Southern\n\nPrice\n\n    * $ (inexpensive)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawkyin8z6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.988679,40.688431]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Venetian","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 3355 Las Vegas Blvd. South, Las Vegas, NV 89109<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawl93utq5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.170434,36.121243]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thrift Smart","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\">  3430 E Tropicana Ave, Las Vegas, NV  89121  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawle7yrw1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.09964,36.101458]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thriftyway, Inc.","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 4921 Vegas Dr. Las Vegas, NV 89108<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawkzs5a0x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.209256,36.187933]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tommy Gunn's Barbeque","description":"Posted by Shannonor 4901 Ridge Ave, 19128Hours:\nMondays - Closed (for the Summer)\nTues - Thurs -- 11a - 9p\nFri. and Sat. -- 11a - 10p\nSunday -- 11a - 8:30p\n\n4901 Ridge Ave\nPhiladelphia, PA 19128\nPhone: (215) 508-1030<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aawl1fzbvj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.20751,40.015133]}},{"properties":{"name":"Toulou","description":"Posted by Shannonor<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 716 N.
