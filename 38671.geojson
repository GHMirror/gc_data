Somehow, I got the car into a space in a parking lot. But when I carefully exited the car and closed the driver\\'s door, the car immediately began sliding sideways across the parking lod down a gradual slope.

I am still a pretty bad driver. Luckily I lived most of my life in big cities with subways and haven\\'t had much chance to do damage.

It\\'s clear. I look to the right. Lots of cars. I watch the cars pass and then I pull out, to turn left, and BLAM, I\\'m broadsided by another car. I had forgotten to look left again and had pulled right out in front of these guys. I busted the windshield with my head, but there was no permenant drain bamage. The front axel of the Citation was pushed back about three inches. Neither of the guys in the other car were hurt.

It was a huge, rusty old monster of an automobile. It might not have had any heat.\n\nIt was a cold, icy day and the roads were a little slick. I was driving to school for something. Play rehearsal, debate practice, a Model UN meeting. Some dorky thing like that. The reason I got into this accident was that I had the incredibly bad habit of reading and driving when was 16-17. Yes. That\\'s right. Reading a book and driving a van on an icy road. Multitasking! If I could read and walk, read and eat, read and watch TV, read and play board games, why not read and drive?\n\nSo, I was driving behind a woman in a station wagon, both of us going 15-20 mph. I saw her put on her left turn signal and start to turn. I looked down at my book, and then smashed into the back of her car. I think I didn\\'t even hit the brake until <i>after</i> I hit her.
