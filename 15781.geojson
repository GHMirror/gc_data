This product will aid in the visualization of an NHC official track forecast, the forecast points are connected by black line segments. The track line(s) are not a forecast product, however, and because there are an infinite number of ways to connect a set of forecast points, the lines should not be interpreted as representing a specific forecast for the location of a tropical cyclone in between official forecast points. It is also important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, and that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the center.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"STORMNUM":{"max":14.0,"mean":14.0,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":14.0,"median":14.0},"FCSTPRD":{"max":120.0,"mean":96.0,"variance":1152.0,"stdev":33.9411254969543,"min":72.0,"median":120.0},"ADVISNUM":{"max":null,"min":null,"median":null}},"features":[{"properties":{"STORMNUM":14.0,"STORMNAME":"FOURTEEN-E","STORMTYPE":"TD","BASIN":"ep","ADVDATE":"090829/1500","FCSTPRD":72.0,"id":"a6252k7gmbly","ADVISNUM":"1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-121.5,13.3000001907349],[-122.300003051758,14.0],[-122.699996948242,14.8999996185303],[-122.699996948242,15.8000001907349],[-122.699996948242,16.8999996185303],[-123.0,18.5]]}},{"properties":{"STORMNUM":14.0,"STORMNAME":"FOURTEEN-E","STORMTYPE":"TD","BASIN":"ep","ADVDATE":"090829/1500","FCSTPRD":120.0,"id":"a6252kfdn8yd","ADVISNUM":"1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-121.5,13.3000001907349],[-122.300003051758,14.0],[-122.699996948242,14.8999996185303],[-122.699996948242,15.8000001907349],[-122.699996948242,16.8999996185303],[-123.0,18.5],[-125.0,19.5],[-127.0,20.0]]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/archive_forecast_results.php?id=ep14&year=2009&name=Tropical%20Storm%20KEVIN","metadata":"http://C:\\Users\\Margot\\Desktop\\FortiusOneStuff\\NOAAHurricaneData\\TrStKevin\\ep142009.001_5day_lin.shp.xml","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":" National Hurricane Center","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/archive_forecast_results.php?id=ep14&year=2009&name=Tropical%20Storm%20KEVIN","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":2,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"forecasts,hurricanes,kevin,nhc,storms,tropical","published":"2009-08-29T12:00:00Z","id":15781}
