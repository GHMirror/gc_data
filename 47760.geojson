The food is excellent. The beer selection is quite large, and they always have a band playing. My band played there a few months back. Many of the bands that play here are guys that I know or play music with. They also have pool and darts upstairs. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hhnrv0zilp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.91697,35.971324]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bijou Theatre","description":"Posted by Apetty3<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/sonvolt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Knoxville, TNRight down the street from the Tennessee Theatre, this place puts up some pretty solid competition. The Bijou also brings in all kinds of different music, it is know for being a little more laid back then the Tennessee Theatre, who sometimes does not allow dancing. It is also cheaper for tickets at the Bijou. Son Volt is the next big act coming around here, I attached a picture of them. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hhns05kzr5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.920833,35.960556]}},{"properties":{"name":"Civic Colesium","description":"Posted by Apetty3<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/civic.jpg\">knoxville, TN 37915Also, another large music venue in Knoxville, the colisium also has many other sporting events such as hokey and ice skating.

Located right next to Gus\\'s deli, Mama Jans has music almost every night of the week. These are mostly local artist who just play for the fun of playing. My band plays here at least twice a month. Also, Ganasita, a local jamband in town, plays there once or twice a month as well. If your walking around Market Square and you hear music coming out of that little place, I recommend you stick your head in. My band will be playing here May 1, after Umphrey\\'s McGee plays sundown.

This place is always full of musicians whethter they are playing or not. I attached a picture of my favorite guitarist in town Micheal Seal. If you look close you will notice Jeff Coffin from the flecktones playing along with the band. Sometimes some really famous people can sneak into this bar.  Mike Seal plays there at least once a week with many different bands and many different types of music. Shows here usually cost five bucks or so in a weekend, but definitely worth the cash if you catch the right band. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hhns3pf6mb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.919704,35.965572]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stir Fry Cafe  (Turkey Creek)","description":"Posted by Apetty3<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/stir_fry.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 11001 Parkside Dr. Knoxville, TNThis is where my band plays a lot of its gigs.

This is mainly due to the fact that it is an outdoor venue. It is under a pavilion, so even if it rains the band can still play. My favorite show that I\\'ve seen there was the Derek Trucks Band. Tickets are never more than around ten dollars. They also have cheap beer and cheap food. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hhns4bgwwk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.021114,35.755301]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Valarium","description":"Posted by Apetty3<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/VALARIUM_2_.jpg\">1213 western avenue knoxville tenneseeKnoxville\\'s newest music venue.
