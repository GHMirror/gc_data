At 250 pounds he can be compared to a bear before hibernation. He will drop over 50 pounds in the coming months.\nAtalaya is a jungle town. The only way to reach it is by boat or plane. Everything is alive with green as the jungle tries to retake the city. “I love the smell of the jungle,” a soaking wet Martin declared as he exited the plane with his new Peruvian guitar in his hand.\nThe true founder of Atalaya was Juan Santos Atahualpa. He was an Apu Inca who led 50,000 Ashaninkan Indians against the Spaniards in 1742. “There will be no slavery,” he declared, and they gave up their lives to ensure the future freedom of these same Incan descendants who gaze on Martin today. He is the first white man some of these warm people have ever seen and is twice as big as most of them.THE DEADLY JUNGLE\nMartin is very happy with the new machete he purchased from a native last evening and likes to carry it around the village with him. Today he is preparing for a scouting mission on a small boat that will take him deeper into the jungle. He visited this area two years ago to exchange gifts with some tribal chiefs and shamans in order to be granted permission to pass through certain remote areas of the river.\nSome of the natives have expressed great concern over the dangers in this part of the river. The Candiru is a small fish that is attracted to the smell of urine and releases razor sharp spines into the orifice it has crawled into. An experienced riverman suggested Martin carry lemon juice as a natural remedy for this problem. Crocodiles are also very common here and Martin will be in great jeopardy each time he swims in dark, still waters away from the fast current. This will make getting into and out of the river extremely dangerous. Anacondas and piranha are also attracted to the slower moving water. The team is taking malaria pills, but nothing is 100% effective. Atalayans tell us that some of us may go home with, “just a little malaria.”  We’ve heard a few reports of banditos who do some smuggling downstream from here, but natives tell us not to worry as those reports are exaggerated.\n&gt;&gt;Matthew Mohlke","link:alternate":"http://triptracker.net/trip/1585/13159/","updated":{"end_time":"2007/01/28 11:00:00 -0500","original":"2007-01-28T15:00:00.000Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/01/28 10:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.7646,-10.7267]}},{"properties":{"title":"Dancing with Ashaninkas @ Atalaya, Peru","published":{"end_time":"2007/01/30 21:00:00 -0500","original":"2007-01-31T01:00:00.000Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/01/30 20:00:00 -0500"},"id":"1","description":"Martin was invited to attend a special ceremony among Ashaninkan chieftains.

At the end of the song she surprised all in attendance by taking Martin’s hand and having him join her in a ritual dance. \nTraining in the Amazon has given Martin a painful sunburn as he acclimates to the climate.

Although we began with a spotlight, he was afraid the beam would attract large predators such as bull sharks, or draw other unwanted attention...\nSo we tied a glowing red neon stick to the back of his wetsuit, waited until our eyes adjusted to the darkness, and used the speckles of light coming from the moon as our reference point. We had a few large boats temporarily blind us with their spotlights, but we were able to make radio contact and ask in broken Portuguese for their cooperation. The night was a success until the tired swimmer slipped and fell off a plank getting back onto the Cassiquari.

One of his biggest fears for this final stage of the trip was of the Pororoca, a huge tidal bore that occurs where incoming tides meet the outflow of the Amazon.\nThey’ve been recorded to reach heights of 30 feet high, speeds of 40 km per hour, and reach as far inland as 100 km, destroying everything in their path, including large boats. The Pororoca has become legendary amongst the top surfers of the world, and many have lost their lives attempting to ride it. The phenomenon is possible whenever lunar and solar tides synchronize, but according to meteorological experts, no Pororocas have been forecast from now until Sunday... although you never know.\nMartin battled the waves and tides to move another 37 km toward his goal today, and expects to brave the moonlit waters of the Amazon again the next two evenings in order to make it to the finish line in time. He’s only 71 km from the end now, but moving along at a snail’s pace. We’re examining the possibilities of taking a slightly longer route along a side channel to Belem in order avoid the big water.\n&gt;&gt;Matthew Mohlke","link:alternate":"http://triptracker.net/trip/1585/14867/","updated":{"end_time":"2007/04/05 15:00:00 -0400","original":"2007-04-05T18:00:00.000Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/04/05 14:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-49.461993333,-1.73245]}},{"properties":{"title":"Crawling Home @ Ilha Joroca, Brazil","published":{"end_time":"2007/04/07 01:00:00 -0400","original":"2007-04-07T04:00:00.000Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/04/07 00:00:00 -0400"},"id":"62","description":"Martin’s health took a turn for the worse last evening as he struggled with dizziness, vertigo, blood pressure jumping off the charts, diarrhea, nausea, and delirium. Despite having difficulty standing and being ordered by the doctor not to swim, Martin is obsessed with making it to Belem, and insisted on night swimming.\nThe winds were light and the almost full moon would come in and out of shrouds of clouds, filtering purplish light out over the rippling waters. We did the majority of the swim without the aid of any artificial light. Although the night was perfect, the swimming went terribly. We watched as Martin’s glowing red neon marker zigzagged back and forth constantly. He couldn’t hold a straight line nor stay with the escort boat, sometimes disregarding our navigational signals to swim off in his own direction. After only 11 km, he finally took our advice and quit for the night. “I’ve had enough. I just want to finish and go home,” he told us. Borut and I had to pull him back onto the boat and assist him into the Cassiquiari and to his room, where he immediately passed out in his wet shorts.\nWe’ve decided to postpone our arrival into Belem until Sunday.\n&gt;&gt;Matthew Mohlke","link:alternate":"http://triptracker.net/trip/1585/14868/","updated":{"end_time":"2007/04/07 01:00:00 -0400","original":"2007-04-07T04:00:00.000Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/04/07 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-49.22396,-1.626945]}},{"properties":{"title":"Almost Finished @ Ilha do Capim, Brazil","published":{"end_time":"2007/04/07 11:00:00 -0400","original":"2007-04-07T14:00:00.000Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/04/07 10:00:00 -0400"},"id":"63","description":"Martin staggered forward another 31 km during the day yesterday, and six more km at night.

He was examined by his personal doctors last night who declared him to be in great health for a man who’d spent the last ten weeks swimming in the Amazon.\nAlthough he lost a total of 34 pounds during the swim, his heart rate is back to normal, and although still on the high side, his blood pressure is getting better.\nMartin and the team are all now entering that tough stage of mental exhaustion that stems from the transition between expedition life and returning to reality.On Trail\nAn expedition is 95% misery and 5% ecstasy. After nearly three months of constant motion in a land far away from home, something strange occurs in the soul of a man. He gets broken. The first symptom is a tired or sick feeling, maybe even some fear and a little helplessness. Loneliness. Then something slowly changes within. The old attachments start to fade and he becomes completely present. He forgets about all the crap that keeps him up at night back home. None of it matters anymore. He’s arrived at the moment when he must make a choice: He can crumble like salt or embrace this new life and harden into steel.\nAfter going home and dealing with all the meaningless details of electricity bills, mowing the grass, mortgage payments, and an unfulfilling job, a period of depression inevitably occurs. Those people back home that can’t understand why he’d leave his cozy existence behind again for three more months to jump at the next opportunity to subject himself to such misery and danger, but they just don’t get it man.\n&gt;&gt;Matthew Mohlke","link:alternate":"http://triptracker.net/trip/1585/15013/","updated":{"end_time":"2007/04/12 12:00:00 -0400","original":"2007-04-12T15:00:00.000Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/04/12 11:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-48.50176,-1.449873333]}}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"","metadata":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"source":null,"contact_phone":null},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":68,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-14T17:26:30-04:00","id":211556}
