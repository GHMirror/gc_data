There\\'s a statue of Mary in the yard next to it that\\'s equally as creepy. I’m not sure how long this church has been closed up and unused, but there are likely to be more churches that close their doors post-Katrina, and the building s will be left to decay and fall into disrepair.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8uuz7520"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.049612,29.964567]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ceramic monster masks at Backspace","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/107081060_6f838d3970.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 115 nw 5th ave, Portland OregonSome creepy, sinister, organic, salt fired ceramic masks that make me think of monsters and warriors, of gnarly road warrior type post and pre apocolyptic times when survival is not taken for granted.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8uyl8zci"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675536,45.52395]}},{"properties":{"name":"Creepy house","description":"Posted by Scottysouling<img src=\"http://ohdog.org/pics/01012406.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Ankeny Street, Portland, ORCreepy serial killer house where I went to an estate sale<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8ut0job5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.618301,45.522405]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dirty's Restaurant","description":"Posted by Joycamp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1710 Durham Drive, Houston, TX 77007<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8uv7clcb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.410553,29.775705]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mirabilis Statuarius Vehiculum","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://agooart.com/pics/extremopushing.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.artcaragency.com/images/MirabilisStatVehicEX2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://home.comcast.net/~cacopics/ext414.jpg\"><img src=\"http://artcarfest.com/images/vehicles/mirabilis.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Portland, ORMirabilis Statuarius Vehiculum\nby Scot Campbell<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8uqi1bu3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.649908,45.517715]}},{"properties":{"name":"My Clown Depot, look for hidden toys and tools","description":"Posted by Crustyclown<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035652915@N01/1182938/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/1/1182938_f6617e786f_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> IJYou may get more of a surprise than you bargained for.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8uqkdo4i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.892092,52.399329]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salton Sea","description":"Posted by Turnhere100 W Brawley Ave, Thermal, CA 92274<a href=\"http://www.turnhere.com\"><img src=\"http://www.turnhere.com/images/turnhere_logo.png\" width=\"151\" height=\"54\"></a>\n              \n               \n            \n      \n                  \n                \n                  \n                    \n                  \n              \n            \n      \n    \n      Salton SeaSalton sea, CA The Salton Sea is a photographer\\'s dreamscape, boasting some of the most stunning images you\\'ll ever see, both natural and man-made. \n  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8v25eafj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.023042,33.374543]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spotted, long forked freak bike","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/136094119_1299ac4d66.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> se madison &amp;

This fact combined with a gas station that refuses to offer 24 hour service means that Wawa has a thriving little hotel industry, which gives me cause to speculate that the owner of the gas station might be the mayor and the judge and the sherrif and whatever else, just like Dan Aykroyd\\'s creepy character in \"Nothing But Trouble.\"  (Which, incidentally, also featured a very young Tupac as a member of Digital Underground (you know, from \"Humpty Hump\" and \"Sex Packets\").\n\nThere are also two giant geese statues in the town.  Deliverance jokes at the expense of rural folk are more than a little passe, but this is one of a very few places that I\\'ve been to (and I grew up in northern BC, for Christ\\'s sake) that actually gives me a foreboding sense of doom and creepiness.\n\nI\\'ve heard tales about Wawa being a major curse for hitch-hikers, who are dropped off and stranded there at an above-average rate.\n\nShayne Wardrop is said to host a spectacular curling bonspiel every spring, though.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dg8v50ocu8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.775143,47.986015]}},{"properties":{"name":"Third Street Promenade (Where Pee Wee's Bike is Stolen)","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/77dc6c35d08eff7babf1845181dced10.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e92/newwavehotdog/normal_pwba_057.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1222 Third Street Promenade, santa monica, caThis is the scene were Pee Wee chains his bike to an animated clown so that he can pick up some magic supplies and pick up his new bike horn from Dottie at Chuck\\'s Bike Shop.
