The sub-facility types related to Captive Hazardous Waste Operations that are included in eMapPA are: Boiler/Industrial Furnace, Disposal Facility, Hazardous Generator, Incinerator, Recycling Facility, Storage Facility, and Treatment Facility._______Captive Hazardous Waste Operation Sub-Facility Types\nBoiler or Industrial Furnace:\n\nFacility permitted by DEP to burn or process hazardous waste generated onsite, to recover thermal energy, or to accomplish recovery of materials in association with a manufacturing process.\n\nDisposal Facility:\n\nFacility permitted by DEP to dispose of hazardous waste generated onsite by incineration, or by intentionally placing the waste in or on land or water in specially designed and constructed containment units where the waste will remain after closure of the facility.\n\nHazardous Generator:\n\nA site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated onsite at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards.\n\nIncinerator:\n\nFacility permitted by DEP to burn or thermally combust hazardous waste generated onsite in an enclosed device using controlled flame. Devices meeting the criteria for classification as a boiler, industrial furnace, carbon regeneration unit, or sludge dryer are not incinerators.\n\nRecycling Facility:\n\nFacility permitted by DEP to treat hazardous waste generated onsite, making it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material.\n\nStorage Facility:\n\nFacility permitted by DEP to hold hazardous waste generated onsite for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated, disposed of, or stored elsewhere.
