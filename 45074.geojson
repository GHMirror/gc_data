And afterwards, when my hosts asked if I\\'d like to grab a drink at a grill-your-own-meat place frequented by gold prospectors...I of course said yes. \n\nWe sat and talked. One of my hosts taught at the local Catholic high school. And just hearing her talk about her days there got me to thinking. Mind you, nothing like what happens in ALL SAINTS ever happened to her. It wasn\\'t so much her stories as her place, in this school, this outpost in a kind of wilderness, that stayed with me. Doesn\\'t make sense that I was inspired to write a book set in Orange County, California after spending a night swapping stories in Ester?

I used to say I didn\\'t know, but now I do: I like the coffee. There are plenty of treats to reward yourself with for doing the work.

The high school in my novel is located on the beach, my high school was located just west of downtown LA across from a cemetery, whose crematorium we could smell certain mornings. Oh, and the high school in my book is co-ed. Mine was definitely all-male. \n\n(If you\\'re curious to know what it looks like -- my alma mater, not the novel\\'s -- rent Donnie Darko, which was filmed there.)\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g548v51x7v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.297021,34.044328]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where Emily lives on Balboa Island","description":"Posted by LcallananEmily, my protagonist, lives on Balboa Island, on Diamond Avenue. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g548l699wr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.89414,33.60668]}},{"properties":{"name":"basement, Sewanee writers conference","description":"Posted by Lcallanan<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/74953487@N00/277694388/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/117/277694388_8efd741b7d_o.jpg\"></a>In 2004, a few months after my first novel, The Cloud Atlas, came out, I found myself spending a few very warm days in Sewanee, TN at the Sewanee writers\\' conference.
