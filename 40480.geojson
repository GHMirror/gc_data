My little brother Zane was born there and shortly after his birth we moved to Las Vegas. Most of my embarrasing child photos for some reason come from when I lived in Albuquerque.

We planned to live there for only 3 years but we ended up living there for 10 years. I went to public schools until my freshman year of high school where I attended a magnet performing arts school. For the first time whites were the minority race in the school. A month into school I was shipped up to Bellingham, WA. There is nothing to do in Vegas when you are underage besides swimming, walking around in air conditioned stores/malls, watching movies, and just staying inside since the temperature reaches the 120s. The city is owned and run by Mormons and a lot of the jobs are held by Mexican immigrants.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fe2ksgwyj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.103492,36.04792]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where the name comes from","description":"Posted by Hesterdingle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/DCP_1900.jpg\">dingle irelandMy dad is a full blood Irish man.
