This includes the Nickel funding package project list enacted for transportation by the 2003 Washington State Legislature (http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/nickel/ProjectList.pdf). This list was prepared by WSDOT from the project listing adopted by the Legislature in the Transportation Budget (ESHB 1163) and transmitted to the Legislative Evaluation &amp; Accountability Program from the Chairs of the Senate and House Transportation Committees on April 27, 2003.\n\n      This data set includes the current Program Item Numbers (PINs) and locational information as it existed in the Capital Improvement and Preservation Program database in September 2003.\n\nPurpose: This data set is intended for use as a reference layer for GIS analysis and display.\nSupplemental Information:\n\n      Included with the spatial data are tables for Work Items, where applicable. Also included is an Excel document that shows Program Item Number relationships between Legislatively approved Nickel Projects and 9/2003. The 9/2003 PIN number can be related to data in the Capital Improvement and Preservation Program database for additional information on individual projects. The bucket project table includes Nickel projects that have a non-specific or statewide location.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"PROGRITID":{"max":null,"min":null,"median":null}},"features":[{"properties":{"PROGRITID":"395680","LOCATION":"ANACORTES TERMINAL","DOT_REGION":"Washington State Ferries","TITLE":"ANACORTES MULTIMODAL TERMINAL","PROJECT_PH":"Construction","id":"a62o4tq1180f","PIN":"902019U","COUNTY":"Skagit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.677908556724,48.5069589987108]}},{"properties":{"PROGRITID":"336554","LOCATION":"EDMONDS TERMINAL","DOT_REGION":"Washington State Ferries","TITLE":"EDMONDS MULTIMODAL TERMINAL","PROJECT_PH":"Preliminary Engineering","id":"a62o4tj2met3","PIN":"910413M","COUNTY":"Snohomish"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.384537756312,47.8131500949864]}},{"properties":{"PROGRITID":"395913","LOCATION":"MUKILTEO TERMINAL","DOT_REGION":"Washington State Ferries","TITLE":"MUKILTEO MULTIMODAL TERMINAL","PROJECT_PH":"Construction","id":"a62o4tdag3gj","PIN":"952515K","COUNTY":"Snohomish"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.304530408228,47.9492754155908]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/geodatacatalog/default.htm","metadata":"http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/geodatacatalog/maps/24k/dot_progman/nickelprojects.htm","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Office of Information Technology, Washington State Department of Transportation","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/geodatacatalog/default.htm","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":3,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"ferries,nickel,transportation,washington","published":"2003-09-16T00:00:00Z","id":2967}
