Two months later on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin near the Sinking Spring. Here the Lincolns lived and farmed before moving to land a few miles away at Knob Creek. The area was established by Congress on July 17, 1916. An early 19th century Kentucky cabin, symbolic of the one in which Lincoln was born, is preserved in a memorial building at the site of his birth.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76zsijjk9ov"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.735073,37.534777]}},{"properties":{"name":"Antique Boat Museum","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/4/WELCOME_hd.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76zsinbg45u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.089656353,44.2356525847]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brazil","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> For hundreds of years, Brazil has symbolised the great escape into a primordial, tropical paradise, igniting the Western imagination like no other South American country.

What exactly is that? Or more importantly, why is there a Pinball Hall of Fame?\n\nThe Pinball Hall of Fame is an attempt by the members of the Las Vegas Pinball Collectors Club to house and display the world\\'s largest pinball collection, open to the public. A not-for-profit corporation was established to further this cause. The games belong to one club member (Tim Arnold), and range from 1950s up to 1990s pinball machines. Since it is a non-profit museum, older games from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s are the prevelant, as this was the \\'heyday\\' of pinball. There are no \\'ticket spitters\\' here (aka kiddie casinos or redemption). It\\'s all pure pinball (and a few arcade novelty games) from the past. And since it\\'s a non-profit, excess revenues go to non-denominational charities. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76zsikklo18"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.102156,36.100054]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yellowstone National Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a><img src=\"http://data2.itc.nps.gov/parkphotos/roosveltarch%2Ejpg\"><img src=\"http://www.nps.gov/yell/slidefile/nationalparkareas/Images/04685.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1402.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1395.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1444.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Long before any recorded human history in Yellowstone, a massive volcanic eruption spewed an immense volume of ash that covered all of the western U.S., much of the Midwest, northern Mexico and some areas of the eastern Pacific. The eruption dwarfed that of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 and left a caldera 30 miles wide by 45 miles long.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76zsio5v4m7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.674366,44.853913]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yukon - Charley Rivers National Preserve","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a><img src=\"http://www.nps.gov/yuch/Expanded/tour/tour_photos/calico_bluff.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Located along the Canadian border in central Alaska, the preserve protects 115 miles of the 1,800-mile\n    Yukon River and the entire Charley River basin. Numerous rustic cabins and historic sites are reminders of the\n    importance of the Yukon River during the 1898 gold rush. Paleontological and archeological sites here add much to\n    our knowledge of the environment thousands of years ago. Peregrine falcons nest in the high bluffs overlooking the\n    river, while the rolling hills that make up the preserve are home to an abundant array of wildlife. The Charley, a\n    100-mile long wild river, is considered by many to be the most spectacular river in Alaska.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76zsi9bvvcv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-141.201812,64.786484]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zanzibar","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a>ZanzibarJumping off point for a lot of expeditions during the early days (Stanley, etc.)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a76zsid4oxwl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[39.3822,-6.097406]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zion National Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a><img src=\"http://data2.itc.nps.gov/parkphotos/Tower%20and%20Temples%2EJPG\"><img src=\"http://womenhiking.org/photos/images/zion03_9b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://womenhiking.org/photos/images/zion03_4b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://womenhiking.org/photos/images/zion03_6b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Zion is an ancient Hebrew word meaning a place of refuge or sanctuary.
