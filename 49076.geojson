After the Prohibition law was repealed, the Bahamas went into a slowed economy again. The economy didn\\'t return to normal until World War II, when the islands were used as an air and sea way-station. Shortly after the war the new industry of tourism came to the Bahamas and changed the priorities in the islands. The beauty of the islands were appreciated for the first time. The Bahamas became one of the world\\'s most popular tourist destinations in the 1950\\'s when Cuba closed its borders to US tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1964 Great Britain granted the Bahamas self-government and in 1969\r\nchanged their status from a colony to a Commonwealth. In 1973 the Bahamas became independent within the Commonwealth of Nations, but Queen Elizabeth II retained them as constitutional head of state.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a712s6r9w7yc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.82169342,21.2918535128]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lakeland","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://volleyballas.com\" href=\"http://volleyballas.com\">Volleyballa14</a><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2170/2236996391_097411d4c3.jpg\">I live here! It is a growing city in central Florida and has many places to hang out and have fun. I was born here at Lakeland Regional Hospital. I have gone to Lakeland Christian since second grade.

As the water flowed over the Falls to the river below, it began eating through the glacial material and the limestone rock of the Niagara Escarpment and began the formation of the Niagara Gorge. A geologist named Doctor Roy Spencer discovered the birth site of Niagara Falls and today this site is known as \"Roy Terrace\".\r\n\r\nWhen Niagara Falls first came into existance the flow rate of water was only twenty-five percent of the present flow rate. Scientists have calculated that the volume of water flowing over the Falls initially was 37,500 cubic feet per second. Niagara Falls has also eroded 11.4 kilometers, or 7.1 miles. In 1938, the deepest flow of water at the crest of the Horseshoe Falls was recorded at 7.6 meters or 25 feet.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a712s6t1l90z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.7719726562,43.2932003139]}},{"properties":{"name":"Okavongo Delta","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://volleyballas.com\" href=\"http://volleyballas.com\">Volleyballa14</a><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2215/2243947438_c68dfefa75.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2071/2247200408_0dd0980cb9.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2247203256_db599b68fb.jpg\">  I totally went on vacation here for three weeks! My grandparents took my mom, dad, and me on a safari for their 50th wedding annaversary. I took 1,200 pictures while I was here. The scenery is beautiful and the wildlife is everywhere. We stayed in tents at twelve different camps. I saw cheetahs, lions, elephants, and many other animals. \r\n\r\n  My mom was walking to the tent one day after breakfast and an elphant was in the path. She thought she could just walk past and get to our tent with out it seeing her. She was wrong! It not only saw her, it charged her! When she tried to run away she tripped and fell. Luckily it stopped other wise I might not have a mom today.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a712s6w49bwb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[24.78515625,-19.2281767378]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://volleyballas.com\" href=\"http://volleyballas.com\">Volleyballa14</a><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3033/2312817937_e6b0c25e80.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3226/2323324350_0fc1144050.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/92/251995001_bdea15587f.jpg\">parisWhen the eiffel tower was first built many people were against it. Environmentalist were afraid it would obstruct the birds flight pattern and many were just against the use of money for such a building. Even with the complaints the tower\\'s building cost were almost completely covered by ticket sales from people coming to ride the elevator nine hundred feet up to the third floor observation deck in the first year alone.\r\n\r\nI can only imagine how pretty it must be to stand on the observation deck and see all of Paris or watch a sun set! Another reason I want to go to Paris is for the language. French is so pretty to listen to. It doesn\\'t matter if I can understand it I just love to hear the fluidity of the words. Also you can\\'t forget the food.

The Sydney Opera House was opened in October of 1973 by Queen Elizabeth ll. The first show to be performed there was the Australian Opera\\'s production of Sergei Prokofiev\\'s \"War and Peace\".\r\n\r\nJorn Utzon, a Danish architect, designed the Sydney Opera House. He designed the opera house to reflect things in the environment.

This Spanish name is actually misleading because it means \"shallow sea\" when really the Bahamas are mountain plateaus that emerged from the Atlantic Ocean a long time ago.\r\n\r\nThen later in history tourism came to the Bahamas. In the 1950\\'s Cuba became closed to US tourists and the Bahamas became one of the worlds most popular tourist destinations.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a712s6myg365"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.9370117188,24.5471231797]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tokyo","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://volleyballas.com\" href=\"http://volleyballas.com\">Volleyballa14</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7660699@N02/2385523932/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3038/2385523932_a91d067705.jpg\"></a>In 1942, WWII, Tokyo came under an attack known as the Doolittle Raid. This was its first air raid by US bombers. This raid followed soon after the Pearl Harbour attack on December 1941. \r\n\r\nIn 1943, Tokyo Prefecture and Tokyo city merged to form Tokyo Metropolis or Tokyo-to. This is commonly called Tokyo today. Since this time, no city in Japan has had the name \"Tokyo\".\r\n\r\nIn 1945 Tokyo was heavily bombed again, and much of the city was destroyed by heavy bombardment by B-29 and other aircraft. Long streches of land were levelled both by the explosions and by the following fires. The damage was not limited to Tokyo City, but extended to the city of Hachioji and other cities in western Tokyo. The bombers targeted air bases, transportation facilities, and strategically important manufacturing plants. The population in 1945 was only half of the population of 1940 due to the heavy death toll and populace fleeing to the countryside.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a712s6mk0ky0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.693908691,35.6885332074]}},{"properties":{"name":"Victoria Falls","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://volleyballas.com\" href=\"http://volleyballas.com\">Volleyballa14</a><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2208/2182279341_f7755ec6da.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2324/2251736355_11560cf5f5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/2107872389_6ba91f3c26.jpg\">While we were in Africa we went to Victoria Falls. We took a helicopter over and around the falls then later went back and walked around. My dad and I got in the water at the top for a picture and my mom almost had a heart attack! We weren\\'t even the most daring! Two girls walked all the way across right above the falls to an island for lunch.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that Victoria Falls is prettier than Niagra Falls and was much larger. We learned that the falls had actually moved eight times in known history because of the rock eroding behind the falls. Victoria Falls is also the widest, strechting over a mile long, and has more water pouring over it than any other falls known. It is also known for pouring over into a small chasm so that you can actually stand very close facing the falls and get wet.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a712s6wr57pz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.8456802368,-17.9052421179]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/284908","metadata":null,"contact_name":"volleyballa14","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:volleyballa14","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/284908","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=284908,platial:user=volleyballa14","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":49076}
