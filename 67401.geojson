My first port of call was Hastings to photograph the fire damage to the Pier then I rode into Eastbourne and finally across to Birling Gap to test out the new neutral density circular polarising filter I bought for my camera.  I hadn't planned on doing any sunbathing but the weather was sunny and very warm when I got to Birling Gap, with the Cliffs providing natural shelter from the cool breeze.  I wasn't dressed for beach weather and hadn't brought a towel so I decided to spare beachgoers the sight of my boxer shorts and sufficed by rolling up the legs of my jeans.  I took these two shots just before sunset when it was still comfortably warm, although I probably should have lost the socks which look a bit naff in a beach shot. I did draw the line at making a handkerchief sunhat.  lol  I took the first shot with my kit lens which is SOOC and just cropped and the second with my Tamron lens using the settings I would normally use for taking street photography.<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\">Taken on 10th October, 2010&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?id=63169691@N06&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\"><b>Marc-John Photographic</b></a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_tag_left.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"><a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=selfportrait&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">selfportrait</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=beach&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">beach</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=socks&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">socks</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=self&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">self</a> ...<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_public.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"> Anyone can see this location","id":"a64kwtkborof"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.201902,50.741644]}},{"properties":{"name":"My 10/10/10","description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5771522059/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2443/5771522059_4c4d238972.jpg\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5771522059/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/simple_new_window_default.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"13\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5771522059/\">Open photo page</a>\n\t\t\t\t\tConcluding the series of shots I took on 10th October as part of my 10/10/10 set I decided to put together this collage to represent a snapshot of how I spent this rather unique date in time.  These are not necessarily the best shots I took but I feel they do encapsulate how I spent my 10/10/10.  \nMy day began in the early hours of the 10th October as I finished shooting and editing shots for two of the most personally challenging and controversial compositions I have ever created, to commemorate World Mental Health Day.  With a fine autumnal day forecast I decided to head out of town on my motorbike on Sunday, but it was only as I was hurtling along the M25 approaching Junction 5 that I decided upon Hastings as my destination rather than the gardens at RHS Wisley.    \nThe devastating fire damage of 5th October on Hastings Pier was too irresistible a subject to pass up photographing for posterity, as if I needed an excuse to spend a day down on the South Coast.  It was also an ideal outing to try out the new circular polarising filter I had bought for my camera.  \nAll in all I spent an eventful day visiting Hastings, Eastbourne and Birling Gap, although the photography was disappointing because my camera's auto-focus started behaving erratically with unsightly dirt marks on many of my photographs; which I have since found out is caused by dirt on the sensor! :-O\n&lt;a href=\"http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:5771522059\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;See where this picture was taken.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/geotagging/discuss/72157594165549916/\"&gt;[?]&lt;/a&gt;<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\">Taken on 10th October, 2010&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?id=63169691@N06&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\"><b>Marc-John Photographic</b></a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_tag_left.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"><a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=selfportrait&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">selfportrait</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=beach&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">beach</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=self&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">self</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=geotagged&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">geotagged</a> ...<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_public.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"> Anyone can see this location","id":"a64kwtpa0tom"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.572025,50.853313]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rockpools, Birling Gap","description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760011572/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5181/5760011572_b8f1d633d1.jpg\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760011572/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/simple_new_window_default.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"13\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760011572/\">Open photo page</a>\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter visiting Hastings and Eastbourne the main reason I rode to Birling Gap was to test out my camera with the new Neutral Density ND 0.9 Circular Polarising Filter I had purchased.

Quite naturally I felt shocked and saddened to learn of Ralph's death.  I think it would be fair to say Ralph was old school in many ways and our relationship had it's up's  as well as a few low points, but the abiding memory I have of my dealings with Ralph was his absolute devotion and professionalism to a job he loved, and, indeed returned to, offering his wealth of experience part-time, even after his official retirement a couple of years ago.  It was largely thanks to Ralph's tenacity and persistence that I was referred for psycho-therapy and drawing on his year's of experience that my mental health condition was formally assessed and finally diagnosed after more than three decades of suffering.  Ralph was the type to fight your corner even when others were sceptical and he left no stone unturned in assuring every patient in his care received recognition and an appropriate treatment plan, giving a sense of hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel during dark times.  He was also forthright in articulating challenging opinions on occasion and never shy about extolling his own virtues, but strangely this was an endearing quality to the man and never diminished the respect he could command from patients and colleagues alike.  Sadly I only learnt of Ralph's death after his funeral had taken place, so as an act of remembrance to Ralph and the contribution he made to keeping me safe during difficult times I am dedicating this shot I took at Birling Gap yesterday to his memory!  \nR.I.P.

These are not necessarily the best shots I took but I feel they do encapsulate how I spent my 10/10/10.  \nMy day began in the early hours of the 10th October as I finished shooting and editing shots for two of the most personally challenging and controversial compositions I have ever created, to commemorate World Mental Health Day.  \nWith a fine autumnal day forecast I decided to head out of town on my motorbike on Sunday, but it was only as I was hurtling along the M25 approaching Junction 5 that I decided upon Hastings as my destination rather than the gardens at RHS Wisley.    \nThe devastating fire damage of 5th October on Hastings Pier was too irresistible a subject to pass up photographing for posterity, as if I needed an excuse to spend a day down on the South Coast.  It was also an ideal outing to try out the new circular polarising filter I had bought for my camera.  \nAll in all I spent an eventful day visiting Hastings, Eastbourne and Birling Gap, although the photography was disappointing because my camera's auto-focus started behaving erratically with unsightly dirt marks on many of my photographs; which I have since found out is caused by dirt on the sensor! :-O\n&lt;a href=\"http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:5759481645\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;See where this picture was taken.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/geotagging/discuss/72157594165549916/\"&gt;[?]&lt;/a&gt;<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\">Taken on 10th October, 2010&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?id=63169691@N06&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\"><b>Marc-John Photographic</b></a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_tag_left.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"><a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=blackandwhite&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">blackandwhite</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=bw&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">bw</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=selfportrait&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">selfportrait</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=beach&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">beach</a> ...<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_public.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"> Anyone can see this location","id":"a64kwto7xt4t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.572025,50.853313]}},{"properties":{"name":"Selfie {Street Style}","description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760019042/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/5760019042_6cdbdf71c9.jpg\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760019042/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/simple_new_window_default.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"13\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760019042/\">Open photo page</a>\n\t\t\t\t\tWith a sunny day forecast after the murk of recent weeks I decided to ride down to the South Coast to take a few shots to mark 10.10.10.  My first port of call was Hastings to photograph the fire damage to the Pier then I rode into Eastbourne and finally across to Birling Gap to test out the new neutral density circular polarising filter I bought for my camera.  I hadn't planned on doing any sunbathing but the weather was sunny and very warm when I got to Birling Gap, with the Cliffs providing natural shelter from the cool breeze.  I wasn't dressed for beach weather and hadn't brought a towel so I decided to spare beach-goers the sight of my boxer shorts and sufficed by rolling up the legs of my jeans.  I took these two shots just before sunset when it was still comfortably warm, although I probably should have lost the socks which look a bit naff in a beach shot.   I did draw the line at making a handkerchief sunhat.  lol lol  I took the first shot with my kit lens which is SOOC and just cropped and the second with my Tamron lens using the settings I would normally use for taking street photography.<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\">Taken on 10th October, 2010&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?id=63169691@N06&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\"><b>Marc-John Photographic</b></a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_tag_left.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"><a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=selfportrait&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">selfportrait</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=beach&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">beach</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=socks&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">socks</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=self&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">self</a> ...<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_public.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"> Anyone can see this location","id":"a64kwtuqjccg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.201775,50.741775]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hasting Pier fire damaged east side","description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5759446921/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3192/5759446921_e6b3e60892.jpg\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5759446921/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/simple_new_window_default.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"13\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5759446921/\">Open photo page</a>\n\t\t\t\t\tFollowing a devastating fire on Hastings Pier on 5th October 2010, which it is estimated destroyed 95% of the superstructure of the Pier, I rode down to the South Coast to photograph the sad sight of this once grand old lady of the Victorian era.\nWhilst the fire damage is indeed quite devastating to behold, to my layman's eye it would appear much of the Pier's ironwork is relatively intact so I do hope that investment can be found to raise this Pier from the ashes. \n=====================================================================\nHastings Pier was designed by architect and renown Pier builder Eugenius Birch (who also designed Eastbourne Pier, West Pier and Brighton Pier) and opened to the public on  5th August 1872.

The Hastings Pier &amp;amp; White Rock Trust (HPWRT) was established to raise funds through various means to renovate the pier and in February 2010 Hastings Borough Council agreed in principle to a compulsory purchase order of the Pier submitted by the Hastings Pier &amp;amp; White Rock Trust.<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\">Taken on 10th October, 2010&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?id=63169691@N06&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\"><b>Marc-John Photographic</b></a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_tag_left.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"><a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=fire&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">fire</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=pier&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">pier</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=seaside&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">seaside</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=victorian&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">victorian</a> ...<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_public.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"> Anyone can see this location","id":"a64kwtmajff9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.57088,50.853069]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yucca Spike","description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760000844/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5262/5760000844_75222ef618.jpg\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760000844/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/simple_new_window_default.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"13\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63169691@N06/5760000844/\">Open photo page</a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\">Taken on 10th October, 2010&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?id=63169691@N06&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\"><b>Marc-John Photographic</b></a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_tag_left.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"><a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=seaside&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">seaside</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=kitlens&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">kitlens</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=flowering&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">flowering</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=spike&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">spike</a> ...<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_public.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"> Anyone can see this location","id":"a64kwtnjyocv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.585322,50.855041]}},{"properties":{"name":"^","description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rabbitriot/5870786688/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5038/5870786688_08a6789b5e.jpg\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rabbitriot/5870786688/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/simple_new_window_default.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"13\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rabbitriot/5870786688/\">Open photo page</a>\n\t\t\t\t\tTierpark Goldau, Switzerland\n&lt;b&gt;Canon EOS 5D | Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8&lt;/b&gt;\n10/10/2010<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\">Taken on 10th October, 2010&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?id=16366682@N00&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\"><b>Rolf F.</b></a><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_tag_left.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"><a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=urban&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">urban</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=canon&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">canon</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=fence&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">fence</a>,&amp;nbsp; <a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=landscape&amp;format=kml_nl&amp;lang=en-us\">landscape</a> ...<img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/icon_public.gif\" height=\"15\" width=\"15\"> Anyone can see this location","id":"a64kwtlxxcb6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[8.555731,47.050717]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=101010&lang=en-us&format=kml_nl","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Flickr","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=101010&lang=en-us&format=kml_nl","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"101010","published":"2010-10-10T14:00:00Z","id":67401}
