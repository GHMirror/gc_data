General John Hood’s scouts spotted General John Geary’s force.  The Confederates then entrenched and waited for General Geary to strike.  Union troops advanced and struck Major General Alexander Stewart’s division along the road and Brigadier General Marcellus Stovall’s division in the church cemetery.  General Joseph Hooker became disoriented and confused by poor maps and a lack of communications.  General Hooker decided to wait until he received reinforcements and fresh orders.  Sherman’s orders were to attack in attempt to flank the Rebels before they could fortify.  Unfortunately for Hooker, the Confederate forces were already entrenched, and his pause gave them additional time to fortify their earthworks with logs, brush, and especially briars, which they would cut down and pile in front of their positions in order to help prevent infantry penetration of the lines.  Hooker’s attempts to advance were repulsed.  The battle, which lasted through the 26th, was fought during a bad thunderstorm, which made conditions even worse for the Federals, who were unable to dislodge the Rebel forces.  Union losses included approximately 1,600 dead, while Confederate losses were between 500-750.  Because of the battlefield defeats and jungle-like conditions of the area, such as the intense thunderstorms, heavy tree canopy, dense forests with near zero visability, dense underbrush with absolute-zero visability, swamps, lack of population, unbearable heat and humidity, the Union soldiers who fought at New Hope Church, Pickett’s Mill, and Dallas, nicknamed Paulding County, “The Hell Hole.”\r\n\r\nSome people live in the Big Apple, some live in the City of Angels, others live in the Windy City.

This is in stark contrast to the other two battles that took place here in Paulding County, New Hope Church and Dallas. Of course, Dallas has been developed for years, and the city continues to grow, but New Hope Community has seen only recent development, but it has been dramatic, and now most of the former battlefield is paved over. I guess we could now call it the Battle of Publix Shopping Center. Metro Atlanta has a bad reputation for paving over its history. Enough preaching. \r\n\r\nThe Battle of Picketts Mill was an absolute fiasco as Union forces attempting to \"turn the corner\" of the Dallas-New Hope Line walked into a trap. Ironically, the most prominent factor that led to their defeat was a lack of good maps of the area. Union officers marched their men through a dense forest in an attempt to engage the opposing Confederate line. In order to do this, they had to march down an extremely steep ravine, and climb back up the steep creek bank on the other side of Picketts Mill Creek. They attempted this under direct fire from perfectly positioned Confederate artillery. The result was an awful bloodbath, from which the Union officers reluctantly withdrew. \r\n\r\nA paraphrased description complete with personal corrections and some of my own commentary thrown in: \r\n\r\nPickett’s Mill is named after Benjamin and Malachi Pickett who moved to the rugged and densely forested ridges west of Kennesaw (known then as Big Shanty) to build a business and provide for their families. General William Tecumseh Sherman moved there to avoid a battle. Late on a Friday afternoon in Spring of 1864, 14,000 Union troops from Major General Oliver Howard’s 4th Army Corps moved towards the Pickett’s farm and grist mill on Pickett’s Mill Creek (some mistakenly call it Little Pumpkinvine Creek) and one of the worst Federal defeats during the Atlanta Campaign. Concerning the confusion of the creeks, most people also confuse Little Pumpkinvine Creek with Pumpkinvine Creek. I read a website that described the Battle of Pickett’s Mill, and it claimed that Pumpkinvine Creek empties about four miles from it’s source. Whoever wrote that must have been referring to Little Pumpkinvine Creek or some other creek because Pumpkinvine Creek flows from its source in the Southwest part of Paulding County to the Northeast corner of the county and beyond into Bartow County. I know for a fact that the distance must be at least ten miles; probably closer to 20 miles from source to mouth. \r\n\r\nThe background story behind the Battle of Pickett’s Mill began ten days earlier, when General William Sherman occupied Kingston in Bartow County. It took a mere two weeks for General Sherman to march half the distance from Chattanooga to Atlanta. He successfully avoided General Joseph Johnston’s entrenched lines by outflanking him at Dalton and Resaca. General Johnston fell back to Allatoona Pass where he set a trap for Sherman. Allatoona Pass was a narrow railroad cut through a mountain and whoever controlled the pass controlled the bridge over Allatoona Creek (now apart of Allatoona Lake). This point is eight miles east of Kingston. The Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad was Sherman’s supply line. Unfortunately for Johnston, Sherman had been stationed at Marietta before the war, and he was well aware of the inevitability of the Confederates’ intention to set a trap at Allatoona Pass. Regardless, Sherman had to find a way to dislodge the Rebels from Allatoona Pass so that he could get his army back on the railroad. \r\n\r\nSherman decided to march south into the Paulding County wilderness. This was extremely risky because it presented the problem of trying to feed an army of 100,000 deep in enemy territory. Plus as his distance from the rail line increased, the number of soldiers he would need to divert to wagon train guard duty had to increase proportionally. These wagon lines became more and more vulnerable the deeper he went into Paulding County. \r\n\r\nGeneral Joseph Hooker encountered resistance near a church northeast of Dallas. General Hooker was confused by inaccurate maps and poor communications, so he decided to wait for reinforcements. Sherman orders an attack in an attempt to outflank the Confederates before they get a chance to fortify the position. The Battle of New Hope Church shocks Sherman because he wasn’t expecting stiff resistance there. \r\n\r\nUnion forces were caught flat footed by Confederate forces who had rapidly moved southwest from Allatoona Pass to check Sherman’s flanking maneuver, which had put Powder Springs in jeopardy along with a direct route into Atlanta from the due west. Federal troops quickly began to suffer from lack of supplies. Sherman ordered General Oliver Howard to attack the left flank of the Confederate Army. General George Thomas, Commander of the Army of the Cumberland and General Howard scouted the area just to the northeast of New Hope Church. They decided to attack what appeared to be the end of the Confederate line at Pickett’s Mill. \r\n\r\nWith Pickett’s Mill Creek to the east, troops under the command of Brigadier General William Hazen begin an assault on the Confederate line, which was heavily fortified. Although General William Hazen knew the advance was a mistake, he followed orders anyway. General Hazen’s soldiers were up against one of the South’s best commanders, Brigadier General Patrick Cleburne. \r\n\r\nAt 4:30 PM, Hazen approaches the Confederate line. Many of his troops got lost in the dense forest during the initial advance and wound up east of the intended objective. Hazen’s support on the right flank was pinned down by dismounted Confederate cavalry firing from the top of a ravine down into the Union troops below who were trying to cross the creek. Very rapidly, the bulk of Hazen’s force found themselves stranded in one of the few open areas of the battlefield, and they subsequently came under merciless fire. Reinforcements from the main Union line were held up by the thick underbrush. When Hazen realized that reinforcements wouldn\\'t arrive in time, he ordered a retreat. \r\n\r\nAt 6:00 PM, General Thomas Woods ordered a second attack. Although Hazen had made some advances, the second attack ended in disaster when Colonel William Gibson’s brigade was totally routed by General Patrick Cleburne’s men. \r\n\r\nBrigadier General Hiram Granbury successfully repulsed Federal attacks and he requested and received permission from General Cleburne to sweep the area in front of the Confederate earthworks for Union troops. At 10:00 PM General Hiram Granbury’s Texans began the counterattack. The Federals got off one volley against the counterattack and then fell into full retreat. \r\n\r\nAfter the battle, Patrick Cleburne estimated 3,000 Union casualties, with at least 1,500 of them killed. By contrast, the Rebels lost only about 500 troops. Therefore, the Battle of Pickett’s Mill was a decisive victory for the Confederacy. For the first time during the Atlanta Campaign, Sherman had to worry about a possible retreat. He realized that he had driven too deep into unfamiliar territory and that he had no choice but to try to break out to the east-northeast in order to get back to the rail line, even if it meant besieging the Confederate fortifications at Allatoona Pass. On May 29, Sherman began to shift troops along the Dallas Line to the north and east to prepare for a break out. Fortunately for Sherman, on June 1, he received the news that Allatoona Pass had been taken by General George Stoneman’s cavalry with little resistance. In fact, precisely because Sherman had driven so deep south, the Confederate Army of Tennessee had to scramble most of the defensive force that they had at Allatoona Pass down to Paulding County in order to prevent Sherman from taking Powder Springs and approaching Atlanta directly from the west.
