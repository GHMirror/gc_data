It is one of the \"most innovative, best-designed\" shopping centers in the state, says architecture critic Alan Hess. \r\n\r\nThe center was part of the neighborhood design scheme of Joseph Eichler, one of the key shapers of the city of Palo Alto (builder of 2,700 homes in the city) and a forward-looking planner who desired to bring good architecture to the masses. \r\n\r\nEichler designed the center to match the surrounding homes in a an experimental scheme much praised by future planners. As architect Mark Marcinik put it, \"we see the traditional building techniques (wood, post and beam construction) turned into grand experiments of space, structure, light and views...They always seem to be pointing to the infinite horizon and convey the spirit of westward expansion.\"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx4qi5ga"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.12572,37.44785]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ananda: Chruch at Center of Sex Scandal","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/ananda12.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/EWstoreFront.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/swami.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/1/swami2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/pa0_027.jpg\">2171 El Camino Real is home to the Ananda Church of Self-Realization, a religion (some say cult) that has a worldwide membership, including some 100-200 Palo Altans.   Ananda also owns the East-West bookstore that operates out of Mountain View (one of the largest new-age bookstores in the nation), as well as seven communes in the United States, Australia and Italy.\r\n\r\nBut in 1996 the Ananda commune in Palo Alto became the heart of a curious sex scandal that led to the resignation of its leader, the Swami Kriyananda (aka J. Donald Walters).  The Swami has written more than 60 books about Ananda, the religion he co-founded in 1968.\r\n\r\n28 year old Anne-Marie Bertolucci, who had left her marriage and job to move into the Ananda commune, claimed that she was manipulated by senior minister Danny Levin to have sex with him and the Swami himself.  She also charged the Swami with using his authority as a spiritual leader to systematically seduce young female congregation members.  Sure enough, 7 other women soon came forward saying that they were manipulated into \"servicing\" the Swami---sometimes in trysts involving two women at a time.  This was complicated by the fact that living a life of celibacy is a fundamental tenant for Kriyananda, according to his writings and church members.  \r\n\r\nDisgraced, Swami Kriyananda admitted to the sex, but claimed that the girls were all willing participants.  The jury in Bertolucci\\'s harassment case did not agree---awarding her more than .5 million all told in the civil and criminal trials. \r\n\r\nThe Swami paid up, although Ananda itself was deemed not responsible for his actions.  Over time, Swami Kriyananda seems to have worked himself back into the organization in a somewhat unofficial role---but he is all over the Ananda website.  Since then the church on El Camino has continued their practices, but stayed out of the headlines.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxcg1pa4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14762,37.42676]}},{"properties":{"name":"Antonio's Nut House and the Noise Complaints","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/ant3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/nuthouse2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/nuthouse5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/leafblower_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/shoreline.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/shoreline2.jpg\">All local politicians probably spend more time than they would wish listening to noise complaints.  When looking back at the history of a city like Palo Alto, it’s hard to overestimate the amount of government time devoted to discussing noise-related issues.  And of course, city lawmakers can never win---because bar owners, elderly homeowners, leaf-blower users, and mothers of sleeping babies all have very different ideas of what is loud.\r\n\r\nAs Palo Alto has moved headlong into the 21st Century, there have been increasing disagreements over noise.  Some residents who still remember Palo Alto’s days as a sleepy town surrounded by farms and apricot groves have been slow to accept the realities of urban noise.  For some old-schoolers, newfangled inventions like jet airliners and rock n’ roll music seem to be at the heart of the debate.  Other proponents of noise reduction seem to have more reasonable claims.  Behind all this noisy complaining about noise, the question remains, what type of city does Palo Alto want to be?\r\n\r\nLeaf blowers have been in the headlines since 1972.  For years, many Palo Altans wanted them banned altogether, complaining that the high-decibel leaf blowers were a constant neighborhood headache.  The issue has been charged with more than just noise pollution, however.  Some felt that racism against the users of the blowers---mostly Latino yard-workers---was a hidden component of the debate.  Many workers, with little ones in tow, have frequented City Council meetings to say that their jobs and thereby, families, would be threatened by a ban.   In 2005, the Council played Solomon, banning all gas-powered leaf blowers, but shying away from amendments to ban electric ones as well.\r\n\r\nOther Palo Alto noise complaints seemed unlikely to lead to any actual changes in behavior or laws.  For instance, Palo Alto representatives were rejected by an airport roundtable of nearby cities that meet to discuss the noise jet airliners made on their final descent into SFO.  One Palo Alto woman wrote to the Weekly that SFO jets woke her up 46 separate times one day when she was sick in bed.  But other cities have basically rolled their eyes at such complaints.   \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Palo Alto has proved more-or-less powerless in a continual campaign to quiet down the rock bands playing Saturday nights at Mountain View’s Shoreline Amphitheatre.   Since 1985 when Shoreline was built, there have been so many complaints from South Palo Alto residents that the City Council officially purchased noise monitoring equipment.  The issue has not exactly helpful to Palo Alto-Mountain View relations.  When Palo Alto asked Mountain View to pass an ordinance fining Shoreline whenever concert noise exceeds 98 decibels, the Mountain View City Council voted 7-0 to reject it.  \r\n\r\nUndeterred, the Palo Alto police department set up a special website for their residents to register noise complaints online.  These cyber-complaints are then passed on to the Mountain View City Council to…er...take under consideration.  As to how much time Mountain View sets aside for such consideration, is anybody’s guess.\r\n\r\nAnd then there have been the continual battles over bars and clubs, especially near California Avenue---the host for such late-night bars as Antonio’s Nut House, as well as residential dwellings like the Birch Court condominiums.  These not so chummy neighbors have had a decade-long dispute regarding the staggering bar revelers exiting the Nut House circa two in the morning and the condo sleepers disturbed in the middle of their REM.  The Council has tried to mediate---requiring the Nut House to post signs warning exiting customers about the noise, setting up a complaint line for nearby residents, even considering limiting Nut House hours.  Still Antonio’s, a distinctive and popular bar, is a Palo Alto icon of sorts and the Council has been hesitant to restrict their business in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, the PAPD even earmarked nearly 8,000 to pay for a noise consultant to deal with noise issues that ranged from the infamous leaf blower to train whistles, loud vehicles, church bells and generators. But perhaps there is no balance to be had on this issue.  Palo Alto has a thriving nightlife scene, is home to a university, and maintains a young, urban, white-collar population.  It is also a quiet residential town that could be described as “sleepy,” just two decades ago.  All of these folks are jumbled close together in a city with tiny backyards and mixed zoning.  It seems probable that City Council members will be hearing noise complaints for some years to come. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx9xkmaf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14393,37.42711]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cantor Center for Visual Arts","description":"Posted by Narwal<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/287_8727.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/287_8728.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/287_8731.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/287_8732.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/287_8748.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/287_8749.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/339_3934.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/339_3966.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/340_4008.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/339_3931.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/340_4022.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/338_3867_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/11/0/338_3885.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx9718vl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.170575857,37.4329799583]}},{"properties":{"name":"Christmas Tree Lane: A Palo Alto Tradition","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/dec24_011.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/xmas5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/xmas2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/xmas4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/xmas3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/xmastreelane1949.jpg\">1830 Fulton Street, Palo Alto, CaliforniaWhile Palo Alto has many of the benefits of a big city---thriving shopping districts, refined cultural life, world-class restaurants---it has also retained many of the charming traits of a small town.  The city government has worked hard to limit growth, maintain historic buildings and keep construction at a human-sized scale (and the few architectural exceptions like city hall and the 525 University office building stick out like sore thumbs).   But there are scenes in Palo Alto which can appear surprisingly quaint for a city that lies in the heart of the sprawling 21st century Bay Area with its endless strip malls, freeways and techie office parks.  \r\n\r\nPicture a crossing guard waving the swarm of middle school bikers across Embarcadero as they ride back home to their neighborhood houses.  Or take Saturday night on University as folks stroll from the Stanford movie house hosting Capra films past their diagonally parked cars to get a treat from an ice-cream parlor. Very Norman Rockwell.\r\n\r\nBut nothing Palo Alto has out-Rockwells Christmas Tree Lane, known as Fulton Street the rest of the year where, in 1940, neighbors spontaneously decided to decorate the entire street with Christmas lights.  Sixty-six years later, on any night during the Christmas season, dozens of cars slowly roll down Fulton Street with headlights off, child noses pressed against the back window, looking at the lights.\r\n\r\nThe tradition began around a bridge game when Judge Edward Hardy, George English and their wives decided to decorate the entire street with lit Christmas trees. They set up stakes along the length of the street adorned with miniature Douglas firs decorated with Christmas lights.  Over six decades Christmas Tree Lane has survived as homeowners have come and gone, lights were extinguished for war regulations (1942) and an energy crisis (1973), and occasional tree rustlers struck.\r\n\r\nToday the tradition not only lives on, but it has gotten better with time.  Decorated houses have become increasingly intricate, city utility crews change all streetlights on the lane from white to red, elementary school carolers sing for passers-by, and Christmastreelane.org has truly added a Silicon Valley spin to an old-fashioned tradition.\r\n\r\nSo next time you’re sitting in some of that modern-day Palo Alto traffic, don’t forget there are still some small-town traditions that make it all worthwhile.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxbh4e4r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.13955,37.44098]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Palo Alto Lives On","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/4/1890.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/4/1901.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/4/stanford_s_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/4/tree_map.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/4/1875.jpg\">Palo Alto\\'s namesake came from a very distinctive looking (originally double-trunked) tree that towers above San Francisquito Creek. The tree was the site of a camp set up by Gaspar de Portola from which his parties explored much of the San Francisco Bay. \r\n\r\nIn 1876, California Governor Leland Stanford purchased 650 acres of El Rancho San Francisquito for a country home and his famous Palo Alto Stock Farm for trotting horses. This property became Stanford University. The Palo Alto name was later adopted by the city that grew up beside the University. In the winter of 1886, one of the trunks of El Palo Alto fell, leaving a lone 110 foot tree that has stood over 1,000 years.  El Palo Alto makes for a charming and historically significant symbol for a city that is steeped in history.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx8gcpw3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16952,37.4469]}},{"properties":{"name":"High Street Parking Garage (Fueling the Auto City)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/parking2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/parking3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/parking5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/parking6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/parking.jpg\">The downfall of the American City in the second half of the 20th Century is really the story of the automobile.  As cities reprioritized around cars, they tore down what made them great---a walkable community of storefronts, apartments and businesses---and put up parking lots and freeways to get people in and out quickly.  Most American cities lost their downtown shopping cores, building large steel and concrete slabs and skyscrapers to house downtown workers.  But downtown no longer became a destination, instead just a place to work.  Suburban malls took over and many cities became ghost towns at night. \r\n\r\nTime and again, shops, housing, restaurants, and walkable little streets were lost to parking and freeways.  The problem is that the more parking and freeways you build, the more you need.  City planners now know that when cities build more freeways to alleviate traffic, it is a temporary solution at best.  Soon more cars start making the trip, workers move further out of town to purchase cheaper houses, and the traffic snarls all over again.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Palo Alto has not lost the beauty and vibrancy of its downtown.  It has, however, struggled with parking for at least half a century.  Like many other cities, it has been victims of the “if you build it, they will come” phenomenon.  City Manager George Morgan recalled in the early 1970’s that his first assignment when he joined the city in 1952 (as assistant to the city manager) was to \"solve the downtown parking problem.\"  Twenty years later he said, “That problem will never be solved.”  That’s because as Palo Alto builds more parking structures, it simply increases the number of single-occupancy vehicles driving downtown.  \r\n\r\nThere are other possible solutions to building parking lots as far as they eye can see.  Many think it is cheaper to pay people not to drive. For instance, businesses can offer employees transit passes or cash to bike or car pool.  Often it\\'s cheaper to pay an employee 0 a month to leave his car at home than 00 per month to build and operate a parking space.  There is also the obvious environmental impact of luring more and more cars downtown.  \r\n\r\nMany see the solution in less cars downtown, not more.  Some propose carrot solutions, other sticks.  Many environmentalists have suggested providing more city buses and Caltrain routes.  Others suggest parking meters to discourage so much car travel.\r\n\r\nDespite all these concerns, in April 1997, Palo Alto decided to build two enormous sized parking structures.  It cost 2 million, bringing the cost-per-space to a stunning 5,476---and the city already owned the land.  Palo Alto gained 905 new parking spaces, but also had to relocate the city’s teen center to do it.  \r\n\r\nWhy did they do this?  \r\n\r\nBecause there is so much support for parking structures.  Besides construction companies that get the lucrative contracts, parking is favored by powerful downtown business interests who believe it will help draw customers.  Furthermore, parking gets support from surrounding neighbors fed up with “spillover” ---those who park on residential streets and then go to work or shop in downtown.\r\n\r\nThe Lot R Parking Structure now stands five stories high behind the Blockbuster video on Alma Street.  According to both workers and shoppers, parking still remains a problem downtown, but ironically, the two new structures remain underutilized.  Some drivers say they are too far from the places they want to shop.  Others are in the dark about where the new parking structures are.  \r\n\t\r\n2 million. That’s lot of money for a half-empty parking structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxcehqdc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16304,37.44339]}},{"properties":{"name":"Institute for the Future","description":"Posted by Anthonymobile<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/59891582_0dec5a57bf.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/23/29082062_0b725f5e62.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/9/69586263_20cf9ae5d7.jpg?v=0\">124 university ave, palo alto, 94301<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx2yet4f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.163519,37.443821]}},{"properties":{"name":"Memorial Church","description":"Posted by Narwal<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/288_8852.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/288_8859.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/288_8877.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/288_8878.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/288_8885.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/289_8921.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbwzu589d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.170339823,37.4270246665]}},{"properties":{"name":"Miyake: Frat Party Sushi","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/miyake_01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/miyake_02.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/miyake_04.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/miyakeroom.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/miy7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/1900miyake.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/miy.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/miy6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> While Miyake Sushi may not be known for Palo Alto’s most heavenly-tasting sushi (that honor usually goes to Fuki Sushi out on El Camino), it is consistently praised for price and atmosphere.  Even when it was across the street in a location so small you could barely squeeze between the bar and a single row of tables, the atmosphere was loud and the prices were low.  \r\n\r\nMiyake opened in 1985 and since hopping over to its larger venue at 146 University (the old Fraternal Hall), it has won many “Best Of” awards, in part because of its rollicking fun.   By day, Miyake is a reasonably-priced business-lunch location, but by night (at least on Friday and Saturday nights), Miyake basically becomes a night club that happens to serve Japanese food.  Disco light swirl overhead, dance music blares and Stanford party crowds start pouring in the front door.  Every few minutes a group of sake-bombers---that is, those who drink a cup of sake dropped in a glass of beer---stand up on their chairs and down a few more.  If there are enough in the group, the management even stops the music so that everyone watches.  So if you are looking to get your party started, Miyake is the place for sushi.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor \"Then and Now\" pictures go to:<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx4ruqkz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16335,37.44391]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pizza My Heart: Surfer Pizza, New York Style","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/pmh2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/pmh.jpg\">220 University Ave, Palo Alto, CA220 University lost a Burger King in 2001 and gained a Pizza My Heart, the slice-heavy, thin crust pizza joint that started in 1981 in surfer hangout Capitola Beach.

As in many cities which have attempted outdoor smoking bans, the issue was divisive.  In this case, not only were smokers and non-smokers on opposite sides of the issue, but for many Palo Altans, homelessness was also at the heart of the matter.\r\n\r\nMark Badger expressed a point of view in the Palo Weekly in 1995 that \"Implementing the ban is clearly a move against the homeless people.  There are only a few places in Palo Alto where people smoke while stationary. Outside Starbucks and Noah\\'s, Rodger\\'s and Il Fornaio. Where do the disadvantaged hang out? Outside Starbucks and Noah\\'s, Rodger\\'s and Il Fornaio, of course! It\\'s a ruse. A pejorative effort to fashion Palo Alto into a model divorced from reality.\"\r\n\r\nSmoking has become increasingly outlawed in Palo Alto, as in most places in the United States.  Palo Alto passed some of the state\\'s first smoking restrictions when it banned smoking in theaters in 1974.  In 1977, the regulations were expanded to require 25 percent of a restaurant\\'s space be non-smoking, and then in 1981, 50 percent. In 1982, the city established an ordinance allowing the creation of non-smoking areas in the workplace, which was strengthened the next year. In 1991, the city banned smoking in restaurants completely. \r\n\r\nIn 1993 the Council extended smoking restrictions to indoor and outdoor \"service locations,\" which include bus and train shelters, ticket or service lines, and public telephones. Whoa, to the chain smoker who spends a great deal of time working or living in Palo Alto.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxdkldtk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.161638,37.445639]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Accidental Death of Ted Brassinga","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/4/brassing.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/pa_029.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/pa_026.jpg\">Palo Alto reserve officer Ted Brassinga was shot and killed by a Mountain View police officer during a 1994 training exercise. The incident took place in Gilroy as cops were preparing for World Cup crowds expected later that summer at Stanford Stadium. \r\n\r\nAs 33 year old Brassinga played the \"bad guy\" in the SWAT-team exercise, he was shot in the chest by a Mountain View officer who accidentally had a bullet in his gun. \r\n\r\nBrassinga had volunteered to act as a terrorist in a simulated hostage takeover with police officers from Mountain View, Palo Alto and Los Altos who are members of the North County Regional SWAT team. He was given a toy gun and hid in a luggage rack on the second floor of a car, waiting for the SWAT team to storm the train. \r\n\r\nMountain View officer Greg Acton was the first to enter, and as he passed Brassinga\\'s hiding spot, Brassinga emerged and \"dry fired\" his toy gun, according to court documents. Acton, carrying his own 9mm pistol, pointed at Brassinga\\'s chest and fired. The gun was loaded and Brassinga was fatally shot. \r\n\r\nA weapons check had been ordered, but Acton\\'s gun was never checked by Acton or by the Mountain View police unit that was in charge of the exercise. \r\n\r\n2 years later his family (he had a wife and young son) won a wrongful death suit against the city of Mountain View and was awarded .25 million from a jury. \r\n\r\nA memorial plaque is now at a tree in Johnson Park to honor Brassinga, only the third officer to die in the line of duty in Palo Alto History. \r\n\r\nThe incident led some departments to use plastic non-guns in their training scenarios. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx6tdmih"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16363,37.44933]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Blue Chalk Cafe: The Down Home Singles Scene","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/blue_chalk.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/blue_chalk2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/blue_chalkweb_page2_43.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> The Blue Chalk Café across from City Hall helped usher in the after-dark Palo Alto downtown that has thrived since the early 1990’s. Pretty much dead after nightfall in the 1970’s and 80’s (Baskin-Robbins and Round Table were about the hottest spots around), the downtown area now draws the singles crowds to Blue Chalk, Gordon Biersch, O\\'Connell\\'s, Fanny &amp; Alexander\\'s and the Empire Tap Room. Indeed this historically tee-totaling town which served its first legal cocktail in just 1971, is now perhaps the most popular nightlife mecca between San Jose and Frisco. \r\n\r\nAt the Birge Clark-designed split level (and historically landmarked) building at 630 Ramona, the college-aged crowd shoots pool on blue-felted tables, revel by the gas fireplace, and play darts and shuffleboard. Not that long ago this hot spot for nightlife was the London House English Tea Room (1969-1993), full of women drinking tea. Now the building is loud, extremely crowded and overcome by hip-hop music. \r\n\r\nBlue Chalk serves up a southern fare with a California twist in a two-floored ambiance that serves as part restaurant, part pool hall, part singles bar. The \"down home\" Southern cuisine and authentic Southern folk art makes for a unique atmosphere that has attracted such famous visitors as Kevin Costner, Barry Bonds, and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. \r\n\r\nDuke Rohlen and Maurice Werdegar opened the Blue Chalk Café in 1992 based on a business plan that Werdegar wrote while studying for his MBA at Stanford Business School. Since then, the two childhood friends have been work-a-holics also opening a series of Left at Albuquerque restaurants, including one a few blocks away on Emerson Street. \r\n\r\nThey have also been involved in keeping Palo Alto’s decidedly stodgier representatives from hampering the singles life in downtown. For instance, they were one of the businesses that helped push the Council to exempt outdoor smoking after 10pm from a controversial anti-outside smoking ordinance passed in 1995.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx7k5o3j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16062,37.44415]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Children's Theatre: Good Government at Work","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/childrens2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/childrens3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/childrens4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/childrens1940.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/childrens.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Good liberals, who know their history, often reminisce of the days of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal---a time when government was on the side of the little guy, the common man.  While conservatives may believe that the government that governs best, governs least, old-time liberals (be they actual old-timers or not) reject such laissez-faire notions.  They see government being involved in a wide range of important tasks, from creating a social safety net to protecting citizens from racism to creating a vibrant atmosphere for the arts.\r\n\r\nThese good government liberals who still dream about an active pro-arts government--- lending financial support to painters, constructing opera halls, and creating community theatre projects--- might well boost their spirits, in this age of Bush, with a visit to the Children’s Theatre in Palo Alto.  \r\nIn 1932, during those heady days of liberalism, The Children’s Theatre’s first play “The Perfect Gift” was commissioned by the Mayor\\'s Committee for Unemployment Relief.  By 1937, they had won their own venue at 1305 Middlefield Road donated by generous Palo Alto benefactor Lucie Stern.  Public theatre, funded by government, had come to Palo Alto. Even today, funding for the Palo Alto Children\\'s Theatre comes from the city. The current budget is over a half a million dollars, plus use of the building, facilities and utilities. Ticket prices are set by the City Council, and the money collected goes back to the city. Prices have been kept low,  for adults and  for children, making the Children\\'s Theatre an inexpensive entertainment option for families. \r\n\r\nThe experiment of “children” (16 to 24 year olds) performing for children was extremely popular from its inception.  “Child actors for child audiences,” was the Theatre’s early motto.  Throughout its long span, the theater has filled to an average of 95 percent of capacity and most shows still sell out.\r\nIn the 1940’s, the Children’s Theatre became the pride of Palo Alto as none other than The New York Times published two articles on the organization. The Palo Alto Children\\'s Theatre was also featured in Life magazine that year--it was supposed to be the cover story, but it was bumped by the bombing of Hiroshima and the end of World War II.  Understandable, I guess.  The Children\\'s Theatre also had a half-hour weekly local radio show--\"Under the Red Tile Roof\"--in the 1940s, which drew national sponsorship.  In the 1950s, the youth theater group performed \"Rumplestiltskin\" on KRON television in San Francisco.  They also produced seven short films--such as \"Pudge,\" which was about the group\\'s mascot, a cute cocker spaniel with big, floppy ears. \r\n\r\nAs the oldest children’s theatre in the nation, the group has had an effect on other areas of the country and world, as youth theater organizers tried to mimic its success.  It often appears in textbooks on theatre, as a model for how to set up a children’s theatre. It\\'s still quite common for community leaders, hoping to start a children\\'s theater organization in their own cities, to call Palo Alto for help.  \r\n\r\nThe group offers several programs. The regular Children\\'s Theatre performances are held six or seven times during the school year, with performers ranging in age from 8 years old through 18. Kids of those same ages participate in the Hotdog Suppertime Season, producing three plays from late June through early August. Held outdoors in the Secret Garden, adjacent to the theater, the Suppertime shows include a stand that sells hot dogs, hamburgers, milk, soda and chips. Families are also allowed to bring their own picnic suppers to these popular productions. \r\n\r\nThe Wingspread program, for ages 16 to 24, produces five major plays during 10 weeks in the summer. Many of its graduates have gone to star on Broadway, London, or television.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Children\\'s Theatre has an outreach program that produces plays at school sites using only performers from the host school.   There are also workshops for children ages 4 to 7 and various fee-based programs such as Foothill Drama Academy and summer and Saturday conservatories. Approximately 4,000 children per year participate in its programs and more than 50,000 people a year watch its plays\r\nNow almost ¾ of a century old, Children’s Theatre has been a wonderful success, training actors and providing entertainment to the city’s children. \r\n\r\nSo who says government doesn’t work?\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx3czjbe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.146,37.44426]}},{"properties":{"name":"The College Terrace Rape Scare (1978-1980)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/0906sexoffendercarter_216.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/carter3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/coll_terr.jpg\">The 24 block College Terrace neighborhood was the home base for a serial rapist during the 1970\\'s.  Melvin Carter, a metallurgical engineer was convicted for committing 11 rapes in the neighborhood during those years. He admitted raping more than 100 women in the Bay Area.\r\n\r\nCarter\\'s rapes followed a distinct pattern, one that would eventually lead to his being caught by Palo Alto police.  He targeted women who lived alone in the many small cottages in the College Terrace neighborhood.  He would cut their telephone wires, break in the house through unlocked doors or windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When I woke up, it was really dark and I thought I was having a nightmare. And the way I wake up from a nightmare is I scream in the dream. But he didn\\'t go away. \r\n\r\n\"It takes a while to wake up. I noticed that I wasn\\'t dreaming and that screaming seemed to be causing chaos. I felt that he had something against my neck. I figured that if I didn\\'t want to die I\\'d better calm down. He wasn\\'t going to go away. Maybe I would drive him into a frenzy by screaming. So I just shut my mouth.\" \r\n\r\nShe noticed that he had a knife, and he cut her, just as he had most of his other victims. \r\n\r\n\"I felt like I\\'d rather not die. I needed to come out of it alive. I wasn\\'t really sure if he was a killer. I decided that these might be my last moments alive. I decided there was a certain way I wanted to live in those moments. I decided to be very calm and centered. \r\n\r\n\"I said, \\'I know who you are, I know what you want, and I would like you to get it over with.\\' I thought, well, that\\'s a small price to pay to live. \r\n\r\n\"The sexual aspect of it was very tiny, insignificant. It was the control, degradation, violation, intrusion: entering my sleep space. It\\'s so creepy that a guy would want that. \r\n\r\n\"I had this in my head, that he would take me to the hell where he lived and I would die. I didn\\'t want to be in that hell with him, I wanted to be in my own soul. I wanted to control what was happening, at least on the human level. I remember getting this impression like a black hole. His eyes went to nowhere. He was totally unattached to anything. I felt like I really had to remain grounded. \r\n\r\n\"I think that I was thinking of him as a human being, trying to see him, trying to see what there was in there and relate to it, connect to that on my inside, and I think I did. I saw him as a human being. It sounds obvious, but I saw beyond what he was doing. And I felt like that would protect me. At least if I died I would die in a human moment and not in a monster hell. I can\\'t let his reality be the reality that I live and die. \r\n\r\n\"He had these rubber gloves on and he got up and pulled up his pants. He pulled off one of the gloves and held out his hand to me. It was kind of shocking--I felt like, I\\'m going to shake his hand? I shook his cold little dead hand and he left and that was it.\" \r\n\r\nThe ritualistic cutting of each victim, the meticulous planning and stalking that went into each attack and the similarity of each rape drew police to the same conclusion Susan reached--that they were dealing with a psychopath.

Collector of contemporary art Gerald Brett, has been the driving force behind this Palo Alto “Avenue of the Arts.”  As a member of the 7 member Palo Alto Public Art Commission he has helped raise money and spend city money on sculptures like Marta Thoma\\'s bronze sculpture, \"Go Mama.\"  Brett calls it a \"fabulous piece of surrealism.\"  It’s also a sculpture of a Mexican doll with a  face is in its belly.  ,250 of taxpayer money went for the statue and some folks have a laundry list of other things for which the money might be better spent.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx7wcsah"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14448,37.42661]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Great Flood of '98","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/flood.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/flood2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/dec29_004.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/flood4.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/flood5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/dec29_002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> In the early hours of February 3rd of 1998, heavy El Nino rains prompted an event that Crescent Park and Green Gables residents had worried about for years---San Francisquito Creek overflowed.  Although flooding at the Chaucer Street Bridge was the biggest problem, the creek also jumped its banks at three other points in the city---near the bridges at Byron, Seneca, and Woodland/University Avenue. \r\n\r\nA wave of water went rushing downhill at record speeds of 7,100 cubic feet per second into the neighborhood of Crescent Park, past University Ave, Hamilton, Channing, over Embarcadero, running southeasterly and pooling in the lowlands near Greer Park.  On its journey it flooded nearly 1,700 homes, turning much of southeasternly Palo Alto into a swirling, muddy nightmare.\r\n\r\nBecause the creek rose the last four feet in just 15 minutes, sleeping residents had little indication that a major flood was on its way.  Oregon Avenue resident Jim Bourdon heard an unfamiliar sound in the early hours of Tuesday morning. \"It sounded like the hose was on---I guess it was water coming into the house.\"   The Bourdons then heard their neighbor banging on the door and knew that it was time to leave, but they had no time to move any of their furniture.\r\n\r\nEvan Economos: “At 3:30a.m., I woke up to go to the bathroom. As I put my feet over the side of the bed, I suddenly realized that I was ankle deep in cold water. I immediately shook my wife and woke her up. Very quickly we woke the children and told them to get dressed. I got dressed as quick as I could.”\r\n\r\n83 year old Miriam Patchen: “At 6 a.m. I heard someone knocking heavily on my door, yelling, \\'Hurry, hurry.\\' \\'I got out of bed, and I was instantly up to my knees in water.\\'\\'   Patchen\\'s neighbor, Dennis McKinsey used his own boat to help rescue Patchen and other stranded neighbors who found themselves in a virtual lake of flood water.\r\n\r\nOne man was rescued around 1:30 a.m. by boat from his overturned truck when he plowed into four feet of water on the Oregon Expressway underpass beneath Alma Street.  The man managed to swim to safety, and was rescued from the top of the pump station.  \r\n\r\nThe lack of any significant warning from the city would cause finger-pointing, accusations, and angry speeches in the weeks and months following the flood.\r\n\r\nNeighborhoods also took a second hit that added to the original surge of creek water.  Since the storm drains flow to creeks, there was no place for water to go.  This left water, and in some cases raw sewage, to pool onto streets, turning them into virtual lakes and rivers.  \r\n\r\nAlthough there were no deaths or serious injuries related to the flood, the losses in terms of property and valued belongings were devastating.  Floors buckled, walls became saturated, water flooded basements and first floors, and many homes had major structural and content damage.  Estimates to many homes ran between 0,000 and 00,000 and some did not have insurance. Overall the flood caused an estimated 8 million in damages.  Few would soon forget the Great Flood of ’98. \r\n\r\nFor \"Then and Now Pictures\" click on link:\r\nhttp://www.paloaltohistory.com/sierracourtflood.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxd1cylp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15371,37.45663]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Palo Alto Creamery","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/penin2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/penin3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/penin4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/penin7_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/penin.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/4/penin6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Fifties-style diners seem to be everywhere---the concoction of jukeboxes, vinyl booths, milkshakes and hamburgers has even been franchised by the mall-ratting Johnny Rockets chain.  But if you’re going to go to a fifties diner, why not go to one that was actually around in the fifties---such as Palo Alto Creamery which has been residing on Emerson Street in Palo Alto since 1923, long before the hula hoop or tailfins were ever invented.  \r\n\r\nBut first an attempt at name clarification.  The Palo Alto Creamery was once owned by the Peninsula Creamery Ice Cream Company which actually had a plant right in town at 800 High Street.  The plant closed in 1994 when the city asked it to start using environmentally-friendly, and drastically more expensive, Freon.  An apartment complex now stands in this location.  In any case, their Peninsula Creamery diner was leased out to Robert Fischer under the name “Peninsula Fountain &amp; Grill.”   Later when Fischer set up a second restaurant under the same name at Stanford Shopping Center, the original Creamery sued over naming rights. They said the name was only for the original Emerson Street location.  So Fischer changed the name of both locations.  Hence, the current “Palo Alto Creamery.” Confused yet?\r\n\r\nWell, if not, it gets more complicated still.  Palo Alto Creamery still keeps the “Peninsula Fountain &amp; Grill” sign over their door on Emerson, plus the old Peninsula Creamery plant still has their own milkshake-winning sandwich and ice cream shop that has survived just a few blocks away on High Street.  It’s called The Peninsula Creamery. Half the city seems to mistakenly think the two “Creameries” are the same operation and local newspapers issue retractions from time to time when they mix-up the names.  Pretty crazy.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, despite all the name perplexity, the diner at Emerson and Hamilton (whatever you want call it, regulars have always just called it “The Creamery”) has become a legend in Palo Alto.  It is probably known best for its 18 flavors of milkshakes and bigger-than-your-hand hamburgers, but the mid-century ambience is what vaults it ahead of other local greasy spoons.  \r\n\r\nThe walls feature posters for old-style cookies and drinks like Yoo-hoo (which is still around) and Green River? (maybe not so much).  There is also a collection of items such as old style speakers, a working jukebox, early televisions and standing hatracks that recall another time.  And the fifties style incorporates more than just the atmosphere.  An authentic Woolworth’s-style soda-jerk behind the lunch counter will make you a Vanilla Coke, an Egg Float or one their famous milkshakes served in one of those stainless steel cups.  Their menus may need a more modern spelling check though---it references its location at the “Standford Shopping Center.”   \r\n\r\nBut wherever it is and whatever its name is, The Creamery has become a Palo Alto institution and as such, a historical landmark---or at least a good place to get a milkshake while you’re on your tour. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxcmg6gb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16174,37.44388]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Sand Hill Road Extension: A Major-League Project","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/sandhill2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/sandhill.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/sandhill3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/sandhill4.jpg\">The 42 million Sand Hill Road Project and its seemingly endless political tangents occupied a place in the Palo Alto political spotlight for nearly 3 decades.  And in the mid-90s when Stanford put on a full-court press to get the city’s go-ahead on the project once and for all---concerns over traffic congestion, open space development, relations with Menlo Park, the fate of native creek species and even the hidden artifacts of the Ohlone Muwekma Indians created a hailstorm of criticism and controversy.  In the end Stanford got its way, but only after a pricy public relations war and a feisty political campaign.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the intersection of Arboretum and Sand Hill roads and El Camino Real is only 0.44 miles, but it has been without any doubt, the most politicized piece of real estate in the city\\'s history.  Four times Stanford attempted to connect Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real---in ’75, ’78, ’83, and ’92-’98, but was blocked by courts who were weary of the Environmental Impact Reports and Palo Alto voters who feared over-growth.  While it was undoubtedly awkward to have Sand Hill Road (a techie-central artery) dead end in the Stanford Shopping Center parking lot, the seemingly logical connection to El Camino Real raised issues a lot more controversial than just the construction of a half mile strip of pavement.  In fact, in the final round of the Sand Hill Project debate, the actual road connection itself was the one point of agreement. Here are the issues that were not so cozy:\r\n\r\nOpen Space:\r\nThe most controversial aspect of the plan was Stanford’s eventually-realized desire to build 628 units of housing for faculty and staff and 500 units of senior housing on a 47 acre plot of land next to San Francisquito Creek.  The land was dubbed Stanford West by supporters of the project and Ohlone Field by nay-sayers.  Opponents argued that the field was the last remaining creekside meadow in the Midpeninsula and should be preserved.  They also claimed that the inevitable urban pollutants of traffic, construction, and housing would endanger the red-tail hawks, American kestrels, steelhead trout, red-legged frogs, and great blue herons who called the field and creek home.  Stanford argued that the site was zoned for housing and they had been paying taxes on it for years in preparation of the project.\r\n\r\nAside from endangered species concerns, Sand Hill opponents were disturbed that the field (and the already occupied land around it) were once home to Ohlone Indian villages.  Occasionally, (as in 1998) Ohlone artifacts were discovered in the vicinity and some feared it would cover more potential treasure sites.  While Stanford’s Ohlone expert, Laura Jones, continually insisted that “the likelihood of them hitting anything significant is close to zero,” Sand Hill opponents were not convinced.  \"The creek is really not just the creek. It is the meadow,\" said Sand Hill opponent Debbie Mytels.  “By building on it, \"it destroys something in our human nature.”  \r\n\r\nTraffic:\r\nOpponents claimed that the Sand Hill extension would create a traffic bottle-neck and lead to over-development of the Sand Hill corridor.  Menlo Park council members and environmentalists were also opposed to some of the side-projects that would be involved in the deal such as the widening Sand Hill north of Arboretum Road, expansion of Quarry Road, and creating a new street behind Nordstrom.\r\n\r\nMenlo Park Relations\r\nThe Sand Hill Road Project also had an impact on Menlo Park, the city just north of the land in question. As one Sand Hill opponent put it, “The people in Menlo Park are not stupid.  They know that wider roads attract more traffic.\"  Indeed, according to the Sand Hill Environmental Impact Report, five of the seven intersections that would have the largest traffic increases were in Menlo Park.  In 1984, Palo Alto residents voted to approve the project, but Menlo Park residents successfully sued to shut down the project.  In 1998, however, the state Superior Court threw out Menlo Park’s last ditch effort to halt the project.  \r\n\r\nShopping Center Expansion\r\nAs part of the project, Stanford wished to expand the Shopping Center to 160,000 feet from the previous limit of 49,000 feet.  Eventually, the Palo Alto City Council convinced them to reduce this to 80,000 square feet, including new parking structures that would extend along Quarry round and some new shopping square footage for the mall.  Not surprisingly, such a plan was not a big hit among anti-growth types.\r\n\r\nThe breaking point for the Sand Hill opponents came in 1997, when a city-wide referendum asked the voters to decide once and for all.  Stanford’s Measure O had backing from the Palo Alto City Council, many former mayors, and of course, Stanfords  big bank account. It was a bruising, expensive, sometimes ugly campaign.  In the end, Measure O was approved with 55% support from the Palo Alto electorate, while another anti-Sand Hill measure failed to gain a majority.  After clearing a final hurdle of lawsuits from Menlo Park, the Sand Hill Road Project finally became a reality.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, after three decades of lobbying, negotiation, and litigation, the road was finally completed to El Camino Real.  Now an ordinary piece of roadway---it is used by thousands of motorists each day unaware of the political battles fought that allow them to make a right hand turn. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxdffsd4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.17139,37.44599]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Varsity Theatre Becomes a Big Book Chain","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/var_2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/var_4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/var_6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/var_8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/var_7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/var_9.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/varsity_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/var_287x403.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/3/pa13_296x403.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/pa0_007.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> There was great controversy when Charles \"Chop\" Keenan took the Old Varsity Theatre and turned it into a Borders. Many lovers of old movie houses were shocked to see a chain as emblematic as Borders taking up permanent residence at 436 University.  Still, given the incredible costs of retrofitting the building to make it earthquake proof and given the slim chances that a second revival house could survive on University Avenue, even the preservation of the Varsity\\'s couryard and marquee have to be counted as victories.\r\n\r\nThe Varsity Theatre opened in 1927 and inspired a half-century of memories as a one-screen first-run theatre and later revivial house.  Buddy Rich, Van Morrison, jazz duo Tuck and Patti, and Count Basie all played there.  The theatre operated until July of 1994.\r\n\r\nThat year a  \"Save the Varsity Committee\" was formed in an attempt to find a group willing to put up the -8 million dollars to save the theatre.  At the first City Council meeting devoted to the subject, there were so many speakers ready to speak for saving the Varsity that the meeting was essentially fillibustered.  Many speakers aimed to have the city purchase the building to become a Perfoming Arts center, but neither the city nor a benefactor (such as David Packard who stepped forward to save The Stanford down the street) appeared on The Varsity\\'s behalf.\r\n\r\nWhile the committee lost the war, it was instrumental in winning the battle of saving the outward Mission Revival style courtyard and the Varsity marquee.  Keenan did basically start anew inside the theatre, converting the theater into a 23,000-square-foot, two-story bookstore and espresso cafe.\r\n\r\nHere are two points of view on the historical significance of the Varsity/Borders experience:\r\n\r\n\"It woisfurther evidence of a disturbing trend that is stripping Palo Alto of its uniqueness and turning it into \\'Anytown, USA,\\' punctuated with anonymous chain stores instead of the city\\'s treasured small, independent businesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Despite their historic value, many of these buildings are not flashy enough to capture the public imagination or the attention of a wealthy philanthropist, or benefit from the financial muscle of a major university. Therefore, the buildings must often change use to remain financially viable; this is called adaptive reuse. We must allow this change and allow incentives to preserve or else the buildings will become obsolete and the high cost of renovation leads owners to neglect rather than preserve their buildings. \"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx84r6v4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15958,37.44778]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tower Well","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\" href=\"http://www.paloaltohistory.com\">Paloaltohistory</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/PA_Tower2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/PA_Tower1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/water_tower_screen.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/2/pa_023.jpg\">When considering what to do with an old water tower, the question may arise, what\\'s the meaning of historically significant, anyway?  Such was the case in Palo Alto.  While there was no doubt that the Tower Well off Alma Street near Menlo Park played an important role in Palo Alto\\'s  electrical development, the 1911 cement tower wasn\\'t exactly an architectural marvel. During City Council debate, the city’s vice-mayor referred to it as “an 80-foot concrete bunker”  He went on to say, “We\\'re talking about a water tower for a city utility. It does not commemorate a major historical event.\"\r\n\r\nOver the years, the Palo Alto City Council rejected both attempts to turn the Water Tower into a historically protected site---as well as more creative attempts to turn it into public bathrooms, hotel rooms, condominiums, low-income housing, and even a house for restoration enthusiasts Tom and Katy Taylor.\r\n\r\nFinally, Tower Well survived as a kind of nod to utility history and remains standing today surrounded by a small park with a collection of informational plaques.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxc03pvv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16733,37.44598]}},{"properties":{"name":"no title","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/185/374964449_c640ef67bf_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/183/374887814_78dd5f6328_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/126/374889713_6c84db9384_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/163/374897327_d5ce957bb6_o.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbx3wrxrl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.17139,37.44599]}},{"properties":{"name":"photo","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/130/333412166_b3acfc9640_o.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64vbxcjiwqx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.17139,37.44599]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/14161","metadata":null,"contact_name":"deisnor","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:deisnor","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/14161","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":31,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=14161,platial:user=deisnor","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":32108}
