The event of Pearl Harbor happened on December 7, 1941 on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The actual harbor was a natural harbor where we held a naval base and many naval ships were located. Pearl Harbor was chosen to hold ships there because we thought the mountains of Oahu were good protection from the enemies.\r\n\r\nSometime before the attack, Japan became angry with the US because they were in a war (WWII) and we had cut off their oil and plane supply from us. Then, they suspected us to join the war soon and Japan wanted to make the first attack and surprise us. They wanted to weaken our US Navy before we got involved.\r\n\r\nSo, consequently, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor with us totally off guard! Our Naval Base didn\\'t see it coming at all. About 2,400 people died with half of them from the USS Arizona ship (the ship that was hit the hardest). In result of the attack, 5 battleships, 3 cruisers, and numerous smaller vessels were destroyed. We lost this battle, but we ended up joining and winning the War. =)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62zi5pd98op"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.944652,21.360875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fort Sumter","description":"Posted by Tay547<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/0/fort_sumter.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/0/ftsumter.jpg\">Charleston HarborFort Sumter was where the first battle of the Civil War took place. The battle was fought on April 12, 1861. As we all know, the Civil War was a war between the North of our country (the Union) and the South (the Confederates). South Carolina was the first state to succeed from the union after President Lincoln was elected and the other southern states shortly followed.\r\n\r\nThe Union occupied the Fort and South Carolina did not like it. While Lincoln wanted to supply the people of Fort Sumter, the governor of SC wanted the people in there out! Basically, the south gave the people of Fort Sumter had a choice: to either surrender or be attacked. Fort Sumter would not surrender; therefore, the first shot of the first battle of the civil war was shot. There weren\\'t even any deaths during the actual battle!!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62zi5qaypzj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.889123,32.752768]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Mead","description":"Posted by Tay547<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/0/mead.jpg\">Lake Mead is a recreational lake where people can enjoy swimming, fishing, boating, and much more. Rain is scarce here which leads to this lake going though a drought at the moment. It\\'s located in Nevada near Las Vegas and is a gorgeous place to go!!!\r\n\r\nIt might be hard to believe, but 400 inhabitants were forced to move out of their town of St. Thomas, Nevada due to the rising waters of Lake Mead. St. Thomas didn\\'t have a chance when the Hoover Dam was built and the Colorado River\\'s water level raised causing Lake Mead to form. Now, Lake Mead is going through a period when the water level is low; however, it\\'s said to be just a pattern and some year, it will go back up.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62zi5fco2mt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.80722,36.04111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mt.

Everest is geographically popular because it is the tallest mountain in the world at 29,035 ft! Climbers from all over the world dream of climbing to the top and some have even died trying. Scientists say it formed about 60 million years ago by two plates colliding. The mountain Mt. Everest is part of the Himalaya range in Asia where a lot more of some of the largest mountains are located.\r\n\r\nMT. Everest was named after a British engineer who first recorded the location and height of Mt. Everest. His name was Sir George Everest. Mt. Everest “straddles” the border of China and Nepal in Asia. New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were a team that wanted to make it to the top of the tallest mountain first and succeeded on May 29, 1953.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62zi5h01ijl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[87.0,29.0]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palacio Real (Castle)","description":"Posted by Tay547<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/madrid_at_night.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/palacio_real_and_fountain.jpg\">MadridPalacio Real is a historical and beautiful place to see. By order of King Philip V, this palace was built in the 18th century on the old area where the old Alcazar was. It took 26 years to complete and finished in 1764.\r\n\r\nIf you ever get to go to The Palacio Real, you will be able to tour 50 out of the 2,800 rooms that make up this gorgeous castle. The Banquet Hall is the largest room and can sit up to 140 people for dinners. This castle is not lived in. The Royalty of Spain lives in a more settle castle near here but does use The Palacio Real for some occasions. In fact, this castle hasn\\'t been lived in since 1931.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62zi5j8v2sa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.70327,40.416712]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pont Neuf","description":"Posted by Tay547<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/0/07_pont_neuf_wrapped.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/0/pont_neuf_thumbnail_3_.jpg\">ParisPont Neuf is a must go to place if you ever visit Paris, France. It\\'s the oldest bridge standing across the Seine River in Paris, France. It connects the Rive Gauche (the left bank) and Rive Droite (the right bank). The name Pont Neuf can either be translated to \"New Bridge\" or \"Bridge Nine\".\r\n\r\nKing Henry the third made the big decision to build this bridge; however, it was completed when King Henry the fourth was in power. Being a series of short little bridges, its total length ends up being 912 ft. long and 92 feet wide. Although the bridge has been repaired, it\\'s original wooden piling that support the foundation stays the same.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62zi5f2ijhr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.351019,48.856662]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sahara Desert","description":"Posted by Tay547<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/0/sahara.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Sahara_yo!.jpg\">Sahara DesertThe Sahara Desert is the largest desert in the world! I want to start off by saying that the Sahara is considered a desert because its lack of rainfall, not because of how hot it gets (although it does get up to 136 degrees F!!). The Sahara only gets up 3 inches of precipitation on average compared to Chicago\\'s 33 inches per year!\r\n\r\nSince the Sahara Desert has low rainfall and crazy hot temperatures, only plants that can adapt to that can stay there. Grasses such as Eragostis and Panicum can survive there. Like plant life, animals that live here also need to be able to adapt to the heat and lack of rain. Some examples of the animals that can live here are the dessert hedgehog, the anubus baboon and up to 300 different kinds of migratory birds. As for people, the population density is only 1 person per square mile, although researches think it was a lot higher long ago.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62zi5cw064x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.872117,23.605347]}},{"properties":{"name":"Statue of Liberty","description":"Posted by Tay547<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/LADY_LIBERTY.jpg\">Liberty Island New York, NYThe Statue of Liberty, which is also sometimes called Lady Liberty, is well tourist popular spot in the USA. This amazing statue that nationally symbolizes freedom and democracy was a gift from France to show friendship. Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi designed this masterpiece trying to match up the sculpture Colossus and Gustave Eiffel performed the framework.\r\n\r\nThe Statue of Liberty was sent in 214 pieces ready to be put together. It finally was dedicated on October 28, 1886 and stood 93 meters high including the pedestal!

This is the place where former president FDR spent a lot of his time during his presidency. Knowing he had polio, which left his legs paralyzed, he wanted to find a way to help his problem.\r\n\r\nWhile being governor of New York, he heard from a friend that routinely swimming in warm, salt water helped him improve his polio. Wanting to try everything to help his polio, he visited Warm Springs often and swam and it began to help!! Right before gaining presidency, he had his cottage built in Warm Springs, which is now known as The Little White House. FDR spent much of his time there and did a lot of his work there.

You can visit this tomb in the Arlington Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. We needed a place to represent and respect the soldiers who fought for us that we couldn\\'t recognize or find after fighting.\r\n\r\nThe tomb is guarded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The guards who guard the tomb are volunteers. They do it for honor, not money. Not just anybody can be a guard. There are certain speculations they have to have; they even have to go through training and evaluation to get to the spot they want.
