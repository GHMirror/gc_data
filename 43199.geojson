It was built from a Victorian Kit  in the Balloon Style (the vertical wall studs are 24ft long, from foundation to roof.)  The woman who lived here before had gathered a lot of great historical details about the work that had been done on it in the last 60 or so years.  We hope to keep up the tradition.  The Variety of fruit growing on the small plot is an amazing bonus, raspberries, 2 kinds of pear, the nieghborhood\\'s oldest living cherry tree, and a double apple tree (that doesn\\'t seem to get polinated).  The best part about this house are the 10 foot ceilings upstairs, the gigantic kitchen (maybe redone in the 60s?) and the 2 fireplaces!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66wh32bnsj8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.699663,45.529133]}},{"properties":{"name":"Art Deco with Pool in Sweetwater, Miami","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> pool, roofjumps, gunshots, too far out, cool neighbors, terrible landlord, mosquito infested hottub, no furniture, wyatt, brain, brock, pranks<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66wh38kwymj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.385498,25.761101]}},{"properties":{"name":"Childhood home, 43rd &amp; Clinton","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Lived here till mid kindergarten, then moved to wasco house.

We just wanted to get out of Broek en Waterland as soon as possible, we wanted to move that week.  But in Amsterdam, people put their apartments on the rental market months before they are even ready to start moving out, so this was the only vacant place i saw that could be occupied right away.  It had been vacant for a months, asking too much, we just offered them less, and they accepted (the dutch people we told this to had never ever heard of such a thing).  \n\nOnce we moved in, we realized it was basically a young family commune.  The building turned out to be an old police station covnerted into condos just 3 years prior.  It filled up immediatly with 10 new couples, who all proceeded to make babies.  So there were 9 young kids, and in fact, every kid born in those years was a boy.  Tabor was no exception, he officially became part of the Kattenburgergracht Futbal Club on St. Patty\\'s Day, 2004, born right there in the apartment, under the stark exposed beams.  \n\nMost of the units in the building had open door attitudes, and packs of young kids would run from one home to the next, leaving a trail of speeletjes, hagelslag, appelstroop, and dikkesaap.  We built a little playspace with padded climbing area, and a sort of slide that the kids would rampage on.\n\nThe building shares a little park in the rear with a few other buildings (college dorms and other apartment buildings) with a playground and a meticulously cared for array of flora that stays green and lush all year round.  Riding into the back courtyard from the street in the winter is a transformation from grey stone gritty old europe to a modern fresh light green alive new nation.  It was paradise.\n\nThe apartment was a very euro, super modern, minimalist loft like place, but with cozy carpet filled bedrooms upstairs.  The windows and balcony looks out over 2 converging canals, the neighbors had boats.  The open kitchen with island mounted stovetop made cooking a supremely social activity, especially when in need of advice on how to really make the pindasaus just right.\n\nThe only downers: too many stairs with kids and groceries, no closets in the whole place, it was such a fancy place that we ended up ruining it (kids), and it was haunted, sorta.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66wh30z6fwd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.91711,52.370499]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rocky Butte Bachelor Pad &amp; Tattoo Studio","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> bike rides to SCRAP in nw, tattoos, too much, wyatt and chopper, laser pointers, movies, <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66wh32jvwos"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.570999,45.547001]}},{"properties":{"name":"SidUps","description":"Posted by Janedoe<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/40682656@N00/279958318/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/100/279958318_ac3fd7d66a_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/40682656@N00/279958318/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/100/279958318_ac3fd7d66a_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 460 Driggs Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211Old Home<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66wh34jafnx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9543,40.7192]}},{"properties":{"name":"SidUps","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://www.eisnor.com/emiko/old/images/tree_babies.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/11/12529584_dd86d02318.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://www.eisnor.com/emiko/old/images/eskimo3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 460 Driggs Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211Emiko\\'s Treehouse, Dance Dance Revolution Olympics, The great flood and blizzard of 03.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66wh30xcsfz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9543,40.7192]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tabor's Placenta is Buried Here","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Villa Kho<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66wh38vni1x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.996376,52.433775]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tenderloin Apt","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Avocado tree in the backyard, insane roaches, insane carpet, old fashioned cage elevator.
