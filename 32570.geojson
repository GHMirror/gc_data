(And you\\'d have the added bonus of being able to check out the matching ostrich or eel boots and belts at Botas Durango next door, or the arts and crafts on display at Josefina Lopez\\'s cultural center and shop in the same block.)\n\nAna Rosa Leon, who comes from Jalisco, opened La Cenaduria almost four years ago after running two restaurants in her hometown, Autlan, and then cooking at Fruitvale\\'s El Taco Zamorano for eight years.\n\nThe menu is as long as the place is small, so check the specials on the white board and seek advice before ordering. If you talk to Leon, she\\'ll steer you right to her whole grilled snapper (filete de pescado), served with either a powerful garlic sauce or El Diablo, a deep-flavored red chile sauce. Both are fantastic, and you can wash them down with a glass of Spanish Muga rose.\n\nPozole, birria, carnitas -- these are common dishes, but Leon\\'s aren\\'t cookie-cutter versions. The best example of her regional approach is her pollo mole pipian with nopales, a well-spiced stew of chicken in a thick green sauce rich with pumpkin seeds, chiles, garlic and cumin.\n\nLike most places in the area, she makes her own thick tortillas daily with fresh masa from La Finca.\n\nEverything comes with radishes. Why radishes? \"I don\\'t know -- it\\'s traditional,\" Leon says. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7eqkvilu6u8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.210375,37.769946]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Huarache Azteca","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\" href=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\">Tanabutler</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3842 International Boulevard, Oakland, CA, 94601El Huarache Azteca 510-533-2395\n3842 International Blvd. (between 38th and 39th avenues); (510) 533-2395.
