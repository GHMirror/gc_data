The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) supports this effort by hosting the web site and Internet Mapping Server, as well as automating the data ingest and update processes.  The Gulf of Mexico Marine Debris Project website allows users to access printable maps indicating submerged object location and density.\n\nSurvey work began in September 2006 using side scan sonar to image the sea floor and locate marine debris. These surveys took measurements to determine the depth of each obstruction and to update nautical charts. The project website and maps include regular updates. Additionally, the Gulf of Mexico Marine Debris Project team will produce planning documents to aid in the aftermath of future storms.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.ncddc.noaa.gov/interactivemaps/gulf-of-mexico-marine-debris-project","metadata":"http://www.ncddc.noaa.gov/interactivemaps/gulf-of-mexico-marine-debris-project/files/GOM_MarineDebris.htm","contact_name":"Betsy Gardner","contact_address":"Geospatial Mapping Developer\n","source":"NOAA","contact_phone":"228-688-4542"},"source":"http://www.ncddc.noaa.gov/interactivemaps/gulf-of-mexico-marine-debris-project","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"marine","published":"2014-08-10T21:41:46-04:00","id":87560}
