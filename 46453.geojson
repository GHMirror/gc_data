AMR offers much better pay and benefits, but you pay the price too.  This is a very busy service.  I started as a part-time Paramedic, then went full-time within 6 months.  In October of 1997 I stopped working on the ambulance and moved inside to the 911 communications center.  In 1999, I went part-time again, while I worked full-time for Wallingford Police.  I again came back to AMR full-time in September of 2003, only to quit completely in May of 2005.  It now appears that I will be returning to AMR shortly on a part-time basis.
