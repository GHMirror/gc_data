I stayed at an apartment off Durrbachtal in Unterdurrbach, Germany. There was an pizza place called \\'Al Capone\\' and a bakery next door. A church across the street woke me with bells at 5am every morning. Good times.\r\n\r\nLaura (my roomate) and I essentially subsisted upon the local beer - Wurzburger Hofbrau - and orange Fanta, both of which we bought by the case from the liquor store down the street.
