Don\\'t rely on your Barcelona metro pass, even though it works in the turnstyle. Buy an individual trip ticket from the machines in the main hall--otherwise you risk getting a fine (and an embarrassing scolding from an officious subway guard)! Trust me, I know.\n\nIf you decide to stay, there are a lot of hotels to choose from. The Grand Melies, about a 15-minute walk from the train station, is a luxury megahotel with a great lounge that looks directly out onto the sea. I imagine that\\'s the view one gets from the rooms, too, but it was a bit pricey for me! In town, one can choose from a myriad of budget hotels that offer friendly service and a short walk to the beach. I stayed at the Normandie, and I\\'ve heard good things about the Platja D\\'or. \n\nThe labyrinthine streets wind their way down to a 1700\\'s cathedral that sits at the tip of the shore, ancient cannons at the ready. Further down the palm-lined beachfront, you can rent a chaise lounge, to keep your belongings dry while you swim. The weather stays warm enough for a swim well into October. Even the storms can\\'t keep people away--the surfers crowd into the Mediterranean to await the waves when the dark clouds start rolling in.\n\nAfter an afternoon of swimming, you can choose from a myriad of cuisines to satisfy your appetite. Small cafes like Al Fresco specialize in fresh salads and bocadillos, while larger restaurants like Los Vikingos serve seafood, pizza, and, of course, great selections from Spain\\'s growing wine market. If you feel like nibbling before you hit the clubs, there\\'s always the stands serving hot, delicious frites, or the numerous gelaterias.\n\nSitges\\' 2 de Maig street throbs with club music late into the night. One can run the gauntlet and hear salsa, house and punk. After spending your energy on the dance floor, you\\'ll be glad you chose a hotel in town as you stumble back along the sleepy streets.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6h51a7m1fko"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.809999,41.240001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stockholm, Sweden","description":"Posted by Phildec<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/25275845_6dbef65ef3_d.jpg\">stockholm<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6h51a1dmkq4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[18.069999,59.330001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Posted by MdeghettoSydney, Australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6h51ag04sx8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.210006,-33.869998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Toronto, Canada","description":"Posted by MichaelcozziToronto, CanadaTook a long weekend here a while back with my wife, and my friends Tom, Edite, Paul, and Jaime.
