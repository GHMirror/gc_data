Most people from the Island know about it, and many have stopped there at least once. It is a small establishment, with no indoor seating and only a few outdoor tables. Most people buy and eat in their car or simply hang out in front. The lack of dining facilities hasn\\'t hurt their business; the place is almost never empty, and in the hours surrounding lunch and dinner times the lines for the indoor order counter pack the small indoor waiting area and spill outside. Maybe All American was once, indeed, a drive-in, but in the quarter century I\\'ve known the place, you park and walk inside.\r\n      \r\n      The big sellers here are the hamburgers. The basic burger is small, probably 3 ounces before cooking, and good for a quick bite (and, at 90 cents quite reasonable). Most people will want more for lunch, though: the double-header (.70) is two patties between a bun (no third piece of bun between them), and a double-double is what you\\'d imagine it is. Alternately, a quarter-pounder (.85) can also be ordered. Though small, the burgers are intensely flavored, served with ketchup, pickles, and finely diced onions unless specified otherwise. They don\\'t have the flavorless, generic taste of the big chains.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m672i8lf7r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.475764,40.666702]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alonso's - MD","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/alonso_front.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/omivore_26.jpg\">415 W Cold Spring Ln, BaltimoreArea is known as Roland Park. When the Classic Catering folks took over Alonso\\'s several years ago, regulars quietly wondered what would become of the corner bar/restaurant\\'s signature staple -- a 24-ounce mound of meat that qualifies as the holy grail of hamburgers. Alonso\\'s pub-grub menu was replaced with more upscale fare, and the smoky center bar gave way to a new long rail that opened up space for a few more tables. But the 24-ounce burger, and its 16-ounce little brother, were spared and now continue to satisfy gargantuan appetites while eliciting contented Homer Simpson-like sighs. When the big burger -- dubbed The Alonso Meal -- makes its way through the dining area, heads turn in amazement, and rightfully so. The beefy sandwich dwarfs the smattering of French fries served with it, and it\\'s nearly impossible to eat the whole thing without losing either the top or bottom portion of the bun. Plan your dining time wisely, as the gastronomic granddaddy takes at least 15-20 minutes to prepare (but the good news is, if you order it medium well, it\\'ll come that way -- not crispy on the outside and rare in the middle).

That\\'s a good start.  It\\'s an enormous piece of meat, weighing in at about 10 ounces I\\'d estimate.  That\\'s a bit too big for my taste, but generally not a deal-breaker.  But don\\'t get your hopes up, because it\\'s somewhat downhill from there.\r\n\r\nThe patties are not seasoned at all as far as I can tell.  No salt.  No pepper.  It goes against everything that I stand for to not season a piece of meat, especially one that size.  And then there\\'s the roll.  It\\'s a \"hard roll\" (aka Kaiser roll), which is not optimal to my mind.  I like Kaiser rolls for breakfast with butter, or better yet with Taylor ham, egg, and cheese.  But I just don\\'t find them appropriate for burgers.  First off ketchup always squirts out the top where that little hole is.

Cheeburger Cheeburger may be one of the happiest hangouts in Westfield. It appeals mostly to the family crowd, but even young couples and mature groups cannot resist the appeal of this kitschy, old-time filling station. The only grumbling here is heard from those waiting for a table, and it\\'s because of the lunch rush that the takeout counter stays very busy. Even though it\\'s hidden away next to the train station in downtown Westfield, people find their way here to fill up on the famous cheeseburgers and shakes. The burgers range from normal (5.5-ounce) to ginormous (20-ounce), and if you finish the latter by yourself, you earn a photo on the Wall of Fame. There\\'s a huge list of free toppings for your meat, incuding chopped garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, blue cheese, A1 steak sauce, bacon and grilled portobello mushrooms. \r\n\r\nA great local story....metal in Newark by day....ground chuck and cheese in Westfield by nite.

The 8-oz. burgers at Collins Pub in Morris Plains overshadow anything else on the menu in this decidedly Irish eatery, and it\\'s only partly because of the meat. Having your steak-quality burger on a toasted roll is fine, but Collins offers (and suggests) you replace the roll with an English muffin. Looking around at the packed dining area, you can see that most of the crowd has taken the suggestion. The nooks and crannies in the muffin do a better job of soaking up the flavor of your choice of toppings, which include mushrooms, onions, crisp lettuce and tomatoes. And of course there\\'s the cheese: Be specific as to what type you want; an answer of \"any kind\" will not cut it. Although the burgers are the food of choice, Collins Bar doesn\\'t skimp on other menu options.

Nevada Ave, Colorado Springs, COThe hamburgers dished out by Conway\\'s are genuine whoppers – a half a foot across, served on broad-domed buns, accompanied by shoestring french fries and titanic pitchers of soda. Panavision-wide but not gourmet-thick, they are happy lunch counter patties with a good oily smack. They are sold whole or half, topped with regular cheese (or, as the ingenuous menu advises, “a generous serving of Velveeta cheese”) or zestier jalapeno cheese, or served as a “Hickory Dickery Top” infused with smoke flavor and smothered with chopped onions and barbecue sauce. \r\n      \r\n      The Red Tops have been a family operation since 1962 when Norb Conway bought the hamburger shop he worked in and he and his wife and ten children went to work. The Conways instilled an unshakeable pride in the business that is as much a part of this restaurant’s charm as are the giant hamburgers. After all, the Red Tops aren’t really much more than fast-food hamburger shops, with waitresses in red hats and blue uniforms who deliver the check with your meal and provide the kind of quick service one expects. The honest menu, homemade food, and genuine hospitality are delightfully oldfangled.

Constantly landing at the top of most best-of lists when it comes to New York City burgers, they are delicious, if a bit hyped.\r\n\r\nThe Corner Bistro, located in New York City\\'s Greenwich Village neighborhood, is an unassuming little joint that serves some serious sandwiches. Cooked in a small broiler just to the left of the bar, these burgers have been a friend to boozers for years on end.\r\n\r\nThe fat patties are served open-face on a toasted bun with onion, pickle, tomato, and lettuce resting on the roll top. This serving arrangement allows you to choose which toppings you\\'d like to dress your sandwich with, instead of making you open the roll to pick off those you don\\'t. This, of course, is critical if you order a cheeseburger, as discarded toppings (if any) won\\'t then stick to the gooey stuff.\r\n(Hamburger Today)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m672h9moxr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.003873,40.737902]}},{"properties":{"name":"Crabills - OH","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/0/1415.jpg\">727 Miami St. ,Urbana, OHHamburger connoisseurs will smile with joy upon walking in the door of this minuscule, 8-stool diner where itsy-bitsy burgers, known to some as sliders, are served at fifty cents apiece (fifty-five cents for a cheeseburger). The burgers are served on small buns, with small squares of cheese, if desired, and with mustard and/or relish for a few cents extra. Six or eight of them make a nice meal.\r\n      \r\n      These are not hamburgers for nutritional prigs. From the counter, you can watch them cooked on a grill to the left. A golf ball-size glob of meat is placed upon the hot iron in what appears to be about a half inch of bubbling oil. It is flattened out with a spatula, becoming a sort of free-form tile of meat that is thoroughly immersed in the hot grease, then gradually moved to the left on the grill, where there is somewhat less oil, and where the cooked patties sizzle until dark. They have a nice crunch to their exterior, and because they are so thin, they have no interior. Like White Castles, but better, these little fellas, even in their buns, are two-bite sandwiches.\r\n      \r\n      Above the counter hang signs announcing the current Crabill record holder: “THE KING, Dave Woods, ate 31 burgers 2/22/01”. There is another record posted for the person who ate the most doubles, which is two burgers in a single bun. Doubles seem like a good way to go if you believe these hamburgers are just too small; but in our experience, the single burger in its spongy little bun, with a single slice of orange cheese melted from the heat, garnished with Crabill’s dark mustard, is one of the perfect foods, not to be modified in any way.

The Beer Barrel Main Event Charity Burger sells for a hefty 79 and serves about 100 people. Denny\\'s used 80 pounds beef, 160 slices of cheese and a house-baked 30-pound bun, among other things to create the meaty monstrosity. It was cooked overnight in an oven for more than six hours.

The burger, broader and thinner than the Shake Shack\\'s, gives you more salty surface area and just as much juicy beef goodness. It\\'s a burger worth going to Austin for, and the tater tots were good, too.Today, Dirty\\'s is still in the original building and location near the University of Texas campus in Austin.  The ceiling in the back dining room has been raised to accommodate four large-screen TVs and a few new menu items have been added such as the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Veggie Burger, Homemade Chili and Queso, an assortment of appetizers, Nightly dinner specials, and our wonderful Cheeseburger Salad.

While this would seemingly result in a dry puck of a burger, ours, while not dripping with juices, were moist enough. The 3.3-ounce patties are packed moderately loose by hand each morning and are cooked atop a griddle, which, along with the coarse grind, makes for a great crunchy crust. The joint gets the cheese-melt just right, too.\r\n\r\nFive Guys was founded in 1986 in Arlington, Virginia, by Janie and Jerry Murrell and their five sons, the \"Five Guys.\" In 2002, there were five locations in Northern Virginia run by the family. The restaurants had gained popularity among locals, and the Murrells decided to franchise the stores. As of March 2007, there were more than 150 locations along the U.S. East Coast from Florida to Connecticut. There are 1,000 more in the building or planning stage.

Harry\\'s idea of a drive-thru hamburger stand where customers could order through a two-way speaker box was quite unique. In that era, it was common to see carhops serving those who wanted to order food from their car. Harry\\'s idea caught on and California\\'s first drive-thru hamburger stand was born. Did you know that In-N-Out Burger has a secret unpublished menu for insiders who are In-The-Know. Next time you\\'re at In-N-Out (i.e. tomorrow . . . or maybe tonight), order a bag of these off-the-menu specials: \"3-by-3\" = three meat patties and three slices of cheese. \"4-by-4\" = four meat patties and four slices of cheese. \"2-by-4\" = two meat patties and four slices of cheese. *Note: You can get a burger with as many meat patties or cheese slices as you want. Just tell the In-N-Out Burger cashier how many meat patties and how much cheese you want and that is what you\\'ll get! For instance, if you want 6 pieces of meat and 10 pieces of cheese tell them you want a \"6-by-10.\" \"Double Meat\" = like a Double Double without cheese. \"3 by Meat\" = three meat patties and no cheese. \"Animal Style\" = the meat is cooked and fried with mustard and then pickles are added, extra spread and grilled onions are added. \"Animal Style Fries\" = fries with cheese, spread, grilled onions and pickles (if you ask for them). \"Protein Style\" = for all you low-carbohydrate dieters, this is a burger with no bun (wrapped in lettuce). \"Flying Dutchman\" = two meat patties, two slices of melted cheese and nothing else - not even a bun! Fries \"Well-Done\" = extra crispy fries . . . even better than the regular! Fries \"Light\" = opposite of fries well-done, more raw than most people like \\'em \"Grilled Cheese\" = no meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce and spread on a bun. \"Veggie Burger\" = burger without the patty or cheese. Sometimes we call this the \"Wish Burger.\" \"Neapolitan\" Shake = strawberry, vanilla and chocolate blended together.

They have a few locations in and around Pittsburg to try, but the original is on 46 18th Street.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m672etqism"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.002448,40.440387]}},{"properties":{"name":"RH Tugs","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platial.com/george55\" href=\"http://platial.com/george55\">George55</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/4/tugs_two_2_.jpg\">1115 Richmond Terrace Staten Island<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6m672gee8vr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.108536,40.645134]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rogue Burger - PA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a>205 S 18th St., Philadelphia PAHow about the burger? The waitstaff has t-shirts on that featured said hamburger, so my immediate reaction was to order something else, but that would have been silly so I ordered the burger.
