I had stopped\nfor a red light and I guess that wasn\\'t what the kid expected. I didn\\'t get hurt by the bike got banged up a little. I got very good help from the local police but it still took a day off our trip with getting all the paperwork and later getting the bike fixed. Riding it to the motel was no fun, the back fender was all bent and kept hitting the wheel. We borrowed some tools from the lady at the hotel and managed to wrench it right. I was a bit wary about riding for a few days after.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6govrlzv55r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.3910603523,35.8368634763]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chicago, starting point for the Route 66 trek.","description":"Posted by Trekprincess<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/e001.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6govrjx4yi7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.62395,41.87186]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gzira Malta","description":"Posted by TrekprincessMalta is such a great place.

The food was fantastic and we got great service what ever we asked for. Heiligenblut is also the south gateway to the Grossglockner Hochalpenstrasse and we made the most of it. Some of the best motocycle riding anywhere! The road is well kept and the hairpins are pletifull.

There must have been more than 25 signs leading up to Stanton. (It was much harder to figure out where to place the marker on the map.) Before making it this far we picked up lost frenchman and he was great company all day. He didn\\'t want to go down the cave but waited for us. It\\'s a great dripstone cave and with the lights it really is mystical. It\\'s not an easy tour, lots of walking up and down but so worth it. The food in the restaurant was good as well. One of our first sightseeing stops on our Route 66 trip.

For a while I didn\\'t think we\\'d get out of Oklahoma, things just kept going wrong. At the cafe we got some pie and soda and our spirits were lifted equally by the food and the long chat we had with the lady running the place. When we left she helped us take the picture and last but not least gave some bumperstickers, although we saved those for our cars back home.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6govrjae42w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-102.66402,35.2712]}},{"properties":{"name":"My studentappartment in Malmö.","description":"Posted by Trekprincess<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6govru7wozy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.97571,55.58366]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parkgatan 3 Boras Sweden","description":"Posted by Trekprincess<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/09/0/P6060015_2_.JPG\">As good a place as any to start.

A unique little hotel that is run by a very friendly man, the son of the man who built the wigwams. The rooms aren\\'t very big but big enough and so full of charm.
