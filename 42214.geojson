From the realm of DIY dining comes Japanese shabu shabu, an unusual hot-potting experience in which customers custom-cook their meals at individual cooking stations. There are three bubbling broths (chicken, traditional and spicy) for simmering spinach-like greens, cabbage, enoki mushrooms, daikon, watercress and other veggies, along with your choice of finely sliced meats or seafood.

It would be clichéd to say long-standing La Paryse has “the best burgers in town,” but the all-beef patties at this cutesy diner are certainly a few grinds above the average. Vegetarians aren\\'t the underclass here, however, with three burger options.

The unpretentious French “cuisine bourgeoise” features hearty soups and bisques, delightful salads, and delicious French classics like duck confit, bavette/frites and choucroute.

A converted casse-croûte redone in beige and gold is a sunny spot for Basque-style tapas, small plates inspired by land and sea. Though it\\'s run by nearby resto Pinxtos, the northern Spanish fare is somehow less convincing and less compelling here.

Cozy and cluttered, Osaka’s subterranean setting feels like a quirky family restaurant in Japan, with its decor of retro lunchroom fixtures and paper screens.
