It is part of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area along with the cities of Helsinki, Vantaa, and Kauniainen. Espoo shares its eastern border with Helsinki and Vantaa, while enclosing Kauniainen. Other bordering municipalities are Nurmijärvi and Vihti in the north and Kirkkonummi in the west. The national park of Nuuksio is situated in northwest Espoo.\n\nEspoo encompasses 528 km², of which 312 km² are land. The current population is 234,466 (as of 2006-10-31), in Finland second only to that of Helsinki.\n\nThe declared goal of the city has always been to preserve nature while developing[citation needed], which has led to the creation of several local regional centers. \"\n\n\"The name Espoo probably comes from the Swedish name for the River Espoo, Espå (or Espåå), which in turn comes from the old Swedish word äspe, meaning stand of aspen, and the Swedish word for \"river\". The name was first mentioned in 1431.\n\nThe first inhabitants in the area arrived about 9,000 years ago.

The city is well known for its ‘Irishness’, and mainly due to the fact that it has on its doorstep the Galway Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking area). The language is visible on the city streets, with bilingual signage on display on shops and road signs, and can be heard by locals around the city. Irish theatre, TV production and Irish music are an integral part of Galway city life, with both An Taibhdhearc, the National Irish Language Theatre, and TG4 headquarters in Galway.

But the landmark that lends the town its distinctive name has been around much longer. At one time, the northern Outer Banks was characterized by a series of sand mountains over 100 feet high. These dunes stretched from sound to sea, from Corolla south to Nags Head. Kill Devil Hill was one of the larger of the dunes, and stories about how the monolith got its name are varied and colorful; the generally accepted one is that it is named for \\'\\'Kill Devil,\\'\\' a brand of rum found washed ashore during the colonial period.\n\nWhatever the origins of its name, the dune was the site of the Wright Brothers first heavier-than-air flight in 1903, which placed Kill Devil Hills forever in the history books. In the 1930s, workers planted hearty grasses on the dune to prevent it from continually shifting, then constructed the impressive Wright Brothers Memorial which is visible for miles.\n\n\nToday, Kill Devil Hills is one of the most popular vacation destinations on the Outer Banks. With thousands of rental homes, great restaurants, sports and activities, and shopping, Kill Devil Hills is at the center of an Outer Banks vacation.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez4t3tu9h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.655,36.013333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Magnetic Island","description":"Posted by Jintexas<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/MagneticIsland_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/MagneticIslandArial.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/MagneticIslandArial_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Magnetic Island is a wonderful island inside the Great Barrier Reef, just a few miles from Townsville on the North Queensland coast, Australia. many residents commute to Townsville to work each day.

These dunes are static, held in position by vegetation, and vary in size from 3 metres in the west to around 30 metres on the eastern side. The most famous dune, Nappanerica, or, more popularly, Big Red (named by Simpson traveller Dennis Bartell), is 40 metres in height.\nThe southern edge of the desert is bordered by Lake Eyre, to the west stony tablelands and the rivers of the Finke, Macumba, Sevenson and Todd Rivers, to the north the Plenty Highway, and to the east the rivers of the Diamantina, Georgina, Warburton and Goyder\\'s Lagoon. Witjira National Park is on the western boundary, Simpson Desert National Park on the eastern. The original inhabitants were Wangkangurru Aboriginal people who lived at wells called Mikiri. The main tracks across the Simpson Desert are the French Line, the Rig Road, the WAA Line and the QAA Line. These lines were built by oil exploration teams. The most popular trek through the Simpson Desert is from Oodnadatta to Birdsville.\nWhilst the desert has a uniform topography and a severe climate - from below freezing on winter nights to temperatures reaching into the sixty deegree celcius range in summer, it is a place of extraordinary beauty and a great diversity of flora and fauna.\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez4o09brc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[138.16406,-25.99755]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thiruvananthapuram","description":"Posted by Jintexas<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/India1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/India2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/India3.jpg\">It\\'s really Thiruvananthapuram - they shortened it\n\nThiruvananthapuram is one of the most beautiful cities in India, known as The City Of Holy Serpent- the holy serpent on which Lord Vishnu reclines.\n \nThiruvananthapuram is an ancient city, with roots going back to 1000 BC.\n \nThiruvananthapuram was also the centre of India\\'s space program.

Yuma is reported to be the third fastest growing area in the US. Despite the  proximity to lots of desert, dunes etc., it\\'s actually a very pleasant place, with a great climate year round. A little heat for a while in the summer, but the rest is easy to live with. It\\'s also ranked in the top 10 golf destinations in the US, and is one of only two places west of the Mississippi to be declared by Congress as a National Heritage Area\n\nI passed through Yuma just after New Year 2007 on a road trip from San Antonio TX  to San Diego CA, up to Desert Springs CA, then over to Nogales AZ, and back to San Antonio.\n\nLocated at the point where the Gila and Colorado Rivers converge, Yuma originated as a major transportation hub, as goods came from the west coast and were shipped up river. Since prehistoric times, Yuma has been the best site for crossing the Colorado River - Spanish conquistadors traveled this route in the 1500\\'s and the only Ocean to Ocean bridge was constructed here in 1920, linking the Eastern U.S. and the West Coast. \n\nYuma\\'s access to the Colorado River is a great asset to this desert community. Yuma has perpetual rights to the water derived from the Colorado River, and uses only about 50% of its allocation. This abundant, inexpensive water supply is much coveted by the water poor areas of Las Vegas, NV, and California.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez52fv6fz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.68079,32.73184]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zima","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44493439@N00/342780198/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/130/342780198_dc96f1794a_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez53zy176"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[41.671944,43.103333]}},{"properties":{"name":"afro (greece)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12261156@N00/328750234/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/125/328750234_b2d24461e8_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez4xugc9z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.7999992,38.4000015]}},{"properties":{"name":"none, japan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez4pgf4y8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[134.266663,33.5]}},{"properties":{"name":"saskatchewan, Canada","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/homephoto_golf_349x201.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.sasktourism.com/images/home/home_maintext_349x234.gif\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez50if96s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.83841,50.50295]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/14397","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jason","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jason","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/14397","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":46,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=14397,platial:user=jason","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":29796}
