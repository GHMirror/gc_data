The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","features":[],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":null,"metadata":null,"contact_name":"","contact_address":"4600 Silver Hill Road, Stop 7400, Washington, DC, 20233-7400","source":"U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Geographic Products Branch","contact_phone":"301-763-1128"},"source":null,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":null,"limit":1000000},"state":"errored","tags":"","published":"2011-01-01T17:00:00Z","id":280867}
