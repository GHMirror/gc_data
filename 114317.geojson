The Superfortress had three more of these, for a total of 8,800 horsepower, propelling the big bomber to a maximum speed of 357 mph.\nOnce again we see the rapid evolution of military aviation before and during World War II: Japan's legendary \"Zero\" fighter, which ruled the Pacific skies at the outbreak of the war, had a maximum speed of about 330 mph. Not a good balance for the Japanese: Fighters need to be faster than bombers. \nThis particular B-29 is Bockscar, which dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki. The official U.S. Air Force Museum fact sheet:\nThe B-29 on display, Bockscar, dropped the Fat Man atomic bomb on Nagasaki\non Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the atomic attack against Hiroshima.\nBockscar was one of 15 specially modified \"Silverplate\" B-29s assigned to\nthe 509th Composite Group. Most B-29s carried eight .50-cal. machine guns\nin remote controlled turrets, two .50-cal. machine guns and one 20mm\ncannon in a tail turret, and up to 20,000 pounds of bombs. Silverplate\nB-29s, however, retained only the tail turret and had their armor removed\nto save weight so that the heavy atomic bombs of the time could be carried\nover a longer distance.\nDesigned in 1940 as an eventual replacement for the B-17 and B-24, the\nfirst B-29 made its maiden flight on Sept. 21, 1942. In December 1943 U.S.\nArmy Air Forces leadership committed the Superfortress to Asia, where its\ngreat range made it particularly suited for the long over-water flights\nagainst the Japanese homeland from bases in China. During the last two\nmonths of 1944, B-29s began operating against Japan from the islands of\nSaipan, Guam and Tinian. With the advent of the conflict in Korea in June\n1950, the B-29 returned to combat. Although vulnerable to MiG-15 jet\nfighter attacks, the Superfortress remained effective against several\ntypes of targets throughout the Korean War.\nBockscar was flown to the museum on Sept. 26, 1961.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/95wombat/5706981920/","id":"0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.102916,39.786279]}},{"properties":{"title":"Univ Dayton Interior of Rec Cntr","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5705177199","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/09 21:58:26 -0400","original":"Mon, 09 May 2011 18:58:25 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/09 21:58:25 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/52224388@N02/\">gleasonmj</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/52224388@N02/5705177199/\" title=\"Univ Dayton Interior of Rec Cntr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3221/5705177199_7fbd0c87e9_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"85\" alt=\"Univ Dayton Interior of Rec Cntr\"></a>\n\nWhy didn't they have something like this when I went there?","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/52224388@N02/5705177199/","id":"1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.174198,39.736555]}},{"properties":{"title":"Univ of Dayton Rec Cntr","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5705177119","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/09 21:58:24 -0400","original":"Mon, 09 May 2011 18:58:23 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/09 21:58:23 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/52224388@N02/\">gleasonmj</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/52224388@N02/5705177119/\" title=\"Univ of Dayton Rec Cntr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/5705177119_f64250681e_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"115\" alt=\"Univ of Dayton Rec Cntr\"></a>\n\nDayton Campus July 23, 2010 over 100 degrees, I remember why I never took classes in the summer.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/52224388@N02/5705177119/","id":"2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.17442,39.736386]}},{"properties":{"title":"Loew's,125 North Main Street , Dayton, OH 45402","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5703772069","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/09 14:04:07 -0400","original":"Mon, 09 May 2011 11:04:06 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/09 14:04:06 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/theatretalks/\">Theatre Talks</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theatretalks/5703772069/\" title=\"Loew's,125 North Main Street , Dayton, OH 45402\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/5703772069_da3bc43b15_m.jpg\" width=\"188\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Loew's,125 North Main Street , Dayton, OH 45402\"></a>\n\nOpening in 1918 as the Dayton, with a seating capacity of 2,500 , the theatre was designed by the Ohio architectural firm of (Harry) Schenck &amp; (Harry J.)
