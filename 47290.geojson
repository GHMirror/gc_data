Ordering a drink at Dee\\'s Hideaway in West Philly, however, means waiting till your 30th birthday. Bartender Sissie Savage cards everyone who walks in, and while she won\\'t serve alcohol to twentysomethings, over-21s can still hang out, sip Shirley Temples and study their imbibing elders. Wednesday is \"Dollar Wheel Day\" at Hideway; from 3 to 7 p.m., every drink ordered buys patrons a chance to spin a numbered wheel. Savage, also known as \"Vanna Black,\" presides over the wheel, handing out dollar-store prizes and collecting extra tips for the bartender if the spinner lands on the number 13.
