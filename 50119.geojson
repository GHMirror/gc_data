For a spine-tingling adventure, try parasailing to enjoy the view of the beach from the sky.\n\nAs the sun sets, Batu Ferringhi comes alive with a carnival-like atmosphere with an open-air bazaar selling anything from ornate curios to enticing souvenir items.\n\nWatch local artisans demonstrate the intricate art of craft-making and batik-painting. Dubbed the Feringghi Walk, the bazaar offers shoppers a host of attractions.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jj6aefzn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.248613358,5.47502803805]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cherating Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_cherating.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> The old Cherating Village has a blend of the modern and traditional. A stretch of road about 1km long runs parallel to the beach, dotted with charming and comfortable chalets, many of which face the beach front. Cherating has the perfect combination of great surf, a wide stretch of white-sandy beach, a wealth of accommodation, dining choices and a classic surfers\\' nightlife scene. Surfers linger for days and even months in this small enclave to catch the best waves and chill out with fellow surfers, exchanging the day\\'s conquests at one of the chic bistros or bars.\n\nIn fact, \"Surfers\\' Haven\" has long been the description of old Cherating Village since the 70\\'s. Each year, surfers from around the world return to Cherating to test out the surf and catch up with local acquaintances. Cherating beach is immaculate and breath-taking. So much so that Club Med decided to build its first Asian base right here. And surfers take the opportunity to have local friends take them through some of the most charming rural villages along the coast and soak in the gorgeous scenery along the way.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jiwg4m0k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.436279297,4.07249425917]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pangkor Island","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_ppangkor_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Pangkor, with its charming mix of fishing settlements and resorts, is a fascinating and convenient holiday destination. It presents the visitor with a rare chance to live near fishermen and observe their lifestyle and also to simply enjoy the fine beaches and resort amenities.\n\nThe fishermen live in scattered settlements on the eastern side, facing the town of Lumut and Teluk Batik. Visitors get a chance to see some of them on the 40-minute ferry ride from Lumut as the ferry stops at the main settlements of Sungai Pinang Kecil and Sungai Pinang Besar before landing at Pangkor Town.\n\nPangkor\\'s two popular beach areas of Pasir Bogak and Teluk Nipah offer sun and sea enthusiasts activities like scuba-diving, snorkelling, wind-surfing and fishing. While Pasir Bogak is quite developed, Teluk Nipah still retains its kampung or village atmosphere. Teluk Ketapang or Turtle Bay still receives turtles on their egg-laying pilgrimages. Some of the resorts on the island also have excellent golf courses on their property.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jj4aofp8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.558547974,4.23343220712]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pulau Payar Marine Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_ppayar_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> The sprinkling of jade green islands that makes up Pulau Payar lies just 30km south-east of Langkawi. It\\'s just a 1-hour boat ride out to the best marine park on Malaysia\\'s West Coast, making it an ideal choice for a day outing.\n\nThis well-preserved, uninhabited marine park extends over a number of islands, with Pulau Payar being the largest. Your base out here is the floating platform moored off Pulau Payar. But the real attraction of this platform lies below sea level. Step into the underwater observation chamber to view the marine life surrounding a reef. Want to get even closer to the swirl of fishes that make these corals their home? Grab a mask, a snorkel and fins and join the spectacle!\n\nAre you into scuba diving? The best diving is along the reef system that skirts the south, east and west of Pulau Payar. Please check with your dive operator what the visibility is like during that time. It can vary from time to time.\n\nThere is no accommodation in Pulau Payar as it is a marine park, but that\\'s not really an issue since Langkawi, with all its fine resorts and restaurants, is just a quick boat-ride away.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jivevzu3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[100.336761475,5.93980184053]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pulau Tiga","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_pulautiga.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Pulau Tiga is the largest of the three islands that make up Pulau Tiga Park. Its beautiful landscape and unspoilt natural environment has attracted CBS TV Network of the USA to use this island as the main location for the popular ‘Survivor’ Programme, dubbing it the ‘Survivor Island’.\n\nThis island was formed through the eruption of several mud volcanoes. The last explosion happened in 1941 and since then the volcanoes have remained relatively passive. Several small mud volcanoes spewing cool, mineral-rich mud can still be found near the summit of the island. The notion that this mineral rich mud is good for your skin makes mud-bathing a must-do activity on this island.\n\nThe island’s lush green jungle serves as a soothing backdrop, while the fine, white sand beaches and the clear unpolluted water are a wonder for nature lovers. The coral reefs encircling the island are home to many species of fish and other marine life. Among the activities that await you here are diving, non-motorised water sports, trekking, bird watching and mud bathing.\n\nThe Park Headquarters is situated on the southern side of the island, not far from Pulau Tiga Resort, the only resort facility available on the island.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jj0z19ih"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.655136108,5.72770271346]}},{"properties":{"name":"Redang Island","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_redang.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Pulau Redang, located 45km off the coast of Kuala Terengganu, is the largest of a group of nine protected islands dotting the South China Sea off the Terengganu coast. The island offers crystal clear waters and numerous dive sites for enthusiasts. Sheltered within the Pulau Redang Marine Park, the waters here are rich in marine life. At midday when sun rays penetrate the sea, brilliant hues of coral, anemones and fish can be seen.\n\nThe waters around Pulau Redang also contain two historic shipwrecks: The H.M.S. Prince of Wales and H.M.S. Repulse, which sank here at the start of World War II, setting the stage for the Japanese occupation of Malaya. This paradise island is perfect for snorkelling, swimming, scuba-diving, jungle trekking, boating and canoeing. No fishing is allowed within a 3.2km radius of the island as Pulau Redang is gazetted as a marine park. The collection of corals and other aquatic life is also strictly prohibited. Berjaya Resort offers a golf course in an idyllic setting.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jj73lkns"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.0078125,5.7826990568]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sipadan Island","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_sipadan.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> The late Jacques Cousteau, the world-renowned oceanographer, described Sipadan Island as ‘an untouched piece of art’, while divers around the world voted it as one of the top five dive sites in the world.\n\nMalaysia’s only oceanic island, it is very small – only 12ha. in size. A 25-minute walk is all that is required to circle the island on foot. As an oceanic island, it rises about 700 metres from the sea floor, attracting diverse marine life from the blackness of the open sea. Surrounded by crystal clear waters, this crown jewel is a treasure trove of some of the most amazing marine animals.\n\nDeclared a bird sanctuary in 1933 by the Colonial Government of North Borneo and re-gazetted in 1963 by the Malaysian Government, the dense vegetation on Sipadan Island supports a large variety of tropical birds which include sea eagles, kingfishers, sunbirds, starlings and wood pigeons. Exotic crustaceans including the amazing coconut crab roam the beaches and scurry among the undergrowth.\n\nWhen diving here, encounters with turtles, resident schools of jacks, bumphead parrotfish and barracudas are almost assured around the tiny coral island. \n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jj1696hx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[118.674316406,4.3573659279]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tioman Island","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_tioman.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> About 56km off the coast of Pahang lies Tioman Island, an alluring holiday paradise in the South China Sea. Acclaimed as one of the best island getaways in the world, Tioman was the location of the Hollywood musical, \\'South Pacific\\' in 1959.\n\nAccording to legend, this island is the final resting place of a mythical dragon princess. The warm waters and good visibility make Tioman a paradise for divers. Discover astounding sights such as colourful Gorgonian sea fans, Staghorn corals, nudibranchs and beautifully sculptured sea sponges. Snorkellers can delight in swimming alongside huge Napoleon Wrasse, Golden Striped Trevally, Bumphead Parrotfish and shoals of Fusiliers.\n\nThis island is an idyllic spot for leisurely days under the sun. Swim in its emerald waters, enjoy a stroll by the beach or be lulled to sleep by the sound of the waves. There are several villages scattered around the coastline, the larger ones being Salang, Tekek, Genting, Paya and Juara.\n\nEach village offers a different and unique atmosphere. Tioman\\'s verdant greenery is home to a splendid variety of plants and small animals, including butterflies, monitor lizards, deer and monkeys. Its flora and fauna have been featured in National Geographic\\'s documentaries.\n\nThe island\\'s granite formations make for excellent rock-climbing expeditions. The more adventurous can attempt to scale the sheer cliff face of the legendary Gunung Nenek Semukut or Dragons Horns. Berjaya Tioman Beach, Golf &amp; Spa Resort offers a luxurious stay amidst a backdrop of rolling hills and scenic views.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jj0s9kbr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.17098999,2.77022132662]}},{"properties":{"name":"Turtle Island Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://www.farithrezza.blogspot.com\">Farithrezza</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/1/msiabeach_turtle.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Turtle Island Park consists of a number of uninhabited islands lying in the Sulu Sea, off the east coast of Sabah. Turtle Island, or Selingan Island, is the largest of these islands and has been developed to house the park\\'s headquarters, a visitors\\' centre, basic tourist facilities and a turtle hatchery.\n\nThe other islands are usually off limits to the casual visitor in order to keep the turtles\\' natural habitat pristine.\n\nTurtle landings usually occur after dusk. The park has a sensible policy of allowing visitors to see only one landing a night. This allows undisturbed nestings to go on throughout the night. Whilst waiting for the evening\\'s highlight, all that is left to do is to laze on the beach at sunset or snorkel. The west side of the island is ideal for this. It\\'s clean, quiet, and offers some interesting coral and sea life. Wander around the island and you\\'ll be surprised at how many turtles would have landed in the last few days; their tracks, like mini-tractors, remain in the sand for days.\n\nThe nearest mainland town to the park is Sandakan. Your tour operator will organise a speedboat pick-up service to and from Turtle Island. It takes about two hours to reach the islands by boat.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Tourism Malaysia.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a621jjadmhfa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[118.050842285,6.15147796421]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/208483","metadata":null,"contact_name":"farithrezza","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:farithrezza","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/208483","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=208483,platial:user=farithrezza","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":50119}
