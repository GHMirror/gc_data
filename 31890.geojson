However, some of those men, who frequently carried large sums of cash with the intention of settling, buying stock, or purchasing a claim; began to go missing.  When friends and family began to look for them, they could trace them as far as the Big Hill Country of southeast  Kansas before they could find no trace of the lost traveler.\nWhen the visitors stopped in for a meal, they were seated at a table with their back to the large canvas that separated the “inn” from the living quarters.  Then Kate would begin to charm the men with her social skills, flirting, or her psychic \"gifts.\"  As the men gave their full attention to the alluring Kate, Pa and John Bender, hiding behind the canvas, would strike the unsuspecting traveler in the skull with a hammer.  Ma Bender and Kate would then rifle the body for money pushing him through the trap door into the hole below the cabin, where Kate would slit his throat.  During the night, the body would then be buried in the garden behind the house.\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67mcksytyxp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.4859542847,37.3431402516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bloody Benders Museum","description":"Posted by Jweaver<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/4/Bender_Hammers_sfw.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/4/8611_512.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/4/Bender_Museum_sfw.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\">  So provocative was the Bender family atrocities that a special museum was established in Cherryvale for the Kansas State-wide Centennial Celebration in May of 1961. It featured an exact  reconstructed replica of the Bender building and housed antiques and household items of the Bender days. In the first three days of its opening, the museum attracted approximately 2,150 visitors from many states and Canada. It operated until 1978 and was closed when the city decided to built a fire station at the site. It was bought by an individual who wanted to place the building on Cherryvale’s Main Street, but the plan was axed by city officials. The building code prohibited wooden frame structure from being placed within the fire limits of Main Street. Some proposed it be relocated behind the Cherryvale Museum, but due to the fact that over a 1.200 visitors came during summer months, parking would be a problem there.  The Bender museum had become a point of controversy in Cherryvale. Some of the townspeople objected to the town being known as the place of such tragic happenings. They were anxious to preserve the good and well-merited name of their town. The museum building and its contents was again sold to Denis R. Ast, a Cherryvale resident and operator of an auction service. He moved it seven miles west on US 160 to the Dennis corner, then a mile south and 1 ¼ miles west to the property where Mr. Ast had his sale barn. The site was within three miles of the original Bender killing site and only a few hundred yards from the new Army Corp of Engineers\\' Big Hill Lake recreational area. The lake was nearing completion and scheduled to be filled by June,1981. Completion date of the entire project with picnic and camp sites was June of 1982. The relocated museum plan fell through. It is believed it later was used as pool/recreation room.\n\nSoutheast Kansas may be the only place anywhere where mass murders are marked in both a topographical and celebratory manner. The two prehistoirc Indian promontories north of US 160 are now known as the \"Bender Mounds.\" The City of Cherryvale, after the removal of its successful Bender Museum in 1978, had for several years an annual “Bender Days” event. \n\n\nCherryvale Museum\n\nThe Cherryvale Museum is itself the dream of a woman who lived here when she was a little girl. Opal Conduitte moved with her parents to Florida, and when she died in 1964, her husband, Clarence E. Evans, notified the people of Cherryvale that his wife had willed valuable antique pieces of glass and china and early Americana to found a museum. The 1927 SWBT office building was purchased with funds from a membership drive.\n\nOne of the prized items include the Martha Washington plate given to Martha by the Dutch East India Company when herMartha Washington Plate husband, George Washington, was president of the United States. The only other surviving piece frin a set of12 can be found in the Smithsonian Institute. The infamous \"Bloody Benders\" murder hammers and other Bender memorabilia are also displayed. The front room of the museum is known as the Opal Evans Parlor. The room at the rear is called the Hibbard memorial Room and displays items once belonging to the S.L. Hibbard family.\n\nOver the years, gifts to the museum have been many. In addition to the fine collections, the Museum also displays a clock with wooden works, a spinning wheel, framed sketches of the Bender Family, antique furniture, a silver water tanker and tumbler, vintage clothing, many Cherryvale photographs and much more.\n\nSpecial exhibits are shown monthly throughout the season. To celebrate Cherryvale\\'s 100th birthday in 1971, a \"Time Capsule\" was encased outside to be opened during the 200th year celebration in 2071.\n\nFree Admission\n\nApril to October - Sunday, 2:00 to 4:00 pm, or by appointment.\n\n215 East 4th Street\n\n620 336-3576\n\nLittle Know Fact- The Independence Historical Museum, Independence Ks. \nIn the \"Antique Barber Room\" at the Museum, look carefully and you will find  a small silver antique cash register.

The many trails, including the nationally recognized Elk River Hiking Trail, provide spectacular vistas of the lake and wind through some of the most appealing rock formations in the state. November through March are great months to see thousands of snow geese and their greater white-fronted and Canada cousins grazing the wheat fields near the wildlife refuge. Winter woodland birds include kinglets, brown creepers, tufted titmice, white-breasted nuthatches, and Carolina chickadees. Bald eagles, common and popular winter residents, can be best viewed in the standing timber of the backwaters of the upper reaches of the lake, particularly near Card Creek campground. Look for wood ducks there also. During spring and summer watch for woodpeckers, blue jays, and flycatchers. Neotropical birds, such as indigo and painted buntings, summer tanagers, northern parula, and prothonotary warblers, nest in this area. Ducks and large flocks of American white pelicans migrate through here. The woods are inhabited by pileated woodpeckers and red-tailed hawks year-round. Gray treefrogs, collared lizards, five-lined skinks, and ringneck snakes are active in spring and summer.

Street Fairs were sweeping the country and it was decided that Fort Scott would throw the Grandest Street Fair of them all.\n\nNoted Fort Scott Historian Don Miller writes of the 1899 Parade: \"Hundreds of people labored thousands of hours decorating dozens of horses, mules, wagons, bicycles, and themselves with flowers and filler that made it challenging to separate foliage from participants with Fort Scott\\'s streets packed with merchants, individuals and lodge clubs.\n\nThe parade mesmerized an audience of thousands. Ideas were visually and mentally stored by many who reported back home of the most spectacular parade they had ever witnessed and dozens of other communities began preparing similar parades for their towns.\n\nFort Scott\\'s popular Street Fair was continued on for many years and for reasons unknown was discontinued.\"\n\nIn 1982 a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation was formed to revive the Street Fair Festival and \"The Good Ol\\' Days\" has been held every year since the first full weekend in June.\n\nThe annual festival is extremely popular with adults and children alike. The Good Ol\\' Days draws thousands of people into Fort Scott\\'s Victorian downtown for a weekend filled with arts, crafts, specialty foods, children\\'s games, and live entertainment. The adjacent Fort Scott National Historic Site provides visitors with an opportunity to experience the living history activities of an 1840\\'s frontier fort.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67mckko94c2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.7073411942,37.8432747726]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fort Scott - National Historic Site","description":"Posted by Jweaver<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Picture_10_2_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Picture_8_2_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Picture_9_2_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Fort_Scott_1_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_photo_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The story of Fort Scott is the story of America growing up.

A short walking trail takes you through a portion of the prairie.\nThe story of Fort Scott is the story of America growing up. When the fort was first established in 1842, the nation was still young, just entering its adolescence and was confined largely to the area east of the Mississippi River. Yet within a few years, the soldiers of Fort Scott became involved in events that would lead to tremendous spurts of growth and expansion as the country spread westward to the Pacific. As the nation developed, it experienced growing pains. Increased tensions over slavery led to the conflict and turmoil of \"Bleeding Kansas\" and the Civil War. Fort Scott takes you through these years of crisis and beyond to the time when the United States emerged into maturity as a united, transcontinental nation.\nFort Scott is the only NPS unit that was directly involved in \"Bleeding Kansas\". Fort Scott was a proslavery town, but many free staters lived in the surrounding area. Located on the grounds was the Western or Proslavery Hotel, directly across from it was the Fort Scott or Free State Hotel.\nKansas was the first Union state to recruit, muster, train and send African American soldiers into combat during the Civil War. The First Kansas Colored Infantry mustered in at Fort Scott, Kansas on January 13, 1863. The unit compiled a proud combat record during the war.\n\nThe site is open daily for self-guided tours. An audio-visual program orients visitors to the history of the site. Guided tours are offered daily at 1:00 p.m. during the summer. Guided tours at other times of year are available for groups by advance arrangement. During the spring, middle school and elementary education programs are presented. The site also hosts three special events per year and participates in a fourth in conjunction with the community. Occasionally, additional events are added each year.\n\nA minimum of one hour is recommended to view the 12-minute audio-visual program and to walk through the buildings. Three to four hours are required to read all the exhibits and to participate in the interpretive activities offered during the summer. Activities on special event weekends go throughout the day.\n\nNote: For Related History see the Historical Flag in Independence Ks located in \" Montgomery County\" The county is named after The leader of the \"Free-Staters\"James Montgomery<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67mcko6fe96"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.704406,37.8436514]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fort Scott - National Historical Site","description":"Posted by Jweaver<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Picture_9_3_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Picture_8_3_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/06fortscott2_2_.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Picture_10_3_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/Fort_Scott_1_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_photo_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The story of Fort Scott is the story of America growing up.

Montgomery, abolitionist.\n\nIn 1858, trouble had intensified in southeast Kansas. Radical elements from other theaters of the conflict were now converging on this area. James Montgomery became a leader of free state forces and was involved in several violent incidents.\n\nIn April of 1858, Montgomery and his men fought U. S troops stationed at Fort Scott in the battle of Paint Creek. One soldier was killed in this encounter.\nIn May of 1858, Montgomery and his men drove pro-slavery forces from Linn County. In retaliation, eleven free-staters were pulled out of their homes, taken to a ravine and shot down. This incident, known as the Marais des Cygnes Massacre was rumored to have been plotted in the Western Hotel.\nOn June 5, 1858, Montgomery and his raiders tried to burn down the Western Hotel. Several shots were fired into the hotel and surrounding homes, but the hotel was saved.\nViolence, such as this, caught the governor\\'s attention. On June 15, 1858, he held a meeting at the Western Hotel in order to settle political unrest. While this meeting nearly broke out into a riot, it was successful. Peace and quiet reigned for a brief five-month period.\nMontgomery and his raiders struck again in December of 1858 when he rescued Benjamin Rice, a free-soiler. Rice had been arrested for murder and was imprisoned in the Fort Scott Hotel. Montgomery claimed that he was jailed illegally, so he came to Fort Scott to free him.\nIn the struggle following Rice\\'s rescue, former Deputy Marshal John Little, a pro-slavery advocate, fired shots into the ranks of the free-staters. Little peered out of a window of his father\\'s store (the former post headquarters) to observe the effects of the shooting. His movement was noted by a free stater who shot and killed him. Little\\'s fiancé, Gene Campbell, wrote Montgomery a letter reprimanding him and saying that he was a \"minister of the devil, and a very superior one too...\"\n\n\nFort Scott\nJanuary 4, 1859\n\nMontgomery:\n\nListen to me. Today I heard that you said in a speech a few days ago that you were not sorry you had killed John Little. That he was not killed too soon. Can you before God say so? Oh, the anguish you have caused. He was one of the noblest men ever created, brave and true to his country and to his word. You can\\'t prove that he ever injured an innocent person. A few days more and we were to have been married, then go south to trouble you no more.\n\nBut through your influence, he was killed. He was sent to another world without even time to pray or to say goodbye to his friends. But thanks to God, though you did kill his body, you can\\'t touch his soul. No. No, it is in the spirit land. Now the cry of \"the Osages are coming!\" can awaken him no more. He quietly sleeps in our little graveyard.\n\nBut remember this. I am a girl, but I can fire a pistol. And if ever the time comes, I will send some of you to the place where there is \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\". You, a minister of God? You mean a minister of the devil, and a very superior one too. I have no more to say to you and your imps. Please accept the sincere regards of your future repentance.\n\nGene Campbell\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67mckuzkrkq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.7038784027,37.2237846221]}},{"properties":{"name":"Le Hunt, KS - Ghost Town","description":"Posted by Jweaver<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/smokestack1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Location Description:     \n \nLeHunt is an old abandoned cement plant and town outside of Independence, now in ruins. Also onsite is an old cemetery. The ruins are said to be haunted by the ghost of a worker who died there. There is also evidence that people have gathered there to perform some sort of magic rituals.\n\nHistory:\nWhen Montgomery County was developing the oil and gas industry at the turn of the century, an area northwest of Independence was receiving some industrial attention. The portion of land known later as Le Hunt was beginning to boom as a new cement company, which had a capacity of producing 4,000 barrels of cement daily, was beginning to start its operations. Several hundred employees worked at the plant, and a small business district sprang up under the cloudy gray smoke belching from Le Hunt\\'s smokestacks.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67mcko8yww1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.7470083237,37.2691692313]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little House On The Prairie - Official Site","description":"Posted by Jweaver<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/KSINDlittlehouse_starstraf1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\">  The official historic site of the Little House on the Prairie as designated by the State of Kansas is located southwest of Independence, Kansas.

This corner of the state was sometimes called the \"Little Balkans\" because of the variety of nationalities - French, Swede, British, Italian, German and Eastern European - who settled here to work in area coalmines.\n\nTo unearth the history of Southeast Kansas, one needs only to mine the myriad of stories from the colorful past of this region. One stirring story is that of the women who participated in a mass march in December 1921 in which two to six thousand wives, daughters, mothers, sisters, and sweethearts of striking miners marched in protest against unfair labor practices and laws across the coalfields of Southeast Kansas. They considered their cause one of conserving democratic values rather than one of revolt.\n\nThe march made headlines across the state and the nation. This large-scale involvement of women, christened the \"Amazon Army\" by the New York Times, set this demonstration apart from the labor unrest that often disturbed the area.\n\nThe women\\'s actions echoed feelings of solidarity with male members of the mining community and linked the miners struggle to American ideals of justice and equality, which ultimately led to national social reform. This spirited act linked men and women together in one \nthe most dynamic pages in the history of American labor.of the most dynamic pages in the history of \nAmerican labor.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67mckl9lvf6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.7067886591,37.4093093463]}},{"properties":{"name":"PCMS","description":"Posted by Jweaver<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/10/3/PITTSBURG_KANSAS_HIGH_SCHOOL.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> 1310 N.

In addition, about 100 females use these tunnels as a nursery site. The bats feed on flying insects over water and follow riparian woodland corridors to get to foraging sites. The summer haunts are at different locales than the winter hibernation caves. Some of the summer resident gray myotis from Pittsburg were banded and found hibernating during winter months in caves of northwest Arkansas. This bat hibernates in clusters with densities that average 170 bats per square foot. The gray myotis is known to live as long as 14-15 years. Common threats to bats include loss of habitat, pesticide residues and human disturbance. Researchers have documented declines greater than 60 percent in gray myotis populations in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Missouri and Arkansas.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67mckgxzy16"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.695110321,37.4130504484]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/521035","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jweaver","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jweaver","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/521035","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":16,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=521035,platial:user=jweaver","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":31890}
