In 1838, the Smith family and nearly 30 of their slaves left their two plantations in St. Marys, along the southern coast of Georgia, to make a new start with some 300 acres of cotton farmland north of the Roswell Town Square. What this well-to-do 19th Century farming family did not realize when they constructed their home was that it would be preserved by their descendants as an untouched treasure of southern history. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zvoxngfmi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.351311,34.03303]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ashtabla and Woodburn","description":"Posted by Mrmcdougall<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/woodburnfrontwflags.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> These two c.1830 large clapboard mansions were built as the Upcountry residences by wealthy Lowcountry planters to enjoy the more healthful climate of the foothills.

He loved the scenery and climate so much that he decided to create his own winter estate in the area, as his older brothers and sisters had built summer houses in places such as Newport, Rhode Island, Shelburne Farms, Vermont, Florham Park, New Jersey, and Hyde Park, New York.\n\nVanderbilt commissioned Richard Morris Hunt, who had previously designed houses for various family members, to design the house in imitation of several Loire Valley chateaux, including the Chateau de Blois. Wanting the best, Vanderbilt also employed Frederick Law Olmsted to design the grounds and Gifford Pinchot to manage the forests. Intending that the estate could be self-supporting, Vanderbilt set up scientific forestry programs, poultry farms, cattle farms, hog farms and a dairy.\n\nVanderbilt\\'s idea was to replicate the working estates of England. Family members and friends invited from all over the United States and beyond came to experience the opulent estate with the splendor of Olmsted\\'s sweet-smelling gardens, rich foods at the 64 seat banquet table, and the utter beauty of Vanderbilt\\'s mountainous estate.\n\nAfter Vanderbilt died of complications from an appendectomy in 1914, his widow sold much of the original 125,000 acres (506 km²) to the federal government to become Pisgah National Forest. The estate includes approximately 8,000 acres today.\n\nVisitors from all over the world continue to be amazed at the indoor pool, bowling alley, exercise equipment, library, and other rooms filled with art works, furniture, and novelties such as electricity, elevators and an intercom system. It remains a major tourist attraction in western North Carolina, with over 900,000 visitors each year. It is still owned by Vanderbilt\\'s grandson, William A.V. Cecil.\n\nIn 1963, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zvp8by4h2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.587662,35.551572]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chief Vann House Historic Site","description":"Posted by Mrmcdougall<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/chiefvann.jpg\">Called the \"Showplace of the Cherokee Nation,\" this two-story classic mansion is one of the best-preserved Cherokee plantation homes. Built by James Vann in 1804, it was the first brick home within the Cherokee Nation. The mansion is decorated with beautiful hand carvings and features a remarkable \"floating\" staircase along with many fine antiques.\n\n\"Feared by many and loved by few,\" Vann was both a hero and a rogue, and he was responsible for bringing the Moravian missionaries into the Cherokee Nation to build schools. Yet, he killed his brother-in-law in a duel, fired a pistol at dinner guests through the floor of an upstairs bedroom, and once even shot at his own mother. Vann himself was shot and killed at a local tavern in 1809.\n\nHis son, Joseph, inherited the home and went on to become a Cherokee statesman. The Georgia Militia evicted \"Rich Joe\" Vann in 1835 for having unknowingly violated a new law making it illegal for Indians to hire whites. Joseph then settled in the Cherokee Territory in Oklahoma and lived there until his death from a steamboat explosion in 1844. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zvp1ojte8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.81926,34.762487]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day 4: Fredericksburg Battlefield","description":"Posted by Mrmcdougall<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/NPS_FRSP_SunkenRoadVADedicationMay2005_013_sized.jpg\">Site of the 1862 battle<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zvox2ayvv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.463398,38.313915]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day Two: Battle-Friedman House","description":"Posted by Mrmcdougall<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/friedman3.jpg\">We plan to stop and tour this home on day two, as we drive from Natchez, MS to Pisgah, AL.\n\nThe Battle-Friedman House was built about 1835 by Alfred Battle, a North Carolina native who had come to Tuscaloosa in 1821. The house and its outbuildings occupied the entire city block. Originally the house consisted of the two front parlours, cental hallway and the rooms above. The columned porch and the rooms at the back of the house were added at various times before the Civil War. In 1875 the house was bought from the Battles by Bernard Friedman, a local merchant who had immigrated from Hungary. It remained in the Friedman family until 1965 when it was willed to the city of Tuscaloosa by Hugo Friedman. The house is operated by the Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society and is available for rental for weddings, receptions etc. The exterior of the house is stucco over brick and painted to resemble red marble. The front porch has distinctively Tuscaloosa styled panelled square columns. Inside, elaborate plasterwork decorates the walls and ceilings of the front parlours and hallways. Some of this is original to the house, but the distinctive art deco nasturtium frieze in the halls was added by the Friedman family in the early part of the twentieth century. The house also contains a fine collection of renaissance revival furniture.\n\nThe house is open to the public Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. and Sundays from 1 - 4 p.m. unless rented out for a private event. There is a .00 per person admission charge.
