I was wandering around Ueno Park, leaving the crowd of people and Hanami parties behind, when you tapped my shoulder and asked me to take a photo of you standing in front of a temple, on top of the hill. You spoke charmingly with a British accent, Chinese-born and living in London. You were amazingly backpacking through Japan on your own for a month. We shared stories of our trips, and then you showed a map of your adventure plans. We swapped emails and addresses. We took pictures of ourselves. When I got back home I received a postcard from you in Nagoya - and later, stories of a dodgy hotel in Osaka, the peril of riding bikes in Kyoto, among other life\\'s off-kilter experiences. I sent winded emails of little things about me, hoping you\\'ll get in touch with me when you get home, but somehow you didn\\'t. Now it\\'s springtime again and I\\'m thinking of going to London. I want to give you a call when I do make it to the swanky shopping district of London - and hopefully, you\\'ll remember me, still, after the long-distance spell. But my nerves are weak now and \"all the umbrellas in London couldn\\'t stop this rain.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsj2qsxw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.77459,35.714462]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kappa fuchi","description":"Posted by Chiron95pVillage of folk tale\nIt is said the waterside where the water imp lives. \n(There is a frightening doll in the nearby vacant lot!!)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsbt1m8w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[141.570624,39.354302]}},{"properties":{"name":"To-mi-ne","description":"Posted by Chiron95pThe summer festival is wonderful. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsoj4b32"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.172672,40.217946]}},{"properties":{"name":"akita","description":"Posted by Chiron95p<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsppuoqp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.12995,39.716893]}},{"properties":{"name":"akita chuo high school","description":"Posted by Chiron95p<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> High school that I passed. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsot8tmq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.078602,39.743758]}},{"properties":{"name":"coco laboratory","description":"Posted by Chiron95p<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Gallery where interesting work is treated. and\nA lot of art books are treated bookstore \"madowaku\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsldruvj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.116019,39.712197]}},{"properties":{"name":"hokuou no mori park","description":"Posted by Chiron95p<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Vast lawn. \nWaterside.\nStarry sky of full marks. \nIt doesn\\'t get tired all day long. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsreoa9f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.363045,40.166281]}},{"properties":{"name":"kokka en","description":"Posted by Chiron95pRosery,Reservoir,Tennis court and\nPlaza in lawn\nThere is a waterway that I designed here. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggscc74d8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.094942,39.903942]}},{"properties":{"name":"when I was a child","description":"Posted by Chiron95p<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> It is a parents\\' home that not is now. \nVery a lot of memories of hills and fields remain. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66ggsnv4if3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[140.136334,39.704331]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/224431","metadata":null,"contact_name":"chiron95p","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:chiron95p","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/224431","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=224431,platial:user=chiron95p","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48002}
