When I first saw some of the footage, I thought how could both towers be on fire at the same time.  I was so confused. I somehow thought I should go to class.  When I got out of my second class, my boyfriend at the time was waiting for me outside to tell me that he had heard on TV at work that one plane crashed in Pittsburgh.  My parents where living there at the time.  I tried to keep it together as I rushed home and to call my mom.  When she answered and I told her why I was so upset, she just gave me a nervous laugh.  I was quite perturbed that the news would say Pittsburgh, when in actuallity, it was more like 30 miles outside of Pittsburgh.
