This text is taken from page 22 and describes the analysis that led to the rankings: The Network Screening Project (Traffic Engineering, Public Works, Hamilton) consists of the application of risk analysis methodology to carry out a comprehensive review of the entire road network in the City of Hamilton. A ranking of roadway locations which exceeded the expected number of collisions for that group, and further experienced an overrepresentation of causal factors for the years 2005-2009. Exhibits in this chapter do not necessarily represent priority lists for improvements, as other factors must be taken into account, such as cost-benefit considerations and the ease of deployment of collision countermeasures.\r\n\r\nThis dataset has been published by the Social Planning and Research Council of Hamilton (SPRC).
