Modern American food with imagination from pure ingredients true to their roots.  Business casual dress is preferred.  30-50 per person, including some drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Mariani | Nov 01 \\'03\r\n\"At this ebullient American bistro, with its trussed ceiling, expansive brick walls, zinc bar and sleek industrial cast, it\\'s almost impossible not to have a good time (especially if you can sit outside in good weather). Chef John Kolar doesn\\'t fret about making culinary waves, instead focusing on flavorful dishes with a minimal number of ingredients: a goat cheese-filled beggar\\'s purse with mixed greens and plum-wine sauce; a spicy Thai beef salad with mint, cilantro and Asian vinaigrette. Pan-roasted walleye pike is sidled with corn ravioli, carrot puree, and sorrel sauce, while juicy grilled tenderloin of beef is dashed with cabernet sauce and accompanied by seasonally good garlic-and-potato-stuffed profiterole. It would take more words than we have to explain the name (think Bob Marley), but the welcoming staff will fill you in.\"\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g44mnei3ox"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.827074,41.481745]}},{"properties":{"name":"Allen Theatre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.everqueer.com\" href=\"http://www.everqueer.com\">Todd</a><img src=\"http://www.playhousesquare.com/images/IMG/IMG_045.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Cleveland Theatre Distict Theatre<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g44mriqws4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.681166,41.501949]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chipotle","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.everqueer.com\" href=\"http://www.everqueer.com\">Todd</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Chipotle, \\'nuf said.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g44mmpy9ln"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.80126,41.484727]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cleveland Browns Stadium","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.everqueer.com\" href=\"http://www.everqueer.com\">Todd</a><img src=\"http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/graphics/global/browns_logo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 100 alfred lerner way cleveland ohioCleveland Browns Stadium<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g44mmtmeo2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.700551,41.504818]}},{"properties":{"name":"Clifton Diner","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.everqueer.com\" href=\"http://www.everqueer.com\">Todd</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/1b5d977e7e851c3d883c332f694d88f4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 44102\r\nThis Lakewood spot would be ideal for, say, a couple in which he craves traditional diner fare (cheeseburgers and fat, sourdough-breaded onion rings), while she wants something a bit more sophisticated (a yellowfin tuna steak club sandwich or tasty tossed salad).
