Along with Delhi, 204km northwest, and Jaipur in Rajasthan, Agra is the third apex of the \"Golden Triangle\", India\\'s most popular tourist itinerary. It fully merits that status; the Taj effortlessly transcends all the frippery and commercialism that surrounds it, and continues to have a fresh and immediate impact on all who see it.\r\n\r\nThat said, Agra city itself can be an intense experience, even for seasoned India hands. Years of corruption and political neglect have reduced its infrastructure to a shambles: filthy water and open sewers are ubiquitous, power cuts routine and the traffic pollution appalling (some mornings you can barely see the sun through the fog of fumes). Moreover, as a tourist you\\'ll have to contend with often overwhelming crowds at the major monuments, absurdly high admission fees, and some of Asia\\'s most persistent touts, commission merchants and rickshaw-wallahs. Don\\'t, however, let all this put you off. Although it\\'s possible to see Agra on a day-trip from Delhi, the Taj alone deserves so much more – a fleeting visit would miss the subtleties of its many moods, as the light changes from sunrise to sunset – while the warren of old streets and bazaars around it offers glimpses of an Indo–Muslim way of life that, in many respects, has altered little since the time of the Moghuls.\r\n\r\nTaj Mahal  \r\n \r\nDescribed by the poet Rabindranath Tagore as a \"tear on the face of eternity\", the Taj Mahal (daily 6.00am –7.00pm, closed Fri; Rs750 [Rs20]) is undoubtedly the zenith of Moghul architecture and quite simply one of the world\\'s most marvellous buildings. Volumes have been written on its perfection, and its image adorns countless glossy brochures and guidebooks; nonetheless, the reality never fails to overwhelm all who see it, and few words can do it justice.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the monument is strangely undiminished by the crowds of tourists who visit, as small and insignificant as ants in the face of this immense and captivating structure. That said, the Taj is at its most alluring in the relative quiet of early morning, shrouded in mists and bathed with a soft red glow. As its vast marble surfaces fall into shadow or reflect the sun, its colour changes, from soft grey and yellow to pearly cream and dazzling white; it\\'s well worth visiting at different times. This play of light is an important decorative device, symbolically implying the presence of Allah, who is never represented in anthropomorphic form.\r\n\r\nOverlooking the Yamuna River, and visible from the fort in the west, the Taj Mahal stands at the northern end of vast gardens enclosed by walls. Though its layout follows a distinctly Islamic theme, representing Paradise, it is above all a monument to romantic love. Shah Jahan built the Taj to enshrine the body of his favourite wife, Arjumand Bann Begum, better known as Mumtaz Mahal (\"Elect of the Palace\"), who died shortly after giving birth to her fourteenth child in 1631. The Shah was devastated by her death, and set out to create an unsurpassed, eternal monument to her memory. Of all the Moghuls, only Shah Jahan, who had been designing palaces and forts since the age of sixteen, could have come up with such a magnificent design. The name of the chief architect is unknown, but Amanat Khan, who had previously worked on Akbar\\'s tomb, was responsible for the calligraphic inscriptions that adorn the gateways, mosque and tomb. Construction by a workforce of some 20,000 men from all over Asia commenced in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1653. Marble was brought from Makrana, near Jodhpur in Rajasthan, and precious stones for decoration – onyx, amethyst, lapis lazuli, turquoise, jade, crystal, coral and mother-of-pearl – were carried to Agra from Persia, Russia, Afghanistan, Tibet, China and the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe story is given an exquisite poignancy by the fate of Shah Jahan himself, who became a tragic and inconsolable figure. Eventually, his devout and austere son Aurangzeb seized power, and Shah Jahan was interned in Agra Fort, where as legend would have it he lived out his final years \"gazing wistfully at the Taj Mahal\" in the distance (although the truth is somewhat less poetic). He died there in January 1666, with his daughter, Jahanara Begum, at his side; his body was carried across the river to lie alongside his beloved wife in his peerless tomb.\r\n \r\nAgra Fort  \r\n \r\nThe high red-sandstone ramparts of Agra Fort (dawn to dusk; Rs300 [Rs20]) dominate a bend in the River Yamuna 2km northwest of the Taj Mahal. Akbar laid the foundations of this majestic citadel, built between 1565 and 1573 in the form of a half moon, on the remains of earlier Rajput fortifications. The structure developed as the seat and stronghold of the Moghul empire for successive generations: Akbar constructed the walls and gates, his grandson, Shah Jahan, had most of the principal buildings erected, and Aurangzeb, the last great emperor, was responsible for the ramparts.\r\n\r\nThe curved bastions of the sandstone battlements are interrupted by massive gates, of which only the Amar Singh Pol is open to the public. Ornamented with glazed tiles, and boasting impressive double walls and a forecourt, it was used by the victorious General Lake when he entered the fort in 1803. The original and grandest entrance, however, was through the western Delhi Gate, leading to the inner portal, Hathi Pol or \"Elephant Gate\", now flanked by two red-sandstone towers faced in marble, but once guarded by colossal stone elephants with riders – destroyed by Aurangzeb in 1668.\r\n\r\nAccess to much of the fort is restricted, so masterpieces of Moghul architecture such as Shah Jahan\\'s beautiful Moti Masjid (\"Pearl Mosque\") are out of bounds to visitors. Only those parts open to the public are described in detail in this Guide, working in an anticlockwise direction from Shah Jahan\\'s Hall of Public Audience to the private apartments.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecsnijmg5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[78.010002,27.19]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ajanta","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecsw77gdd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[75.75,20.533333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bangalore","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecszjj0pi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[77.559997,12.97]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bharatpur","description":"Posted by KaozThe walled town of BHARATPUR is just a stone\\'s throw from the border with Uttar Pradesh, 150km east of Jaipur, and a mere 18km from Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar\\'s deserted capital. It\\'s fun to explore by bike or on foot, with traditional markets, mosques, temples and a massive fort, but the real reason to come here is to visit India\\'s most famous bird sanctuary, the Keoladeo National Park, just a short way south of the town. Even if you\\'re not particularly interested in ornithology, this extraordinary site deserves at least a night or two. Few places in the world, let alone ones so easily accessible, boast such a profusion of wildlife in so confined an area. Cycling around the sanctuary\\'s quiet, shady paths, you\\'re almost certain to glimpse several species of large mammals such as black buck and deer, as well as lizards and pythons, and some startlingly exotic birds.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecso7wruk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[77.489997,27.229999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cochin","description":"Posted by KaozKochi (Cochin)  \r\n \r\nThe venerable city of KOCHI (long known as Cochin), is Kerala\\'s prime tourist destination, spreading across islands and promontories in a stunning location between the Arabian Sea and the backwaters. Its main sections – modern Ernakulam and the old peninsular districts of Mattancherry and Fort Cochin to the west – are linked by a complex system of ferries, and distinctly less romantic bridges. Although most visitors stay in Ernakulam, Fort Cochin and Mattancherry are the main tourist spots, where Kochi\\'s complex history is reflected in an assortment of architectural styles. Exotic spice markets, Chinese fishing nets, a synagogue, Portuguese palace, India\\'s first European church, Dutch homes, and a village green that could have been transported from England\\'s Home Counties can all be found within an easy day\\'s walk. Kochi is also one of the few places in Kerala where you are guaranteed Kathakali dance performances, both authentic and abridged tourist versions. Around Kochi, a 12km auto-rickshaw or bus ride southeast of Ernakulam, the colonial-style hill palace at Thripunitra is now an eclectic museum that stages a music and dance festival in October or November.\r\n\r\nKochi was founded in 1341, when a flood created a natural safe port, replacing Muziris (or Kodungallur, 50km north) as the chief harbour on the Malabar coast. In 1405, the royal family made it their new base, after which the city expanded rapidly, attracting Christian, Arab and Jewish settlers from the Middle East. Its name probably derives from kocchazhi, meaning new, or small, harbour.\r\n\r\nEuropean involvement in Kochi began in the early 1500\\'s with the Portuguese – followed by the Dutch and British, all wanting to control the port and its lucrative spice trade. In 1800, the state of Cochin became part of the British Madras Presidency and from 1812 until Independence in 1947, was administered by a succession of diwans, or finance ministers. In the 1920s, the British expanded the port to make it suitable for modern ocean-going ships and Willingdon Island, between Ernakulam and Fort Cochin, was created by extensive dredging.\r\n \r\nMattancherry  \r\n \r\nWith high-rise development restricted to Ernakulam, across the water, the old-fashioned character of Mattancherry and Fort Cochin remains intact, with glimpses of Kochi\\'s past greeting you at virtually every turn. Approaching Mattancherry jetty by ferry, the shoreline, with its tiled roofs and pastel-coloured buildings, offers a view that can\\'t have changed for centuries.\r\n\r\nDespite the revenue brought in by tourism, traditional trade is still the most important activity here. Barrows loaded with sacks of produce trundle between godowns (warehouses), and there are numerous little shops where you can negotiate prices for tea, jute, rubber, chillies, turmeric, cashew, ginger, cardamom and pepper.\r\n \r\nSt Francis Church and around  \r\n \r\nSouth of the Chinese fishing nets on Church Road, the continuation of River Road, stands the church of St Francis, the first built by Europeans in India. It overlooks the large typically English village green, known locally as the Parade Ground. The exact age of the church is not known, though the stone structure dates back to the early sixteenth century; the land was a gift of the local raja, and the title deeds, written on palm leaf, are still kept inside. The facade, with its multi-curved sides, became the model for most Christian churches in India. Vasco da Gama was buried here in 1524, but his body was later removed to Portugal.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dutch, the church was renovated and became Protestant in 1663, then Anglican with the advent of the British in 1795; since 1949 it has been attached to the Church of South India. Inside, various inscribed tombstones date back to 1562. One throwback from British days is the continued use of punkahs, large swinging cloth fans on frames suspended above the congregation, operated by the \"punkah-wallah\".\r\n\r\nSouth of St Francis church, the interior of the twentieth-century Santa Cruz Cathedral will delight fans of colourful, gaudy Indo-Romano-Rococo style of decoration.\r\n \r\nThe Pardesi (White Jew) Synagogue \r\n\r\n(daily except Sat 10am–noon &amp; 3–5pm; Rs2) was founded in 1568, and rebuilt in 1664. Its interior is an attractive, if incongruous, hotchpotch; note the floor, paved with hand-painted eighteenth-century blue and white tiles from Canton, each unique, depicting a love affair between a mandarin\\'s daughter and a commoner. Opposite the entrance, an elaborately carved Ark houses four scrolls of the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament), encased in silver and gold, on which are placed gold crowns presented by the maharajas of Travancore and Cochin, testifying to good relations with the Jewish community.\r\n\r\nMattancherry Palace  \r\n \r\nMattancherry Palace (daily except Fri 10am–5pm; free) stands on the left side of the road a short walk from the Mattancherry Jetty in the opposite direction to Jew Town. The gateway on the road is, in fact, the back entrance, but the most accessible way from the ferry. In the walled grounds behind the gate stands a circular, tiled Krishna temple (closed to non-Hindus).\r\n\r\nKnown locally as the Dutch Palace, the two-storey building was actually erected by the Portuguese, as a gift to the Cochin raja, Vira Keralavarma (1537–61) – though the Dutch did add to the complex. While its squat exterior is not particularly striking, the interior is captivating. The murals that adorn some of its rooms are among the finest examples of Kerala\\'s much underrated school of painting; friezes illustrating stories from the Ramayana, on the first floor, date from the sixteenth century. Packed with detail and gloriously rich colour, the style is never strictly naturalistic; the treatment of facial features is pared down to the simplest of lines for the mouths, and characteristically aquiline noses. Downstairs, the women\\'s bedchamber holds several less complex paintings, possibly dating from the 1700s.\r\n\r\nWhile the paintings are undoubtedly the highlight of the palace, the collection also includes interesting Dutch maps of old Cochin, coronation robes belonging to past maharajas, royal palanquins, weapons and furniture. Without permission from the Archaeological Survey of India, photography is strictly prohibited.\r\n \r\nKuttanad: The backwaters of Kerala  \r\n \r\nOne of the most memorable experiences for travellers in India – even those on the lowest of budgets – is the opportunity to take a boat journey on the backwaters of Kerala. Immortalized as the setting for Arundhati Roy\\'s Booker-prize-winning novel The God of Small Things, the area known as Kuttanad stretches for 75km from Kollam in the south to Kochi in the north, sandwiched between the sea and the hills. This bewildering labyrinth of shimmering waterways, composed of lakes, canals, rivers and rivulets, is lined with dense tropical greenery, and preserves rural Keralan lifestyles that are completely hidden from the road.\r\n\r\nViews change from narrow canals and dense vegetation to open vistas and dazzling green paddy fields. Homes, farms, churches, mosques and temples can be glimpsed among the trees, and every so often you might catch the blue flash of a kingfisher, or the green of a parakeet. Pallas fishing eagles cruise above the water looking for prey and cormorants perch on logs to dry their wings. Daily life continues both on the water and the palm-fringed shorelines. Families subsist on tiny pockets of land, with just enough room for a simple house, yard and boat, and bathe and wash their clothes – sometimes their buffaloes, too – at the water\\'s edge. Powered both by gondolier-like boatmen with poles and by sail, kettu vallams glide past laden with heavyweight cargoes, and fishermen work from rowing boats or operate massive Chinese nets on the shore.\r\n\r\nCoconut trees at improbable angles form shady canopies, and occasionally you pass under simple curved bridges. Here and there, basic drawbridges can be raised on ropes, but major bridges are few and far between; most people rely on boatmen to ferry them across the water to connect with roads and bus services, a constant criss-crossing of the waters from dawn until dusk (a way of life beautifully represented in the visually stunning film Piravi, by Keralan director Shaji). Poles sticking out of the water indicate dangerous shallows.\r\n\r\nThe African moss that often carpets the surface of the narrower waterways may look attractive, but it is actually a menace to small craft traffic and starves underwater life of light. It is also a symptom of the many serious ecological problems currently affecting the region, whose population density ranges from between two and four times that of other coastal areas in southwest India. This has put growing pressure on land, and hence a greater reliance on fertilizers, which eventually work their way into the water causing the build up of moss. Illegal land reclamation, however, poses the single greatest threat to this fragile ecosystem. In a little over a century, the total area of water in Kuttanad has been reduced by two-thirds, while mangrove swamps and fish stocks have been decimated by pollution and the spread of towns and villages around the edges of the backwater region.\r\n \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecszhexi0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[76.272499,9.944722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delhi","description":"Posted by KaozOn first impressions, DELHI, with its jam-packed streets, tower blocks and temples, forts, mosques and colonial mansions, can be both disorienting and fascinating. It certainly takes a while to find your feet, as you attempt to weave a path through buses, trucks, nippy modern cars, mopeds, rickshaws, cows, bullock carts, hand-pulled trolleys and even the occasional elephant being ridden along with the flow of traffic. You\\'ll find unlikely juxtapositions are everywhere you look: suit-and-tie businessmen rub shoulders with traditionally dressed orthodox Hindus and Muslims; groups of young Levis-clad Delhi-ites pile into burger joints, bars and discos; turbaned snake charmers tease hypnotizing moans out of curved pipes; pundits pontificate while sadhus smoke their chillums; and ragged beggars clutching dusty children plead for a little help towards a meal.\r\n\r\nDelhi\\'s daunting scale becomes more manageable as you start to appreciate that, geographicall as well as historically, it consists of several distinct cities, an amalgamation and expansion of the \"Seven Cities\" of tradition (seven fortress settlements built at different times here by different rulers). The hub of the metropolis is New Delhi, an orderly plan of wide roads lined with sturdy colonial buildings, which was established soon after the imperial capital of British India moved here from Calcutta in 1911. Many of the city\\'s hotels are here, concentrated amid the colonnaded facades of Connaught Place. A couple of kilometres south, the broad, green east–west swathe of Raj Path links India Gate and the Indian parliamentary buildings, once considered to be the architectural jewels in the Imperial crown. Old Delhi, Shah Jahan\\'s seventeenth-century capital of Shahjahanabad, lies 3km northwest of Connaught Place. This is Delhi at its most quintessentially Indian, where the traditional lifestyle of its predominantly Muslim population has changed little over two hundred years. A visit to the mighty Lal Qila or Red Fort and Jami Masjid, India\\'s largest mosque, is a must, and should be combined with a stroll through the area\\'s ancient bazaars, a warren of clustered houses, buzzing with commotion, and infused with aromatic smells drifting from open-fronted restaurants, spice shops and temples.\r\n\r\nFirozabad, another of Delhi\\'s ex-capitals, is centred around Delhi Gate, while the other five former capitals, further south, are today all but deserted, standing as impressive reminders of long-vanished dynasties. Among them you\\'ll find the towering free-standing twelfth-century column erected by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the Qutb Minar – it marks the first capital, Qila Rai Pithora, and signalled the development of the city that visitors see today. Walls and dilapidated pillars survive from the fourteenth-century city of Tughluqabad, and Purana Qila, the sixth capital. Interspersed between these historic ruins are the grand tombs of Delhi\\'s former rulers, plus a plethora of Hindu temples, and domed mosques, introduced by the Muslims, which dramatically changed the conventional mould of Indian cities. Perhaps the finest expressions of the Moghuls\\' architectural genius were the grand charbagh (quartered garden) mausoleums of Humayun\\'s Tomb, and, most famously, the Taj Mahal in Agra. The major monument of the great Moghul period is Lal Qila (the Red Fort) in Old Delhi.\r\n\r\nAs befits a national capital, Delhi, with its many museums and art treasures, cultural performances and crafts, provides a showcase of the country\\'s diverse heritage. Shops trade in goods from every corner of India, and with a little legwork you can find anything from Tibetan carpets, antiques and jewellery to modern art and designer clothes. After years of economic isolation caused by India\\'s draconian post-Independence trading laws, Delhi is enjoying a tremendous economic boom. With plenty of spending money and a new sense of confidence among the wealthier classes, the city now boasts a great nightlife scene, with designer bars, chic cafés and good clubs. Its auditoria host a wide range of national music and dance events, drawing on the richness of India\\'s great classical traditions. Smart new cinemas show innumerable Bollywood and Hollywood movies, while theatres hold performances in both Hindi and English.\r\n\r\nCrafts Museum  \r\n \r\nImmediately north of Purana Qila on Bhairon Marg, the Crafts Museum (Tues–Sun 10am–5pm; free) is a uniquely dynamic exhibition of the rural arts and crafts of India. Its village complex displays an assortment of building traditions, bringing together cultures from across the subcontinent to provide a unique, if artificial, insight into rural life. Authentically constructed mud huts are beautifully decorated with folk art, and exhibits include woodcarvings, paintings, papier-mâché, embroidery and a full-sized wooden haveli from Gujarat. Live demonstrations by the artisans offer close-up glimpses of the folk arts that can be all too difficult to obtain elsewhere in the country. You can buy ritual objects, ornaments, rugs, shawls and books from the craftsmen and women or from the excellent museum shop.\r\n \r\nHumayun\\'s Tomb  \r\n \r\nClose to the medieval Muslim centre of Nizamuddin and 2km from Purana Qila, Humayun\\'s Tomb (daily dawn–dusk; ) stands at the crossroads of the Lodi and Mathura roads, 500m from Nizamuddin railway station (one stop from New Delhi station on the suburban line). Delhi\\'s first Moghul mausoleum, it was constructed from 1564 onwards after the death of the second Moghul emperor, under the watchful eye of Haji Begum, Humayun\\'s senior widow and mother of Akbar, who camped here for the duration. The grounds were later used to inter several prominent Moghuls, and served as a refuge for the last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, captured here by the British in 1857.\r\n\r\nThough later eclipsed by the Jami Masjid and the Taj Mahal, its sombre, Persian-style elegance marks this as one of Delhi\\'s finest historic sites. Constructed of red sandstone, inlaid with black and white marble, on a commanding podium looking towards the Yamuna, it stands in the centre of the formal charbagh, or quartered garden. The octagonal structure is crowned with a double dome that soars to a height of 38m – the inner shell forms the vaulted ceiling. Porches on each side rise to 12.2-metre-high pointed arches, flanked by outer bays and recessed windows with lattice screens of stone and marble. Below the cenotaph, inside the building, are the graves of Humayun and Haji Begum.\r\n\r\nNearby stands the Nila Gumbad (\"blue dome\"), an octagonal tomb with a dome of blue tiles, supposedly built by one of Akbar\\'s nobles to honour a faithful servant, and which may possibly predate Humayun\\'s Tomb. Within the grounds southeast of the main mausoleum, another impressive square mausoleum, with a double dome and two graves bearing Koranic inscriptions, is that of Humayun\\'s barber, a man considered important because he was trusted with holding a razor to the emperor\\'s throat.\r\n \r\nRaj Ghat  \r\n \r\nWhen Shah Jahan established his city in 1638, its eastern edges bordered the River Yamuna, and a line of ghats, or steps leading to the water, was installed along the riverbanks. Ghats have been used in India for centuries, primarily for worship, but also for washing clothes and bathing, and for the final ritual, cremation. Raj Ghat, the site of the cremations of three of modern India\\'s most revered figures, Mahatma Gandhi (1948), Indira Gandhi (1984) and her son Rajiv (1991), is more of a park than a ghat, lying well away from the river bank. Rajiv is honoured by a striking frieze and his mother marked by a red-grey stone monolith. The Mahatma\\'s samadhi, a low black plinth, receives a steady stream of visitors, and he is remembered through prayers here every Friday evening, and on the anniversaries of his birth and death (Oct 2 &amp; Jan 30). Opposite Raj Ghat, the small Gandhi Memorial Museum (daily except Thurs 9.30am–5.30pm; free) houses some of Gandhi\\'s photographs and writings, and on Sundays you can watch a film on his political and personal life (March–Oct Hindi 6pm, English 7pm; Nov–Feb 4 &amp; 5pm).\r\n \r\nOld Delhi (Shahjahanabad)  \r\n \r\nAlthough it\\'s not in fact the oldest part of Delhi, the seventeenth-century city of Shahjahanabad, built by the Moghul emperor, Shah Jahan, is known as OLD DELHI. The original city walls spread for seven miles, enclosing the sprawling fort, Lal Qila, and the formidable Jami Masjid, or \"Friday Mosque\". Old Delhi\\'s main thoroughfare, Chandni Chowk, a seething mass of hooting, pushing cars, tempos, cycle rickshaws and ox carts, was once a sublime canal lined with trees and some of the most opulent bazaars of the East. Today the city walls have crumbled, and of the fourteen old gates only five remain. It\\'s a fascinating area, but you\\'ll need stamina, patience and time to endure the crowds and traffic.\r\n \r\nJami Masjid  \r\n \r\nOld Delhi\\'s red-and-white Jami Masjid (no set hours; free; Rs50 for cameras), 500m southwest of the Red Fort, is India\\'s largest mosque. Soaring above the narrow streets of the old city, it may look huge from a distance, but feels nothing short of immense once you\\'ve climbed the wide staircases to the arched gateways and entered the open courtyard, large enough to accommodate the bending bodies of 25,000 worshippers. It was designed by Shah Jahan and built by a workforce of 5000 between 1644 and 1656. Originally called Masjid-i-Jahanuma (\"mosque commanding a view of the world\"), this grand structure stands on Bho Jhala, one of Shahjahanabad\\'s two hills, and looks east to the sprawling Red Fort, and down on the seething streets of Old Delhi all around. Broad red sandstone staircases lead to gateways on the east, north and southern sides, where worshippers and visitors alike must remove their shoes. Dress conservatively.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the courtyard, your eyes will be drawn to the three bulbous marble domes crowning the main prayer hall on the west side (facing Mecca), fronted by a series of high cusped arches, and sheltering the mihrab, the central niche in the west wall reserved for the prayer leader. The pool in the centre is used for ritual ablutions. At each corner of the square yard a slender minaret crowned with a marble dome rises to the sky, and it\\'s well worth climbing the tower south of the main sanctuary (Rs10) for an unrivalled view over Delhi. In the northeast corner a white shrine protects a collection of Muhammad\\'s relics, shrouded in rose petals and watched over by keepers who will, in exchange for a tip, reveal the contents: two sections of the Koran written on deerskin by relatives of the prophet, a red beard-hair of Muhammad\\'s, his sandals, and his \"footprint\" miraculously embedded in a marble slab.\r\n \r\nQutb Minar Complex  \r\n \r\nAbove the foundations of Lal Kot, settled in the eighth century by the Tomara Rajputs and developed in the twelfth century by the Chauhans, the first monuments of Muslim India are now known as the Qutb Minar Complex (daily dawn–dusk; ), and stand in well-tended grounds 13km south of Connaught Place off Aurobindo Marg; to get here take bus #505 from Ajmeri Gate. One of Delhi\\'s most famous landmarks, the fluted red sandstone tower of the Qutb Minar tapers upwards from the ruins, covered with intricate carvings and deeply inscribed verses from the Koran, to a height of 72.5m. In times past it was considered one of the \"Wonders of the East\", second only to the Taj Mahal – in the words of the Victorian historian, James Ferguson, \"the most beautiful example of its class known anywhere\"; but historian John Keay was perhaps more representative of the modern eye when he claimed that the tower \"[had] an unfortunate hint of the factory chimney and the brick kiln; a wisp of white smoke trailing from its summit would not seem out of place\".\r\n\r\nWork on the Qutb Minar started in 1199; it was Qutb-ud-din Aibak\\'s victory tower, celebrating the advent of the Muslim dominance of Delhi (and much of the subcontinent) that was to endure until 1857. For Qutb-ud-din, who died four years after gaining power, it marked the eastern extremity of the Islamic faith, casting the shadow of God over east and west. It was also a minaret, from which the muezzin called the faithful to prayer. Only the first storey has been ascribed to Qutb-ud-din\\'s short reign; the other four were built by his successor Iltutmish, and the top was restored in 1369 by Firoz Shah, who used marble to face the red sandstone.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the tower lie the ruins of India\\'s first mosque, Quwwat-ul-Islam (\"the Might of Islam\"), built by Qutb-ud-din using the remains of 27 Hindu and Jain temples and the help of Hindu artisans – their influence can be seen in the detail of the masonry and the indigenous corbelled arches. Steps lead to an impressive courtyard flanked by cloisters and supported by pillars unmistakably taken from a Hindu temple and adapted to accord with strict Islamic law forbidding iconic worship – all the faces of the decorative figures carved into the columns have been removed. Especially fine ornamental arches, rising as high as 16m, remain of what was once the prayer hall. Beautifully carved sandstone screens, combining Koranic calligraphy with the Indian lotus, form a facade immediately to the west of the mosque, facing Mecca. Iltutmish and his successors extended the building, enlarging the prayer hall and the cloisters and introducing geometric designs, calligraphy, glazed tiles set in brick, and squinches (arches set diagonally to a square to support a dome).\r\n\r\nIn complete contrast to the mainly Islamic surroundings, an Iron Pillar (7.2m) stands in the corner of the mosque, bearing fourth-century Sanskrit inscriptions of the Gupta period attributing it to the memory of King Chandragupta II (373–413). Once topped with an image of the Hindu bird god, Garuda, the extraordinary and virtually rust-free pillar, made of 98 percent pure iron, is a puzzle to metallurgists. It must have been transplanted here, but its origins remain hazy. Tradition has it that anyone who can encircle the column with their hands behind their back will have their wishes granted.\r\n\r\nAla-i-Darwaza, a mausoleum-like gateway with stone lattice screens, was added by Ala-ud-din Khalji (1296–1316). Its inlaid marble embellishments are ascribed to an influx of Pathan artisans from Byzantine Turkey, and the import of Seljuk influences – the true arches were the first in India. The south entrance to the complex is marked by yet another tower, Alai Minar, which was planned as grander and larger than the Qutb Minar but left abandoned after the construction of its first storey.\r\n\r\nOn a plinth west of Quwwat-ul-Islam, the tomb of Iltutmish, built in 1235 by the ruler himself, is said to be the first Muslim mausoleum in India (Hindus cremate their dead rather than bury them). A relatively plain exterior blending Indian and Muslim styles, with three ornate arches, hides an interior 9m square with geometric arabesque patterns combined with calligraphy and lotus and wheel motifs.\r\n\r\nPerched above the scrubland 150m southeast of the Qutb Minar, the octagonal Moghul tomb of Muhammad Quli Khan, one of Akbar\\'s courtiers, was somewhat bizarrely occupied by Sir Thomas Metcalfe, resident at the Moghul court, as a country house – the first floor above the sepulchre room was converted into a living apartment, and the chamber beneath the dome became dining room. The building now lies in ruins. Another crumbling Raj-era house nearby still boasts a very ornamental English fireplace and swimming tank. Outside the complex, north of the Qutb Minar, Adham Khan\\'s tomb stands on the remains of the walls of Lal Kot. A general in Akbar\\'s army, Khan was hurled from the ramparts of Agra Fort on the orders of the emperor after some murderous court feuding. You can get good views of both the tomb and the Qutb complex from the roof of the Church of St John, an incongruous little chapel with an Anglican nave, monastic cloisters and a Hindu chhapra (tower), tucked down a lane opposite the tomb entrance.\r\n \r\nHauz Khas  \r\n \r\nThe Soho of Delhi, Hauz Khas is a wealthy suburban development, packed with boutiques and restaurants, 12km southwest of Connaught Place. The \"village\", as it\\'s known, is just off Aurobindo Marg (or the Delhi–Mehrauli Road), which leads from the centre to the Qutb Minar Complex, and adjacent to a pleasant deer park. The road through the shopping enclave leads to the ruins of Ala-ud-din-Khalji\\'s large tank (enclosed reservoir) known as Hauz-i-Alai, built early in the fourteenth century to supply water to the inhabitants of Siri, Delhi\\'s second city. It was expanded almost fifty years later by Firoz Shah Tughlak, who added a two-storey madrasa (seminary), and a mosque at its northern end.\r\n\r\nIn among the anonymous tombs scattered throughout the area is that of Firoz Shah himself, situated on the edge of the tank. Its high walls, lofty dome, and doorway spanned by a lintel with a stone railing outside, are fine examples of Hindu Indian traditions effectively blended with Islamic architecture. At dawn every day, the surrounding woodlands and the bed of the immense tank, once the site of Timur\\'s camp, come alive with Delhi-ites out walking, practising yoga and jogging; in the evenings, Hauz Khas\\'s salubrious restaurants attract diners from all over the city.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecsuownmh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[77.209999,28.67]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ellora","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecst0sasj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[75.1666641,20.0166664]}},{"properties":{"name":"Goa","description":"Posted by KaozGoa  \r\n \r\nIf one word could be said to encapsulate the essence of GOA, it would have to be the Portuguese sossegarde, meaning \"carefree\". The pace of life in this former colonial enclave, midway down India\\'s southwest coast, has picked up over the past twenty years, but in spite of the increasing chaos of its capital, beach resorts and market towns, Goa has retained the laid-back feel that has traditionally set it apart from the rest of the country. Its 1.4 million inhabitants are unequivocal about the roots of their distinctiveness; while most of the subcontinent was colonized by the stiff-upper-lipped British, Goa\\'s European overlords were the Portuguese, a people far more inclined to enjoy the good things in life than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts.\r\n\r\nGoa was Portugal\\'s first toe-hold in Asia, and served as the linchpin for a vast trade network for over 450 years. However, when the Lusitanian empire began to founder in the seventeenth century, so too did the fortunes of its capital. Cut off from the rest of India by a wall of mountains and hundreds of miles of un-navigable alluvial plain, it remained resolutely aloof from the wider subcontinent – while India was tearing itself to pieces in the run-up to Independence in 1947, the only machetes being wielded here were cutting coconuts. Not until 1961, after exasperated Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru gave up trying to negotiate with the Portuguese dictator Salazar and sent in the army, was Goa finally absorbed into India.\r\n\r\nThose who visited in the late 1960s and 1970s, when the overland travellers\\' trail wriggled its way south from Bombay, found a way of life little changed in centuries: Portuguese was still very much the lingua franca of the well educated elite, and the coastal settlements were mere fishing and coconut cultivation villages. Relieved to have found somewhere inexpensive and culturally undemanding to recover from the travails of Indian travel, the \"freaks\" got stoned, watched the mesmeric sunsets over the Arabian Sea and partied madly on full-moon nights, giving rise to a holiday culture that soon made Goa synonymous with hedonistic hippies.\r\n\r\nSince then, the state has largely shaken off its reputation as a drop-out zone, but hundreds of thousands of visitors still flock here each winter, the vast majority to relax on Goa\\'s beautiful beaches. Around two dozen stretches of soft white sand indent the region\\'s coast, from spectacular 25-kilometre sweeps to secluded palm-backed coves. The level of development varies wildly; while some are lined by ritzy Western-style resorts, the most sophisticated structures on others are palm-leaf shacks and old wooden outriggers that are heaved into the sea each afternoon.\r\n\r\nWherever you travel in Goa, vestiges of former Portuguese domination are ubiquitous, creating an ambience that is at once exotic and strangely familiar. This is particularly true of Goan food which, blending the Latin love of meat and fish with India\\'s predilection for spices, is quite unlike any other regional cuisine in Asia. Equally unique is the prevalence of alcohol. Beer is cheap, and six thousand or more bars around the state are licensed to serve it, along with the more traditional tipple, feni, a rocket-fuel spirit distilled from cashew fruit or coconut sap.\r\n\r\nTravelling around the Christian heartland of central Goa, with its whitewashed churches and wayside shrines, it\\'s all too easy to forget that Hinduism remains the religion of more than two-thirds of the state\\'s population. Unlike in many parts of the country, however, religious intolerance is rare here, and traditional practices mingle easily with more recently implanted ones. Faced by the threat of merger with neighbouring states, Goans have always put regional cohesion before communal differences at the ballot box. A potent stimulus for regional identity was the campaign through the 1980s to have Konkani, the language spoken by the vast majority of Goans, recognized as an official state language, which it eventually was in 1992. Since then, the immigration issue has come to dominate the political agenda. Considerably more prosperous than neighbouring states, Goa has been deluged over the past couple of decades with economic refugees, stirring up fears that the region\\'s cultural distinctiveness will disappear. Among the main employers of migrant labour in recent years has been the Konkan Railway, completed in 1997 to form a super-fast land link with Mumbai – another conduit of economic prosperity that has brought lasting changes.\r\n\r\nWhich beach you opt for when you arrive largely depends on what sort of holiday you have in mind. More developed resorts such as Calangute and Baga in the north, and Colva and Benaulim in the south, offer more \"walk-in\" accommodation and tourist facilities than elsewhere. Even if you\\'re looking for a less touristy scene, it can be worth heading for these centres first, as finding places to stay in less commercialized corners is often difficult. Anjuna, Vagator, and Chapora, where accommodation is generally more basic and harder to come by, are the beaches to aim for if you\\'ve come to Goa to party. However, the bulk of budget travellers taking time out from tours of India end up in Palolem, in the far south, or Arambol, both beyond the increasingly long reach of the charter buses. That said, Palolem, in particular, has become a resort in its own right, with thousands of long-stay visitors in peak season.\r\n\r\nSome 10km from the state capital, Panjim, the ruins of the former Portuguese capital at Old Goa are foremost among the attractions away from the coast – a sprawl of Catholic cathedrals, convents and churches that draw crowds of Christian pilgrims from all over India. Another popular day excursion is to Anjuna\\'s Wednesday flea market, a sociable place to shop for souvenirs and dance wear. Further inland, the thickly wooded countryside around Ponda harbours numerous temples, where you can experience Goa\\'s peculiar brand of Hindu architecture. The district of Salcete, and its main market town, Margao, is also littered with Portuguese mansions, churches and seminaries. Finally, wildlife enthusiasts may be tempted into the interior to visit the nature reserve at Cotigao in the far south.\r\n\r\nThe best time to come to Goa is during the dry, relatively cool winter months between mid-November and mid-March. At other times, either the sun is too hot for comfort, or the monsoon rains and clouds make life miserable. During peak season, from mid-December to the end of January, the weather is perfect, with temperatures rarely nudging above 32°C. Finding a room or a house to rent at that time, however – particularly over Christmas and New Year when tariffs double, or triple – can be a real hassle.\r\n \r\nOld Goa  \r\n \r\nA one-time a byword for splendour with a population of several hundred thousand, Goa\\'s erstwhile former capital, OLD GOA, was virtually abandoned following malaria and cholera epidemics from the seventeenth century onwards. Today you need considerable imagination to picture the once-great capital as it used to be. The maze of twisting streets, piazzas and ochre-washed villas has gone, and all that remains is a score of cream-painted churches and convents. Granted World Heritage Status by UNESCO, Old Goa today attracts bus-loads of foreign tourists from the coast, and Christian pilgrims from around India, in roughly equal numbers. While the former come to admire the gigantic facades and gilt altars of the beautifully preserved churches, the main attraction for the latter is the tomb of St Francis Xavier, the renowned sixteenth-century missionary, whose remains are enshrined in the Basilica of Bom Jesus.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re staying on the coast and contemplating a day-trip inland, this is the most obvious and accessible option. Just thirty minutes by road from the state capital, Old Goa is served by buses every fifteen minutes from Panjim\\'s Kadamba bus stand; alternatively, hop into an auto-rickshaw (Rs75), or rent a taxi (Rs200–250).\r\n\r\nBasilica of Bom Jesus  \r\n \r\nClose to the convent of St Francis, the 1605 church of Bom Jesus, \"Good\" or \"Menino Jesus\" (Mon–Sat 9am–6.30pm, Sun 10am–6.30pm), is known principally for the tomb of St Francis Xavier. In 1946, it became the first church in India to be elevated to the status of Minor Basilica. On the west, the three-storey Renaissance facade encompasses Corinthian, Doric, Ionic and Composite styles.\r\n\r\nThe interior is entered beneath the choir, supported by columns. On the northern wall, in the centre of the nave, is a cenotaph in gilded bronze to Dom Jeronimo Mascarenhas, the Captain of Cochin and benefactor of the church. The main altar, extravagantly decorated in gold, depicts the infant Jesus under the protection of St Ignatius Loyola (founder of the Jesuit Order); to each side are subsidiary altars to Our Lady of Hope and St Michael. In the southern transept, lavishly decorated with twisted gilded columns and floriate carvings, stands the Chapel and Tomb of St Francis Xavier. Constructed of marble and jasper in 1696, it was the gift of the Medici, Cosimo III, the Grand Duke of Tuscany; the middle tier contains panels detailing the saint\\'s life. An ornate domed reliquary in silver contains his remains; for a week around his feast day, December 3, tens of thousands of pilgrims – Hindus as well as Christians – queue for darshan (ritual viewing) of the casket before attending open-air Mass in the square outside.\r\n \r\nChurch of St Francis of Assisi and Archeological Museum  \r\n \r\nSouthwest of the Sé Cathedral is the ruined Palace of the Inquisition, in operation up until 1774, while to the west stands the Convent of St Francis of Assisi, built by Franciscan monks in 1517 and restored in the mid-eighteenth century. Today, the core of its Archeological Museum (daily except Fri 10am–5pm; Rs5) is a gallery of portraits of Portuguese viceroys, painted by local artists under Italian supervision. Other exhibits include coins, domestic Christian wooden sculpture, and downstairs in the cloister, pre-Portuguese Hindu sculpture. Next door, the Church of St Francis (1521) features fine decorative frescoes and paintings on wood showing the life of St Francis of Assisi.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecsu60iz5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.832779,15.382778]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jaipur","description":"Posted by Kaoz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/11/3/header_r1_c3.jpg\">A flamboyant showcase of Rajasthani architecture, the Pink City of JAIPUR has long been established on tourist itineraries as the third corner of India\\'s \"Golden Triangle\", just 300km southwest of Delhi and 200km west of Agra. Though the \"Pink City\" label applies specifically to the old walled quarter of the state capital, in the northeast of town, exuberant eighteenth- and nineteenth-century palaces are scattered throughout the whole urban area. The orderly bazaars of the old town rank among the most vibrant in Asia, renowned above all for hand-dyed and embroidered textiles, jewellery, and the best selection of precious stones and metals in India. For all its colour, however, Jaipur\\'s heavy traffic, combined with the aggression of over-eager traders and touts, tends to reduce the appeal of a long stay. Few travellers find it easy to relax here, and most leave craving the fresher air and laid-back pace of Bharatpur or the Thar Desert towns.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re anywhere near Jaipur in March, don\\'t miss the Elephant Festival, one of India\\'s most flamboyant parades, celebrated with full Rajput pomp during Holi (March).\r\n\r\nCity Palace  \r\n \r\nThe magnificent City Palace (daily 9.30am–4.45pm; Rs150, Rs50 extra for camera, Rs150 extra for video; same ticket also valid for Jaigarh Fort at Amber if used within 24hr), open to the public as the Sawai Man Singh Museum, stands enclosed by a high wall in the centre of the city amid fine gardens and courtyards. The royal family still occupies part of the palace, advancing in procession on formal occasions through the grand Tripolia Gate in the centre of the southern wall. Less regal visitors must enter through Atish Gate left of the main gate or Nakkar Gate in the west, passing the food stalls and souvenir shops in Jalebi Chowk.\r\n\r\nThe palace was conceived and built by Jai Singh, but many of the apartments and halls were added by his successors. The exhibits and interior design have lost none of the pomp and splendour of their glory days. Each door and gateway is heavily decorated, each chandelier intact and each hall guarded by turbaned retainers decked in full royal livery, so that Jaipur\\'s palace impresses upon the visitor the continuity of a living royal presence.\r\n\r\nAn ornate gateway in the southwest corner of the complex leads into the first courtyard, with the solid marble Mubarak Mahal in its centre. This elegant palace, built in 1899, holds the textile section of the museum, whose treasures include throne carpets and antique pashmina shawls from Kashmir. Opulently decorated ritual objects are also on display, but the real highlight is the former maharani\\'s richly gilded black Diwali outfit, covered in elaborate gota appliqué work. The first floor of the building next to the Mubarak Mahal, once the harem, houses the royal arsenal.\r\n\r\nAs you enter the second courtyard you\\'re confronted by the raised Diwan-i-Khas, the Hall of Private Audience, built in sandstone and marble. Open-sided, with its roof raised on marble pillars, the hall contains two silver urns, or gangajalis, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest crafted silver objects in the world, each more than 1.5m high with a capacity of 8182 litres. When Madho Singh II went to England to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1901, he was so reluctant to trust the water in the West that he had these urns filled with Ganges water and took them along with him.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the compound, with balconies and windows studding its seven-storey facade, Chandra Mahal is the residence of the royal family. You can see it best from Pritam Niwas Chowk, known as Peacock Courtyard, to the west of the Diwan-i-Khas.\r\n\r\nThe largest section of the museum is housed in the Diwan-i-Am, once the Hall of Public Audience. The intricately painted walls provide perfect mounts for immense medieval Afghan and Persian carpets. Miniatures from the Moghul and Jaipur schools, and Jai Singh\\'s translations in Arabic and Sanskrit of the astronomical treatises of ancient scientists such as Euclid and Ptolemy, are displayed in glass cases.\r\n \r\nHawa Mahal  \r\n \r\nJaipur\\'s most acclaimed landmark, the tapering Hawa Mahal, or \"Palace of Winds\" (daily 10am–5pm; Rs5, Rs30 extra for camera or video), stands to the west of the City Palace, where it exudes an orangey-pink glow in the rays of the rising sun (8–9am is the best time for photographs). Built in 1799 to enable the women of the court to watch street processions while remaining in a strict state of purdah, its five-storey facade, decked with no less than 593 finely screened windows and balconies, makes the building seem far larger than it really is; in fact it is little more than one room thick in most parts. Though the primary source of its appeal is undoubtedly the fantastic honeycomb pink-and-white face, visitors can go inside (enter from the back) to see exactly where the women sat, and take a close look at the detailed stonework.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecso6y2ki"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[75.800003,26.92]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jaisalmer","description":"Posted by KaozIn the remote westernmost corner of Rajasthan, a good 100km beyond its closest neighbour Pokaran, JAISALMER is a desert town par excellence, its sand-yellow ramparts rising out of the arid Thar like a vision from Scheherazade. Put off by reports of rampant commercialism, many travellers never make the long detour out here, but in spite of all the souvenir shops, hotel touts and large tour groups, the town remains one of India\\'s most enchanting destinations. Villagers from outlying settlements, dressed in dazzling red and orange odhnis or voluminous turbans, still outnumber foreigners in the bazaar, while the exquisite sandstone architecture of the \"Golden City\" is quite unlike anything else in India.\r\n\r\nHavelis  \r\n \r\nThe streets of Jaisalmer are flanked with numerous honey-pale facades, covered with latticework and floral designs, but the city\\'s real showpieces are its havelis. Each of these extravagant mansions, comprising three or more storeys around a central courtyard, was commissioned by a wealthy merchant during the eighteenth or nineteenth century. Their stonework was the art of silavats, a community of masons responsible for much of Jaisalmer\\'s unique sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe large Patwon-ki-Haveli (daily 9.30am–5pm; Rs2), not far from Narayan NiwasHotel in the north of town, was constructed over fifty years by the Patwa merchants – brocade and opium traders. Five separate suites with individual entrances facing a narrow street are connected from within, and all have flat roof areas – the views are excellent. Traces of stylish wall-paintings survive in some rooms. The building\\'s most striking features, however, are its exuberantly carved jharokhas, or protruding balconies.\r\n\r\nSalim Singh\\'s small haveli provides Jaisalmer\\'s only favourable memory of the tyrannical Salim Singh Mohta, who became prime minister in 1800 after his father was murdered for publicly challenging a Rajput prince to repay a loan. From an early age, Salim seemed hell-bent on avenging this crime, impoverishing Jaisalmer\\'s citizens through vigorous taxation and extortion rackets, and holding the royal family to ransom by raising interest rates on their huge loans. He was eventually stabbed by a furious Rajput, and his wife made sure the wound wouldn\\'t heal by infesting it with poison. Their curious family home is topped with small blueish domes; its upper floor, enclosed by a protruding balcony, is best seen from the roof of Natraj Restaurant. The house is still lived in, but you can go inside for Rs15. On the road to Malka Pole, you pass the decorative facade of the late-nineteenth-century Nathmalji-ki-Haveli, also built for a prime minister of Jaisalmer. It\\'s Rs10 to visit inside and you can expect a hard sell at the gift shop.\r\n \r\nCamel safaris from Jaisalmer  \r\n \r\nFew visitors who make it as far as Jaisalmer pass up the opportunity to go on a camel trek, which provides an irresistibly romantic chance to cross the barren sands, sleeping under one of the starriest skies in the world. Sandstorms, sore backsides and camel farts aside, the safaris are usually great fun.\r\n\r\nAlthough you can travel for up to two weeks by camel from Jaisalmer to Bikaner, treks normally last from one to four days, at prices varying from Rs350 to Rs1500 per night. In general the less you spend the less you get, in terms of food, blankets, fitness of camel, and so forth. A lot depends on whether the guides are friendly, how big the group is, and what expectations you have. Freelance camel owners, working for extremely low prices, may stop you in the street and offer their services, but increased demand has resulted in high prices and very poor service from some. All in all, you\\'ll do better to go through an established agency or hotel. A couple of reputable operators are mentioned in this Guide, and you should also check with other travellers. Make sure you\\'ll be provided with an adequate supply of blankets (it can get very cold at night); a quota of fruit if you\\'re paying anything over the average; and a campfire. As a precaution, have the deal fixed on paper, giving the maximum size of the group, details of the food you\\'ll be getting, transport and anything else you\\'ve arranged. If you\\'re only going for a day, none of this applies, but wear a broad-brimmed hat and take high-factor sun-protection lotion.\r\n\r\nFollowing government restrictions on routes, most safaris head west of Jaisalmer through places such as Sam sand dunes, Lodurva, Amar Sagar, Bada Bagh and assorted small villages. Some visitors feel this puts too much emphasis on sightseeing; it\\'s possible to arrange a few days\\' amble through the desert without stopping at any monuments. Taking a Jeep at the start or end of the trek enables you to go further in a short time, and some travellers prefer to begin their trek at Khuhri. Longer treks to Pokaran, Jodhpur or Bikaner can also be arranged. Firms running treks into restricted areas should fix the necessary permits for you, but check in advance.\r\n\r\nHowever much you intend to spend on a trek, don\\'t book anything until you get to Jaisalmer. Unscrupulous touts trawl the train from Jodhpur, and even try to pick up tourists in Udaipur, but they, and the barrage of operators at the bus and railway stations, usually represent dodgy outfits, most of which are based at one or other of the small budget hotels north of the fort. Some offer absurdly cheap rooms if you agree to book a camel trek with them, but guesthouse notice boards (not to mention our postbags) are filled with sorry stories by tourists who accepted.\r\n \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecst76m0s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.900001,26.92]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jodhpur","description":"Posted by KaozOn the eastern fringe of the Thar Desert, JODHPUR, dubbed \"the Blue City\" after the colour-wash of its old town houses, sprawls across the arid terrain, overlooked by the mighty Meherangarh fort, whose ramparts rise from a sheer-sided sandstone outcrop. It was once the centre of Marwar, the largest princely state in Rajputana, and today has a population of 1.2 million. Most of the tourists that stop in Jodhpur only stay for a day, squeezing in a visit to the fort before heading west to Jaisalmer (300km) or east to Jaipur (320km). It\\'s a shame to rush the place though. Getting lost in the blue maze of the old city you\\'ll stumble across Muslim tie-dyers, puppet makers and traditional spice markets, while Jodhpur\\'s famed cubic roofscape, best viewed at sunset, is a photographer\\'s dream. In addition, the encroaching desert beyond the blue city is dotted with small settlements where you can escape the congestion for a taste of rural Rajasthan.\r\n\r\nMeherangarh Fort  \r\n \r\nJodhpur\\'s Meherangarh Fort (daily: summer 8.30am–1pm &amp; 2.30–5.30pm; winter 9am–1pm &amp; 2–5pm; Rs250 entry includes headphone guide; Rs200 extra for video, camera free; elevator Rs15), provides what must be the most authentic surviving taste of the ceaseless round of war, honour and extravagance that characterized Rajputana. Unlike the fort in Jaisalmer, it is uninhabited, its paths trodden only by visitors to the temples and palaces within its high crenellated walls. The walk up to the fort from the old city passes through busy bazaars, with some streets so narrow that pedestrians must advance in single file. You can also reach the fort by taxi or rickshaw along the much longer road (5km) that enters the old city at Nagauri Gate. Allow at least a couple of hours for a tour of the various exhibitions inside the palace, followed by a stroll out to the Durga temple, perched on the far southern tip of the precipice, from where the views over the old city are superb. A good place to steel yourself for the visit, or recover afterwards, is the fort\\'s cool little restaurant, just inside the main entrance.\r\n\r\nOn the wall next to Loha Pole, the sixth of seven gates designed to hinder the ascent of enemies up a steep winding cobbled road, are the handprints of Maharaja Man Singh\\'s widows. Following the Rajput code of honour, they voluntarily ended their lives in 1843 on their husband\\'s pyre, in defiance of the law against sati passed in 1829 by the British. As you stop to look at them, musicians and dancers will strike up in the hope of receiving a tip.\r\n\r\nBeyond the massive Suraj Pole, the final gate, lie the palaces that now serve as the Meherangarh Museum. From the courtyards, you can see the fantastic jali (lattice) work that almost entirely covers their sandstone walls and balconies, as well as a portrait of Rao Jodha himself. Solid silver howdahs (elephant seats) and palanquins are on display, as well as weapons and photos of the maharajas\\' coronations. In the Jhanki Mahal, or \"Queen\\'s Palace\", there\\'s a colourful array of cradles of former rulers, while Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace) holds the nine chairs reserved for the nine heads of the Jodhpurian state (and one central cushion for the maharaja). Outside, in Shangar Chowk (King\\'s Coronation Courtyard), is the majestic marble coronation seat upon which all the rulers apart from Jodha have been, and still are, crowned. One prize exhibit in the museum is a 250-year-old pure silk tent seized during a raid on the Moghul court in Delhi. The most elaborate of the apartments is Phool Mahal (Flower Palace), a dancing hall for the entertainment of the maharaja and his guests. Pictures of dancers, deities and rulers look out from its walls and wooden ceilings.\r\n \r\nVillage safaris  \r\n \r\nJodhpur\\'s surroundings can be explored on organized \"village safaris\", which take small groups of tourists out into rural Rajasthan, usually stopping at four or five villages of the local Bishnoi tribe where you can taste traditional food, learn about herbal remedies, and watch crafts such as spinning and carpet-making. The maharaja encourages the fair sale of Bishnoi handicrafts in the hope that they can thereby avoid the emigration to the city that has destroyed the traditional way of life of so much of India\\'s rural population. These tours get mixed reviews; some enjoy the experience, others find it totally contrived. A lot depends on the integrity of the operators and the relations they have with the villagers. Three inexpensive, commendable companies are: RTDC, based at the tourist office on High Court Road; the Govind Hotel on Station Road (tel 0291/254 5083); and Joshi, at Cosy Guest House, Novechokiya Road, Brahm Puri (tel 98290 23390). Rates start at around Rs900 per head for a group of eight and it\\'s a good idea to opt for a translator-guide, although this bumps the price up a little.

But as the powerhouse of Indian business, industry and trade, and the source of its most seductive media images, the Maharashtrian capital can be a compelling place to kill time. Whether or nor you find the experience enjoyable, however, will depend largely on how well you handle the heat, humidity, hassle, traffic fumes, relentless crowds, and appalling poverty, of India\\'s most dynamic, westernized city.\r\n\r\nFirst impressions of Mumbai tend to be dominated by its chronic shortage of space. Crammed onto a narrow spit of land that curls from the swamp-ridden coast into the Arabian Sea, the city has, in less than five hundred years since its \"discovery\" by the Portuguese, metamorphosed from an aboriginal fishing settlement into a sprawling megalopolis of over sixteen million people. Being swept along broad boulevards by endless streams of commuters, or jostled by coolies and hand-cart pullers in the teeming bazaars, you\\'ll continually feel as if Mumbai is about to burst at the seams.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the population problem and attendant poverty lie, paradoxically, in the city\\'s enduring ability to create wealth. Mumbai alone generates nearly forty percent of India\\'s GNP, its port handles half the country\\'s foreign trade, and its movie industry is the biggest in the world. Symbols of prosperity are everywhere: from the phalanx of office blocks clustered on Nariman Point, Maharashtra\\'s Manhattan, to the expensively dressed teenagers posing in Colaba\\'s trendiest nightspots.\r\n\r\nThe flip side to the success story, of course, is the city\\'s much chronicled poverty. Each day, hundreds of economic refugees pour into Mumbai from the Maharashtrian hinterland. Some find jobs and secure accommodation; many more (around a third of the total population) end up living on the already overcrowded streets, or amid the squalor of Asia\\'s largest slums, reduced to rag-picking and begging from cars at traffic lights.\r\n\r\nHowever, while it would definitely be misleading to downplay its difficulties, Mumbai is far from the ordeal some travellers make it out to be. Once you\\'ve overcome the major hurdle of finding somewhere to stay, you may begin to enjoy its frenzied pace and crowded, cosmopolitan feel.\r\n\r\nElephanta  \r\n \r\nAn hour\\'s boat ride from Colaba, the island of ELEPHANTA offers one of the more atmospheric escapes from the seething claustrophobia of the city – as long as you time your visit to avoid the weekend deluge of noisy day-trippers. Populated only by a small fishing community, it was originally known as Gharapuri, the \"city of Ghara priests\", until the island was renamed in the sixteenth century by the Portuguese in honour of the carved elephant they found at the port. Its chief attraction is its unique cave temple, whose massive Trimurti (three-faced) Shiva sculpture is as fine an example of Hindu architecture as you\\'ll find anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Deluxe\" boats set off from the Gateway of India (Oct–May hourly 9am–2.30pm; Rs85 return including government guide); book through the kiosks near the Gateway of India. Ask for your guide at the caves ticket office on arrival – they take about thirty minutes. Ordinary ferries (Rs65 return), also from the Gateway of India, don\\'t include guides, and are usually packed. The journey takes about an hour on either boat.\r\n\r\nCool drinks and souvenir stalls line the way up the hill, and at the top, the MTDC Chalukya restaurant offers food and beer, and a terrace with good views out to sea, but you cannot stay overnight on the island.\r\n \r\nGateway of India  \r\n \r\nCommemorating the visit of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911, India\\'s own honey-coloured Arc de Triomphe, the Gateway of India, was built in 1924 by George Wittet, the architect responsible for many of the city\\'s grandest constructions. It was originally envisaged as a ceremonial disembarkation point for passengers alighting from the P&amp;O steamers, but – ironically – is today more often remembered as the place the British chose to stage their final departure from the country. On February 28, 1948, the last detachment of troops remaining on Indian soil slow marched under the arch to board the waiting troop ship back to Tilbury. Nowadays, the only boats bobbing about at the bottom of its stone staircase are the launches that ferry tourists across the harbour to Elephanta Island.\r\n \r\nPrince of Wales Museum (Chhatrapati Shivaji Museum) and Jehangir Art Gallery  \r\n \r\nSet back from Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Road in its own grounds, the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India (Tues–Sun 10.15am–6pm; Rs150, Rs15 extra with camera), recently renamed as the tongue-twisting Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Sanghralaya, ranks among the city\\'s most distinctive Raj-era constructions. Crowned by a massive white Moghul-style dome, it houses a superb collection of paintings and sculpture that you\\'ll need several hours, or a couple of visits, to get the most out of. The building was designed by George Wittet, of Gateway of India fame, and is the epitome of the hybrid Indo-Saracenic style – regarded in its day as an \"educated\" interpretation of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Gujarati architecture, mixing Islamic touches with typically English municipal brickwork.\r\n\r\nThe central hall provides a snapshot of the collection with a few choice Moghul paintings, jade work, weapons and miniature clay and terracotta figures from the Mauryan (third century BC) and Kushana (first to second century AD) periods.\r\n\r\nThe main sculpture room on the ground floor displays some fine fourth- and fifth-century heads and figures from the Buddhist state of Gandhara, a former colony of Alexander the Great (hence the Greek-style statues). Important Hindu sculptures include a seventh-century Chalukyan bas-relief from Aihole depicting Brahma seated on a lotus, and a sensuously carved torso of Mahisasuramardini, the goddess Durga with tripod raised ready to skewer the demon buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe main attraction on the first floor has to be the superb collection of Indian painting, including illustrated manuscripts and erotic Gita Govinda paintings in the pre-Moghul Sultanate style. Moghul schools are well represented, too, with famous portraits and folios from the reign of Akbar (1556–1605)\r\n\r\nEuropean art – including a minor Titian and a Constable – is featured on the second floor, alongside a collection weapons belonging to various Moghul emperors. The poorly lit Indian textiles room showcases brocaded saris, turbans, and intricately pattered antique Kashmiri shawls.\r\n\r\nTechnically in the same compound as the Prince of Wales Museum, though approached from further up MG Road, the Jehangir Art Gallery (daily 11am–7pm; free) is Mumbai\\'s best-known venue for contemporary art, with five small galleries specializing in twentieth-century arts and crafts from around the world. You never know what you\\'re going to find – most exhibitions last only a week and exhibits are often for sale.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecspfwscn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[72.819999,18.959999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mysore","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecstxm1bg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[76.65,12.3]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nasik","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecslp7u92"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.780853,20.00066]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pune","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecsquk7t9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.839996,18.53]}},{"properties":{"name":"Somnathpur","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecsr2esxm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[76.8833313,12.2666664]}},{"properties":{"name":"Udaipur","description":"Posted by KaozReflected in the shimmering waters of Pichola Lake, UDAIPUR\\'s skyline of whitewashed havelis and tapering temple shikharas, surmounted by the domes and ornately carved balconies of the famous Rajput city palace, has managed to keep its head above the rising tide of hotels and terrace restaurants, and remains one of Asia\\'s most exotic spectacles. Enjoying it from a boat at water level, or on a rooftop in the cool of the evening, many travellers are tempted to forget their tight itineraries. In any case, it takes at least a week to explore the city\\'s monuments, and the temples, forts, palaces and scenery of the hills and valleys nearby.\r\n\r\nThe smooth rolling hills that surround Udaipur were once covered with forests. Widespread felling, instigated by the Indian government in the 1970s after it took possession of the Mewar lands, left them irreversibly barren and have added to the dry and dusty desert conditions of the Udaipur valley.\r\n\r\nLake Pichola  \r\n \r\nThe serene lakeside location chosen by Udai for his new capital made a welcome change from the craggy heights of Chittaurgarh. He enlarged the lake, which drew water from mountains up to 160km away, and now covers eight square kilometres. Later rulers added dams and canals to prevent flooding during the monsoon.\r\n\r\nThe two islands in the lake, topped with the ivory-white domes and arches of private palaces, are the most familiar and photogenic features of Udaipur. Jag Niwas, now the Lake Palace Hotel, is the larger of the two, built as a summer palace during the reign of Jagat Singh (1628–52). If you aren\\'t staying here, you can visit the palace for lunch, dinner or afternoon tea; the price includes the boat ride from the mainland (booking advisable).\r\n\r\nThe larger Jag Mandir, on the island to the south, has changed little since its construction by Karan Singh in 1615. (It takes its name from Jagat Singh who added to the initial structure.) Intended as a small Rajput palace, it was never used as such; Karan Singh offered refuge here to the Moghul prince Khurum (later Emperor Shah Jahan), exiled by his father, Emperor Jahangir, in the 1620s. Khurum succeeded his father while still in Udaipur, and the Moghul gathering for the occasion defied the established code of Rajput–Moghul enmity. During the 1857 Mutiny the island once again served as a safe haven, this time for European women and children. The main building facing the City Palace has detailed stone inlay work within its domed roof. In front of it a green marble chhatri carved with vines and flowers is the centrepiece of a garden guarded by stone elephants. Jag Mandir\\'s only inhabitants other than flocks of birds are three royal servants who tend the gardens and grow flowers for the maharana\\'s celebrations.\r\n\r\nHalf-hour boat rides around the lake depart from the jetty behind the City Palace, below the Fateh Prakash Palace hotel (hourly: April–Sept 8–11am &amp; 3–6pm; Oct–March 10am–noon &amp; 2–5pm; Rs100), while an hour\\'s trip (hourly 2–6pm; Rs2000) includes a stop at Jag Mandir. The view of the palaces and shoreline from the lake at sunset is one of the most memorable images of Rajput splendour. To make the most of them by boat, however, you\\'ll have to sit on the side facing the palace (they usually run anticlockwise around the lake, so check when you get on).\r\n \r\nCity Palace  \r\n \r\nUdaipur\\'s fascinating City Palace stands moulded in soft yellow stone on a rocky promontory on the northwest shore of Lake Pichola, its thick windowless base crowned with ornate turrets and canopies. Eleven constituent mahals (palaces), constructed by successive maharanas during the three hundred years that followed the foundation of Udaipur in 1559, together form the largest royal complex in Rajasthan.\r\n\r\nPart of the palace is now a museum (daily 9.30am–4.30pm; Rs50, Rs100 extra for camera, Rs300 extra for video), entered through Toran Pole from the massive courtyard where elephants once lined up for inspection before battle. Although guided tours (Rs95 for a non-Indian language) are not compulsory, they do serve to illuminate the chronology of the palaces, the significance of the paintings, and details of the lives of the maharanas.\r\n\r\nEverywhere you look the marble and granite walls are laden with brilliant miniature paintings, decorated with tiles or overlaid with spangling mosaics of coloured glass and mirrors, and each room glows with sunlight filtering through stained-glass windows. Narrow low-roofed passages connect the different mahals and courtyards, creating a haphazard effect, designed to prevent surprise intrusion by armed enemies.\r\n\r\nEach of the three large peacocks (mor) set into the walls of the seventeenth-century Mor Chowk, placed there by Sajjan Singh two hundred years after the palace was built, is composed of 5000 pieces of glass, glittering in green, gold and blue. The pillared apartments that face Mor Chowk are adorned with scenes from Krishna legends. Corridors lead to another chamber called Kanch-ki-Burj, decorated throughout with a mosaic of mirrors, and to Chandra Chowk (Moon Square), which encloses its own garden on the crest of a hill in the heart of the palace.\r\n\r\nMore hallways, some with good views of Lake Pichola, continue to the Zenana Mahal, the women\\'s quarters, decorated with more legends of Krishna. With alcoves, balconies, coloured windows, tiled walls and floors, these are amongst the most splendid rooms in the palace. Krishna Vilas, an apartment full of miniatures, honours a nineteenth-century Udaipur princess who poisoned herself to avoid the dilemma of choosing a husband from the two rival households of Jodhpur and Jaipur.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62ecszo2jwk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.690002,24.579999]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/11320","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kaoz","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kaoz","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/11320","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":18,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=11320,platial:user=kaoz","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41756}
