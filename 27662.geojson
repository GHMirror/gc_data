The price includes sales tax, state excise tax, and federal excise tax.\n\nYou can pump directly into your car from our fuel station-style pump that\\'s California Weights and Measures certified. We also offer fuel in 5 gallon containers called carboys that give you the freedom of fueling whenever and wherever you like. Many of our customers fill up their tanks and then stock up with 10-20 gallons in carboys, so they only come to the Oasis every month or two and minimize their driving to get fuel. The carboys cost  for the container plus the cost of the 5 gallons of fuel.\nBioFuel Oasis was founded in 2003 to provide greater access to biodiesel, a renewable fuel that reduces harmful tailpipe emissions.

Burke, Inc. has been reliably delivering premium diesel fuel, motor oil and gasoline to fleets and industry throughout the Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island area. \n\nWhile Detroit offers several variations of new Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV) that average over 50 miles to the gallon, independent fuel marketers are introducing \"Biodiesel,\" a healthier, renewable energy solution that seems to be meeting just about everyone\\'s approval. The Burke Gas Station on Beacham Street in Chelsea is the first station in the state of Massachusetts to offer biodiesel products  Biodiesel B20 at the pump and Biodiesel B100 in drums and pails. \n\nBiodiesel is a clean, diesel fuel substitute made from soybeans, canola, and recycled cooking oil from restaurants. It can be burned safely in any standard, unmodified diesel engine, either in pure form (B100) or in a 20% blend (B20) with 80% petroleum diesel. Most truck manufacturers recommend using B20 in their engines. Pure biodiesel is completely biodegradable, and poses minimal concerns to soil and water contamination. Biodiesel is also non-toxic to plants, animals and humans. On the performance side, biodiesel\\'s higher cetane rating results in excellent engine performance and fuel economy. Biodiesel has outstanding lubricity characteristics. Blend ratios as low as 1% can provide up to 30% more lubricity over conventional diesel fuel. And a higher flash point means it\\'s safer to handle. \n\nAs one of New England\\'s largest suppliers of diesel fuel, gasoline and motor oil products, Dennis K. Burke is proud to be first in bringing biodiesel to Massachusetts.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atdns5ra5g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.047724,42.39452]}},{"properties":{"name":"Denver Biodiesel","description":"Posted by Luisdb1005511 Washington, Denver Co 80216<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atdo0ikryu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.97827,39.796728]}},{"properties":{"name":"Denver Biodiesel","description":"Posted by Luisdb1005511 Washington, Denver Co 80216Denver Biodiesel cooperative provides biodiesel at prices competitive to petroleum diesel.
