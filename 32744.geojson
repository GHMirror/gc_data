There are few streets that follow a straight line from beginning to end.  Even in Boston the roads and avenues can take on the form of a horrific labyrinth of one way streets and rotaries that appear to be in a nice gridlock system until an out of state tourist traverses downtown.  It is a strange phenomenon on how people can drive under such conditions, but seeing how Albert Steadman navigated his white \\'96 Chevy on the same roads at night, while lighting up a joint, the twists and turns of the ride seemed less mysterious.\n\n\nThere isn\\'t much mystery to Albert, an out of school under the table worker who lives in Cambridge Mass just outside of Boston.  In a way he is very lucky where he is right now with an opportunity to head back to school later in the year.  “The past two years have been a real eye opener for me,” he said.  I think I have learned more than I did when I was learning jack shit at college.”\n\n\nAbout two and a half years ago in the summer of 2005, Albert was living at home with his mom in Pepperell Mass and was a commuter to Middlesex Community College about an hour away.  He had gone down to Daytona Florida for a few weeks to visit a friend, get high on whatever went past him, and enjoy the last moments of summer.  Back in Massachusetts though, his mom stumbled upon his hidden stash and grow room he had in his closet, something she had a hunch on but could never find proof.  It was from this chain of event that Albert was thrown out of his attic bedroom and forced to live on his own at the cost of four buddings of marijuana.\n\n\n“I was very lucky to have found a roommate in such a short time,” he said in between two big hits off the joint.  He taped out the roach and rolled the windows down to let in some fresh air.  Albert\\'s love of the weed may not be far off from what most Generation Nexters (Generation Y 18 to 25 year olds) think of the drug.  Even his hair cut, thick dreadlocks, shows how the generation that came of age in a post 9/11 world thinks about his society and his place in it.  By the days end though, he seems to be just happy with a job in a market that is struggling to keep up.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpeq7d7dn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.59876,42.66906]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dan the Computer Wiz","description":"Posted by MgiguereMaybe it is the geek in him that draws Dan Pernoud to computers.  By the time he became a senior, he had gone through three computers, two of them he built by himself.  “It’s just a hobby I love to do.  It’s interesting and I love making them from scratch.  I don’t see how some people have a hard time making something when they have the parts to do it.”\n\nLike Dan, most of the kids in his generation grew up surrounded by the visual splendor that is computers which in no time surpassed the knowledge of many older people who were raised on using typewriters and library resources.  But what Dan does on his rig isn’t just the medical homework he has to complete for the day.  One of his greatest passions is playing video games when ever he has free time.\n\nMost of the time he can be seen leveling up his Night Elf Mage in World of Warcraft, an online role playing game that connects millions of other players from around the world to team up and battle against one another.  While many of the same players loose track of time and their duties, Dan knows how to balance his work and his hobbies as well spending time with his fiancé Lilly.\n\n“Sure it can be hard to pull so any things together at once, but it’s always a good feeling to get that feeling of accomplishment when I finish my homework or beat a boss in a dungeon,” he says in a proud tone.  If there is a chance to beat out the stereotypes of this generation that some say are way too lazy for their own good Dan seems to be a shining example of perseverance in them.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpertgrw7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05824,41.47322]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dining","description":"Posted by MgiguereEven more telling of how the Boomers care for their kids is what sacrifices they make to ensure their children have a future to do what they chose. As a member of Valparaiso University’s Dinning Services staff for over 20 years, Diane Krause continues to provide service to the university and its community that started when she wanted to provider her children with a full college experience. Joining Dinning Services in October of 1986, Krause had worked up to supervisor over the years and continues to work, showing no signs of slowing down.\n\n“I started at the bottom in the dish room and worked my way up to where I am now,” said Krause. She began her work part-time at what is now the student bookstore back in the time when it used to house students and a cafateria. From there she became a full time employee exclusively at the Student Union – then called Ye Old Grail. During the mid 90’s she was promoted to supervisor of Jesters where she works today providing the hordes of hungry students who eat there everyday.\n\nIt is interesting to see how the next generation will shape up to the self-sacrificing mentally of the Boomers. The time now is a far cry off when a generation came of age where their President asked them what they can do for their country. Hopefully sacrifices like these will mold the future into other’s that will give back to the opportunity that was given to them. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpenb3m4a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05772,41.47669]}},{"properties":{"name":"Housekeeping","description":"Posted by MgiguereThe Valparaiso University Housekeeping service is located far off on old campus that most people pass by without knowing what it is. The office building that headquarters Housekeeping Services is rather small two floored office that holds all the equipment and staff needs for all of campus. The one thing that stands out among all of the equipment and cleaning supplies are the stacks of paper and operational manuals.  In such a small two floored building, the clutter of papers takes on a mind of its own sometimes.\n\n“We have a policy for just about everything and we have a procedure for about everything,” said Dan Brooks, as he pointed to a massive three ring bound binder that had about 1000 pages in it alone. Everything, from the smallest detail of how to mop a floor to how to properly close a building is kept on file in some form or another. “I could tell you how much square feet are in a building,” he said with a smile.  Dan has worked at this job as supervisor for over twenty years, back to the time when there wasn\\'t even a VU Housekeeping Service.   Even after all of this time, his job involving more to do with papers than cleaning supplies, he still enjoys his work.   “We’re a service industry,” he says, “and out motto is ‘We’re Here to Serve.’”\n\nIt seems like a daunting task to clean one building on the Valparaiso University campus and then multiply that by about 20. The VU Housekeeping Services is responsible for cleaning every building on campus inside and out. It is a cycle that never truly ends but needs to be done not only for cleanliness but also personal reasons. “People just like to come into a clean office in the morning and that makes them feel better about themselves and the job they have to do.” This in turn makes the housekeepers feel good about the job they do as well, most of the time at least.\n\n“Once in a while we’ll get an acknowledgment, but not all the time. It’s like people think there are these invisible people that come in and clean the place at night,” one of Dan co-workers said as she passed by the office. There are many like Dan in these offices of cleaning supplies mixed in with the paper trails of catalogs and operating procedures. To Dan it’s important to be prideful and aware of the job that needs to be done for the day. Just a small acknowledgment on the job being done is enough to keep at it.  Just like their motto, they only want to serve and make other people\\'s day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpetfhg3d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04996,41.46662]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mike Overtime Lover Maahs","description":"Posted by MgiguereMike Maahs is overworked for the week.  In a short amount of time he has managed to work two jobs, one for his school’s IT department at Valparaiso University and another for the local pub Past Times as a dishwasher.  What he holds in his hands is the payoff for several months of overtime and many nights of sleep deprivation.\n\n“I so nervous that I have to tell someone about this,” he says while opening the box in his hand.  Inside there is a small diamond ring.  “My plan is,” he continues “Is to take her out to a nice dinner with a band playing music.  Then I want to give her a necklace I bought her to celebrate two amazing years of being together.  After that I want to give her this.” \n\nIt is a big step for Mike but it is one he is more than willing to take.  His hard work prevailed when it came down to popping the question as his now fiancé, Heidi, fighting back tears of joy, said yes.  It is further proof that this is a generation that has to overcome the speculations of their predecessors who think it is a generation full of lazy loafer who mooch of their parents.  Mike not only proves them wrong, he also sees how the work has paid off.  \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpeygim71"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04541,41.4701]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nurse Mary","description":"Posted by MgiguereWhile the future of the world will be in the hands of Generation Y, for the past few decades it has been in the hands of the Baby Boom Generation.  Soon there will be many new people heading to retirement, but due to the current situation involving Social Security and privatizing of many of the staples for many to survive on there is still a lot of uncertainty in how the future will hold.\n\nMary Giguere, a nurse at Lahey Hospital in Burlington Mass, has he doubt on how she can plan for a retirement with putting three kids through college as a single mother.  Like many Baby Boomers, Mary has been divorced for almost ten years when her ex husband William left.  Forced into a situation, she paid her way through Nursing school with the help of some friends and working in a social clinic.  Even with a paying job it is still hard to get by.  “Last week I lost most of my retirement funds in one of my stocks when the market plunged,” she said, commenting when the Dow lost over 400 points in a single day due to the sell off in Eastern markets.  “There are times when I worry how I will be able to get through retirement and how far I can go.”\n\nInstead of worrying over bills, Mary takes action.  On the same day she filed all of her and her children\\'s\\' taxes and federal loans forms, she took out a bank loan and placed into an account to gain interest on it.  Maybe one of the biggest differences in the two generations is the risks the Boomers are willing to take.  Many of the Ys are unsure of what their future plans are and a great number of them are staying back at their parents home right out of college for a longer time than past generations.\n\nEveryday Mary makes her hour long commute where she will sometimes work well over twelve hour days.  There are days when the work becomes too stressful to deal with the work at home and the house suffers from negligence (her high school daughter helps but she too is out of the house to often to help).\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpekg4imu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.65069,42.66615]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tom's Secret Service","description":"Posted by MgiguereIt\\'s hard to guess who maybe working for the government in this day and age; the need for secrecy is paramount.  Every so often there is someone who is willing to take the flack of others\\' opinion and do what is needed for their county.  That\\'s how Tom Arrow sees it.  “The one thing I don\\'t enjoy about this job is how people misunderstand what we do.”\n\nAs a student intern, Tom has taken a position for the National Security Agency at Fort Meade in Maryland.  Most of his job is a secret even to him, but when you job involves gathering intelligence to keep the home front safe, it comes with the territory.  “It\\'s not like we personally search everyones e-mail and phone records,” he says.  “We have to maintain the security of the nation however.”\n\nThere is more the job than he lets by however, since most of it is classified.  What is open to the public is the multiple guard posts stationed outside the fort.  “Everyday going to work that semester was like going into a war zone, the place is lined with pillboxes and machine guns and it\\'s all so cool.\n\nThat would be the most he would ever talk about concerning the NSA.  To be fair, it is one mysterious government organizations, one that has gotten plenty of attention in the past year due a legal scandal involving unwarranted wire taps and released phone records.  And while Tom assures that what he has seen is done by the books, the secrecy that goes on is what scares most people.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpemw3coi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.94824,39.08317]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tyler's Moshpit","description":"Posted by MgiguereThere is something about the flatness to Florida that doesn\\'t appeal to me all that much. For my friend Tyler Rodriguez it fits him all too well. It could also be the sun that makes him like the place so much, the way it bears down most of the day and scorches the the palm trees and shirtless backs of the throng of tourists. Tyler as an American Hispanic and college student at Embry-Riddle fits right in to the huge mix of diversity in the area.\n\nWe cruise around Orlando in his old Nissan Sentra which has seen better days after being banged up by a tornado that ripped through his school and apartment complex last December on Christmas day. “That was some gift,” he joked as he made the turn into the city. Like our good friend Albert Steadman (see Albert) he too is of the new generation of kids who will soon be unleashed upon the world of terrorism and a unstable job market in this country, but unlike Albert he has plans to head on to do graduate work later in the year so that one day he can work for Houston Space Command. It has been a long road so far for him and it seems to be even longer before he can reach that goal. “The work is tough and sometimes I have struggled to keep up with all of it,” he admits, “but I think in the long run it will be all worth it.”\n\nWe finally make a stop on Orange St. to a place called the Social. It\\'s a small bar and venue for local and indie bands to throw a show. The price is right too, only 5 a ticket gets you in and able to enjoy three bands preform. Tyler takes the opportunity to grab a drink and head to the front of the stage to see what he came here for, Horse the Band. After a lot a bad noise from the crowd and some warm up bands, the show is about to begin. No sooner than the lead singer arrived on stage in a drunken stager, the whole pit starts to flip out like a bunch of ninjas on speed. Tyler is there in the middle, head-banging to hardcore mix of guitars, drums, scream lyrics, and keyboard sounds that belong in a 80\\'s style Nintendo game.\n\nThe place is packed with Gen Nexters moshing and rocking to the sounds. To many of them, it\\'s the start of nice week break, a way to release all the pent up energy and angst that comes with high school and college.  Several guys in the pit start flailing their arms in wild movements and everyone around them are making room in their wake.  After the concert Tyler was furious at them for being such hogs.  “It\\'s bullshit man.  They take up such a large space with no concern for the others around them.  That\\'s not how you mosh in such a place.”\n\nThankfully to others around wanting to enjoy the music, these pit hogs can\\'t maintain their energy long enough for five seconds.  Tyler, on the other hand, just thrashes back and forth, going with the energy of the music.  This is the time to let loose and start a riot, something you can\\'t get away with in the outside world.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qlpeq7v6vw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.36475,28.61346]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20732","metadata":null,"contact_name":"mgiguere","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:mgiguere","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20732","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":8,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20732,platial:user=mgiguere","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":32744}
