Eighth St. Holland, MI 49424Traditional German specialities in a beautiful setting. \n\nThe Alpenrose is not just a restaurant. It\\'s an idea: to bring an authentic taste of the Alps to downtown Holland. To the average passerby, \"the Alps\" probably sparks visions of lederhosen and oompah bands, but the famed European mountain range actually carves through countries as diverse as Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland--a cornucopia of cultures and cuisines which can all claim the title \"Alpen.\"\n\nYears before our 1991 opening, many of us who were involved in developing this idea called Alpenrose, began cultivating an ever-deepening affinity for the people and places of the region. We hope that our on-going love affair is reflected, not only in the food we prepare and the service we deliver, but throughout the Alpenrose facility itself. \n\nEntering the Alpenrose, it\\'s hard to image that this building once housed a run-of-the-mill discount store. The Alpenrose is wall-to-wall wood, even support columns and ceiling rafters display exquisite wooden carvings of the Alpenrose--a rhododendron type flower found throughout the Alps.\n\nOur dream of bringing Alpen charm to West Michigan is reflected in our multiple dining rooms as well. From our family-oriented Kitzbuhel ski lodge to the classical, fine-dining elegance of our Salzburg room to the tasteful banquets available in the Garmisch room,  Alpenrose is a magnificent microcosm of the many dining experiences available in the Alpen region.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65xwup9m36z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.106995,42.790166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Butch's Dry Dock","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:7Lh1ywN8pgs_JM:http://www.reckley.com/images/1-butchs.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 44 East 8th St. Holland, MI 49423Fine dining, extensive wine selection<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65xwuche042"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.105294,42.790178]}},{"properties":{"name":"Country Inns &amp; Suites","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://www.countryinns.com/chi/images/hotels/HOLLAND/lobby_339.jpg\">12260 James St. Holland, MI 49424The Country Inn-Holland Michigan, combines business professionalism with friendly service, a clean comfortable environment, inviting accommodations, expanded complimentary breakfast and value enhanced rates.\n\nIt\\'s all about the little things we do in the country.

In 1994, feeling there was both a need and an opportunity to enhance their relationship with the Holland community, Hope College began working on plans for a hotel and conference center. These plans, soon fueled by a generous combined corporate/family donation to the \"Hope in the Future\" campaign from Haworth Inc. and the Haworth Family, began to take shape as the Haworth Inn and Conference Center at Hope College.\n\nOpening its doors to business on January 13, 1997, the Haworth Inn and Conference Center has fifty guest rooms and twelve conference rooms covering more than 10,000 square feet.
