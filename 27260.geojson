It\\'s not too far from Athens, and not terribly far from Gwinett County, but it\\'s quite a haul from here to Downtown Atlanta and even farther for us west of town.  Interesting that the NASCAR track down in Hampton isn\\'t all that close to Atlanta either, but I suppose it\\'s closer than Commerce.\r\n\r\nWell, here\\'s where I get my racing fix.  I can\\'t stand to watch the round track drivers ride around in a circle 500 times.  If that\\'s your fancy, bonus, but I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve wasted all my patience for a long sporting event on the baseball game.  Now when it comes to auto racing, I want it to be quick.\r\n\r\nBy the time it takes round track to finish one race, the drag strip has hosted scores of races.  The top fuel and funny cars here run in the low 4\\'s.  That\\'s a quarter of a mile in just over 4 seconds for those who don\\'t know.  The power that these machines generate is nothing short of incredible.  I saw a car with a jet engine at an air show at Dobbins AFB one time, and that thing looked slower than molasses compared to these cars.  I\\'m sure many of you have seen a Ferrari outrun a fighter jet for a quarter mile.  That\\'s what I\\'m talking about.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder, how much faster can they get?  If the races end in less than 3 seconds at that level, will people start to complain that they\\'re not getting their money\\'s worth?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qxufd3za"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.471889,34.262892]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aunt Martha","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 3196 Misty Valley Dr Macon, GAThis is where my Aunt lives in Macon.

General John Hood’s scouts spotted General John Geary’s force.  The Confederates then entrenched and waited for General Geary to strike.  Union troops advanced and struck Major General Alexander Stewart’s division along the road and Brigadier General Marcellus Stovall’s division in the church cemetery.  General Joseph Hooker became disoriented and confused by poor maps and a lack of communications.  General Hooker decided to wait until he received reinforcements and fresh orders.  Sherman’s orders were to attack in attempt to flank the Rebels before they could fortify.  Unfortunately for Hooker, the Confederate forces were already entrenched, and his pause gave them additional time to fortify their earthworks with logs, brush, and especially briars, which they would cut down and pile in front of their positions in order to help prevent infantry penetration of the lines.  Hooker’s attempts to advance were repulsed.  The battle, which lasted through the 26th, was fought during a bad thunderstorm, which made conditions even worse for the Federals, who were unable to dislodge the Rebel forces.  Union losses included approximately 1,600 dead, while Confederate losses were between 500-750.  Because of the battlefield defeats and jungle-like conditions of the area, such as the intense thunderstorms, heavy tree canopy, dense forests with near zero visability, dense underbrush with absolute-zero visability, swamps, lack of population, unbearable heat and humidity, the Union soldiers who fought at New Hope Church, Pickett’s Mill, and Dallas, nicknamed Paulding County, “The Hell Hole.”\r\n\r\nSome people live in the Big Apple, some live in the City of Angels, others live in the Windy City.

Here, the Marlins have won two World Series, while the Dolphins haven\\'t won a SuperBowl since they moved from the Orange Bowl in downtown Miami.  In fact, the Dolphins haven\\'t won the SuperBowl in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nFormerly known as Joe Robbie and Pro Players Stadium, Dolphin Stadium is a great venue for football, and while it handles baseball just fine, it\\'s obviously not a stadium designed for baseball.\r\n\r\nThe Marlins organization and the City of Miami had talked earlier about building a new baseball stadium in downtown Miami, but I heard that the State of Florida wouldn\\'t back the deal with state funds.  As much as I would like to see the Marlins get the new stadium downtown, I have to back the governor on the decision he made.  For Atlanta and Georgia it\\'s easier....you have one team for each major sport and they\\'re all in one city, which just happens to be the capitol and regional hub.  In Florida, on the other hand, you\\'ve got multiple teams in each sport spread all over the state, and none of them are in Tallahassee.  So if you help build a stadium for the Marlins, why not the D-Rays or any other pro sports team for that matter?\r\n\r\nEnough preaching, I saw the Marlins play San Diego here one night with my sister and brother-in-law.  The Padres shut them down that night (that was when the Marlins were still one of the newest teams in the Majors).  They didn\\'t get good until 1997, when they won it all.  The Marlins have still never lost a post-season series.\r\n\r\nFlorida seems to have become Atlanta\\'s trouble team.  Montreal used to be the team that would beat Atlanta without mercy no matter how good the Braves played against everone else.  The Marlins have now seemed to fill that role.  Think about it, the Marlins have won two world series and were born into a division that the Braves have owned ever since the Marlins came into the league.  So while they\\'ve never been able to win a division, they still have not been beaten in a post-season series.  It\\'s quite a coincidence that because Florida and Colorado came into the league, the Major Leagues were forced to realign divisions.  Because of realignment, in order to have an even number of playoff contenders, the wild card slot had to be added.  Florida has won two World Series by getting into the playoffs as a wild card team.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qxunfgh7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.238862,25.957968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dr. Augustus Smith House Site, 1864","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> Acworth, GAIn this vicinity in 1864 stood the house of Dr. Augustus Smith.

General William Hardee first set up his headquarters here on May 23 as his corps marched south into Paulding County from Stegall\\'s Station (now known as Emerson).  The next day, General John Hood set up his headquarters here as his troops were marching from Allatoona Pass to check Sherman\\'s move towards Dallas at New Hope Church.\r\n\r\nOn October 5, Major General Samuel French set up his headquarters here after he retreated from an aborted attempt to retake Allatoona Pass.  He was enroute to meet up with General Hood at New Hope Church in order to combine forces to strike Union supply lines north of Atlanta.  At this point Atlanta had already fallen, and the main defensive force was reeling to try to stop Sherman\\'s March to the Sea, which ended in the capture of Savannah (Lincoln\\'s 1864 Christmas present from Sherman).

A palisaded earthen fort, barracks, and a cypress blockhouse were built in 1721 by soldiers under the command of Colonel John \"Tuscarora Jack\" Barnwell.  The fort caught fire in 1725, damaging the blockhouse and destroying the barracks.  It was partially rebuilt in 1727, but was promptly abandoned as the garrison was moved to South Carolina.  Although the outpost was never attacked, the garrison suffered heavily from malaria and the unforgiving environment of the marsh.  General James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia, brought Scottish Highlanders to the abandoned site in 1736, just three years after the colony was established.  Their settlement, which was named Darien, survived and went on to become the global export center of lumber until 1925.\r\n\r\nNear the fort site was a Guale town called Talaje and later a Spanish mission called Santo Domingo de Talaje, which was built in 1595.  It was destroyed during the Guale uprising of 1597.  The Spaniards returned and rebuilt the mission, but it was destroyed and abandoned permanently in 1661.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qxto46fx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.415091,31.363788]}},{"properties":{"name":"George Darby House, 1864","description":"Posted by MountainmaverickHiram, GANear this point, stood the house of George Darby, which briefly served as headquarters for Brigadier General Patrick Cleburne.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qxvtunuj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.749415,33.904986]}},{"properties":{"name":"Georgia Dome","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/gdome02.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAHome of the Falcons and the annual Peach Bowl.

I wasn\\'t too happy with Miami\\'s performance against LSU, it kind of reminded me of the only Falcons game I went to.  They were playing San Francisco, and we were a little bit late, so by the time we walked in, it was already 14-0 49ers.  Oh well, at least we got to see the Falcons only points, which came from a field goal.  I think Frisco wound up beating us 49-3 or something like that, and to rub it in even more, that was when Deion had just gone to the Niners, ouch!

The park was created to protect, interpret, and memorialize the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain fought in June 1864.  In addition to history, the park contains an extensive trail network through hardwood forests that have been left undisturbed for almost a century.  The views from the peak of Kennesaw are incredible, and the view of the Atlanta skyline points to its strategic significance during the Civil War.\r\n\r\nTotal trail lengths are approximately 16 miles, and the peak of the mountain is 1,808 feet above sea level.  Significant geographic features pertinent to the battle include Kennesaw Mountain, Little Kennesaw Mountain, Pigeon Hill, Burnt Hickory Road, Dallas Road (Highway 120), Noses Creek, Kolb\\'s Farm, John Ward Creek, and Cheatham Hill.\r\n\r\nCheatham Hill is where the worst of the intense fighting took place.  Union troops dubbed it the \"Dead Angle,\" because it was at Cheatham Hill, that a massive Union force attempted to break a deeply entrenched Confederate force, and wave after wave of Union troops were cut down by well timed volleys from the Rebel troops.  The State of Illinois has erected an impressive memorial in rememberance of the tremendous sacrifice that their troops gave at Cheatham Hill.  The soldiers\\' accounts that I read about the battle in the museum and especially about Cheatham Hill were so horrifyingly sick, that I just about broke down reading it.  I just had to stop.

This community is home to the oldest public building in the State of Georgia.  New Ebenezer established Georgia\\'s first public school, and in 1737, it\\'s first public orphanage.\r\n\r\nThe community\\'s founders were Protestant Austrians who fled Salzburg in 1734 because of religious persecution.  After consulting with the colony\\'s founder, General James Oglethorpe, the Salzburgers decided to establish their community of Ebenezer six miles up Ebenezer Creek.  Outbreaks of disease forced the settlers to move the community to the current site of New Ebenezer, near the banks of the Savannah.  The new site was a success, and it grew to a population of over 1600.\r\n\r\nEach settler family was given a Mulberry Tree from the Trustee\\'s Garden in Savannah for the purposes of producing silk.  Although, James Oglethorpe\\'s vision was of the entire colony establishing a silk industry in the New World, most silk production failed.  New Ebenezer was one of the very few exceptional communities where silk production actually thrived.\r\n\r\nThe only thing left of the original community is Jerusalem Lutheran Church, it\\'s cemetery, and a house.  The current church was built in 1769.  During the Revolution, British Colonel Archibald Campbell captured, burned, and looted New Ebenezer.  The British used the community as a prison camp and the church for a hospital, storehouse, and stable.  In 1782, Colonial forces under the command of General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne drove the British from New Ebenezer.  In July of that same year, the Georgia Legislature met in the church.  After the war, most of the Salzburgers left the gutted town.  One of the original Salzburger colonists, John Treutlen, was an Amerian patriot who became the first governor of the State of Georgia, and was subsequently murdered in South Carolina by Tories in 1782.\r\n\r\nMany Salzburger descendants return every year on the anniversary of their ancestors\\' arrival in Georgia on March 12.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qy3adhhu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.182386,32.378603]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oakdale Road Trailhead","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Smyrna, GAThis proposed trailhead will act as the eastern end of the Silver Comet Trail as well as the beginning of the Silver Comet - Cumberland Connector Trail, which will eventually access part of the Kennesaw Mountain - Chattahoochee River Trail.

This is in stark contrast to the other two battles that took place here in Paulding County, New Hope Church and Dallas. Of course, Dallas has been developed for years, and the city continues to grow, but New Hope Community has seen only recent development, but it has been dramatic, and now most of the former battlefield is paved over. I guess we could now call it the Battle of Publix Shopping Center. Metro Atlanta has a bad reputation for paving over its history. Enough preaching. \r\n\r\nThe Battle of Picketts Mill was an absolute fiasco as Union forces attempting to \"turn the corner\" of the Dallas-New Hope Line walked into a trap. Ironically, the most prominent factor that led to their defeat was a lack of good maps of the area. Union officers marched their men through a dense forest in an attempt to engage the opposing Confederate line. In order to do this, they had to march down an extremely steep ravine, and climb back up the steep creek bank on the other side of Picketts Mill Creek. They attempted this under direct fire from perfectly positioned Confederate artillery. The result was an awful bloodbath, from which the Union officers reluctantly withdrew. \r\n\r\nA paraphrased description complete with personal corrections and some of my own commentary thrown in: \r\n\r\nPickett’s Mill is named after Benjamin and Malachi Pickett who moved to the rugged and densely forested ridges west of Kennesaw (known then as Big Shanty) to build a business and provide for their families. General William Tecumseh Sherman moved there to avoid a battle. Late on a Friday afternoon in Spring of 1864, 14,000 Union troops from Major General Oliver Howard’s 4th Army Corps moved towards the Pickett’s farm and grist mill on Pickett’s Mill Creek (some mistakenly call it Little Pumpkinvine Creek) and one of the worst Federal defeats during the Atlanta Campaign. Concerning the confusion of the creeks, most people also confuse Little Pumpkinvine Creek with Pumpkinvine Creek. I read a website that described the Battle of Pickett’s Mill, and it claimed that Pumpkinvine Creek empties about four miles from it’s source. Whoever wrote that must have been referring to Little Pumpkinvine Creek or some other creek because Pumpkinvine Creek flows from its source in the Southwest part of Paulding County to the Northeast corner of the county and beyond into Bartow County. I know for a fact that the distance must be at least ten miles; probably closer to 20 miles from source to mouth. \r\n\r\nThe background story behind the Battle of Pickett’s Mill began ten days earlier, when General William Sherman occupied Kingston in Bartow County. It took a mere two weeks for General Sherman to march half the distance from Chattanooga to Atlanta. He successfully avoided General Joseph Johnston’s entrenched lines by outflanking him at Dalton and Resaca. General Johnston fell back to Allatoona Pass where he set a trap for Sherman. Allatoona Pass was a narrow railroad cut through a mountain and whoever controlled the pass controlled the bridge over Allatoona Creek (now apart of Allatoona Lake). This point is eight miles east of Kingston. The Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad was Sherman’s supply line. Unfortunately for Johnston, Sherman had been stationed at Marietta before the war, and he was well aware of the inevitability of the Confederates’ intention to set a trap at Allatoona Pass. Regardless, Sherman had to find a way to dislodge the Rebels from Allatoona Pass so that he could get his army back on the railroad. \r\n\r\nSherman decided to march south into the Paulding County wilderness. This was extremely risky because it presented the problem of trying to feed an army of 100,000 deep in enemy territory. Plus as his distance from the rail line increased, the number of soldiers he would need to divert to wagon train guard duty had to increase proportionally. These wagon lines became more and more vulnerable the deeper he went into Paulding County. \r\n\r\nGeneral Joseph Hooker encountered resistance near a church northeast of Dallas. General Hooker was confused by inaccurate maps and poor communications, so he decided to wait for reinforcements. Sherman orders an attack in an attempt to outflank the Confederates before they get a chance to fortify the position. The Battle of New Hope Church shocks Sherman because he wasn’t expecting stiff resistance there. \r\n\r\nUnion forces were caught flat footed by Confederate forces who had rapidly moved southwest from Allatoona Pass to check Sherman’s flanking maneuver, which had put Powder Springs in jeopardy along with a direct route into Atlanta from the due west. Federal troops quickly began to suffer from lack of supplies. Sherman ordered General Oliver Howard to attack the left flank of the Confederate Army. General George Thomas, Commander of the Army of the Cumberland and General Howard scouted the area just to the northeast of New Hope Church. They decided to attack what appeared to be the end of the Confederate line at Pickett’s Mill. \r\n\r\nWith Pickett’s Mill Creek to the east, troops under the command of Brigadier General William Hazen begin an assault on the Confederate line, which was heavily fortified. Although General William Hazen knew the advance was a mistake, he followed orders anyway. General Hazen’s soldiers were up against one of the South’s best commanders, Brigadier General Patrick Cleburne. \r\n\r\nAt 4:30 PM, Hazen approaches the Confederate line. Many of his troops got lost in the dense forest during the initial advance and wound up east of the intended objective. Hazen’s support on the right flank was pinned down by dismounted Confederate cavalry firing from the top of a ravine down into the Union troops below who were trying to cross the creek. Very rapidly, the bulk of Hazen’s force found themselves stranded in one of the few open areas of the battlefield, and they subsequently came under merciless fire. Reinforcements from the main Union line were held up by the thick underbrush. When Hazen realized that reinforcements wouldn\\'t arrive in time, he ordered a retreat. \r\n\r\nAt 6:00 PM, General Thomas Woods ordered a second attack. Although Hazen had made some advances, the second attack ended in disaster when Colonel William Gibson’s brigade was totally routed by General Patrick Cleburne’s men. \r\n\r\nBrigadier General Hiram Granbury successfully repulsed Federal attacks and he requested and received permission from General Cleburne to sweep the area in front of the Confederate earthworks for Union troops. At 10:00 PM General Hiram Granbury’s Texans began the counterattack. The Federals got off one volley against the counterattack and then fell into full retreat. \r\n\r\nAfter the battle, Patrick Cleburne estimated 3,000 Union casualties, with at least 1,500 of them killed. By contrast, the Rebels lost only about 500 troops. Therefore, the Battle of Pickett’s Mill was a decisive victory for the Confederacy. For the first time during the Atlanta Campaign, Sherman had to worry about a possible retreat. He realized that he had driven too deep into unfamiliar territory and that he had no choice but to try to break out to the east-northeast in order to get back to the rail line, even if it meant besieging the Confederate fortifications at Allatoona Pass. On May 29, Sherman began to shift troops along the Dallas Line to the north and east to prepare for a break out. Fortunately for Sherman, on June 1, he received the news that Allatoona Pass had been taken by General George Stoneman’s cavalry with little resistance. In fact, precisely because Sherman had driven so deep south, the Confederate Army of Tennessee had to scramble most of the defensive force that they had at Allatoona Pass down to Paulding County in order to prevent Sherman from taking Powder Springs and approaching Atlanta directly from the west. Only a token force could be left to defend Allatoona Pass. The Confederates were also trying to prevent Sherman from taking Marietta and Smyrna, but he wound up taking them anyway along with the ultimate prize, Atlanta.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qxuh9b5s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.759146,33.973963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pumpkinvine Trestle","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Pumpkinvine_Trestle_S_Open.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Dallas, GAOld rail bridge with beautiful view of Pumpkinvine Creek.

The Falcons moved to the Georgia Dome when it was built in 1991.  Here, Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth\\'s homerun record (before my time).  When I was a kid, Dale Murphy and Bob Horner were the big stars for the Braves.  They were terrible in the 80s, it got so bad that Ted Turner even held races at the stadium with ostrich powered chariots as a promotional to get fans to come watch the games.  Then in the 90s, everything changed, we got Bobby Cox as manager and John Schuerholz as GM, and that relationship has produced results: 14 consecutive division titles, 5 pennants, &amp; a world championship aint bad considering what we had just one year before our first pennant, last place.\r\n\r\nI remember one night after going to see a game against San Diego in \\'91, people were out of their heads, the stadium was so loud that I couldn\\'t even think...I\\'m not exaggerating.  Everyone was doing the Tomahawk Chop, shouting that war chant, I mean at the top of their lungs..10s of thousands of people, it got pretty roudy.  Anyway, that whole season, we were one loss away from being put out of the division race by the Dodgers.  We caught them and barely stayed ahead.  That night against the Padres, we were losing, then we tied it, and in the bottom of the ninth, I think it was Ron Gant that hit a 2 run homer to win the game.  I\\'ve been to many concerts, but I\\'ve never heard a place so loud in all my days.  The fans were so excited that they continued bellowing that war chant out into the parking lot, and there\\'s a tunnel that connects two lots under Capitol Avenue, and I remember the mass of people walking through there doing that war chant at the top of their lungs and hearing it echo through the tunnel.\r\n\r\nSee, back in those days, we couldn\\'t even comprehend that an Atlanta team would do well in sports, sure the Hawks were decent, and we had a few individual stars like Nique, Aaron, Niekro, and Murphy, but never so much as a first place finish.\r\n\r\nThe first Braves batter to step to the plate here was Felipe Alou, and the last batter to step up to the plate in the regular season was his son, Moises Alou, playing for Montreal.

Don\\'t give me the hot and humid excuse either, Miami never used a dome and Houston has done away with theirs.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qxwq9ctg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.653494,27.768393]}},{"properties":{"name":"Turner Field","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/image06.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner70.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner_field1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner_field2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAHome of the Braves. It was the Olympic Stadium built for the Centennial Olympic Games in 1996. Ironically, baseball, which was the only Olympic event that I got to see, was played at the old AFC Stadium. Last summer, my brother-in-law took me to a game, and since his friend\\'s grandmother knows Henry Aaron, we were somehow able to get Aaron\\'s seats. We ended up sitting literally behind homeplate. I don\\'t mean a couple rows back or so, I mean it was us, then the wall, then the umpire\\'s butt. Best seats I\\'ve ever had. They played the Cubs that night, and after a rain delay of 1.5 hours with some bad lightning, they ended up winning the game. \r\n\r\nThe first game I got to see here was a playoff game against Florida in 1997. We won the game, but of course we lost that series because the Marlins went on to win their first World Series that year. \r\n\r\nI miss the memories of A-FC Stadium, but this ballpark has better seats and is more stylish. It\\'s truly a stadium built for baseball whereas A-FC was designed to save money by utilizing the generic, bland, coliseum style stadium for multiple sports, of course, mainly baseball and football. Ironically, Turner Field was originally that Olympic Stadium, which had that same bland coliseum shape. They just tore out some pieces in order to shape it how it is today.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qxuwclk6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.389634,33.735279]}},{"properties":{"name":"Uncle Spencer","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> This is where my uncle lives in Kimper, Kentucky.

When Polk County was carved out of Paulding and Floyd Counties in 1851, Van Wert became apart of the new county.  For Paulding, the county seat was moved to Dallas.  Three years later, in 1854, the Polk County Seat was moved to Cedartown.  \r\n\r\nVan Wert was the first town in the state to have its own water system, which was installed in 1886.  During and immediately after the Civil War, Van Wert was the only town in this vicinity, however, during the post war economic recovery, the railroad was put through the area to extract the vast mineral resources (especially slate) of the area.  Unfortunately, for Van Wert, a wealthy landowner donated a large tract of land for the railroad to build a station just to the northwest of town, and Rockmart was born.  Because of the location of the train station, Rockmart boomed, and Van Wert stagnated and declined.  \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Van Wert lost its charter, but due to its historical significance, it was declared a special historical district, and therefore it cannot be annexed by the City of Rockmart, thereby retaining its unique identity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a747qy45qirh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.041465,33.983963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wild Horse Creek Park Trailhead","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Powder Springs, GAThis trailhead serves as the beginning of the Wild Horse Creek Trail, which follows Wild Horse Creek up to Wild Horse Creek Park on Macedonia Road.
