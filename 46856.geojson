You don\\'t know the half of it. This is one seriously comprehensive art museum that doesn\\'t bother with petty period constraints; If an object was created between the Stone Age and now, it may well be in here. The Met is the preeminent American museum of art, and its collection of European works is matched only by that of the Louvre.\n\nIf you\\'re trying to decide how much time to spend, know that the museum holds over two million pieces of art. At a rate of a minute per piece, you\\'ll need roughly four solid years of viewing time, so you had best get started. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330ksnv57m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.963008,40.779372]}},{"properties":{"name":"Museo de arte contemporaneo","description":"Posted by Melchessani<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330kjxiz0k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-100.37109,23.56399]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rijksmuseum","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/4/fineart07_rijksmuseum_sm_e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> This jewel houses the masterworks of Dutch and Flemish painters from the 17th century, commonly called the Golden Age: Rubens, Hals, van Dyck, Vermeer and, of course, Rembrandt.\n\nIf you\\'re planning to work your way through all the museums on this list, save this one for last. Not only is Rembrandt\\'s enormous \"The Night Watch\" a transcendent experience that will cap off your world art tour, but the museum\\'s main building is being renovated through 2008. If you\\'re in town anyway, don\\'t fret: The major masterpieces,including \"The Night Watch,\" will be available for viewing in an auxiliary wing. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330ktki2ul"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.884195,52.35951]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Louvre","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/fineart07_louvre_sm_e_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 75001 Paris, FranceThe Louvre is the granddaddy of all world art museums: arguably the greatest and most famous, and certainly among the largest. One of its many strengths is its unparalleled collection of French paintings from the 13th to the 19th centuries.\n\nBe kind to yourself: Allow yourself more than one day in the Louvre. It\\'s simply too vast to appreciate in a hurry. Also, if this is your first time, avail yourself of an audio or book guide to help you navigate.\n\nExpect lots of people and lines of varying length. Admission is free on Friday nights for those under 26, a deal that tends to attract lots of young visitors, so decide on whether you prefer company with your masterpieces. The rest of the world can get in free on the first Sunday of the month and on July 14, Bastille Day.\n\nBecause the Louvre was a primary setting for The Da Vinci Code, several companies offer tours tied to Dan Brown\\'s bestselling novel. The Louvre itself offers a Da Vinci Code audio guide. Considering the museum has enjoyed sizzling-hot tourism since the book\\'s release in 2003, and the film version came out in 2006, it may be a while before the hoopla dies down.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330ko2njbp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.33168452978,48.8564458088]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Museum of Modern Art","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/MoMA_Marron_Atrium2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 11 West 53 Street, New York, NY 10019-5497MoMA, as it is affectionately known, was founded in 1929 to be a breath of fresh air in the stuffy traditional world of museums. Today it is the greatest museum of modern art in the world, home to the most famous masterpieces of the most famous modern artists: \"The Starry Night\" by van Gogh, \"The Persistence of Memory\" by Dalí and \"Broadway Boogie Woogie\" by Piet Mondrian.\n\nOnce you\\'ve satisfied your cravings for celebrity pieces, be sure to visit the museum\\'s under-hyped drawings and prints galleries, where frequently changing exhibits feature lively, widely varied content. If you\\'re an MP3 addict, you can download free audio tour guides at www.moma.org/audio before you visit. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330kpl22v6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.015704,40.707948]}},{"properties":{"name":"The National Gallery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/fineart07_ntlgallery_sm_e_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Trafalgar Square, WC2, England, United KingdomBritain\\'s national art museum and Trafalgar Square landmark is a favorite with travelers for its organization and friendly staff. Best of all, admission to the museum is free because the collection is considered to belong to the British public. It\\'s not every day an art museum is so visitor-friendly and enthusiastic, particularly one with such a prestigious array of masterpieces.\n\nThe permanent collection\\'s focus is Western European paintings from 1250 to 1900 and you\\'ll find great works representative of nearly every period in art history by masters from Botticelli to Monet.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330kswn6oi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.128092,51.508729]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Prado Museum","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/4/fineart07_museoprado_sm_e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> This is a true museum lover\\'s museum because it was founded out of love for art, not a desire for prestige. The Prado was established by royalty, like many great world museums, but the Spanish kings and queens had a true affection not just for art itself but for the artists who created it. A favorite old legend says that Spanish monarch Charles V once bent to pick up a paintbrush dropped by the artist Titian, thereby stooping below his level, the ultimate gesture of respect from a king.\n\nYou\\'ll find masterpieces in The Prado from all the Spanish art VIPs: Velázquez, Ribera, El Greco and Goya among others. Check out the collection of 14 of Goya\\'s \"Black Paintings,\" which depict violent, macabre and raw images far ahead of their time. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330klsfo3l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.6925,40.413889]}},{"properties":{"name":"The State Hermitage Museum","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/fineart07_hermitagerussia_sm_e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Establishing the Hermitage museum was Catherine the Great\\'s way of trying to dispel the popular image of Russia as a crude and backward province. She sought to amass a personal collection that would rival any in Europe, and she didn\\'t do too shabby a job: Catherine increased the royal stock of paintings from 250 when she came to the throne in 1762 to more than 4,000 at the time of her death three decades later.\n\nToday\\'s Hermitage Museum includes not only 17,000 paintings and millions of exhibits, but also St. Petersburg\\'s famed Winter Palace, the magnificent home of Russia\\'s czars for centuries. The Western European masters are well-represented here — da Vinci, Raphael, Rubens, Monet, van Gogh and many more — but the massive collection also offers fascinating prehistoric pieces, antiquities, medieval items and arms and weaponry. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330kxjt5f6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.313611,59.940556]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Uffizi Gallery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/fineart07_uffizi_sm_e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Florence is the birthplace of the Renaissance, and if you truly want to understand the history of representational painting — to see where artists learned the secrets of portraying man and nature with breathtaking realism — you must visit the city where it all began. Highlights include Botticelli\\'s \"Birth of Venus\" and Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"The Annunciation,\" not to mention an outdoor cafe that offers a priceless view of the rooftops of Florence.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330krvxxeh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.2553,43.76841]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vatican Museums and Galleries","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/Lightmatter_vaticanmuseum.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/VaticanMuseumStaircase.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> It\\'s hard to overstate the cultural significance of this complex of museums, nestled in a tiny walled city in the northwest corner of Rome.
