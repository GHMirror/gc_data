To facilitate the display, animation and layering of satellite with other observational datasets in a user-selective fashion, the NRL TC-Web satellite data processing stream was adapted for use within the Google Earth framework. The resulting NRL Tropical Cyclones on Earth (TC-Earth) application is designed to exploit the capabilities of virtual globe technology to facilitate the display, animation and layering of multiple environmental satellite imaging and sounding sensors for effective visualization of tropical cyclone evolution. As with the NRL TC-Web, the TC-Earth application is a dynamic, realtime application, driven by the locations of active and historical tropical cyclones. TC-Earth has a simple interface that is designed around a series of placemarks that follow the storm track history. The position coordinates along the storm track are used to map-register imagery and subset other types of information, allowing the user a wide range of freedom to choose data types, overlay combinations, and animations with a minimum of number of clicks. \r\n\r\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Track Line","id":"0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[51.5,-18.7],[52.7,-18.3],[54.1,-18.2],[55.6,-18.0],[56.6,-17.7],[57.6,-17.6],[57.9,-17.5],[59.0,-17.2],[59.4,-16.9],[60.1,-16.7],[61.0,-16.0],[61.6,-15.6],[63.8,-14.7],[65.1,-14.1],[66.0,-14.0]]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/tc_pages/tc_home.html","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Naval Research Lab","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/tc_pages/tc_home.html","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2012-02-13T19:57:51Z","id":205178}
