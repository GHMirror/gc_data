The first recorded landing happening in 1688, by the English ship \"<i>Cygnet</i>\". In the 1870s and 80s, Dr. John Murray visited the island. His rock samples revealed that the island was rich with phosphate. This led to Christmas Island being put under British control in 1880. The island was shortly occupied. Many years after, the island became a colony of Singapore, and was taken over by the Japanese during World War II. During the 1950s, the island finally came under the control of Australia.\n      The official language is English, but Chinese languages are often used.

Later, the area was discovered by Greek colonists and given the the name Byzantium by King Byzas. In the 100\\'s B.C., it was captured by the Romans and made the capital of the Empire in 306 A.D. During that time, it was also given the name Constantinople. In the following times, the city was constantly attacked by different groups, until it was captured by the Ottoman Turks 1453, and renamed Istanbul.\nIstanbul is not the capital of Turkey, as it is commonly mistaken, yet. The city lies on both Europe and Asia, and is right next to the Bosphorus Strait. Some major industries are glass, textiles, shoes, cement, and ships.

While it may seem like just like the other 364 islands in the area, it is actually the home of a legendary treasure buried deep beneath the ground, in a hole called \"The Money Pit\".\nIt all began in the late 1700\\'s. It is said that 3 young men came across a depression under an oak tree. Out of curiosity, they began digging up the area. After they dug only two feet, they found a layer of stones they did not expect. Digging down even further, to about 30 feet, they found layers of oak logs every ten feet. After this, they abandoned it, being unable to continue by themselves.\nA decade later, a group named the Onslow Company continued their digging. Every ten feet, they reached a layer of oak logs. However, when they reached 90ft, it is said they reached a stone with a code written on it (it is disputed whether the stone really existed). Shortly after that, the pit began filling up with water, and they were unable to remove all the water without having it fill up again. In hopes of continuing the dig, the Onslow Company dug a connecting hole right next to the Money Pit, which turned out unsuccessful. The dig was again abandoned.\nSince then, many companies and people have tried to locate any kind of treasure in the famed Money Pit, all of them unsuccessful. Somewhere along the line, it was discovered that the reason the pit kept on flooding was because there were a few flood tunnels along the side of the tunnel, filling up the pit with water. To date, 6 people have died because of the pit. People are still interested in finding the treasure, but no digging is currently happening.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qa5pwm6wo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-64.2931938171,44.513400278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salt Lake City, Utah","description":"Posted by Theduke<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Saltlakecounty.jpg\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Flag_of_Salt_Lake_City_SVG.svg/430px-Flag_of_Salt_Lake_City_SVG.svg.png\">       Salt Lake City is the capital of Utah with a population of around 178,858.

Doing this led to a number of wars and skirmishes, which included the two Messenian Wars. Eventually, the Spartans had taken over the entire region, and had a few years of peace. However, Sparta was involved in many more wars, such as the Greco-Persian War, the Peloponnesian Wars, the Chremonidean War, and many more.In the government of Sparta, there were always two kings. Not only did they have to keep an eye on the empire, but each one had to keep an eye on the other king, making sure they did not go corrupt. Every year, 5 magistrates would be elected, and their jobs were to carry out the business of the kings and states and conduct foreign treaties. Twenty-eight men over 60 were chosen to be elders who led their respective city-state.\nSparta also has a class system in their society.

Also in the park is an active volcano, more than 300 geysers, one of the world\\'s largest caldera\\'s and petrified forests, and at least 290 waterfalls. The annual number of visitors to the parks exceeds 2 million.\n However, it was not an instant success. At the time, only a few people were able to   make the trip to the park. As it became more popular, however, people began taking advantage of the park, poaching some of the animals and using the park for their own profit. To ensure the success of the park, the park officials had to put an to the crimes. In 1894, the Lacey Act was passed, which granted protection to all wildlife in the park.
