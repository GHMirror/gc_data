Even though I took piano for nine years and sang in our church choir until college, I’d rather listen to it than perform it. Music has always been passionate part of my life – I love everything from Beethoven and the Beatles to gut-bucket blues. But lately, perhaps because I often listen to the jazz radio station at Trinity University, KTRU, in my car, I have become intensely interested in this unique American contribution to music.\n\n“Jazz was born around 1895-1900 out of many American traditions – blues, Sousa’s marches, ragtime, swing. And New Orleans dwarfs any other city for the origins of jazz,” said Jim Cullum, the leader and trumpet player of the jazz band of the same name, which plays six nights a week at The Landing on the River Walk when he’s not on tour. His radio show, “Live from the Landing,” is broadcast weekly on more than 200 National Public Radio affiliates across the country.\n\nWith his dapper seven-man band, Cullum had come to talk about and demonstrate jazz at the Witte Museum’s afternoon jazz series on second Sundays. Cullum’s specialty is the New Orleans style that came to be known as Dixieland jazz, though he plays other jazz as well. Jazz never stops evolving.\n\nIn his casual sports jacket and khaki pants, Cullum looked like a slightly rumpled professor with a trumpet as they played a few jazzed-up bars of “America the Beautiful” to demonstrate a point, then stopped suddenly – perfectly together in mid-beat – with a slight motion of his hand. Amazing.\n\n“1921 was the first year San Antonio had jazz. Jack Teagarten, just 15 years old, blew in from the Texas Pan-handle and played [trombone] in a roadhouse on the edge of town. In those days the real action – drinking, dancing, gambling, and jazz – took place outside the city limits. Since then we’ve always had jazz here,” said Cullum. Then they launched into “Wild Man Blues,” a classic jazz number that made me think of movies set in the “Roaring Twenties,” when jazz truly took off. Their playing conjured up glamorous flappers doing the Charleston in swinging, beaded, fringed chemises.\n\nImprovisation – virtuoso solos combined with musicians answering each other’s riffs – was the key element that separated jazz from what went before. Instead of playing a piece exactly as it was written, musicians saw a composition as merely a starting point for their embellishments. “Jazz is a musical conversation,” proclaimed Cullum.\n\nI wanted to be part of that conversation in San Antonio, at least as a listener. But in a city better known musi-cally for its Mexican trios and mariachis, would there be enough jazz for a compelling, ongoing conversation, or was the Jim Cullum Jazz Band just a one-night stand? In my odyssey in search of jazz in the Alamo City, I was in for some surprises.\n\nI decided to start in the downtown area and work my way north – or wherever the Sirens of jazz led.\n\n“San Antonio has always had a very rich and diverse jazz scene. There’s a very accomplished jazz community here – lots of great musicians,” said Ken Slavin, a jazz crooner who weaves a romantic spell with standards from the swing era of the 30s and 40s – Cole Porter, Rogers and Hart, George and Ira Gershwin – in the Sage Lounge at the Fairmont Hotel.\n\nMusicians here are also very supportive of each other, Slavin explained. “George Prado, a very accomplished string bass player, gave me my first gig at Dick’s Last Resort on the River Walk, 16 years ago. His son, Aaron Ellington Prado, is a very fine pianist and the music director at Trinity’s jazz station. George gave Aaron his middle name after Duke Ellington,” said Slavin. One thing segues to another – in jazz and in San Antonio. George and Aaron Prado, part of the Regency Jazz Band, play every Sunday evening at Dolores del Rio on the River Walk. The rich aroma of Italian cooking led me up the stone steps into an intimate, cozy restaurant with stone walls, dark roof beams, tiny lights strung here and there, and candles in bottles resembling stalagmites. In the corner of this bohemian cave on a Tuesday night, Jose Alvarez and Brandon Rivas were playing a mixture of swing, bluegrass, jazz, and Mexican ballads on guitar and bass.\n\n“I have live music every night – I’ve been doing this for 25 years,” said Stefania Baldesarelli, the owner. “We have some of the best musicians in the country in San Antonio. One of my musicians, Michael Martin, was on David Letterman recently,” she said. When Rivas and Alvarez took a break around 8 p.m., a beautiful belly dancer, Veronica Rivas, took to the stage in her glittering outfit with finger cymbals.\n\nAmong the legendary local jazz musicians who play at Dolores del Rio are saxophonist Spot Barnett and pianist June Parker. “This place is like home,” said Brandon Rivas, the bass player, “You never know who you’ll play with, but they’re all good.” Plus there’s no cover. With my friend Christine I strolled on down the River Walk to Swig Martini Bar, about as cool and slick as Dolores del Rio is cozy and casual. A very smooth, urbane jazz trio on saxophone, keyboards, and bass – Cecil Carter, Joël Dilley, and David Lucke, all local – played on a small stage as we looked over the list of 55 differ-ent martinis. The cool music fit seamlessly with the austerely elegant, minimalist décor. Smoking is allowed since no food is served, other than pretzel mix. There’s also a patio overlooking the River Walk. I planned to come back here to discover more local musicians, such as Bett Butler on piano or the straight-ahead jazz of the Chuck Kerr Trio.\n\nWith its vibrant Mexican-Latino culture, San Antonio was sure to have jazz with a South American accent, sí? Indeed. At the Cork Bar in the Hotel Contessa on the River Walk, Henry Brun &amp; the Latin Playerz Trio filled the airy, upscale bar with the sound of sexy conga drums and romantic guitars as my boyfriend, Steve, and I dropped into plush, oversize chairs and considered ordering tapas – empanadas, paella soup, or perhaps flamed mushrooms. Liquid choices were equally intriguing, ranging from rum-and-mint mojitos and red sangria to a Spanish wine called Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen Red Blend, which sounded dangerous. Night reflections on the river sparkled beyond the tall windows. With more appetite, we might have walked into Las Ramblas here for a dinner inspired by Spain. But Southtown beckoned. This historic neighborhood just south of downtown, including the Victorian mansions of the King William Historic District, has blossomed with arty cafes, galleries, and boutiques in the past decade. In fact, if you’re there on a First Friday, when shops stay open late, the area goes into party mode, so make res-ervations if you want to dine on the muy rica Nuevo Latino fare at stylish Azuca with its splashy folk art colors and hand-blown light fixtures.\n\nBut we were headed to Azuca Bar next door. Besides savoring the best mojitos we’ve ever had, the salsa and meringue bands were energizing, even though we didn’t join the well-dressed crowd on the small dance floor. Orquesta Tropicante, Albert &amp; Extasy, and Geno are some of the jazzy Latin bands who play here and at Azuca’s sister restaurant and bar on the north side, Pasion! We would have to make repeat visits to sample all 20 varieties of mojitos and the Pisco Sours at Azuca Bar.\n\nIf Azuca reflects the Alamo City’s Latino culture, the Beethoven Halle und Garten – also in Southtown – pro-vides a glimpse of Old San Antonio’s German heritage. Built as a clubhouse for the traditional singing societies, or Maennerchor, of the German settlers who began arriving in the mid-1800s, the casual Beethoven Halle has an old-fashioned wooden bar with plenty of German beer on tap, while framed photos of Maennerchor members hang on the walls.\n\nWe didn’t hear the men’s choir, but hit the Halle on a Friday night when the John Magaldi Trio plays. Three older guys in golf shirts – on sax, keyboards, and drums – they played superb, straight-on jazz with lots of vir-tuoso solos. They exemplified that jazz paradox of being loose, yet tight – no one missed a note or a beat. And considering that there was no cover and our bill for a Coke and a glass of wine was .50, the Beethoven (as locals call it) is one of the best live-music bargains in town. There’s even a patio out back if you’d rather trinken in the Biergarten.\n\nThe 1930s ushered in the “swing era” of big bands. Without microphones or amplification, jazz bands had to add musicians to be heard in the large ballrooms and dance halls where they played.\n\nI got a pleasant earful of that era at the Blue Star Brewing Co., a microbrewery and restaurant which hosts big bands every Tuesday evening. Located on South Alamo St. west of Beethoven Halle, the Blue Star Art Com-plex is San Antonio’s alternative art development, featuring galleries, art studios, and loft apartments in con-verted cold storage warehouses on the San Antonio River. Like jazz, this was a timely improvisation that suc-ceeded.\n\nThe night I was there the Crimson Jazz Orchestra was playing a special D-Day program of songs popular during World War II, including many by Glenn Miller. This band was big, too – I counted at least 16 musicians with saxophones, guitars, trumpets, trombones, drums, and a grand piano. Listening to them in that utilitarian back room with bare brick walls and exposed metal roof trusses, it was easy to imagine this was an improvised R&amp;R club for enlisted men during WWII.\n\nBut what surprised me was learning that there are several groups of this size in San Antonio, so you don’t hear the same big band every week at Blue Star. In fact, a new downtown restaurant, the Radius Café (across from the Municipal Auditorium), has started scheduling big bands on Wednesday nights.\n\nExpanding my jazz quest beyond downtown, I was immediately drawn to Carmen’s de la Calle for its Spanish name, meaning “Carmen’s of the Street.” Would this be another Latin jazz stronghold? Just off North St. Mary’s Street, where many hangouts draw a college crowd, Carmen’s was considerably cooler and more re-served. In a converted bungalow with a patio out front, Carmen’s had hardwood floors, tiny red lights twined around interior columns, and a blackboard tapas menu. Its band du jour, the Andy Langham Trio, had no Latin accent but played superb mellow jazz as Shelley Murray sang jazzy renditions of songs like “Summer Time” and that Billie Holiday classic, “You Go to my Head.” Latin jazz groups do play here often, however, I was told. Carmen’s was clearly a go-back.\n\nLatin music is a draw at Circa 1900, too. Both restaurant and bar, Circa was as over-the-top swanky as a Holly-wood stage set. Here you could dine in romantic little alcoves that looked straight out of the 18th and 19th cen-turies, they were so baroque’d up with antiques, paintings, ornate chandeliers, and swags of plush fabric. After dinner, patrons take free tango lessons in the bar on Monday night and try meringue Thursday and Friday eve-nings. For non-dancers, there’s a loft above the dance floor for great people watching. And if you fall in love with one of the antiques or artworks, no problem, you can buy it – all the furnishings are for sale. Antique shop, restaurant, and nightclub, Circa 1900 is another improvisation that succeeds by sheer excess.\n\nNearby, Caparelli’s on Main is another restaurant offering live music most evenings, including jazz. A casual bistro in the Montrose area just north of downtown, Caparelli’s had the relaxed friendliness of a neighborhood café combined with excellent Italian food and service. The evening I was there, keyboard player George Marti-nez jazzed up mellow pop songs like “Try a Little Tenderness” and “The Way You Look Tonight.” I would definitely return; another regular musician here is Paul Harper on jazz guitar.\n\nLuna Fine Music Club made me think of a little nightclub in Greenwich Village: it was small, intimate, cool, and dark, except for the small lighted stage up front. Luckily its prices didn’t emulate New York: the cover is usually  and drinks are reasonable. I’ve heard great jazz and Latin groups at Luna, both local and from Aus-tin, which provides another pool of talented musicians for San Antonio venues.\n\nSilo, a star-chef restaurant I’ve visited many times for its innovative New American cuisine, now features one of San Antonio’s own stars in its bar every Thursday night, starting around 9. Beverly Houston, who always engages her audience with her great warmth, talent, and humor, sings a mixture of jazz, rhythm and blues, and pop, backed up by the excellent local band Breezin’.\n\nThe last stop on my jazz odyssey was out Fredericksburg Road in the Medical Center area. From the outside, the Oak Hills Tavern looked like a dive, an anomaly in a neighborhood of tall, high-tech hospitals and sleek clinics. Almost hidden among some big oak trees, it made me think of the old roadhouses Jim Cullum talked about from jazz’s early days in San Antonio.\n\nEven more hidden was its Jazz Annex out back. Dim and smoky, it had a small bandstand up front and a self-service cigar cooler in back. Partying locals were whooping it up at the next table and the band was on break. Maybe this was a mistake, I said to my friend Niki. Then the noise makers cleared out and a beautiful young woman with curly gypsy hair sat down with her guitar, accompanied by a male guitarist and a male conga drum player. She sung the most amazing version of “Cielito Lindo” I had ever heard, a blend of Latin-gypsy-folk-jazz improvisations in a full, resonant voice that filled the tiny room as wood walls and floors provided perfect acoustics. Niki and I were stunned: this woman and her fellow musicians – part of the Jam Band – had presence with a capital P. I felt like I had discovered for myself Jim Cullum’s point – that those old roadhouses can be where the action is, even today.\n\nInspired by musicians like Jim Cullum and the local jazz station KTRU, jazz is alive, well, and growing in San Antonio today. Noted musician George Prado, head of the Regency Jazz Band, regarding the era before jazz really caught on in a big way in San Antonio, “Jim Cullum’s Landing was like a lighthouse for jazz.”\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65atl69xmy5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.4642264843,27.9467771269]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sarasota Memorial Hospital","description":"Posted by Rtsnance<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65atl597wml"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.53101,27.31798]}},{"properties":{"name":"Uncle Colin, Aunt Kara, Karina, Scott &amp; Liam's house","description":"Posted by Rtsnance<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65atl512dbb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.06229,42.19549]}},{"properties":{"name":"plant hall","description":"Posted by Rtsnancehow how howhow how howhow how howhow how howhow how howhow how howhow how howhow how howhow how howhow how how\nhow how howhow how howhow how how\nhow how howhow how how\n\nhow how howhow how howhow how howhow how how\nhow how howhow how how<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65atl1cy00i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.4641942978,27.9466633947]}},{"properties":{"name":"the New Nance's dad's desk","description":"Posted by Rtsnance<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65atl7lux2h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.44265,27.38296]}},{"properties":{"name":"the New Nance's future home","description":"Posted by Rtsnance<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65atlbcj3s5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.46149,27.3957]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/233370","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rtsnance","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rtsnance","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/233370","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":17,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=233370,platial:user=rtsnance","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":42679}
