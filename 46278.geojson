Affiliated with Normandy Park Education Center so during school hours accessibility is hit or miss, but it is a perfect place for fun on evenings and weekends as well as non-school days. It is fenced in and has a well-padded play surface with lots of climbing equipment. It is located on the corner of Bellaire Avenue and County Rd F on the East side of White Bear Lake.\n\nThe only negatives here are that the trees are new, and there is very little shade, but that\\'s not unusual.  There are some picnic tables by the school, so picnics are possible, but they are outside the gated park.  \n \n\n \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f9thda258"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.996178,45.063034]}},{"properties":{"name":"Snail Lake Park","description":"Posted by Trekbody<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 45.069641,-93.120332This park has fantastic lake views, a large covered picnic area and even a great playground for the kids.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f9t7unxe2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.122993,45.067535]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wedgewood Park","description":"Posted by Trekbody<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/Wildwood1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Wildwood Road (County Road E) also known as Hwy 244, just east of Century Blvd.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f9t5ircjh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.978346,45.050559]}},{"properties":{"name":"Woodbury's Central Park","description":"Posted by Trekbody<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 8505 Valley Creek Rd, 55125An indoor park, library, and child play area called Lookout Ridge - Central Park is hard to beat. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f9td2c08x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.932277,44.916346]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/6382","metadata":null,"contact_name":"trekbody","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:trekbody","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/6382","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=6382,platial:user=trekbody","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":46278}
