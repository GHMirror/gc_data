The planting itself took place over a one-week period in late May 1997.  Residents themselves determined where the trees were sited -- on their own property as well as on public land -- and were actively involved in the planting as well.  In conjunction with the 1997 show \"Joseph Beuys Multiples\" at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.  Project was coordinated by independent curator Todd Bockley with support from the Visual Arts Department, as well as the Education Department\\'s Teen Programs and Community Programs.\n\nMore Info:\nhttp://www.walkerart.org/archive/9/A343D1DFBAD672436161.htm<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6nercdgryqx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.60104,47.379522]}},{"properties":{"name":"18 Trees on W. 22nd St. between 10th &amp; 11th Ave (planted 1996)","description":"Posted by Cecilkleakins<img src=\"http://www.diacenter.org/ltproj/7000/siteplan.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 18 Trees on West 22nd St Between 10th &amp; 11th Ave (planted 1996)In 1996 Dia extended this project by planting 18 new trees, each paired with a basalt stone, on 22nd Street from 10th to 11th avenues, adding Pin Oak, Red Oak, Elm Honey Locust, Gingko and Linden. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6nerccr5kum"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.005558,40.747387]}},{"properties":{"name":"5 Trees at the DIA Foundation (planted 1988)","description":"Posted by Cecilkleakins<img src=\"http://www.diacenter.org/ltproj/7000/beuys-7000-top.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 5Dia installed five basalt stone columns, each paired with a tree, at 548 West 22nd Street in 1988, continuing the sculpture project 7000 Eichen (7000 Oaks) by German artist Joseph Beuys.

Step inside and feel yourself transported into another time and place, when doing the hokey pokey on roller skates was the pinnacle of coolness.  Kids fall in love with this place.  There is nothing more \"real\" than seeing a sincere group of skaters doing the chicken dance unironically con mucho gusto.  If they put Cheap Trick on the sound system and allowed smoking inside again, it\\'d be flashback city.  When I was 10 I bought some candy cigarettes and rolled them up in my shirt sleeve here.

It was the end of a long hot summer.  I convinced a friend to drive me down to Des Moines (without telling his parents) ostensibly to see Henry Rollins and the Rollins band play.  He loved Henry Rollins, I loved a songwriter and editor of a local punk \\'zine.  He saw the show, I walked off into the night with my love and found this spot next to the river behind some bushes off of a little walkway.  It was liberating, intense and passionate.  Lots of hot sweaty leather moments.  I can still remember the lovely smells of that night.  We made love for so long that when we returned to the botanical center, my friend was terribly upset with me--he was really late getting home which blew his cover and he was grounded for a month.  On the long drive home, he angrily berated me while I strummed on a guitar dreamily and sung her songs.  By the end of the drive he was singing along too, and the romance had even rubbed off a little on him too.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6nerc9k02if"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.616691,41.594584]}},{"properties":{"name":"Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago","description":"Posted by Cecilkleakins<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/57b4c897f5fc29cedb395964a4ac236b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 220 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago ILGreat art museum specializing in contemporary art.

I was unemployed.  My roommate came bursting into the apartment, face white as a sheet.  They turned her away from the subway, as the first plane had hit.  We turned on our crappy TV with no reception (We didn\\'t have cable).  The second plane had just hit.  Our apartment was on the ground floor but just looking outside, two long streams of smoke could be seen in an otherwise crisp clear blue sky.  We engineered an antenna from aluminum foil and huddled around the TV to try and figure out what had happened.  The towers fell and it felt like a dream.  I was in complete denial.  No way.  This can\\'t be happening.  This is not happening.  But yet we looked outside and there were the plumes of smoke in the sky from the burning buildings.  I was able somehow to make sure my daughter was ok.  She was in the East Village and was with her mother.  My roommate located her girlfriend, who came over and we all sat around in bewilderment.  Cell phones stopped working and the internet went down.  Rumors were flying about subsequent follow up attacks: poisoned water, bombs in the subway, other planes still unaccounted for.  My roommate rushed out to buy emergency supplies.  She came back with several gallons of water, 12 jars of peanut butter, and 20 cans of tuna.  I remember laughing as we unpacked the bags--12 jars of peanut butter!  Somehow it seemed so funny, in a very human way, peanut butter is such a comfort food--it seemed surreal.  The apocalypse will not be a fine dining experience.  But yet my laughter quickly turned to sobering reality--what if the water supply really is poisoned?  What if the city shuts down?  4th Avenue is a main thoroughfare connecting to the bridges leading to Manhattan, so during the late morning through the entire day, ghostly groups of dusty figures shambled by on their way home to their neighborhoods in Southern Brooklyn.  Everyone was in shock.  There were so many rumours about what had happened and who had done it.  I felt helpless, numb, and wounded.  Vengenance and anger hadn\\'t set in yet.  It was just such a total and complete shock.  Watching those buildings fall through the blurry snow of a bad tv set, while a few miles away it actually was happening.  Nothing made sense anymore.  Slowly the impact of what had happened set in.  I watched the columns of smoke cross the sky for a long time.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6nercl4q2z8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.980525,40.68076]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nashville Parthenon","description":"Posted by Cecilkleakins<img src=\"http://www.chrisnelson.net/images/parthenon.jpg\">2600 West End Ave Nashville, TN 37203This replica of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece was built in 1897 for the Tennessee Centennial celebration.
