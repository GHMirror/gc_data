Cabbage tempura... or more like cabbage fritadas (Italian deep fried thingies) to me...  eaten with a ponzu-like sauce.\nCheese Bread:  Like a bun with a stick of string cheese in it... gooder than it sounds!\nChicken Stew (takeout): looks kinda like curry, strongly seasoned, and the taste is what I had been wanting to cook myself, and had imagined on some occasions, haha.\nBeef Stew (takeout): looks like beef burgandy or whatever stew... good taste, but I didn\\'t like the way the beef was cut, which made for a difficult chewing experience.  If you\\'re lucky, you\\'ll get pieces of beef liver, too  :9\n\nWant to Try:\nOther take out dishes\nDried anchovies, said to be eaten with soy sauce and lemon kinda mix (prolly that ponzu-like sauce)\n\nI also happen to have a  tab going on here...  hope there\\'s no interest!!!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczviavxl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.123495,32.918768]}},{"properties":{"name":"Buca de Peppo","description":"Posted by Thejames<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczrld0n9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.118244,32.916517]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cali Cafe Sandwiches","description":"Posted by Thejames<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> Cali Cafe SandwichesVietnamese Sandwich Shop\n\nAwesome back-less leopard print \"Roman\" style couch.

A perfect crispyness that doesn\\'t destroy the roof of your mouth.  Each Bahn Mi is .75, tax in.\n\nTried:\n#2 - standard viet sandwich: ham, steamed meatloaf, headcheese\n#11 - pork shuu mai: very yummy, the shuu mai is warm and in a tomato kinda sauce, which makes the sandwich remind me of a meatball sub...\n\nWant to Try:\n Normal Subs...  but with the Bahn Mi\\'s being 2.75... might not happen anytime soon...\nDURIAN SMOOTHIE<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczm88kkk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.123485,32.91862]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Maguey","description":"Posted by Thejames[Dirty] Mexican Restaurant\n\nPickled carrots and salsa bar are NOT free.\n\nTried:\nMachaca Plate: standard fare, doesn\\'t come with veggies though.\n\nWant to Try:\nSomething from their extensive Soup menu...<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczvvzt1r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.125453,32.916548]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lucky Pho (the sign just says Restaurant - it's inside of Lucky Seafood)","description":"Posted by Thejames<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Pho Restaurant\n\nThey have green chopsticks, and two TVs.\n\nTried:\n#16 Pho with Rare steak and Well Done steak: the BEST well-done \"steak meat\" I\\'ve had  in an order of Pho.  Why?  Because it wasn\\'t the cuts with the nasty yellow pieces of fat attached, and didn\\'t have that weird chewiness.  Very tender, good cuts of well-done steak.  The rare steak was good, standard fare, some pieces were much larger than what I\\'d normally expect, but still very thinly sliced.  Soup/broth was only decent, I like it richer than this.  Hopefully the quality of the well done steak wasn\\'t just a fluke... will have to try again to make sure.  Oh yeah, this place has not only large sizes, but EXTRA LARGE for just a quarter on top of the price for a large!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczi40d9t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.12445,32.918872]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lucky Seafood [Supermarket] Takeout","description":"Posted by ThejamesLucky SeaA Vietnamese-run takeout food operation within a supermarket (analogous to the 99ranch takeout counters, I suppose)\n\nThe food is mostly Chinese-like, nothing specifically Viet-cuisine, that I could recall.  For your \"big compartment\" filler item, you can choose any mix of: fried rice, chow mein, fried wide rice noodle (chow fun?), and fried vermicelli (the thin kind).  Personally, I think the fried vermicelli tastes the best.\n\nFood volume is comparable to Sam-Woo takeout, standard 3 compartment (2x small 1x large) take out box, pretty much filled to the top.  Though the take out is \"loaded\", I didn\\'t feel as explosively full as I would after finishing it as I would have with Sam-Woo takeout... a good thing, I suppose.  For the third item, they will use a separate cup kind of container, a large and small size - depending on the dish you choose.\n\nTried:\nCurry Chicken: standard Chinese-style curried chicken parts.  The potato chunks were HUGE, and very yummy.\nStir Fried Fish and Squid: has cucumbers in it too, not bad, kinda too salty\nBroccoli Beef : standard fare\nMini Salmon Steak piece: submerged in some thick sauce, kinda like teriyaki sauce... not bad, could do with less sauce, though\nSome Tofu Dish: can\\'t remember what it was... maybe with seafood?\n\nWant to Try:\nRice Noodle Lunch Kit: prepackaged dry (w/o soup) rice noodle meal kit thing... kinda like 冷やし中華... but with rice noodles, and probably has peanut sauce (or is that a Thai thing?)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczpk07b0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.124209,32.918895]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mr. Wasabi","description":"Posted by Thejames<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczk4pig5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.123195,32.916724]}},{"properties":{"name":"On the Border Mexican Grill","description":"Posted by Thejames<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczmonxqd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.120035,32.91676]}},{"properties":{"name":"Panera Bread","description":"Posted by Thejames<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczt3uehz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.118345,32.91622]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pat &amp; Oscar's","description":"Posted by Thejames<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xczrwi2nj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.118571,32.914698]}},{"properties":{"name":"Popeye's Chicken","description":"Posted by Thejames<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xcztkqtqx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.129788,32.915693]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/6902","metadata":null,"contact_name":"thejames","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:thejames","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/6902","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=6902,platial:user=thejames","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":45996}
