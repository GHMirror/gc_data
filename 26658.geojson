Take two of my friends, who live in the same multi student house.  The one girl lives in Maryland, the boy\\'s grandmother lives not too far away.  For break, he wanted to go visit, and the girl offered him a ride.  I was also offered a ride to my house, which is halfway there.  This way, I got home, and they had  a free place to sleep overnight.  Well, the plans had been made for several weeks to do this.  The girl\\'s parents had figured out gas costs roundtrip, and had asked the boy if he would pitch in something, since he was just riding.  He agreed.  But when he was told what the girl\\'s parents had added up, he flipped.  They were only asking for 0 for gas roundtrip.  Considering gas prices, and that roundtrip was equivalent to a full 24 hours, plus the extra several hours the girl would have to go to take him to his grandmother\\'s, it wasn\\'t all that bad.  He was very mad about it, but he was still planning to come.  The plan was to leave friday before break, right after my last class of the day.  This was the plan until about noon that day.  He goes up to the girl while she is working, and says that he got a train ticket.  Just like that.  The very day of the trip, and he pulls out, to travel more expensively, and longer.  In what way does that make sense?  Now, since they still live in the same house, things are going to be ackward.  The girl doesn\\'t fully know why he pulled out, and now she is completely confused as to what he is going to do.  And it will be hard to avoid.  Just goes to show that even though someone may live underneath the same roof, doesn\\'t mean that they know what the heck people are going to do.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sahir7s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05036,41.46195]}},{"properties":{"name":"1 photograph","description":"Posted by Ellen8788The foreground is dominated by broken shards.

Walking through the building, you would think that it was fall break because no one is to be seen or heard.  All of the doors are closed and no lights are on.  There is only one reason for this in January.  It was time for Grey’s Anatomy.\r\n\tAt this time every Thursday, one can find 10 or more girls up on the third floor lounge all sitting around the TV just waiting to see what is going to happen next.  Last weeks episode was “to be continued” so there was more anticipation in the air than normal.  There were 3 people on the couch, 2 people on the big soft chairs, which would fit 2 if you wanted to share, there were 2 more people on the chairs that were supposed to be around the table, and there were 3 people on the floor.\r\n\tEverything was the same, the lounge smelled like burnt popcorn because someone burnt their popcorn 5 minutes before we got there.  All of the blinds were open because no one wanted to shut them.  Everyone was talking about last week’s episode, trying to catch people up who did not see it.  It was 7:58, a few of the girls left to go to the bathroom before the show started because when it was on, you did not go anywhere.\r\n\tThe show started at exactly 8:00, the whole room was silent.  No one moved or made a sound.  We were all watching the show with anticipation of what was going to happen with George’s dad, or if Addison and Kerev were going to kiss.  Then a commercial came on.  Ever one liked the commercials because that is when you were able to talk.  Everyone was talking at the same time, we could have been heard on the second floor, but we did not care.  Even though everyone was talking, we were all paying attention to each other and we were able to differentiate between each other’s voices.  \r\n\tWhen the show started again, everyone stopped talking and started watching.  It came to the part that George’s dad died, there were sniffles and even though no one would admit it, there were even tears.  It was sad, every one could feel the pain that George was going through.  That is how the episode ended.  We all sat around for a minute or two to regain ourselves, then got up and went back to our rooms.  We will all get together next Thursday and do the same thing.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sappshh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04247,41.4658]}},{"properties":{"name":"1145 St. Joseph St.","description":"Posted by Ellen8788I grew up on 1145 Saint Joseph St.  St. Jo is a narrow road on a big hill—a sand dune, actually—it’s a killer for bike riding.  You have to take a sharp turn off of Oak St. at the base, so it’s impossible to get enough momentum.  You have to stand on your bike pedals all the way up, wobbling back and forth, panting…and once you reach the top, you’re already coasting down the other side.  More like hurtling, actually, into another sharp turn at the bottom, around a huge pot hole and through drifting sand, blown up from the beach.   That’s the street where I learned how to ride my bike.  I wiped out on that sand at the bottom so many times, that after a while I started bailing out when I got near the bottom.  I knew I was going to end up on the asphalt, anyway, and the less tangled I got in my bike chain, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the start and end of St. Jo weren’t so great, but the top of it was amazing.  For one thing, that’s where my house was.  Right at the top.  And you could see the lake.  But mostly, the house.  1145.  My parents added on to it twice, so my memory of it is a combination of all its editions.  There was always a picket fence out front, and a yard behind it, that got considerably smaller with each addition.  My mom planted new trees every time they made the house bigger, too, so it really wasn’t a front yard so much as heavily forested little patch of grass.  The oldest tree was a wisteria bush, on your right as you walked up the slightly winding sidewalk to the house.  It was 30 years old, at least.  It had a thick knotted trunk, grown up around the axle of a wagon wheel. The vines branched out around the wheel at the top, intertwined in the spokes, pouring out over the top.  It made huge purple flowers in the spring, shaped like grape clusters, hanging almost to the grass.  The iron rung of the wagon wheel had fallen off long ago, and embedded itself in the grass beneath the tree.  My mom filled the circle in with pebbles during the 1st addition to the house, when I was seven.  I cleared out a seat under the wisteria and lined it with leaves.  I used to sit in the bush, playing with sticks and flowers and my stuffed animal rabbit, whose name I can’t remember.  I left it in the yard one day and first it got rained on and then the dog ate it.  But before the rabbit died, I had a perfect world under the wisteria at 1145 St. Joseph St.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2shsvfuh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.2381,41.62064]}},{"properties":{"name":"20 min.","description":"Posted by MgiguereThis town was made for squares.  I think this everyday when I have to walk 20 minutes to campus form my home and then another 20 minutes to get back.  What is even more annoying is that there is no possible shortcut to this problem as where I live and where the campus is are on opposite corners of a huge rectangle.  I don’t want to seem bitter about it, because I do enjoy the exercise – rain or sine.  However, by the time I have walked back and forth about a couple hundred times the variety of the scenery becomes muddled and all too familiar.\n\tTrying to mix up the pattern in this town is hopeless since each road is basically the same thing over and over again.   Some days I go the straight rout, sticking to the perimeter like some train tied to the tracks.  Other times I mix up the repetitive trails with a bit of zigzagging.  I may stick to the quite roads in the morning and then speed back with the noise and hustle of the traffic on Lincoln Way.  Yet no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try; it always takes me 20 minutes to get from one place to another.\n\tIt seems people out here feel safer in boxes.  Out East the idea of a grid shaped county, town, or city never really struck anyone as a good idea.  Some people when they come out to New England, for example, feel completely overwhelmed by the notion of having to drive through hills and woods on roads that stretch and coil for miles, hugging the curves of hills and ponds instead of blasting right through them. While everyone may feel safe here in this corner of Northwest Indiana in their squares and rectangles I wonder why they think curves are so bad for the place.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s8ls7s4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04639,41.47129]}},{"properties":{"name":"41.550210, -87.462930","description":"Posted by Jpavich1<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sji9pwx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.46293,41.55021]}},{"properties":{"name":"A Brother","description":"Posted by Jpavich1A Brother \r\n\r\nOne day, I walked into the basement of the library to check my email, and there, in the corner office, was Mark Sharp.  He works for the University as a web designer—or something computer oriented.  Anyway, I’m sure he knows what he’s doing.  Mark’s from Highland too.  He and I actually graduated a year apart.  We have several friends in common, although we never hung around together all that much.  He gave me a team in his fantasy baseball league.  Helluva guy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it’s really great to have someone around who understands what that place has done to my head and the heads of all the people I discuss here and everywhere I discuss people.  In other words, Mark knows why I do what I do and say what I say.  I don’t have to explain to him why, or feel the need to apologize or explain.  Mark’s office is a little house with a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter’s night (I think that’s REO Speedwagon I stole that from).  I enjoy our few minutes we can hang out everyday.\r\n\r\nHe told me his theory of “the sphere of influence,” which basically is that if you stayed in town for any extended period of time after high school, you remained in “high school” in your mind.  The “sphere” holds your place in time and perpetuates itself within the personalities of those who failed to break from its grasp.  Awesome.  True too.  \r\n\r\nAnd so I asked him about a mutual friend, whom I believe has a theory that a Vietnam Vet and a friend of mine are trying to have him killed.  The Vet, by the way, was not in Vietnam.  So Mark says—“oh yeah, and what about the aliens?”  I say, “what aliens?”  And he says, “There’s not enough time now, come and see me later.”  So I will see him later.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sjl7eyn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04468,41.44067]}},{"properties":{"name":"A Constant Beauty","description":"Posted by Laura886The streets are covered in mud.  The sidewalks are covered in mud.  My shoes are covered in mud.  Mud seems unavoidable these days.  These mud covered pathways are all fenced in to separate the muddy paths from the muddy ditches.  As I walk across campus I have found that some serious acrobatics need to be put into action to get past the perilous puddles.  One time I clung to the fence’s edge and tip-toed on the bit of hardened mud and slush crusting the edges of the pathway.  I made it without too much of a mess.  Today, though, the waters had risen and the hardened crusts were now squishy.  I stood staring at the lake, then down at my dress shoes, and back to the lake.  This went on for about a minute.  There was no way to avoid wet socks.  I turned around and took a longer route through a nearby building.\r\n\tNew projects pop up everywhere one looks.  Holes are being dug.  Pipes lay across the slush covered grass.  How many pipes can possibly need fixing?  I awake many mornings to the sound of beeping trucks.  I even heard one in the middle of the night the other night.  It’s the middle of the winter and late, is digging a hole really that urgent?\r\n\tThough I’ve had some run-ins with flash sidewalk flooding and am greeted many morning by big yellow and black alarm, I found today to be beautiful.  I look past the puddles and the pipes and see the pink and purple streaks across the sky.  As I walked back from my cross-country practice that involved high-winds and pelting bits of hail, I breathed in the moist air and smiled.  I smiled at the soil smell in the air from the dug-up earth.  I smiled at the fresh breeze.  I smiled at the pink and purple streaks across the sky.  Despite the construction and mud I had a feeling of renewal.  Days are getting warmer, spring break will soon be here.  In less then two weeks, it will be day lights savings; the lights in the sky will burn further into the night, uplifting us from the winter slumps.\r\n\tThis scene reminds me that no matter where you are there is a natural God-given beauty that can’t be suppressed.  Beyond dirty city streets or construction sites or the like.  Above the muddy gated sidewalks there are pink and purple streaks across the sky, a splash God’s watercolor brush.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sad41kn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04275,41.46415]}},{"properties":{"name":"A Memory","description":"Posted by MommysurvivalI got up before anyone else this morning to burn a CD for my workout. I fiddled around with playlists on iTunes, playing snipits of songs to find just the right motivation for this frigid snowy day. “Oh cool, iTunes.” Andrew’s voice startles me. “Sorry to scare you, Mommy,” he says with a smile. “Can I pick your workout songs? I promise you’ll rock out.” “Sure,” I say. “But, I’m in the mood for a little old school. Can you do that?” “You got it,” he says as he sets to work clicking, dragging and dropping.  \r\n\r\nHe knows what I mean by old school—80’s pop—the music I cranked on the car radio as loud as it could go when I finally had a license to drive; the songs I recorded on my jam box; the ones I danced to alone in my room with the cords to my Sony Walkman flapping against my hip. It’s Michael Jackson and Tina Turner, Pat Benatar, Men at Work, Devo and Duran Duran, or Prince. Yeah, Prince was my favorite. Andrew never cared for the music of Sesame Street or other children’s music when he was a toddler, so instead he was raised on the Monster 80’s CDs. I trust him to hook me up.\r\n\r\nA few hours later on the treadmill I am not disappointed. He chose a good mix of songs. The sweat beads on my forehead as the sounds of Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” blast from my earplugs. This was a good one. \r\n\r\nI see myself sitting in front of the TV in the living room of The Brown House (our term for my childhood home). I sit anxiously on the edge of the sofa. My brother and parents are in chairs at the other end of the room. We are watching Michael Jackson at the 1983 Grammy Awards. He will own the night by the end of the show. He will win for Best Male Vocal Performance in Rock, Pop and R&amp;B. He will win for Best Album and Best Producer. But it is his live performance of “Billy Jean” when he does the moonwalk that will rock the house. \r\n\r\nMichael Jackson, in 1983 looked youthful and handsome—no plastic surgery, no skin bleaching, no baby over the balcony, no sex abuse scandals. He looked innocent and human. It was performances like this where the comparisons to Elvis Presley were born. Michael Jackson did have the unmistakable gyrating hips of Elvis, yet he borrowed the break dancing pops and locks or the pirouettes of ballet to make his grooves unique. He would grab his belt and kick up his foot then twist his body like a rubber band. Sometimes he tossed in a stiff shoulder thrust or head snap that no one had ever seen. Crowds went crazy for his ingenuity. I sat in my living room mesmerized. \r\n\r\nUnder the stage lights, his sequined jacket glistened at every paddle of his feet or pop of his hand. It was this performance where he wore the lone white glittery glove that became a trademark of his for so long. There’s an instrumental portion in Billy Jean near the end and that’s where it happened. Michael, alone on stage—no back up dancers or hip hop entourage like today’s performances—just Michael and his moves. On the edge of my seat, I could see it in his eyes; he was in his element, in the zone. The beat thumped out and it looked like he just did what comes natural: he grabbed his belt, pumped his pelvis a few times then slid backwards on his penny loafers; a move that made him look like he was gliding on air. The crowd erupted. I remember my dad said, “Well, would you look at that?” “Yeah, look at that!” I yelled. \r\n\r\nWhen I think of Andrew compiling this playlist I smile at the meeting of the past and the present: the way my memory of Michael Jackson sliding across the Grammy stage morphs into my husband’s funky display across the kitchen tile as Andrew yells, “Daddy, that was awesome will you teach me how to do it?” How can you not be impressed by the moonwalk the first time you see it? I smile at the thought of my son in his closet in front of the mirror trying to pop, lock, and snap. I’ve shown him a few moves, but his dad is better at this, too. \"Just close your eyes and feel it,\" my husband suggests. I wonder if Michael Jackson ever looks back to the 1983 Grammies at his youthful innocence and his passion for the beat. I wonder if he ever stands with one of his children in front of the mirror and says, “You snap your foot like this then pop your shoulder like this. Now you try”\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s6x7tvc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.08313,41.47463]}},{"properties":{"name":"A Necessary End","description":"Posted by Dwright1In Texas we joke, “If you don’t like the weather, wait an hour.”  But that is a popular saying in Indiana as well.  I can’t believe that yesterday it was balmy and warm, and today I’m brushing snowflakes from my eyelashes.  This area never ceases to amuse and baffle me.  The turn of weather and unrelenting wind only adds to the strange atmosphere on campus—a place where I literally could not figure out how to get to one of my classes yesterday.  I went to the library this morning and headed up to the fourth floor, where I can usually look out of the windows and over the balcony to a beautifully laid out campus.  This is the first time I’d been up there in awhile, and my view was quite different than usual.  I’ve seen the construction on campus; I’ve complained and wondered with everybody else, but seeing it from a bird’s eye was a new experience.  I looked out at all the places I’ve become familiar with in the last four years, and I felt sad to see it so changed, to know that in a year or two years, this place will look and feel familiar to someone else.  A new group of students will keep coming in and making friends and starting traditions and making this place their own.  I’ve always looked forward to graduation and getting out of here—not because I hate Valpo or don’t appreciate my friends or experiences, but I’ve always been eager for the next step.  I’m far from home and want to get back to my family.  I’m engaged and looking forward to marriage and kids and dogs.  But I feel faced with my own mortality today.  This is the end of part of my life, and yes, the beginning of another—but I will miss the comfort and familiarity of this town with its own quiet personality.

Not completely; academics are still great, and the community is still very close knit. But the spirits are falling with every new mass of mud that seemingly springs up every single day across campus.

Sod can\\'t be put down because it\\'s too cold - roots won\\'t take hold. But you would figure paths would at least be made clean.\n\nValpo is now exclusively a mud university. You can\\'t get from one side of campus to the other, in many cases from one building to another, without having your feet soaked in mud. This tends to piss people off. Smiles have pretty much deteriorated across campus, replaced by grimaces. The students used to hold their heads up, observing the beauty of campus in all seasons. Now, they have to keep their heads down to make sure they don\\'t lose a shoe in the increasing mire.\n\nIt\\'s been a while since I\\'ve heard a student not complain about the mud situation.

I no longer need to hide my behind my nerd tendencies of all the facts and knowledge gained over my past years in Valparaiso. I now have a reason to write about place. So I was sorry for shy and fun loving Victoria when she had to answer my question: What type of a landform do you represent in Northwest Indiana?\n\tAt first she turned her head slightly and starting laughing. Then she simply put her hand to her face and just said “I don’t know. I am not from this area. So I am not too familiar with the land forms or what is around.” So I went back to my knowledge and then just starting listing off some landforms. When I said the Dunes, I was shocked when she responded; “I have never been to the dunes.” I don’t think Victoria knew she was talking to a park ranger. Finally, instead of listing the technical names of landforms, I just name a basic group, hills. Victoria looked at me right in my eyes and said, “I am just like a hill!”\n\tShe then continued this time knowing where she was going. Victoria, although I am not too sure what state or region, is from a flat area. She enjoys waking up every morning and looking out her window and seeming the rolling plains of the Valparaiso Moraine. Her identity is just like hill. Some days are up while others are down. But this is a good thing to her. She likes it here much better then high school. Even though there is still drama in college it isn’t as bad as the higher school drama. \n\tShe has yet to reach that mountain peak in total or complete happiness. That is why a hill is a good way to describe what she is feeling. It’s not too tall in other words. You have your high moments, but it’s not that exciting and soon comes to an end. Victoria said that is better have it this way, because if you were climbing that mountain you would except to reach total excitement once you have reached the top, and then it would be a long downward fall. But with a hill it’s always up and down, and since size is different on each hill you never know what those moments are going to arise. \n\tMood swings, mood swings, mood swings, she was stressing to find me another metaphor for a hill. But she does not smoke marijuana, so she couldn’t say rolling a joint. Even though she was struggling to find these metaphors, she knows that Valparaiso is a nice change of pace for her. She no longer sees flat land first thing in the morning, but rather rolling topography, cranes, masses of construction, students, and workers. Not only when walking to class, but to other areas of town she is tramping through the mud, not a big fan of that, and walking up and down those hills and her personality most relates with.\n\tWhether or not we notice landforms or geographic features around us, we all are just like one or two of them. Victoria is a hill! She is a White Snapple drinking, energetic, jolly, freshman girl, with high ambition in her life.

I was all alone in my room.  The TV was on and some Christmas lights that me and my roommate have put up just for fun.  My room smelled like cookies and honeysuckle, that’s the scent of our air freshener.  It was comforting, but nothing could take my mind off of what was happening.  I had the place all to myself, except for some other people on my floor that came back around 2:30 after being out at a bar.  They made the halls smell like smoke so I was very glad that I was in my room with the cookie smell.  Then it got quiet.  No noise, no nothing, just me any my thoughts.  I tried listening to music and dancing, I mean no one cared because my roommate was not there, and I wasn’t being loud.  I’m getting very tired now; it is 3 in the morning.  Everyone was asleep, except me.  I opened my curtains to look out side.  Nothing, just the twinkling of the snow on the ground that just fell today.  It was so beautiful with the light from the moon shining down on it, and the passing of random cars.  A few more hours went by and I finally fell asleep.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sani9ks"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04268,41.46556]}},{"properties":{"name":"April Flurries?","description":"Posted by KliederDoes everyone know that it is April?

Even people new to Valpo are taken aback when they hear of an indoor gun range located in town.  To be fair the entire town has a strange fascination with guns and gun laws.  For one, there is no licensing required to fire a weapon on an indoor range, just show up with your weapon of choice, a box of your favorite ammo (certain types such as high velocity ammo and bottle neck cartridges are prohibited), and 0 will get you in the back room for at least an hour of mindless target practice.  In some ways it reminds me of New Hampshire and their “Live Free or Die” state mantra.  Sometimes I keep thinking that Indian is in some ways a sister state or the bastard child of NH.\n\nThe whole store is filled to the ceiling with guns most of which are hunting rifles mixed with a few old fashion replicas of guns long retired.   There is ammo of almost every kind to be found to match what you need for the day whether it’s a Glock you fancy or a new Desert Eagle you want to try out.  All of this is present under the soft bangs and snaps coming from the back room, muffled by a wall of reinforced steel and concrete.  Compared to being in the back room and with ear plugs or some kind of hearing protection, it’s relatively quite in the actual store.  There are also many trophies on the wall that range from a small quail and other fowl to large deer heads and an even larger Bull Moose head that guards the exit.  The moose’s head is far up above the main door that, even for its massive size, it’s easy to miss on the way in. \n\nFor all of that, Blythes doesn’t seem too far out of place for Indiana.  Any other state in the country, aside from New Hampshire and parts of the South, would find it hard in this day to welcome such a loose and free place for passionate gun lovers.

THe buildings all have an older facade that is found in many small town downtowns, but with many of those facades with a new look to them.  Brick is also everywhere.  It adorns all but a few of the smaller and most recent buildings, giving the place a sharp and hard edge.  THe roads appear wide, but are actually narrow, and often one way roads.  THe city tries for such tight control of the traffic, suggesting a need for order and power in those in charge.\n  In the center of the  town is a large older building that looks like a courthouse.  But is it?  This is hard to tell since there is little on the building to signify it as such.  There is another building that is a main government building that could be the courthouse.  This building is off to the side, on a corner about two streets away from the center and near roads taht the average traveler has no real reason to take.  The city hall is bricked similar to the rest of the town, and sits on a corner of the central square.  Other then the street signs, including the massive amount of Do Not Enter signs that are everywhere, and the overly long stop lights, actual signs of an active government are hard to find.  One gets the impression of a hiding government and law enforcement, giving way to the idea that they are trying to stay away from the people of their own town.\n   Of course, the nature is very properly cared for and neatly trimmed, suggesting more government involvement, but all this says is that the people want the place to look nice.\n    Most of the noticeable buildings actually hold stores, boutiques, cafes, and restaurants.  Those that hold alternative businesses are discreet, and not so easy to identify.  THe town caters to the middle class yuppie.  And the older citizen.  Few of the people to be seen appeared overly young or in the least bit without money.  And the vast majority of the people are white.  If looking for a very racially intermingled town, then a traveler has come to the wrong place.  Granted, the fact that it was a rainy day meant that not many people were out and about, but there were enough for a person to asume that there would be at least a few non-caucasians in this town, but that was not so.  Valparaiso is a very homogenized place, and the area screams small town country.\n   Granted, it is a decent looking little town, and it was being viewed on a grey and bleak day.  Those kind of days can damper anyone\\'s warm feelings towards a place.  But this town had a feeling of falseness.  Just moving beyond the main road, and on the other roads of the square, and walker can see the oldness of some of the buildings, and the neglect.  It also becomes quite obvious that all the facades on the buildings that are new and shiny were just placed over the original, decaying buildings.  The town is guilded, and while it is a decent and safe place to walk for and afternoon (provided the weather behaves), it is not a place where someone who is culturally and politically aware should linger.

I usually want to do something romantic, while Danny will want to be cheap and fast so we will be able to get back and move along with the rest of the night.\nSitting in my Compass Point apartment plain dull while living we bicker back and forth about where we will go and who will pay if it is somewhere expensive. It usually ends up around seven o’clock before we both finally agree on a place to eat that we both like. \nTypically, at this point my roommate Susie will ask what we are doing for dinner and her boyfriend Will end up joining Danny and myself. Not to mention this usually changes our plans from a romantic dinner for two to a casual dinner for four at some chain restaurant here in Valparaiso. Don’t get me wrong, I love Susie and Will and would always want them to come along to dinner.\nThe four of us all pile into one of your compact cars and drive the 2.5 miles into the heart of Valparaiso. We turn into a parking lot where half of the parking if for downtown customers and the other half is just for Around the Clock customers. Even though we are not allow to park in the Around the Clock spots, nine times out of ten we do. (Nobody ever knows the difference.)\nSusie and I will grab our purses from the car and Will and Danny get out of the front and lock up the car. We all run fast across Lincoln Way to the Buffalo Wild Wings. The restaurant is located inside of a building that contains a bunch of other stores including a hair cutter. Since this tends to be one of the hotter food eateries in town that is always a wait of at least thirty minutes. We put our name on the list. If it is not a typical Valparaiso night out, we usually will go stand outside of the restaurant and stand on the sidewalk. The two boys go off and joke about everything that they are looking at while Susie and I gossip about the new facts of our third roommate.\nThen our name is called, Dana party of 4. We all run inside the building and meet up with the hostess as she takes our to a wooden booth that contains four menus, a drink list, some Buffalo Wild Wing costars, and usually some crumbs from the last table occupants. Danny and Will talk one of the booth while Susie and myself sit on the other.\nWe sit in our wooden booth that contains a picture of a buffalo carved into the sides quietly and read over the menu, while the people around us talk about their daily lives louder and louder because it seems that the music is getting louder and louder. \nWe all have decided what we want to order. I look under the table and see old fries, pieces of buns, and chicken bones under my feet. I all of a sudden start to wish I would have cooked at home, because at least there is no food remnants under it. \nWill, “I will have 12 wings in sweet BBQ, buffalo wedges, and a side salad.”\nSusie, “I will have 12 wings in Blazin, buffalo wedges and a coke.”\nDanny, “I will also have 12 wings in BBQ, and a side salad with a water and lemon.”\nDana, “I will have 12 wings, 6 in honey BBQ, and 6 in Blazin, and an order of wedges.”\nThe order has been placed and we sit on the wood talking about the past week and what is come the next week. The smoke from the bar starts to roll over to where we are sitting and Susie’s eyes start to water from her allergies. \nOur drinks are bought, and Danny finds a piece of lettuce floating on the top of his water. It is sent back for another, and the waitress become perturbed with us. I start to sit cold because of the draft that is coming in from the front window. I put on my black jacket. \nAfter about forty-five more minutes of waiting our food finally arrives. It is placed in front of us. It doesn’t appear to be much food. I decide to use the restroom before eating. Susie gets up and moves out of the way. In the restroom is a group of four high school girls talking about the dates they are on, and how lame each of the guys is. I walk over to the facility one, and there is pee on the rim, then I move to facility two which looks as though it has never been flushed, and finally the third one appears to be ok. I wash my hands in the splashed and soaped up sinks before returning to the table.\nStudents are all over this place, and more and more seem to be coming in. The place is just increasing in noise and alcoholic drinks keep getting served more and more. \nThe four of us eat, and then ask for the check to be split into two: one for Danny and me, and the other for Susie and Will. Danny and my check is for 2.00. Now I really should have cooked at home. The food was not worth 2.00. We pay and live a tip for the grouchy waitress. \nAs we walk out our clothes smell of fried foods and smoke. We get into the car and drive back to Compass point.

At times it feels like I have been here for an eternity, and sometimes it feels like I am brand new to campus.  First, there is the construction.  It seems that I have not passed a year here without seeing large vehicles on campus, creating big holes.  But it has been in a different spot every time.  My first year, the old library was where I went for my research, and the new library was only half done.  Since then, the library has switched places, there is an addition to another building, a radar is now on campus, and there is one of the biggest holes I have seen up close smack in the middle of everything.  It changes, and yet at the same time doesn\\'t.\n  I have been in several different dorms now, though this year I find myself back in the freshman dorms.  Luckily, I am on the first floor.  I started here on the forth, and have since lived on several different floors.  Who I roomed with has changed, and even the decorations that I put up have changed.  But I still have the same bedspread, the mass of books on my desk, and the same wish to simply sleep a few more hours.  I even have some of the same plants, though those have grown.  I also killed the fish that I had my freshman year.  So he was alive, and then he changed to dead.  And he is still dead.  Though of course, that wouldn\\'t change.  Unless fish can be raised from the dead.  Hmm.\n   Another thing here that changes is the weather, though it is always the same four seasons.  The amount of snow that falls differs, but it is always cold.  The campus can look wonderful in any season, though have the time it has been raining and looks like crap.  (Well, actually like mud, but that is not the point). My point is that some things don\\'t, and some things do, no matter how long anyone lives anywhere.

Within the chapel walls, I am in a semi-dark room, and not a pinch of sound. In front of me is a baptismal font with a tall white candle, which ultimately reminds all of us at the time of death to remember our baptism. There is another wooden skinny table in front of there with white candles (thirty-three to be exact) to make their presence known during the service. Yes even the killer was remembered. In front of the tables of candles, there is a podium with two candles on each side for students and even the preacher can speak their words.\n \nEach person present at the service had an unlit candle. One student proceeds to the baptismal font and lights his own candle and starts passing it along to the students that were the head of the service. Those students were going pew by pew and gave it to the first student in every row to pass along. The light shines up my face and represents all the life that was lost in the world the day before. I hear sniffles from other people and their eyes filling up with tears. The preacher told us to stand with our candles still lighted so we could name all the people that were lost. The array of light looked extraordinary beautiful and filled with life. In between all the names, there was a musician that had a bell and it rang after every name. That was the most emotional part of the whole service. The students were from all different classes and majors. It just questions your thinking, how could something like this happened and could have it been prevented? I hear all of our voices in unison reciting the Lord’s Prayer and asking God for prayers for the whole university community. Taking all of our prayers and respects up to God (in a church setting), at least for me was the right thing to do. I could sense other students around me doing the same thing by holding each other or patting somebody on the back. Everybody just needs to think how could something like this happened and could it been prevented? The mourning lasts forever, but there is always hope to move on.

Sometimes the kitchen cupboards contain crumbs of the crackers, cereal, or bread which once resided in them.

The artifacts painted a clear portrait of the room\\'s former dweller.  \n\nLast night while scrubbing down a stove, I found myself wondering what conclusions one might draw from my own clutter--whether my empty coffee cups or the colored pencils which have slipped behind my desk provide insight into my personality.

When I was in high school I worked at a used bookstore and spent hours reading the inside covers of old books, from children’s printing to adult’s inscriptions, the inside covers reveal a glimpse of their earlier owner.

Denton, Texas hosts an international jazz festival and at one point was home to musician Norah Jones.  However when Danielle talked about her hometown she talked less about the culture and more about the people.  \n\nLike her hometown, Danielle is warm.  She laughs easily and smiles easily.  She’s laid back.  She wears a grey Kappa Delta sweatshirt and a shiny diamond engagement ring, both indications of some of the people she cares about.\n\nWhen I asked Danielle why she left her warm southern hometown for Northwest, Indiana she initially answered the great financial aid package but after a couple more minutes of thinking she went on to talk about the warmth and friendliness of the people.   She said that despite the obvious geographical, cultural, and meteorological differences between Indiana and Texas, the people in the places share similar warmth.  She characterizes Valparaiso as “southern” in its friendliness and small town amiability.  \n\nThe biggest difference she notices between the places is the weather.  Unlike many Midwesterners, Danielle likes the snow.  She smiled and laughed, and told me a story about pausing on the way to class to take pictures of the snow to send her mom.  She adds with a grin, “Even though I’ve been here three years.”  Danielle doesn’t take things for granted.  It also struck me that sharing the experiance with her mother was important.  Her only qualm with the snow is the immobility that the cold weather brings.  For example, recently she was unable to make the trip to see her fiancé in Ohio because of a blizzard.  I thought it was interesting that cold and the dreariness didn’t bother her, winter only becomes a hindrance when it interferes with her seeing people she cared about.  \n\nIn the brief time I spent talking to Danielle what became obvious to me was the value she placed on people, on friendliness, on community, and on loved ones.  The small town southern friendliness she remembers in her hometown and sought out in Indiana seem embedded into her personality, values, and even wardrobe.  She notices geography and culture as a part of place but recognizes what gives a place or a person value is interaction with people.  \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sd67jv5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.01859,41.47875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Deja Vu","description":"Posted by RammsteinDespite what people think, I\\'m not exactly comfortable with strip clubs.

This line has the grill area, and the special hot line, serving different foods from the main line (though not always).  Of course, there is the salad bar, and the desert line, as well as a sandwich line.  The problem is, that except for a few items, the food on campus is all the same.  And once you have eaten one thing there, you\\'ve eaten just about everything there.  Why does campus food have to be so bland, and so uniform.  After four years, a person gets quite sick of the food here.  Unfortunately, one finds it hard to eat off campus, partially due to cost, partially due to transportation.  You are forced to eat the food made here, the over-priced, under spiced, repetitive food.  A study should be done to determine if this is a mark of all campuses across the country, or just Valpo.

Everybody has a friend who, whether because of intoxication or just plain obnoxiousness, tells the same fucking stories over and over. It\\'s annoying as all hell but you put up with them because they\\'re your friend and they mean well. Sometimes, we don\\'t choose our acquaintances. But, answer me this: Do we choose our religions? As I child, I had no say in the matter. Church was a sacred place by necessity; I was told it was, and as I child, you don\\'t object. It was self-evident why the church was sacred - because it was God\\'s house; it was a church, duh! There was even a point in my formative years, mostly as a teenager, when I actually felt the church as sacred. The eucharist, the pulpit, the cross - they meant something. I tried my best to entrust my soul to the Lord. And then I grew up and realized the church, any church, is no different from my jackass friends who can\\'t come up with something original. Every week - they read from the same book; they tell them EXACT SAME STORIES. I\\'m totally bewildered how ministers have come up with original sermons for the last century. Christ, I mean the gospel is only 5 books. Worshippers sing the same songs out of the same book. Lutherans revere, and are named after, a man who wrote a book called \"Discourse I Against the Jews,\" in which he outlines how much the Jews suck at life. How many times can one hear the story of Christ\\'s birth? WE GET IT, OK? Church is repetition at it\\'s best. I used nostalgia in class the other day. It seems to me that church is the ultimate nostalgic trip - it pines for the days when things were better, when Jesus Christ was rockin\\' out with his cock out. Thing is: it wasn\\'t that great back then. I don\\'t mean this in a literal sense, of course. I have a sense of appreciation for my religious upbringing. It taught me the values and morals which I like to think define me this very day. But at some point, you outgrow it. You see the hypocrisy; you see the parellels to your life; you recognize it as antiquity. You wish it well, and move on. What a mindless rant. Bottom line: I\\'m proof that sacred is a fleeting concept. Believe it if you want, but I\\'ll continue to think of it as nostalgia. And that\\'s just fine with me, because you can indulge in whatever nostalgic memory you choose. You don\\'t disrespect what other\\'s consider sacred, church taught me that.

Tucker\\'s getting quite a workout tonight.  Her pitcher is good but inconsistent.  Lots of high, wild pitches.  And each time Tucker must leap out of her squat, rip off her mask, and dash for the ball while yet another runner steals base.\n    It\\'s all quite exciting.\n\n    About a week ago, Kevin and I stumbled upon a younger version of girls\\' softball at Kirchoff Park.  But that night I had not prepared for the mosquito invasion so we were unable to stay.  Last night as we began our walk, I saw the lights of the field beckoning and heard the crowd\\'s cheers drifting down the length of Oak St.  In that same moment, a mosquito got me smartly in the calf.  So I promptly turned us toward home and ran upstairs for my super-potent all-natural bug repellant.  When even Kevin, who can\\'t smell a damn thing (and, when some scent does make it past his dull defenses, swears everything smells like peanut butter), began to complain about the potency of my citronella concoction, I figured I was safe. \n\n    To be fair, there was quite a bit of base stealing on both sides.  The Valpo pitcher, (Sarah we learned), though much more consistent, had her share of wild balls, too.  But her consistency allowed for more hits, so when Valpo took the infield, we saw more action.  Most batters hit right down the first base line for an easy out, but not so the top of the ninth.  Valpo\\'s opponents grabbed three hits off of Sarah and even sent one to the unsuspecting outfield who suddenly lamented the attention thrust upon them.  In a short span of five minutes, the other team had brought those three runners across home plate and things looked bad for Valpo.  Someone said the score was 7 - 5, but we had no idea which team was up.  Valpo played it cool though.  No sweat off their backs.  With another runner on first, the last batter popped a ball right towards the first base(wo)man, who, all muscle and sinew, leapt as naturally as a cat, caught the ball and landed on first, getting two outs in a single bound.  And that was the game.  7 - 5.  Valpo.\n    \n    Kevin and I are currently considering season tickets.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2simzhgd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04485,41.47232]}},{"properties":{"name":"High Point","description":"Posted by KliederA palace it is not.

This term seems to encompass so many possible definitions.  Some are exclusive and some are definitions so broad that sacred ground can be found anywhere.  As a Christian, a place that stands out to me as obvious sacred grounds are churches, houses of God.  In the chapel on campus I have felt the presence of God in the empty hushed pews, where I sit peacefully, being quieted with the love of God.  Also I feel the presence of God in rejoicing and lifting a heartfelt harmony to the heavens.\r\n\r\nMy family and I make going to church a priority.  When I was younger, I sometimes took for granted the wonder of being in a sacred place, a House of God.  In churches that aren’t ornate, filled with things such as statues or stained glass, it can be more easily forgotten that the place you are in is still sacred.  A simple church is the same as any other; the physical atmosphere is not what determines its value.  While churches are considered houses of God, do there have to be walls?  What about an outdoor gathering place, with nothing more than stumps for pews?  Even further, are not the bodies of Christians’ houses of God?  Our bodies are temples that house the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nOver time I have come to really appreciate the sacredness of a church.  I no longer see it as just where I go to respect God.  I now want to go and bask in God’s presence--a taste of an eternal party. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2scmx1hw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.22046,41.44479]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hurricanes","description":"Posted by Victoria\tI just read this: “This being New Orleans, there were, of course, hurricane parties everywhere…The drink Hurricane is, as you may know, a local invention.” I chuckled to myself here and thought, “Oh, I know ALL about that Hurricane drink…” I continued reading and smiled at this next line: “Everyone I talked to had a hurricane story.” Now, while I was fully aware that Codrescu was speaking of the actual natural disaster, I thought about how everyone he talked to probably also had actual Hurricane (the drink) stories. So many drunken Hurricane stories. So here I am in the comfort (yes, for some reason tonight I can use the word “comfort”) of my dorm room and I fear that my mind is smiling at the very thought of that night...my Hurricane night. So, would you mind terribly if I shared my Hurricane story with you?\n\tIt was our last night in New Orleans. The wedding was just okay. No one in the family really liked the girl he was marrying. As a matter of fact, we still don’t like her. But either way, it was okay. We had spent the entire week as the epitome of tourists. As soon as we stepped out of the glass doors of our hotel, we were on the sidewalks of Bourban Street and during the day we walked up and down the streets of one of the cutest cities I’d ever visited. At night...we took a cab. Strangers amongst all the strange natives. That last night, though, David, my cousin, suggested taking my other cousin, Amanda, and I out. We accepted his offer and decided to take a WALK down Bourban Street. The bars were bustling with crowds seeping onto the street, many with drinks in hand. Now, for someone like me (mind you, I was 16 at the time), getting into the bar wasn’t a mission. At least it hadn’t been during my visit. In fact, earlier in the week I had the privilege of having a drink bought for me by a sailor…a sailor in full uniform. But, that’s a story for another night. This night, however, David took us to Pat O’Brien’s, the home of the New Orleans Hurricane. Now, this is the #1 rated bar in the city so this time I wouldn’t be getting in so easily. As we neared the building David was devising a plan for me. “Okay, here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna go up to the guy, dig around in your purse like you’re looking for your ID…then look at him and say you forgot it…” As he informed me of my instructions I just stared at him blankly. “Me and Amanda are gonna go in after you to make sure you get in…” So, I went. I did exactly as I was told, my heart racing throughout this entire act and finally I looked up at the doorman and sighed sweetly, “I must have forgotten my ID…” Before I even had the chance to bat my eyes he placed his hand on the small of my back, gave me a little shove, a wink and said, “You’re fine…go ahead.” \n\t“Did that really just happen?” I kept asking myself. Finally, I just told myself that this was going to be one of my greatest stories. \n\tAt the time, I had no idea how well-known this bar was, but I couldn’t believe how glorious it was. Yes, glorious. We stepped through a carriageway into a whole new part of the city. As we sat down in the Patio, David ordered for us, \"Three Hurricanes.\" In mere minutes, the largest, most stunning drinks were placed in front of us. It was punch. Fruit punch. But the kick didn’t hit me until I stood up for the first time since having been sat down and it was this night that I came to the harsh, yet exciting realization, that rum is very, very bad for me. I’d have two more…very, very bad of me. And oh, my dear, dear Pat O’Brien, there’s no one else I would have rather taught me what drunk is. And stumbling back down the streets to our hotel, New Orleans, there’s no other place I would rather tell my story about. \n\tTonight, my mouth waters a little for that drink. It waters for the enormous piece of pineapple that sticks out of the rim. Tonight, I wouldn’t mind being back there. All of a sudden, my dorm room isn’t as comforting as it was earlier. So how does a mere memory have such an impact on me? I suppose it’s the story. I suppose it’s the place. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s94vcp4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04189,41.46585]}},{"properties":{"name":"I Hate Hospitals","description":"Posted by VictoriaMy friend was sexually assaulted last weekend.\n\nIt happened early Sunday morning. I found out later that afternoon. I held back my anger and waited to unleash it after I had gone to talk to her. It took me 3 minutes to get somewhere that would normally take me 20 seconds. Down the hall, five doors down, she was reliving it over and over in her mind. When I walked in, she was sitting up covered with a blanket, holding her knees up to her chest. She was just staring at the floor in front of her…trying not to picture it anymore. She was trying not to feel it anymore. I sat in front of her right at her feet. She didn’t even look up at me. She just started crying…sobbing. I started crying…sobbing. Her room, covered in bright oranges, pinks, yellows, was now covered in fear. Every picture that decorated her desk, her closet doors, and her walls, were reminders of the hell she was forced into. They were reminders of people she thought she could trust. Her clothes were reminders of the nights she thought she’d never want to forget. The next day, she would get rid of three trash bags full of them. She would throw away the pictures. She would attempt to clean every inch of the square room, but no matter how much of this place she tried to get rid of, she would never be able to escape it. “This is the room I came back to after that night…” “This was the bed I couldn’t get comfortable in after that night…” “This was the jacket I wore on that night…” “This was the campus that it happened…” Now, this is the place where she can’t stand being alone…where she’s scared to be alone. \n\nMonday night we made a few phone calls with hope that it wasn’t too late to take her to the hospital. Whether or not she would press charges was still up in the air, but because of how distraught she was the day before, we couldn’t convince her to handle things a certain way. The first phone call we made was to the hospital. We gave the nurse the benefit of the doubt when she answered our questions angrily with an “Well, she can just do this and this and we’ll do this, but I don’t know about this and that.” Thanks, Lady. Next. Every dorm room has an ugly poster glued to the back of the medicine cabinet’s mirror. WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. “Sexually assaulted” in bold letters. Sadly, we weren’t surprised to be directed to a voice mailbox. As if we weren’t angry enough with this entire situation, we got an answering machine. In the end, we found a 24-hour crisis hotline with an angry voice on the other end. “Hi, um…our friend was sexually assaulted the other night and were just wondering…” only to be replied with “Oh, well…I don’t know.” We were directed to someone else. Finally, we got an answer. There was still time. \n\nOn our way to the hospital, my friend asked me if I could tell the doctor what happened. Once we were there, she requested that the word “rape” not come out of any of the staff’s mouths. When we walked in, I stood at the Register desk, whispered to the nurse what had happened and of every rude voice we’d heard on our way to this moment, he beat them all. I suppose we were too naïve to assume that a bit of compassion would be shown. As I tried to explain to him what she wanted, he turned away from me as I spoke and asked, “Alright, who did it happen to?” It? IT? All I could be glad about was that he hadn’t called it “rape”…yet. He took my friend with him and the rest of us sat in the waiting room. It was around 11:30 and we caught the end of an Oprah episode. For the three hours that we sat there waiting, all I could do was drum my fingers, flip threw the magazine’s pages without reading a word and barely looking at the pictures, sway back and forth and chip away at my finger nail polish…and all of this, not because I was impatient, but because I was angry. I was pissed. I was fucking livid. We shouldn’t have had to be there. We shouldn’t have had to bring our best friend to the hospital because she was…the “r” word. I hated every minute of sitting in that room, walls covered with those wispy paintings of streaks of pastels over a beach…a broken vending machine…plastic flowers…I hated every minute of sitting in that room. For three hours we waited only to be told that we’d have to wait 2 days until we got the results. When she walked into the waiting room to let us know she was done I looked into her eyes and all I could think was how I never truly knew hate until now. I just sat in that chair hating everything about its floral upholstery, hating everything about those paintings, hating absolutely everything about this place. I’ve always hated hospitals but more than anything, I hate him.\n\nI hope that bastard rots in hell. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2shog4yn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04882,41.46736]}},{"properties":{"name":"Illumination","description":"Posted by Laura886What does the everyday Valpo look like to you?

There also is a plan to make Valpo U a walking campus within the next ten years.  Places are always changing: some good changes and other’s detrimental.  In the surrounding Valparaiso, a shopping complex has sprouted and it is expanding even further into the city.  It is incredible how new restaurants and businesses can sprout up over night.  When I go home on breaks, I almost always find a new restaurant or drug store or strip mall.  I have lived in the same city for all of my life and it used to have many more plots of land filled with the natural beauty of flowing green grassy fields with large sturdy trees that had decorated the land for years.  Now in their place I find manicured lawns decorated by massive homes: each one almost identical to the one next to it.\r\n\tThere seems to be a loss of charm in character in many parts of America today.

It also took her awhile to get used to the buildings on campus also, but she actually likes campus now.  The biggest thing that she did not like was the bells that go off every fifteen minutes.

They are the highest structure on campus, and they can be heard no matter when you are on campus.  Also, hopefully you are not walking under them when they go off or you will become deaf, not really.  \nIronically though, one of her favorite places on campus is in the library.  Not just any place in the library though.  She goes to the top floor and sits on a couch that looks out over the sidewalk between the Chapel and the library.

Laura runs cross-country for the university—she’s a Lutheran.  I asked if she considered herself a “Midwesterner,” to which she answered yes.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, if you look up “Midwestern” in the dictionary, you very well may find a picture of Laura as a representative form of Midwestern females.  Historically, farmers chose wives in the Midwest based on “sturdiness” or general health.  Indiana (Northwest in particular) is no exception to this historical fact (if “fact” can be defined as something I may have read once).  \r\n\r\nReference to Detroit bothers Laura.  She will use Detroit as a point of reference, but seems to prefer not being seen as “of Detroit.”  As a Chicago Blackhawks fan, I don’t blame her—but somehow I get the feeling no one would mistake her for a city-dweller.\r\n\r\nThere’s a small town honesty that makes me nervous.

From this experience he grew up seeing both extremes contained in one city, yet never felt committed to either.\r\n\tFrom his early schooling through high school, Josh just coasted by.  When the time came to decide on what to do after high school the decision was easy.  His parents both attended Valpo and so without second thought, Josh wrote out and sent his in only college application which landed him a spot in Valpo, as well.\r\n\tJosh’s father is a social worker in this poorer area of Chicago, while his mother used to work in a school nearby.  Josh looks on his family’s decision to live there through bittersweet lenses.  He acknowledges that there was something very unique about growing up in this culture and area yet he resents how it made him feel like an outsider.  While he has these mixed feelings, he enjoys going back to get away from the everyday Indiana environment he experiences at college.\r\nLooking back Josh somewhat regrets his quick decision-making in finding a college.  He feels that there may be something more out there for him.  An unforgettable experience that made his time at Valpo worthwhile, though, was the opportunity he found for studying abroad in Germany.  It had left a wonderful lasting impression on him seen through his raised eyebrows, sentimental grin, and the twinkle of his eyes as he gets started on talking of this place. He knows that this is where he wants to be after he graduates.\r\n\tIn Germany, Josh feels he has finally met his match of a culture that he feels at home in.  While over there for a year he built up quite a network of friends.  With a laugh in his throat he adds that being 15,000 miles from here didn’t hurt either.  There is one thing Josh will miss though: the bars—cheap, hill-billy, kick-up dirt Indiana bars.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2se372kd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.58301,41.37681]}},{"properties":{"name":"Katrina Party Aftermath","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Knowing that I have not been to New Orleans since Katrina, I did not know what to expect from Professor Tomasek\\'s show. The location of the show was very confusing to locate, but overall I expected it to be longer. From the costumes and beads, I knew that I was in the right place. While checking out all the pictures, I was able to find some commonalities that describe New Orleans culture. \nColor from the very beginning grabbed my attention. Most of the colors that people wore were blue, black and white. Seeing colors like this surprised me. I expected to see more of the traditional colors (green, gold, and purple), but knowing that this city went through a destructive disaster maybe I should not assume anything. People also were wearing masks, feathers and beads. A surprising side note is that most of the people dressed up in costumes were men. I would think that women would like to celebrate this just as much as men. Men exposing bodily hair were not a particular favorite of mine. Then again, everyone losing everything that people did not have a lot to work with. One picture I could see the mold and dirt blobs on the costumes. I could even tell what costumes were made out of the stitched and sown fabric compared to plastic containers and tarps. \nThe political significance of Katrina just reminded me of all that viewed on television. Accusations against FEMA, our presidential administration, and insurance companies were evident. A lot of mixed emotions were displayed from straight faces to happy smiles. \nA true characteristic of observing New Orleans culture is the use of drugs and alcohol. More than half of the pictures had either a cigarette or a cup filled with alcohol. The two ideas definitely define a party-like occasion. \nWith these three observations through this exhibit, it always made me wonder how a city of this proportionate could be put back on due to the circumstances. I think Mardi Gras can try to get back to where it used to be. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sh2iigz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03987,41.46468]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kid's Craziness","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl13241755 Harrison Blvd Valparaiso, IN 46385With my pencil hitting the paper, I am intentionally waiting for the kids to come into the down the hallway and into the classroom. Our classroom at St. Paul Catholic School is nicely organized with twenty-five desks, two dry erase boards, baskets filled with books, and cubbies for the kids to put their belongings. I can hear their voices and footsteps trampling down the hall. Kids enter the room with loud voices although I try to ask them to minimize the volume tone. \nConstantly hearing the tattle tale hearing one say, “So and so did this” and the other said “No I did not.” My face is filled with disgust about hearing it. There are tears dripping down faces due to bumping into things or bleeding. I try to comfort them with their injuries with the help of ice cold packs. \nWe try to proceed to the cafeteria in a quiet manner. Many stops would need to be made due to the noise level especially coming from the boy’s line. Children are eager to talk to each other, but get distracted and they do not want to eat all the food that they have in their lunch. Lining up with a tray full of scrumptious delicious food to fill their tummies, they cannot wait to be social. Proceeding to the tables, I try to keep them calm even though with other kids in there it makes the sound become unbearable. By the time a half hour hits, lunch is already over and it is time to dump all the food that is not needed in the garbage can and you hope there is no kid that comes up to my desk and says, “I am still hungry.” I make it really clear that they need to eat in order to prevent that from happening.

I abandoned my shoes early on, and ran very close to \r\nthe water’s edge, when the sand was the darkest and hardest.  When the \r\nlake was rough, a stray wave might come up to splash my face, and once \r\nor twice, drench my shorts.  Running into the wind was the best.  I \r\ncould smell most fully whatever the lake was offering that day—seaweed, \r\ncucumber beetles, or dead fish.  They re all good smells, if by good \r\nyou mean real and awake and alive.  Yes, even dead fish make an alive \r\nsmell, if you’ll let them.  \r\nI went once very early in the morning, hoping to see the sunrise.  The \r\nsun was already up, actually, but the time I got out on the sand, but \r\nstill low enough to make the quietest waves glimmer out over the sand \r\nin pure, cold, glassy blue.  Looking up, I saw Bethlehem Steel, calm \r\nand chilly on the horizon, its furnaces just beginning, making thin \r\nsteely smoke trail sideways in the distance.  To me, the mills don’t \r\nruin Lake Michigan; they are part of it, a lot like the dead fish.  So \r\nI didn’t mind running toward them, taking in their colors and shadows \r\nwith as much appreciation as I did the sand drifts and drift wood and \r\ndune grass and smooth little brown skipping rocks to the right of my \r\nfeet.  But the wind was at my back, and the rocks were getting more \r\nabundant, and there was U.S. Steel to look at on the other side anyway, \r\nso I turned around, away from the rising sun, to run back over my wet \r\ntracks.  Now everything was red and orange.  The waves were not glassy \r\nbut very textured, with seaweed visible beneath their surface.  Three \r\npeople were visible too, huddled around something on the water’s edge.  \r\nOne of them has his arm around another.  I can’t hear anything but I \r\nknow they’re silent, mourning whatever it is they see.  I run faster, \r\nfeeling wet sand fly up behind me, surpassing the pace of my music, and \r\ntilting my head back to let more wind flow in.  I smell dead fish.  So \r\nthat’s what they’re huddled around.  I run straight toward them and \r\nsmile, not veering my path till the last instant, and as soon as I’m \r\npast, I fill my lungs and laugh out loud. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sa5olwo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.23419,41.62289]}},{"properties":{"name":"Life's a circus","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Lace, swirls, sparkles, clarity, light, distinct shadows, full blue.

They want you to have to examine their crotches and chestal regions to discover their sex, and they want you to not be able to decide.  But mostly, they want you to notice, to point, and to smile with them.\r\n\r\nThree women, dressed in wedding gowns—stained, ruined wedding dresses.  They’ve been treated with flood waters.

They seem to be talking.  They have something say.  This photo is dated 2006.  It still has light, and sharp shadows, and unbelievable colors—only the wedding dresses are dingy.  And these people have a purpose, too.  But instead of astonishment, they aim at anger.  Humor, certainly, but not the entertaining kind.

That is when I was three or four, and was taken in the night to have tubes put in my ears.\n\nMy appendix was on the verge of rupture on a bus ride back from my 7th grade class trip to Washington, D.C. I didn\\'t tell anyone. The bus was so quiet, and creeping so peacefully through the Pennsylvania night, that to complain about my dying body would have been a merciless infraction against the dark glowing rest. Later, when my appendix was removed, my mother or my brothers drove me around on long, song-filled county drives, to keep my mind occupied and rumble me to sleep.\n\nI went out to Kingsbury in April of 2005 with Matt and Holly. I was in the sumblime state of healing that any other night-drive does to me. Matt\\'s rental car, Race Suzuki, was riding low and crooked--the wheelwells were busted two nights ago, when he took us and his bestfriend Cody to fishtail out on rain-slicked backroads. We went into a farmer\\'s hatch, took a wagon trail through a windsheer and half the car slid into a ditch. We got out and pushed Suzi back onto grit. She took off and Matt mawkishly laughed as he peeled away, leaving his friends in the cold mud.\n\nKingsbury was a spook story he never told us about. An abandoned military installation, the only reason for a town to be there at all, had been peeled back after the Korean war, and all the implements for making mortars and shells had been hauled out of the still-standing buildings. The fortifications, the outposts, the mess-halls, the recreation buildings all haggard and rain-rotted, like swamp-submerged skulls. The road into the complex was so over-grown with bramble and briar we drove past it twice, never angling our headlights onto its low-brush demarcation, finally tumbling onto the road blindly, where Matt intuited. We lost a chunk of the front-bumper as Suzi nose-dived into a massive pothole.\n\nHegel, Marx, Freud--if I\\'d read anything on them then, I could have prostituted their ideas for my own safety. But in this trespassing zone of rural exploration, I only felt the gloom and majesty any abandoned endeavor produces. The phenomenon has been explored extensively, mainly in the idea of the \\'uncanny,\\' the everyday turned unfamiliar, as Vidler describes, \\'the stubborn resistance of nature to the assimilation of human attributes and its tragic propensity to inorganic isolation.\\' \n\nWhen the drizzle let down, Matt and Holly and me got on top of Suzi. Matt said, \\'Let\\'s roof,\\' so that\\'s what we did. He had his leg in the driver\\'s side window, steering the car as it trundled forward, gear in drive, and I had my legs hanging off the back. Holly bravely faced forward. We roofed through the debris, stopping here and there to inspect empty lots, circles of dead trees, the resonating shimmer of an inky pond, and three gutted buildings.\n\n\n\nFixed below is a link to a youtube.com, Okkervil River\\'s music video for their song, \\'For Real,\\' off their album Black Sheep Boy.

It is farmland, covered mostly in soybean fields with the occasional corn. The land is dry, possibly in the first stages of desertification. The soil crumbles if you hold it in your hand, and the only flowing water is a small (ten feet wide at the most) drainage ditch that used to be a flowing river. \n\tBefore farmers, namely Caucasians, came to this area of northern Indiana and drained the massive wetlands that used to be where the farms are today, the land was considered sacred to the Native Americans in the area, a paradise of sorts. If ever there was a Garden of Eden, there’s a good chance it was in northern Indiana. Believe it or not, there used to be bears that lived up here, mountain lions, and more bird species than you could probably count. The wetlands used to be a major stopping point for birds migrating north. When the wetlands were drained, the wildlife left. I can’t remember the exact number, but the draining of the Kankakee Marsh drove an unfathomable number of avian species to complete extinction.\n\tThe marsh used to be a favorite hunting place of Theodore Roosevelt. The old, derelict lodge that he used to be a common patron still stands near what remains of the Kankakee River a few miles from the dry fields. It stands as a testament to the fact that Roosevelt failed in his attempt to make the Kankakee Marsh one of the great National Parks of the United States; his lodge has fallen apart with the marshes. \n\tWhen people pass through this part of the state, many are quick to notice the flat, rural landscape, completely ignorant to the fact that there used to be a massive wetlands covering a good percentage of the area. This land was sacred…the livelihood of Native Americans and wildlife. It was paradise. Now, it is farmland, concrete highways, and industrial buildings. If you want to talk about the destruction of place, the abomination that is what used to be the great Kankakee Marsh is a prime example to center discussion around. You want to talk man destroying beauty, here you have it. You want to talk about the loss of the sacred, literally throwing life down the train for the sake of agricultural wealth…look at the farms around here.

We are watching the latest Harry Potter movie—the fourth story with dragons and Dementors and a few other images that when conjured by FX guys are usually much scarier than when conjured by your own mind. “Of course,” I say sliding over to make room. He rests against my right side then pokes at my belly with amusement. “You’re squishy,” he says with a smile. “Yes, I guess I am,” I reply.\r\n\r\nAfter two C-sections, an emergency appendectomy and an exploratory scope through my belly button, it is true that my midsection is not what it used to be. I feel superficial to wish that it was, although not superficial enough to avoid daily workouts. However, no matter how many minutes I spend on the treadmill, or no matter how many crunches I do, it is increasingly difficult to shape my body into the skinny silhouettes I admire in magazines and catalogs—the body I remember before having children.\r\n\r\nThere is a picture I keep in a drawer in my closet--of me at 22 years old in a bathing suit on a beach with a college friend. Sunburned, youthful and confident, I wear a very small black and yellow bikini. My stomach muscles are visible, rippling in all the right places. No stretch marks, no scars, no flabby skin—it was 17 years ago. \r\n\r\nLost in my own thoughts I didn’t notice Andrew had fallen asleep. Although his face has matured, his long, dark lashes against his pale skin will forever remind me of his sleeping face when he was a baby. When he was two months old, I rocked him in my lap until he dozed off, then I tiptoed to the crib and gingerly removed one hand at a time from around his body until I had placed him on one of my shirts (a way to trick him into thinking I was still close by). He called the bluff—it only took him a split second to realize he was no longer in my lap. His eyes would pop open and I couldn’t resist returning to the rocker to start the process over again. \r\n\r\nTonight I feel the weight of his body heavily on my side and notice his gangly legs outstretched to reach the foot stool. He has grown too big to carry, so I have to wake him. His eyes still startle open just like they used to, but instead of a trip to the rocking chair he lumbers out of his spot, and without any help from me, stumbles up the stairs and down the hall to his room.\r\n\r\nAs a baby, the rocker ritual took three or four tries before he would finally give in to sleep. It was always hard to leave the crib until I was sure he was breathing—a strange mother thing that won’t go away. Tonight, from the doorway I see his chest rise and fall as a slight whistle escapes from his nose on each exhalation. It is safe to go to my own bed. I undress in my closet and sit in front of the mirror in my underwear with the beach photo in hand. For the first time, I notice how pale I am compared to the bronzed girl in the picture. As I’ve aged I’ve grown wiser about the sun and I am unwilling to bake my skin as recklessly as I did in my twenties. Then it occurs to me that as I\\'ve aged, my body has grown wiser about me. It knows that no matter how much I desire a bikini body I am a mother that needs a lap—not a hard park bench kind of lap, but a squishy comfy couch kind of lap.

The apartment smells of fettuccine because that is what was on the stove cooking when the fight occurred.\nI had just ran to the near by Target to pick up some glue for a project I was working on. I left the two of them in the kitchen happily cooking dinner. I stood at Target and debated about the different types of glue I could buy. Generic verse Elmer’s, and then clear glue verse that deep white glue. I ended up buying a .24 cent bottle of clear Elmer’s glue. (I think it was miss-marked.) I checked out and went back into the dark, cold night and travel the mile back to the apartment. \nI unlocked the door, which I hadn’t locked before leaving twenty minutes ago. The fettuccine noodles were boiling over on the stove, and water from the pot was dripping on the floor. The white creamy sauce was boiling high splashing again the microwave, making a mess. Where was my roommate? \nAll of a sudden I hear deep sobs coming down the hall in the apartment. All the lights are off, except of the glare of Full House that was on the living room. (I had left the TV on when I left to go on my errand.) I stood there in the cream colored hall, holding my Target bag, and debated on whether or not I should disturb her. I walk lightly over to the coat closet, next to her room, and hung up my brown coat. I stood outside her door for a moment and tapped on the door. It wasn’t my roommate that answered; it was her boyfriend saying, “she is fine.”\nFrighten by the situation I ran back to the living room and sat down on the green couch. I turned the volume up on the TV, took out my glue, and started glue together my project. I could still heat her sobs coming from the room down the hall, and occasionally a males voice would be yelling. I just kept on turning the TV louder and louder to drain any noises in the background.\nFull House was ending, and he came storming out of her room. He slipped on his blue flip-flops and left the apartment. I sat there and stared down the empty hall. I didn’t know if I should invade on her privacy or not. I stood in the kitchen and started to clean up the mess that was created. She came out of her room. Her eyes were swollen, and her face was as red as Santa’s suit. “Let me clean this up. I made the mess.” I told her not to worry and gave her a glass of ginger al. She sat on the green couch while I worked on cleaning the mess up. She just stared at the white painted walls, and then turned her head slightly toward me and started sobbing again. I looked at her and she ran into her room.\nI dried my hands off, and went down that hall, opened her door, and sat next to her on her bed. I opened my arms and she crawled right into them, and just sobbed and sobbed. \n     We have never spoken about that night, and I have no idea what the fight was about.

Before the summer breaks, I get to sign up for shifts in the next semester, as well as the winter break.  I get to think about working there even when I am on vacation.  The place and the people won\\'t let me go.  I probably couldn\\'t get fired now if I tried.  Hmm.  No, I won\\'t try.  The job is not bad, though it does take a greater bite out of my mealcard than it would if I did not have to go there for the majority of my digestive needs.  After all this time there, I admit, I do like the job, to an extant, and will miss it, especially my coworkers, when I leave.  I have been in that cafeteria so much, that it is a place I will never forget.  Even if they tear it down when the new Union is finished, it will still be one of the places that has the greatest hold on my memory, and one of the biggest, though more subtle, parts of my college existence.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sgeql8l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04376,41.46249]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nature Issues","description":"Posted by Andybrd<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> When a person looks around this campus, they may notice a few things.  The construction for one, or that all the buildings share the brick wall motif.  Something that more observant people may notice are trees, or rather, the lack there of.  This campus does not seem to put much into having a good amount of trees, and it seems that whenever we have some, they get torn down for some new construction.  We do have some, but who knows how long they will last in this place?\n   This issue was brought to my attention recently during the in class interviews.  I was conversing with Chris, and asking his opinion on this area, and one of the biggest concerns for him is the lack of nature.  With no trees, this place is almost like a \"barren wasteland.\"  And that is becoming more apparent with each day of construction.  \n   The lack of nature has had one good impact, at least on Chris.  It has led him to \"appreciate what (he) used to think as crap.\"  This was in reference to the area he came from.  Before coming to this area, he never noticed the hills, nor the abundance of nature in his home area.  But here, where the winds come rushing at you over flat lands with little in the way of nature to create breakers, you learn to appreciate a place that had more change in landscape, where you could not see the same land extending infront of you for miles.  Instead of a hilly place where what is beyond creates a mysterious adventure, shaded in nature\\'s beauty, we get to see everything, which is more than we wanted, and to find that what we see greatly lacks in green.  While this area is not completely bad, the geography could truly use some help.  I say, keep your new buildings and parking lots, and give me the trees, my paradise.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2satvpgh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03767,41.46424]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans","description":"Posted by DdoboszI knew I was about to enter Professor Tomasek exhibit, but I was not aware that I was about to enter into a New Orleans Mardi Gras. The walls of the exhibit were covered in photos taken from the first Mardi Gras after Hurricane Katrina. I started gazing into the pictures that were filled with yellows, purples, greens, blues, and whites. All of a sudden I hear, “Here have another Rum and coke, this ones on the house.” I look down at myself and I am wearing a simple green and yellow dress and there are ten strands of beads hanging from my neck. I ran over to a near by mirror and I can not see my face because it is hidden behind a mask. \nI am drawn away from the local street bar, to jazz musicians on the street. As I walk I notice that the ground is covered in trash, and there are other people just like me wearing customs. The air is humid and dry, and it dawns on me that I am attending the New Orleans Mardi Gras. I decide to walk around taking notice of everything that I pass. The people attending the festival are of all ages, young, middle aged, and old. They are all in some custom, expect for one older woman who is wearing a sweatshirt, but she has a multitude of breads hanging around her neck. People of all shapes and sizes are here.  What I did notice was that there was much multi-cultural diversity at this party. Much of the people were white, and I was unable to tell if they were visitors or locals. I would assume that from the smiling faces of the people, the elaborate customs that they were wearing. \nOut of the corner of my right eye I see two young men. I turn to look at them. There customs was one of the most unique I have ever seen. They have a custom of white flesh representing the body that lays under the cloths. The irony of this was that they were still hiding their own true bodies. Because what they were wearing was representing clothing and under them laid their own bodies. I have no idea why only one hand was wearing a black glove, and why their faces were hidden behind a black mask. \nEveryone around me is either holding an alcoholic beverage, or is holding a cigarette. If they are not wearing face paint, then they are wearing a mask. I am surprised that since this is the first Mardi Gras after the hurricane that some of the people took the same amount of time as normal to develop these elaborate customs. There was one man who took of the whole street himself. He was dress in a white leotard and had huge feathers with eyes coming out of them. He was supposed to be a peacock. Most of the men just dressed up as women in dresses, or lady suits. Another man was dressed as Popeye. \nThe women were just dressed as going to a masquerade ball. The slinky dress, and skirts with their faces hidden behind face paint or a mask. \nI started making my way down the street, gathering beads and taking pictures. I was drinking and laughing with everyone else. I didn’t care I had no idea who these people were, and I didn’t even remember that the hurricane had hit just a few months before. It was fun to be in the true sprit of New Orleans.\nI dropped my pen on the ground and as I bent down to pick it up; I realized that I was still in the VUCA visiting an exhibit. My trip to New Orleans had been created by the pictures surrounding me on the two walls. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2scwfn41"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04,41.46404]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans Blues","description":"Posted by VictoriaIt was the first thing that I noticed when I stepped into the hallway. The blues. For a minute, I stepped onto the street myself...I walked past a sax player playing his song. Mind you, the street wasn\\'t as jampacked with the costumes and masks and beads and liquor, but it was an entertaining walk full of cans with a few dollars in them, a human sock monkey, and a blues soundtrack playing throughout the background. \n\nThat is where I was taken back to when I stepped through the gallery, but soon I was brought back to reality. I stood in front of these images and again, I noticed most the great mess of blues. While the color itself that radiated through many of the pictures was quite eye-catching it was so bright, the concept behind the costumes made of the large blue tarps that almost all read \"FEMA\" made me wonder if these Mardi Gras regulars had recovered from their blues. Or, did they sing the blues? Listen to the blues? Feel blue after Katrina? Were they blues fans before Katrina? For they were showing off their mighty blues now. From wigs, to masks, to hats, to eyelashes, to jewels...the blues made everyone one. The blues brought the street of men, women, men very well-dressed as women together. And, as a backdrop of these photos what did I notice? These boys proud of their creations and standing strong on their land after Katrina tried to wash it away had a clear, blue sky framing them in their pictures. The streets were crowded, indeed, but that\\'s what I liked to see. The spirit that I\\'ve heard so much about lately was there. It was still there. I wanted to be there.

A majority of the pictures were of men dressed in drag—outlandish gold eyelashes, obnoxious bosoms, garish red lipstick, and huge blue hair.  The disguised men looked almost creepy in the glare from their glitter—smiling out at the camera, ignoring the pain of the place around them.  It made me think that something about a place, something inside people, never really changes.  We can suffer a huge loss and devastation, and still get fired up to dress like a woman, tucking inconvenient anatomy into the refuge of costumes.  These people wanted to make a point that life goes on, celebration goes on, protest goes on, spirit goes on.  I really liked the political commentary costumes, not because I agree with them or thought they were necessarily poignant, but I love looking at a place where people speak up and say what they’re thinking.  It sounds cheesy, but it really does make me proud to live in a place where we can do this whenever we want.  Even amidst what some condemn as a huge mistake and neglect on the part of our leaders, all of these people can get together and sympathize with each other, voice and visualize their opinions, hurt in front of a crowd.  But the interesting thing about these photos and the atmosphere of Mardi Gras through the camera lens is that it doesn’t look like pain or suffering.  It looks like celebration, which is at the heart of this tradition.  I see eccentric, startling, up-close, loud, fun, over the top, heartfelt, open… when I look at these pictures.  It’s pretty clear to me that at least part of the population in this region decided that a hurricane can only claim so much.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sjpae7e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03938,41.46379]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans Through A Camera","description":"Posted by ClentzMardis Gras is important to the people of New Orleans. One does not need to take a class about the city to understand that. The event is known across the country, and has inspired an infinite amount of party and prom themes. However, I never really knew what made the event so special in New Orleans.\n     After hearing St. Germain\\'s discussion about New Orleans, in which the negative aspects of the city were placed on the table in a way I had yet to see, the pictures in the 2nd floor of the VUCA took on a whole dimension that brought into view the life of the people.\n     Before Katrina: Here, on the streets, were men in drag despite age. Costumes ranged from none to Popeye to the absurd (two masked men in naked man suits). Here is a time where the downsides of the city take a back seat to smiles and good natured fun. Everyone in the pictures, even those completely unaware they are having their shots taken (in the background) seem to have smiles on their face. In a city where violence seems to be ever constant, this wouldn\\'t be the norm.\n     After Katrina: There are still smiles and an upbeat attitude, but the costumes seem to have died down. Where there was once countless drag (still being some but not nearly as much) there are people in blue tarps with the letters FEMA written across them. A man and a women sport red horns and shirts that say, \"Insurance Adjusters From Hell.\" One man has a poster that states, \"Bush Is An Idiot!\" Outside of New Orleans, one might find such costumes to be in bad taste. From inside the city, however, the pictures tell a different story.\n     The smiles on film are evidence that people still see Mardis Gras as a time of celebration, a time to have fun and smile. However, where there was once random colorful (and sometimes disturbing) outfits, there is now a collection of politically charged regala. One man in blue drag is covered in bugs and holds a fly swatter, a testament to the bug problems the city has with the decay of unused food and abandoned refrigerators. Sarcasm seems to have replaced random absurdity in the minds of New Orleanians; but nothing seems to have replaced their view of Mardis Gras. Look at the smiles in the pictures. Look at the outfits and the usually-depressing-turned-comical motifs, and it is evident that Mardis Gras is important to a city riddled with anger, depression, racism, and violence.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2slodayj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04008,41.46398]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina","description":"Posted by Bambi1185New Orleans is a very amusing and enjoyable place with a lot of drinking and smoking.

This is a time for a carefree life when no one cares what you do.  There are street parades and food everywhere.  There is also a drink and cigarette in everyone’s hand.  There are a lot of purples, blues, and yellows through the city of New Orleans.  Well, this was until Hurricane Katrina hit.  After Katrina hit, New Orleans became a place where mold and government protest were seen all along the streets.  Now, Mardi Gras is still fun, but people are trying to make a more political message out of it.  Instead of men and women wearing beautiful dresses, they wear dresses that look like they have been in water and have mold on them.  Also, the costumes are made up of FEMA tarps and people are “insurance agents from hell.”  There are even people with signs that say how bad President Bush is and how the government sucks.

Nothing was wrong; it was perfect.  I walked a little more, getting lost with every step.  I had no clue what time it was and I really did not care for the first time in a long time.  I see a rabbit just standing there also, but why was he just standing?  Did he have no place to go?  Was he scared of me?  I like to think that he was just enjoying the beautiful night.

I was in a trance, which was brought about by the feeling of relief, relief from the hard day of school and work, and the relief that everything will be okay in the end.  I just keep walking letting all of my worries and fears leave me.  I did not want to leave the peacefulness outside, but I was getting cold, so I had to start walking back.

Furthermore there are cops that chase robbers, who exceed the speed limit on bike. When these robbers are caught, a coupon is ripped from a local drugstore’s booklet, instead of a ticket. Too many coupons meant a “night behind bars” of a front porch railing. It is a place where new restaurants open and within days are closed and replaced by new ones. Movie stars and pop-singers perform weekly. A day at the spa is only a water-hose and sandbox away. And if one really wants a special treat, a nice blend of perfume can be made straight from the branches of a lilac bush. The process, quite simple: 1 part water-filled tin pots heated in the sun, 1 part Mom’s garden, and 2 parts ability to convince others of its wonderful scent.A few blocks from this place from a store that sold all the essentials one needed in life. It was called “D &amp; C”, a dime and cent candy store. A special item at the store was a foot-long, bright pink plastic piggy bank. It always stared at you with a huge grin plastered on its face until one day you can’t take it anymore. You buy it in excitement and then get home to realize that now you have no pennies to put in it. On other trips you may pick up a necklace or lipstick or cigarettes, the sugar variety only. This place is quite wonderful, especially in the summer. You wake up to the sun shining brightly through the window-panes and the sounds of bouncing balls or jump-ropes hitting the pavement below. The breeze through the window screens brings laughter of children, the best alarm clock of all. You jump out of bed, throw on a zip-up one-piece outfit covered in tropical fruit shapes or ice cream cones, and are ready to start the day. Then you run downstairs to find a smiling face, a warm “good morning sleepy head”, and a piece of homemade cinnamon toast. There is an exchange of “I love you” and out you go. What shall you do? Probably get chased by a cop, hunt a ghost, go undercover to do a background check on the old lady on the corner; or if you’re feeling a little less adventurous you may settle for a relaxing mud bath.This is a wonderful place. I will store it in my memory forever. It will always be a part of me wherever I go.

Behind us two students informed each other what their day’s consisted of. In front of us, a group of students each walked with their heads down—chasing their shadows. I chased the Chapel’s light. I’ve come to discover that once the sun sets, it radiates from inside. From the highway across the street, it calls to you. The chandeliers that hang inside on the high ceilings play as the North Star. From the dorm buildings, it announces that it’s there if you need it. From any of the campus’ pathways, its kaleidoscope of windows aluminates and draws you into its sanctity. \n\n\t\n--Tonight, we’ve come together to pray. And isn’t it ironic that such a tragedy is what must take place for some to seek God? Is it strange that we’ve come together because someone has taken away people who are complete strangers to some of us? Gone…from the world. \n\n\n--I sit in a pew near the back. Some of the heads in front of me are down—praying already. Some are observing this environment they have never surrounded themselves with. Some are watching the candles burn in front of them. Some are twirling their thin, white vigil candles between their fingers. Ahead of us all stands a tall candle where the fire for ours will derive from. Next to this is a table consumed with dozens of pillar candles already burning. It’s easy to assume what these represent…who these represent. \n\n\t\n--The lights are dimmed. The speakers quietly pop when their power switch is flipped. The service begins. The voices are low, the passages are solemn. We learn nothing but sorrow as the story is retold to us. We pray.\n\n\t\n--Behind me, a man and woman sing “O Lord, Hear My Prayer” as the candles are being lit one by one. They arrived to the Chapel together and their voices accompany one another. She harmonizes his. It’s a melancholy hymn, but its two verses are sung over and over again. After so many repetitions I hear them slowly begin to hum only clearly singing the words “Lord” and “prayer”. They’d hum. “Oh Lord…” They’d hum. “Lord…” They’d hum. “Lord…my prayer…” The candles were lit. The song was done. \n\n\t\n--I heard a psalm and while he read it I watched the flame of a boy sitting in the pew in front of me. The voice read, “Weep with those who weep…” and I watched his candle melt away. I watched the wax fall down its side—as if it was weeping. My candle did not cry, but his wept. Three tears melted on top of one another on this boy’s candle. \nThree distinct tears. \n\n\t\n--I stood up with the whole of the congregation. “There are 33 candles in front of you. Not 32. But 33.” One by one we learned who belonged to each flame and with each name the bell chimed. My heart grew heaviest after each bell toll. I kept my eyes shut as the sound resonated through the Chapel, but here my tears began to melt on top of one another. Here, I wept with those around me.  I listened to the names, the toll that helped lead them into eternity, and to my neighbors’ whimpers. \n\n\t\n--We blew our candles out together and walked away. As I stood in line to leave the school a message from our university, I watched those who stayed to pray longer. In the back pews students took moments alone. By the 33 candles, one student stood. The other kneeled. He prayed with his hands palm to palm and his face resting upon them—the way prayer is depicted in pictures. Behind his profile stood the statue of Jesus at the front of the Chapel, his arms spread wide open, welcoming life…celebrating life. Next to me, students embraced one another. This was when I began to cry once again. I wiped away my tears and watched those praying by the candles as they finished. They as well embraced one another, but didn’t let go so quickly. He wrapped his arms around her and without stepping back he again replaced his arms even further around her as if the first time wasn’t strong enough. \n\n\t\n--She handed me the pen and I wrote: Vayan con Dios y enontren paz.

My question is broad, too broad. There is an air of nervousness about her, as perhaps there is to most people living in the region. I restate the question more clearly. Slowly, she opens up, even sounding candid at times about her experience of living in Northwest Indiana. \r\n\r\nRachel is small; her body obviously shaped by the never ending cadence of her feet on the pavement. She is a runner, and from what I can gather, a very good one. We begin there as I ask how being an athlete here is different as opposed to her native Detroit. \r\n\r\nShe tells me there differences are small, but not negligible. Valparaiso, which sits on the edge of expansive farmland, has much more open land compared to back home. There\\'s a stronger connection to nature here and she seems to dig it. \r\n\r\nWe open up. I learn that she\\'s studied abroad in London. I ask her what impact coming back to Valpo had on her after studying in, what many consider, the heart of modern history and culture. Her answer surprises me greatly. She does not speak ill of Valpo, in fact, quite the opposite. \r\n\r\nShe tells me that upon her return she found the, admittedly, boring space of Northwest Indiana more interesting. She was better able to appreciate her remaining time here. Having similar travel experience but greatly different opinions, I\\'m floored and ask her elaborate further. \r\n\r\nIt seems in seeing such a vastly different culture and landscape, she feels a sense of heightened sense of appreciation for her surroundings. \r\n\r\n\"Going to London taught me that I don\\'t necessarily have to be stuck around here forever.\" \r\n\r\nWhile still taken aback, I’m envious of Rachel. By having her horizons broadened, she has not lost focus on why she came here in the first place - to earn her degree. She acknowledges how mundane this place can be and occasionally sees the same vapid landscape I see. But somehow, she’s able to get past herself and realize that her time here is fleeting, and she makes the best of it; she even enjoys it. She has a good base of friends and sense of purpose and that seems to be enough for her, at least for now.\r\n\r\nRachel is self-assured. She will go on to bigger and better things.

Is it all the sights, sounds, smells, touches, and tastes it has to offer? As a park ranger last semester for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, I was able to experience nature having one on one contact. Sometimes on the closing night shift, I would have the delight of shutting down the famous Mount Baldy. Once I parked in the parking lot of the famous dune, I would attach my radio to my belt and then start my never-ending journey to the top of this 227-foot dune. At a slow pace I would make my way through a forest of trees, mostly oak and spruce, on a nicely made wooden plank walk that is being covered with sand slowly. (I would always be sure to stop and pick up any litter along the way.) I would then stop at the wayside sign and read and then re-read the basic information given to visitors. I would then slowly make my way up the once nicely made trail for visitors. At first I can slightly feel the wooden broads under my feet, but about two hundred steps into my hike, I feel sand starting to slowly trickle into my shoes. The sand is wrapping itself tightly around my foot, almost as thou it is trying to engulf me as quicksand would. I come to a large sand hill; that used to be 20 wooden steps. I stop for a moment and can see the slowly setting sun shining through the tops of the large trees surrounding the monstrous dune. I take a deep breath, because I know the rest of the way to the top wont be easy. All is quite, that is with the exception of birds calling. No visitors seem to be making trouble tonight, or asking annoying questions. Today is a day that I can be alone, a personal self-expression time with the dune. The more and higher I hike the deeper my shoes sink in the sand, and the sand fills my shoes. Finally, I am at the far left corner on the dune. Out of breath, I stop and take a deep breath in. My mouth fills with little salty water vapors from Lake Michigan. As I close my mouth and start breathing from my nose, I start the smell the pollutants from the near by steel mills. The sun is now almost completely set, but I can still see dark reds, pinks, blues, yellows, and purples in the sky above the water of Lake Michigan. I walk slowly across what seems to a vast desert of sand to the middle of the dune overlooking the deflation basin. I sit down for a minute and take off my socks and government issued hiking boots. I take the socks and boats and dump them over to let the sand pour out of them. I can now fell cold, slightly moistened particles adhering to my feet. All of a sudden I hear a loud honking noise, and my head turns in the direction of highway 12. I look at my watch and see that my time is long done here. I quickly put on my socks and shoes. I stand up and run the top of the dune to make sure there are no visitors left in this area of the park. I then take a giant step on to the slip slope of the dune and go tumbling down it. At the bottom, I think what a waste of time it was to empty my shoes and socks of sand, because they are now more filled then ever. The parking lot it is almost nothing but total darkness. I head to my car, and drive off. I stop shortly to lock the gates to the Lakeshore’s pride, Mount Baldy.       <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sjh5mot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.20836,41.62058]}},{"properties":{"name":"Reaction","description":"Posted by RammsteinThat title caught your eye, no? It has nothing to do with the actual post. Turn back now.\r\n\r\nI have two kinds of opinions on The Big Easy: These photos reinforced both of them. \r\n\r\nHonestly, most of these pictures didn\\'t interest me in the least. And speaking in relative sobriety, I know why. New Orleans is a city which assigns no value or weight to modesty. It\\'s a loud, in your face, sodden place to live - that\\'s just fine. But growing up as I did, I can\\'t attach anything noble or particularly worthwhile to the celebration. I\\'m in the minority on this, I know, but something about a celebration which demands being an attention-whore just didn\\'t sit quite right with me. I could give two shits about the lude behavior and drunken debauchery - I\\'m no prude, in fact we\\'ll get to that - but I personally could not stomach going to Mardi Gras unless dragged. But that\\'s only me - I\\'m probably too introverted and shy to truly appreciate its splendor. I have no doubt it\\'s a great representation of a truly unique culture - it\\'s just not one I think I could embrace. Therefore, the biggest reaction to one of the pictures was, \"Ha, guy in a muscle suit, small dick - funny.\" \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, were it a necessity for me to go and indulge, I have no doubt that I could indulge to the max. Consumption to limit, and as my BAC rises as I write this (and as I planned it to) I can easily see why it\\'s such a celebrated event. Because let\\'s face it - which is more fun: Celebrating Ascension Sunday or celebrating Mardi Gras - the festival of decadence? My vote goes towards the latter. \r\n\r\nFrom the photos I could see how attending would be akin to entering a strange and dark universe. Floating in a drunken stupor in the middle of a whirlwind; New Orleans the torrent would sweep me away, an unfettered binge before the fast of the Holy Month (week?)(season?)(my confirmation class eludes me). The backdrop of the unique architecture and the foreground of creatures and ghouls...and the errant pair of breasts - that\\'d be quite a sight for eyes under the influence. \r\n\r\nI guess the question how these photos affected me hinges upon one thing: What state (or lack there of) I see them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sfddlcm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03971,41.46371]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sactuary","description":"Posted by RbuttonDuring Wednesday night prayer service I slipped out of the lower chapel to get a drink of water and use the bathroom.  I mounted the steps and stole away from the sounds of voices and the bright light into the nave of the chapel.  The nave, which on a Sunday morning seats over two thousand people, lay dim and vacant before me.  Only a soft murmur of voices gave evidence to the jubilant singing in the Gloria Christi Chapel below.  The room was dark except for the faint glow of candlelight from the alter.  The stillness and dimness of the room seemed to accent the chaos of my everyday life.  For a moment I paused basking in the peacefulness I rarely find in other facets of my day.\n\nFrom the 4th to the 17th century in England, convicts found safety in the asylum of the church.  The asylum seeker was to confessed his sins, surrendered his weapons, and surrender to church supervision of the church or abbey in return for legal protection. Today some illegal immigrants still find sanctuary in the church and international law recognizes the right of asylum.\n\nThe idea of the church as a refuge, a place apart from the laws, regulations, and programs which governs our day to day life has always captivated me.  The church provided safety and a place for individuals with nowhere left to run in the middle ages.  However today, all too often it becomes just another way to discriminate and exclude, rather than a safe refuge in an unforgiving world.  \n\nWednesday night I found refuge in the empty chapel.

I\\'m not sure about the \\'second chance\\' part; I feel like I was never given a first. Alas. \n\nThis gala, held in the same apartment described in \\'The Cat and Her Spaces,\\' will be chaperoned, have spiked punch, a photographer, formal wear at least four years un-worn, and girls crying in the bathroom, alone. The boys will take too much time asking their dates to dance; they\\'ll shift awkwardly and compliment one another on their boutonnières.

Brown running shorts above sleek thighs, smooth calves. Eyes blue with good humor. \n\n\\'Evan!\\' he called from down the sidewalk.\n\n‘Fuck,’ I mumbled to myself, adjusting my cap. Then I called out unabashedly to the boy, beaming, perhaps a little too excited: ‘Nate! What’s up, man?’\n\nHe trotted over. We shook hands for some reason. (My relationships seem to accrue through intimate handshakes now. Why?) \n\nWe talked about the lack of kittens. In the back of my head, I kept whispering, ‘Evan, you fucking wasteboy, you little troglodyte, you ugly fool.’ But my tongue kept making the most admirable efforts to connect—talking about running, about the community, about the assignment. And—Second Chance Prom: We’ve Come This Far. \n\nNate and I expressed some trepidation, some misgivings, but he was hiding his excitement. His mouth was wide open with glee, talking about the bad music, the dancing. ‘Those girls, he said. ‘Those boys,’ I said. \n\n\\'I don\\'t have a tux.

At the time she told me, I didn’t care to take into consideration that we were treating a very heavy subject so lightly. It was right after my grandfather passed away and the headstone brochures were randomly dispersed throughout the house. I remember looking through them and finding the one that I wanted. A part of me even got excited about the idea. That’s weird. But my mom had seemingly made the decision a while back because she didn’t even have to start thumbing through the pamphlets before she told me, “I want a bench so you girls can come sit and talk to me.” I’m not sure that the conversation has come up since then. \n\nI hadn’t thought about my mom’s wishes until today so I figured, since I was here, I could reflect on her and see what some of our options are for benches. I walked right past the Garden of Memories and the Garden of Eternal Life. To me, the entire area felt vast with its rolling hills, picture perfect green, cut grass, and several paved paths for its visitors’ traveling convenience. I was walking through a park, really—a very quiet park where instead of shade coming from large trees that follow each pathway, the only shade seen on the ground comes in blocks behind the gray and white gravestones that tower from the lawn. And instead of the dozens of large trees, there are tiny berry trees that randomly accent the field of graves. For the place that I was standing in, it was actually quite beautiful and definitely peaceful. \n\nPast the gardens and “Welcome to Graceland Cemetery” sign, I met “Shelly”. It was the first bench that I came across on my way up the hill, but instead of sitting on top of it, I made myself comfortable on the grass next to it. Despite its purpose, it didn’t feel right taking advantage of a seat that’s been reserved for family and friends. Who was I to disturb her? COME, SIT AND REMEMBER ONLY THE GOOD TIMES. Before I even knew her name, I read her epitaph first. I wondered if anyone had come to think about bad times. When I looked on the other side of her bench, there she was engraved boldly, “SHELLY”…quotation marks and all. There were no more markings anywhere on the bench. Just her rules and her “name”. I took a moment to observe her neighborhood. \n\nI met the Kirkpatrick family, Mr. and Mrs. Addison, Gene Swanson who was patiently awaiting for his wife Joan to join him, and only a tiny part of the Sheaks family. BABY ROBIN GAY was waiting to meet her parents. By the bright pink flower arrangement that filled Baby Robin’s vase, Father Charles and Mother Cleta I it was clear to see had recently visited their newborn. All of these graves oversaw Highway 30 with the sun setting behind them. I thought for a minute and wondered if they had ever imagined that the chaotic sounds of semis and the fast paced life would taunt them even through eternity. There was something different about “Shelly”, though. While everyone around her faced the nonstop world past the “Thank you for coming” exit sign of the cemetery, she faced laid in the opposite direction. “Shelly” faced the sunset. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sbl6eai"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03906,41.45842]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spring Cleaning!","description":"Posted by Ddobosz2222 beech street valparaiso In 46383With spring just around the corner, that could only mean one thing, Spring-cleaning. Even though I will have to move out of my apartment in late May, I still find the urge to clean what I can. (I guess my mom with the bucket and a mop has really stuck in my head.) The problem was, everything in the apartment was relatively clean. The kitchen gets scrubbed down once a week along with the bathrooms, and the floors get vacuumed once if not twice a week. Then I walked into my closet and it looked like a tornado had stuck down and everything was taken up in a whirlwind. \r\n\r\nAs I stood inside this walk in hazard area, I saw clothes that were half hung on the hanger, piles of pants there need buttons sewed on, cleaning supplies that I had stashed away at the begging of the year and forgot about, a laundry basket filled with clothes to hid the bottle of Vodka from the RA’s. The worse thing was the smell. Now don’t get the idea that I smell bad, and don’t do my laundry. I do my laundry twice a week, and clean everything that I wear. But I don’t where everything in my closet and I believe that those items have accumulated a smell of the year. It just smelled like old clothes that had been boxed up for the long winter, and I was just about to unpack them. \r\n\r\nThere in front of me stood the most fabulous spring-cleaning project, my closet. I figured that I would eventually need to clean it out before leaving so there was no better them the present. (I had no idea what I was getting myself into.) I started with the shoes. I have six shelves built into the wall on the far end of my closet. I like to line my shoes up pair after pair so I can match them to each outfit. As of this point all of the shoes were just stacked on top of one another, and the leather ones were coated in salt. I started by putting the winter shoes and the bottom and rising them clean of the salt particles. Then I went to the summer shoes and started lining those up by color. This look me a good half and hour in the back of my closet, but I was now warmed up and ready to attack the big part.\r\n\r\nI continued to the right in the closet. Over here hung my dress clothes: dressed skirts, nice slacks, and blouses that match each of them. All of these items were hung poorly, some were hanging off the hanger, well others were inside out, and yet somehow I still managed to leave my legging and tights inside of the pants. (Can we say lazy?) So slowly I went throw each item and pulled out the tights, leggings, and hung everything that needed to be hung nicely on each hanger. Above this bar is a shelf that contains items such as: a Nike carry bag, a empty shoe box, paper plates, and paper cups. Honestly, I looked at the items and said, “I will deal with that soon enough.”\r\n\r\nThen I continued on my way to the front entrance on the closet, which contains yet another six shelves. The first shelf is my purses and extra blankets. I re-folded the blankets that were in a pile and organized my purses to be in a straight row. The next shelve was easy, just some big towels, that were already folded nicely. The next shelf was a mess of wash clothes. I stood there and folded each little different colored square into a nice neat tiny square. The next shelf was my PJ’s, needless to say this shelve was a hazard. Then after that the next two were sweat shirts that all needed re-folding and I also needed to re-wash some to get the weird looking spots out on them. \r\n\r\nThen the far left wall awaited me. I started slow by re-hanging everything and placing more items in the laundry basket. Then I got annoyed and bored my clothes just were so poorly hung, and I was finding shirts that I should have never bought in the first place. Finally, I was done. I took a vacuum to the floor and started a load of laundry. \r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, the place is getting back to the usual piles and poorly hung clothes. It’s a cycle that will never end. I will never learn from one cleaning experience to the next. Even though I am tired and swear to myself that I will never let things get out of hand, the very next day things start to go array.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sj3dqp2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.033885,41.474165]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stage...","description":"Posted by RbuttonSomeone once compared life to playing a violin solo in public and learning the instrument as you go.

Aimee is always good at capturing people with her camera.  Every one of those images tells a story.  In the pre-Katrina images, there seems to be just so much more.  There is so much variety of color, so many people, costumes, and feathers.  On the contrary, the post-Katrina pictures have less people, less simple joy and fun, but more blue.  The blue comes so greatly from the Fema tarps, and the creative ways people have chosen to mock the group.  It is amazing how weather can cause such a great change in a celebration.  In the earlier images, it is all about having fun.  There is a sense of carefree life and joy in the images, and of a no-holds-barred way of life.  As one goes along in time, the subject of the images takes a complete change.  Where once there extravagant costumes that changed a person into something other, there are now costumes that have a noticeable politicalness to them.  People are no longer dressing to become the opposite of themselves, now they are dressing up to give opinions, to criticize the government and agencies, and to show the world tragedy in a joyous manner.  It is not just a release; a way of expanding wanton energy before Lent.  Mardi Gras seems to have changed to something charged more by pain and turmoil, with a wish to truly escape, but being unable to do so.  The people cannot change the reality of Katrina, so they embrace it, and weave it in to the story of the parade.  The mood in the pictures becomes so much more somber.  It lets people know that something tragic happened here, and the people are never going to forget it.

We heard of a place called DC\\'s Country Junction in Lowell, Indiana, and late one Saturday night decided to give it a shot.  We pulled up and discovered it was an old barn turned into a country line dancing extravaganza.  When we walked into the doors it felt as if we stepped into the South.  Most people had on cowboy boots, tight jeans, and a few even went as far as a cowboy hat and flannel button-up.  There was an indoor bbq pit and picnic tables where people took a break from the rowdy dancing to sip a cold drink or suck on the ice that filled most of the plastic cup.  On stage there were old men with round bellies, long beards and toothy grins playing away on there guitars and drums.  We were in the South.

Even though she knew how much respect I had for our campus\\' Greek life, she thought I\\'d be a discerning date, someone that would keep his eye on her and other people, and report back with some integrity on the state of the human scenes at the little gala. Also, I wouldn\\'t try to have sex with her at the end of the night, which, it seems, a lot of people get too anxious about. \n\nThe dance wasn\\'t very fun. All the guys were too drunk to talk to, and if they weren\\'t drunk they acted drunk. The cleaning staff for Casa del Roma, the venue for this affair, must dread the clean-up after opening their doors for the kids in our University because all we do is puke in their bathrooms, in the stalls, in the urinals, and fill their wastebaskets up with shit when the toilets get taken over by people passed out.\n\nIt\\'s an impressive space—faux-glamorous, faux-Italian—with columns and a balcony area, and a dark cherry hardwood dancing floor, then vine-trellises, and cut-glass chandeliers. Jake Gatsby might cut-loose here. But it isn\\'t a complete space. Usually, whoever is on the decorating committee for these events, they string up white Christmas lights, and billowing swaths of maroon fabric, because nothing quite catches your eye in the big rooms. All atmosphere, no ambiance; all expectation, no catalyst. And there is never enough privacy. To have an intimate moment, a grope or two, or get in fight, you have to take it to the parking lot.

It\\'s implacable, uncanny, that a bus full of sorority sisters and their fraternity boyfriends, once peaceful, once so diligent at compromise and placation, air months-long grievances and secrets out on the dance floor. Two years ago, it was the vague hostility of rival lovers blooming through amaretto sours. Then someone dropped their champagne flute on the dance floor, and those girls who had relieved themselves of too-tight pumps, they got glass in their feet.\n\nSuch insanity—what triviality, arcane abuse, we will do one another when a transient location (that is, where you will only stay for a few hours) is filled with desperate intentions. Last night, after promising myself to never attend these ridiculous farces, I was feeling a lot more apologetic about my criticisms. So I said yes.\n\nAnd it ended in tears again.

Back home in Illinois my special spot is a big oak tree in my back yard. Not having that oak tree here, is like not having that shoulder to cry on. I needed to find a place that would re-assure me as much as my oak tree did at home. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until my sophomore year that I was able to finally find my scared place. Danny and I love to take walks whenever it is possible, basically meaning that the weather will cooperate. Usually, we will just get into the car and drive to the dunes and find a new trail we haven’t walked to journey to the top of yet another dune. But this late fall Saturday afternoon we looked up on the internet a different area that we could go hiking in. We found Taltree Arboretum &amp; Gardens. We spent the whole afternoon there, just the two of us and the garden, not a single soul walked around us. \r\n\r\nThe next week at school had been a tough one, lots of work and drama with friends. I needed my oak tree and its calming voice to relax me. Unfortunately, that was all the way back in Illinois. I found myself picking up my car keys and going outside to my car and driving back to the gardens. Again I was alone no one else there expect of myself and the wind. I grabbed my blue notebook out of my car and walked down to a pavilion that was just being built. There was a wooden picnic table set up on the inside next to a small man made stream. I sat down on the table and opened up my notebook. \r\n\r\nThe wind blew silently up my shirt back, hugging me and comforting me while I sat and pondered my week. The wood under me held me still and re-assured me that it was going to allow me to sit for as long as I needed. The trees that were over the top of pavilion helped shade the sun out of my eyes. And the wind that blew across the man made stream was talking to me and calming me down, just like the oak tree at home. \r\n\r\nI opened my notebook and began to write a serious of questions that were asking myself the truth about what was going on. How well did I study for that chemistry test? Why did I really go and tell Keith about Susie? Why did I tell my mother that I was upset with her for not coming this past weekend like she said she would? I wrote questions and then filled in the answers to each. Nature spoke to me and helped me find the real answer to each of them. It was comforting to know that someone was there that cared and wanted to help.\r\n\r\nI knew that I could relay on this place when I needed to come again and regroup. I go to this place every time I need my own time to self reflect. I go back to that same wooden picnic table, which now has character from all the weather changes, and sit there and write questions and allow the stream to help me answer them. It is all honesty and reflectance on what happened. Every time I go to leave I come out with a smile on my face and I am calm and ready to attach the drama at hand, or I am ready to forgive and forget.

Spring was trying her damndest, and on the lawn of the fortess-like court house, daffodills and tulips were making their way into the warming light.\n\nAnd - there is always that discreet possibility of encountering the gaze of someone sipping in a coffee shop - and holding that gaze. And in that gaze imagining the sex these perfect strangers could have over and over, utterly changing their lives, climaxing in shrieks of glass-shattering frequencies. That is, making noise enough to break all that smokey carmely dreamy glass between the interior and exterior conspirators.\n\nI\\'m uncertain, absolutely, why the pet shop doesn\\'t stock kittens.

Long bouts of not having a cat--probably since I was in Elementary School is the last time I really owned one, or had one to feed. At the apartment lives Cosette, who is fat and depressed and gets excited only when she can eat. She coughs up enormous, pubicly torrid hairballs and has fine dandruff that sticks under my fingernails if I scratch her back too long. I jokingly obliged her, Be My Valentine? but I fazed the joke out a week before the 14th, because I was broke. And really, what can a filthy cat give back? \n\nI read cats can\\'t sublimate pleasure. After a few minutes of feeling well-kept with strokes and comfort, they get confused and start hissing. Even a purring cat will eventually forget it was having a high time, unless it falls asleep. This threshold probably has a name and can be teased into a broader application.\n\nCosette\\'s apartment sometimes has parties. I attended a Masquarade there last Friday. Felt like a real animal, with a crow mask so huge it hurt the bridge of my nose, and blighted one eye\\'s sight. \n\n\\'Oh my God, that\\'s fantastic! Can you see in that thing?\\'\n\n\\'No.\\'\n\nReaching for salsa and chips was a chore, I had no depth perception for the night. Accidentally elbowed couples standing in doorways, waved at strangers, eventually collapsed on a chair in the living room and stared beakishly at unknowers, still feeling peckish, too proud to waver the mask. I Sipped on Red Bull to give me wings. \n\nCosette hid in Tracy\\'s room under the bed. I knew exactly where she was, where she always is, and surprised myself by not creeping down to her to scare her whiskers off.\n\nWhat a terrific inversion. An animal frightened by humans dressed like animals, and hiding under the bed. When I was younger, I mentally topated where I would hide if burglars entered my home in the night. Emphatically! Only under the bed! Behind boxes of old seashells and used-up calendars, and bundles of birthday cards. Old shoes. Tender dust bunnies!\n\n\\'Cosette?\\'\n\n...\n\n\\'I\\'m sorry you\\'re so ascared.

Once one hit and melted with countless others, my gaze turned skyward and I followed another on its dead-end journey. Nastasha was driving with her eyes focused on the road, intent on arriving back to my dorm room. We had been in a wreck a few weeks before that had totalled her previous car, something I still blame on the dampness of the roads that night.\n\nAngels are falling...\n\nI used to love snow, and I still do when I\\'m fairly close to my home in Terre Haute. But something about the way snow interacts with the landscape up here gives me an uneasy feeling. The flakes fall so fast with the wind, and the descent gives me the strangest feeling of vertigo when the backdrop are the flat fields, emptied of all vegetation by the cold of winter. At my home, there are lots of evergreens that catch the wind, and the flakes fall ever so slowly. They are angels to me that grace the ground with their presence. In my mind, the sing as they fall into each others\\' arms on the cold ground: beauty in the dead of winter.\n\nAs we drove, the angels were screaming in mortal despair. They smashed into the ground and were promptly run over by passing automobiles. Visions of jumpers on September 11th passed through my head. I tried to change the channels upstairs, but the same replays over and over again.\n\nBlack ice was becoming more and more visible on the road. Red and blue flashing lights were scattered between Merrillville and Valparaiso while police officers helped those who had run off the road. Some music was playing, but neither my girlfriend or I were paying attention. We moved slowly, rarely over 25 mph, towards VU.

More often than not, someone was coming. \n\nI\\'ve never known what it was to have neighbors until now. Today, I\\'m basking in my own luck of living in Alumni Hall surrounded by the high pitched screams of the new and ecstatic sorority girls, the blasting \"gettin\\' ready to go out for the night\" music, the football and basketball players right above me playing football and basketball RIGHT ABOVE ME, and of course, the sweet sweet scent of Ramen and Mac &amp; Cheese. A dream come true...if you like that sort of thing. When I was younger I lived too far away to be able to ride my bike to meet any of my friends. Now, I place one foot out the door and I\\'m surrounded by doors covered from top to bottom and side to side with brightly colored wrapping paper always cleverly themed to the time of year. If I take about two steps out of my door more often than not I find myself face to face with my best friends. A sincere dream come true. \n\nIt\\'s a common experience, no? Life in the dorms.

And where we\\'ll look back at and scratch our heads during an attempt to figure out how we even survived it once we\\'re living nowhere near here. But we\\'ll laugh at how observant we had no choice to learn to be. The third floor east always smelled of food. A combined mixture of everything you could imagine which amounted to the gagging scent of garbage. The west side smelled good. Sweet perfumes. We\\'d always walk out the west side door. During the week, the fourth floor smelled like a boys locker room and as soon as you\\'d step through the door, it\\'d feel like one too. The air thick and jockish. But on the weekends we\\'d walk through just to get a wiff of their cologne. The fifth floor was its own environment. Clean, fresh, quiet. Intensive study. And the rest of the building? Well, we never ventured to the second floor because we liked jocks better. And the first floor was used as either our exit or the entrance of our freshman 15...Jimmy Johns, Dominos, what have you. \n\nThis is our beginning. These great halls will hold some of our fondest memories, yet our biggest complaints. And could it ever really get any better than that?

Or is there no such thing as ghost?  Many places on campus are reputed to be haunted: the basement of Alumni and Brandt, to name a few.  One tha few know about, but that many would not be surprised at is the haunting of the Arts and Psychology Building, or the Art &amp; Psycho building.  This place is a somewhat twisted building, designed and built by engineering students in the fifties, it houses offices for the two majors, as well as the studios and the rat lab.  Rooms and doors exist everywhere, and on the art side, some of the rooms are cavernous.  Others just highly exposed.  \n  At night, the building is an unnerving place.  Anyone can come from anywhere.  When there alone, the feeling of being watched pervades every mind.  Perhaps overly imaginative brains with more than a hint of paranoia are at work, or maybe there is something more...\n  Some claim to have seen something there.  One profesor, Michele Corazzo, says that there is a ghost in the building, and has actually seen it on occassion.  THe ghost, named George, is a friendly ghost, but a ghost the same.  His rumored existence makes the building all that more spooky.  There are some places out there that just hold a sense of the paranormal, and make many wonder.

While taking the quiz everyone is concentrating really hard, just to do well on a quiz that is worth four points.  I have never seen the reason to stress about the quizzes, because they do not affect your grade at all.  Then when everyone is done, people start talking to the people within there table, no matter who is done.  No one has any respect for anyone else.  Then, the professor comes back and starts talking.  No one is paying attention.  In fact, a few people even fall asleep!  Then, the class is done, and now it is time to work on the problem set problems that are due in a week.  You have to start these problems early because they each take at least one hour to do, no matter what.  When ever anyone asks me what I am working on and I say Elementary Math, they look at me like I am crazy.  “That can’t be hard, it’s for elementary students,” they say.

If alone, I would run quickly, hop into my car, and turn on the heat in my seats.  But I am seldom alone anymore.  I have two cats, two kids, and a husband.  There is always someone to do something for or someone to go somewhere with.  Today is no exception.  My four year old daughter leads us on a meandering tour that is certainly not the quickest or most efficient way to the warmth of the vehicle. \r\n“Did you eat chicken soup when you were my age?”  This is a rhetorical question, I know.  “I am the only one my age that eats chicken soup and the only one my age allowed at this restaurant.  Next time I will get the Broccoli Cheese because no one my age eats that either.”  “I can’t wait until I’m seven.”  “Mommy, how many days until my birthday?” “ I want Daddy to make me a wedding cake.  A big, big cake that is stacked really high and can feed 427 people!”  She has taken a breath to marvel at the idea of a cake that feeds 427 people.  Her internal musing gives me a chance to reply, “Oh that would be some birthday cake.” She talks from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to bed.  Most of the time she falls asleep mid-sentence and even on occasion talks in her sleep.  If the climate were not so harsh I would enjoy the slow pace she insists on taking to the car; I would soak in her monologue and marvel at her spirit—creative and unafraid.  But today, I feel a needling sensation in my finger tips, on the end of my nose and on the rims of my ears.  I want to grab her or pull her along a quick and clear path, even though she has told me she doesn’t like it when I make her “go fast.”  I feel guilty for my impatience, but a stronger more primal impatience for the elements.\r\nWhen I tune in to her ramblings again she is still talking about her birthday.  She wants a dog, no seven dogs.  “I know!” she yells.  She stops and turns to face me.  Her index finger is still pointed in the air to indicate she has a good idea.  She is wearing a cheetah print faux-fur coat—a fleece and polyester blend that is more a statement of personal style than protection from the weather.  The same could be said for her boots—silver cowboy-style made of a flimsy leather-blend.  She also wears a navy skirt and tights with a pink and purple flower print.  Her ears are pierced, but now that she has learned to change them out she seldom chooses for the right ear to match the left.  Today she wears a guitar in one and a red ball in the other.  She is constantly garbed in an odd menagerie of things that can only be described as “Adrienne.”  I can’t help but recall last year at this time when she only wore bathing suits.  I had to bribe her with books and candy to convince her to wear warmer clothes.  She finally agreed but manipulated the agreement to suit her fetish by wearing her bathing suit underneath it all.  “She is such a pistol,” everyone would say. Still a pistol, I think to myself. \r\n“Maybe when I’m seven or nine or twenty-one I could go to China for my birthday and have my big cake there.” The snow swirls up around her while the wind whips her dirty blond hair around her face.  She is totally unaffected by it all and all I can say is “Aren’t you freezing?” “Yes,” she replies flatly, but stays planted and narrows her eyes at me under her mask of hair. Knowing I have to answer or suffer the consequences of frostbite I say, “We will think about China when you are older.”  “Thank you, Mommy.  Oh look, here’s our car.  Hurry and unlock the doors I can’t be out in this hideous weather another minute!”\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2si93gms"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.11197,41.49469]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Porch","description":"Posted by MgiguereJust on the corner of Chicago St. and Morgan Blvd. resides my current home.  While indoors it is nice and cozy with fire places to keep me warm and plenty of couches to lounge about on, it can get crowded with nine other roommates to share it with.  That is why my favorite spot to sit at is the outside porch that over looks the busy street.\n\tIt’s not the prettiest porch in town; cigarette butts lie about the concrete floor and a disassembled desk is piled up in the corner.  The sofa under the massive window – the shades always hiding what goes on inside – is a wreck, holding together only by its seams. Even the porch swing has seen better days.\n\tFor all of this though, it is a great place to just lounge about.  The sun hits the area perfectly in the afternoon, bathing up the entire sofa in warm rays of sunshine, perfect for the cold days of winter.  In the fall the popcorn festival parade marches by with the height being just right to see about above the head of crowd.  And while the swing is too old for anyone over 250 pounds, I find no problem in sitting on it or having any fear of it breaking on me.\n\tThere are many other porches on the boulevard, some sweep out in massive arcs and have towering columns that look to be from the Roman era.

Living in these, students can quickly meet people, make new friends, and just hone social skills.  These are good, but there are problems.  The main problems are the people who are not your friends.  Not necessarily enemie, but now friends.  Just all the other people whom you are forced to live with.  Among this group, are those who never seem to realize that they have to live with other people.  They are the ones who reak havoc, make the most noise, and create the most fines for everyone who lives around them.  Everyone deals with them, but never entirely knows who they are.  Right now, in the one dorm, there are several people on the third floor who create all kinds of trouble.  They vandalized the lounge, set off all the fire extinguishers several times, pour water into someone\\'s room, and also steal all the shower curtains from the comunal problems.

I wonder if the woodland creatures mourn the loss of fields and other wooded areas of if they feel confined by their reduced living space.  The raccoons have adapted.  I hear their low growls near the  sandbox under the window as they scavenge for my four-year-old daughter’s leftovers—a half-eaten granola bar or the sticky remains of a forgotten melted Popsicle.  The odoriferous defenses of a skunk drift through the screen and into my room.  The skunks anger so easily, I think.  Or maybe after a long winter of inactivity they blast their stink to ensure their protection mechanism is working properly.  Sometimes the coyotes run through howling and growling like a pack of frenzied followers of Dionysus, shouting their pleasures.  Their parade is gone as quickly as they appear—off to who knows where.  Spring nights bring the swampy area alive.  Listening to Mother Nature’s lullaby, my lids get heavy and my body sinks further into the mattress.  In the distance, a passing train whistles and I feel sleep finally coming.  \r\n\r\nA new sound rapidly invades the tranquility of the wetland.  Shortly, I recognize the gurgling engine and the whirling rotor blades as the sound of a helicopter.  Within seconds it is so loud and so close it feels as if it barely skims the treetops.  Fully awake now, I think of war.  I think of the images I see on TV of Iraq.  Then I think of Vietnam and the descriptions I have read of the MedEvac helicopters that landed in the rice patties or hovered in the clearings just beyond the burned villages or the dense jungles; taking away the dead or wounded, yet leaving the ones with wounded minds behind.  \r\n\r\nLike the wolves, the helicopter clears my house as quickly as it appeared.  The wetland sits silent.  I’m not sure if the animals know the chopper will fly back over us in a matter of minutes or if they have learned to be overly cautious since the housing boom.  Whatever the reason, there is stillness and an odd feeling of nothingness beyond my window.  When the helicopter returns it occurs to me that this is the Lifeline—the helicopter that transports the critically injured from our local hospital (the one where my children were born) to a more sophisticated and medically advanced facility in the city. \r\n\r\nI lie stiff on top of the sheets, prickly with anxiety.  I worry that the hospital I trusted to bring my children into the world might not be equipped to help if ever I, or God forbid, my husband or children are faced with something “serious.”  I feel the weight of responsibility to being a mother; the responsibility to explain illness, tragedy, and war.  I am the one who will tell them, “Sometimes people don’t get better.”  Maybe the mothers in the wetland feel the same trepidation I do when the helicopter roars overhead.  Maybe they suck in their breath, and like me, hope that despite the Lifeline’s reminder that life is delicate and vulnerable, we won’t have to let our children know just yet.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sb30w65"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.11609,41.49418]}},{"properties":{"name":"The old man","description":"Posted by MgiguereThe first week of freshman year is always a pain to get through.  You never know where you are when you need to go somewhere, and you can never find your way back once you get going.  The first week in Valpo I had a similar experience traveling the darken paths and roads in an attempt to find the sole Buffalo Wild Wings in town.\n\nI realize now that this all could have been solved by using a map search online, but when you’re in a group of students with BWW dollars and hunger cravings for some spicy wings it’s hard to use common sense.  At any rate, a group of use decided to take a shot at walking to downtown Valpo.  I though it would be a good idea to head down towards old campus and work our ways from there.\n\nThe place was booming with frat activity, the houses were lit with lights and shaking at the foundations from the music and cheers from all around the neighborhood.  It was tempting to check out the scene but each of us knew we were on a mission to find the where the buffalo roams.  Before long we had reached the train tracks, an area where the sounds of the parties died down to only muffled sounds in the background.  Very few houses were on the road and little light could be found to make our path.  Still we marched forward.\n\nJust ahead saw one house with a small porch and a single light illuminating the yard.  A voice then yelled out to us as we passed. “You boys better not be causing trouble,” it said.  I turned around to see where it came from.  Over on the porch, just under the light, sat a man in a rocking chair.  I couldn’t make out more than the long whiskers on his face telling me he was quite old.  We didn’t say anything to him as we passed by.  We just kept walking straight and faster towards the lights in the distance that we hoped were a signal for downtown.\n\nI can’t understand why I recall that old man on the porch.  Even to this day I have never seen him after that night.  Were we that freaked out by some old man on his porch?  To this day I can’t seem to understand why I am so scared of the stereotype.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2skbbp88"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0603,41.46466]}},{"properties":{"name":"The other side of town","description":"Posted by MgiguereValpo is divided in two parts.  On one end there is the old town where many of the banks and family owned stores reside.  This is also where many of the residents of the town live in standard gridlock systems of roads, many one way streets, and two floor houses.  Further down the main roads of Lincoln Way and Morgan Blvd is a separate business district, one encompassing all the needs of the residents of supplies and food.   Aside when the Popcorn Day Parade comes around, there is very little activity compared to the other side of Valpo.\n\nThe other side to Valpo is almost the complete opposite.  What were once open corn fields and farm land in the 70’s is now a complex of mini malls and plazas littering the zone between interstates 2, 30, and 49.  And what college community wouldn’t enjoy the comfort of a Wal-Mart, Target, or Menards?  It seems to start early on in the student’s college career.  The first day in Valpo is usually spent in the east end of the town at the local Target, or a little further south at the Super Wal-Mart (at some point the executive branch of Wal-Mart/Sam’s Club felt it was the best time to close the old one and build it better right next door).  Once the first day of supply shopping is over, the new side of town has you hooked right thereafter.  It is the familiar aspect of the stores I think that draws us in, a place that most Americans visit freely from day to day.  There is no time or need to explore such places like downtown Valpo when uptown lays the EB Games and Pizza Hut we crave for most of the semester.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sagair0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.02923,41.46627]}},{"properties":{"name":"The unknown","description":"Posted by DdoboszPale, alone, he lays in the bed at Porter Memorial Hospital.

I go by his side, and kneel down by the stiff bed that is covered in sandpaper like sheets. I take hold of his cold, shacking hand, he still smiles at me trying to re-assure me that everything is going to be the same. I grip his hand tighter and tighter and look up at the gray/blue ceiling, praying to God that nothing will take this wonderful creature away from me. He lets go, and I walk over the single window in the room and open the gay straw like curtains. “Its cold in here,” I say, “Do you think there is a draft?” The nurse comes in carrying videos that say, “Coping with diabetes type one.” She lays them on top of the VCR that sits under the black 20’’ TV. I put my hand over my month trying to show him that I am not afraid, our lives will now be completely changed, and that life will now take us down a different path. I look over at him and see the heart monitor hook up to him, and other machines and needles that are stuck in and around him. The room is bare and cold with two single old 1960 looking chairs. He hits a remote found at the side of his of bed that allows him to sit up. “I think I might want to go to the bathroom.” He slowly stands up and carries the sugar water machines with him into a cold blue tiles bathroom, with a white porcelain toilet and a handicapped shower. He closed the heavy, dark wood, maple door for a few minutes before returning to his position in bed. The main door to the room is open, and as I sit in the olive green chair, I see busy nurses running past yelling things like, “106 in room A.” or “Dr. Young is RIGHT NOW.” The love of my life sits in an unknown bed, pale, shacking, and trying to understand what’s going on. He doesn’t want to show fear to me, and I don’t to him. The hospital speaks both of fear and emotions for the both of us. “They say in a couple of months I can stop the injections and go on the pump,” he says. Good news, I guess, something that is hardly heard in these hallow, cold, spooky walls. “When are you coming home,” I say. “Don’t know, I guess this has to be home for a few more days. They have to get my sugar levels down from 420 to 120,” he states.

When those of us who went to Our Lady of Grace in Highland first hit the public schools, I was introduced to her through a mutual friend.  She was truly \"otherworldly\"--as in not of my world, although I guess you could say we hung out in common circles.  \r\n\r\nI called her one night out of the blue...no plan, nothing to say.  We talked some that night, and that night turned into frequently...which turned daily.  We were friends.  I cared about her.   \r\n\r\nIn my youth, I carried around odd ideas of what relationships were like and how they were supposed to be carried out.  Attraction was coupled in my mind with intimacy--physically--but emotional intimacy was attached to nothing as I hadn\\'t felt it yet.  Somehow, I felt like being emotionally intimate should be regarded as sacred and physical intimacy was somehow \"degrading\" to emotional love.  I know it sounds crazy, but I never really discussed these things with people.  What this does, or did--was make it impossible to feel \"love\" as I felt for her and still attempt an intimate relationship.  To have both was to defile the other.  If this makes no sense to you as a reader...you are sane, because basically you can\\'t have sex and love together.  I was 15 or 16...\r\n\r\nBut I was learning.  I\\'d never felt \"love.\"  I\\'d never been in love.  I was confused.  I also trusted her completely, which made things begin to take shape in my muddled mind.  Yes, I can trust...yes, she can trust me...this is healthy...this is what it\\'s all about...I had it, and of course, I\\'m telling this story because I lost it.\r\n\r\nHow it happened is based on place oddly enough.

I rode up Grace Street heading towards Ben’s on Garfield, and I happened to pass by Tim Ispas’.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young buck, Ispas’ was famous for the two Chevelles Timmy’s brother kept out front all summer.  They must’ve been late-sixties to mid-seventies Chevys.  They were both beautiful.  One was red and the other yellow.  I passed them every day on my way to Damon’s, and on the way to Pettit Park with him on the way back.  We both loved those cars.\r\n\r\nTim was 12 when I was 9 (almost 10).  I was moved from the Little League “minors” to “majors” a little before my ninth birthday.  I was a little too young, and a little too small—but they couldn’t keep me where my age warranted because I didn’t fit there either.  Anyway, I didn’t know the older kids.  Tim was the best player on our team—and because he “took me under his wing” so to speak—I was almost instantly accepted.  Tim was a good guy.\r\n\r\nAs always, the story I have has filtered through the Highland rumor mill, so I can’t be sure I have the story straight.  It’s probably safe to say that Tim was involved in a hunting accident.  The story is that Tim was shot on purpose by someone over property or trespassing while hunting.  I heard he was on a duck boat and drifted somewhere where someone thought he shouldn’t have been.  I don’t know for sure.  All I know is that he’s in a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nI went by quickly, but I can surmise from seeing him in the driveway that he can’t use his arms and legs.  He was in the middle of the driveway facing the garage door with his back to the street.\r\n\r\nI rode out to Kane Field at Homestead Park before I went to Benny’s to check something.  I rode to the side of the building behind home plate where the signs are with the names of everyone that won state championships.  In 1988, my team won.  My name is right there in alphabetical order after Ozelie, Mark.  In 1986, as I suspected, there was the name Tim Ispas.  \r\n\r\nI’ll bet, judging from my own experience, that winning that title seemed real important to Tim in ’86.  Now—I’m not so sure it matters to him at all.  I wonder if he even follows the game anymore.  I wonder what kind of things Tim considers important now.  But I’ll never know, because the guilt hits me so bad every time I see him that I can’t bring myself to tell him who I am.   \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2siici08"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.48138,41.58463]}},{"properties":{"name":"To the Dunes once more...","description":"Posted by MgiguereI was told by my mom how the dunes were just like the ocean and that everyone should go and experience them.

There were many nights like those in the 80’s; nights where bonfires would cut through the darkness and blaze into the early morning.  It’s a shame that today the practice of beach partying is a lost due many forces beyond what the common man can do (state restrictions is at the top of the list).\n\nIn a lot of ways the Great Lakes are familiar to those who have gone to the ocean, minus the arousing sent of salt air from the sea.  Chad said that to him the lake was kind of like a bathtub, one where you knew what was on the other side.  To him it takes away the mystery of what can be out there half way across the world.

I decided that I just wanted to stay within the square because if I went outside of it, my opinion would be too widespread and go off on too many tangents. The first thing I noticed walking out of the South Bend Chocolate Café, which is on the east part of the square, with a nice little setting, that all four traffic lights around the square are black. Only one is blinking on the southeastern part of the square between the Old Jail Museum and the police station. Also, hanging next to the traffic lights are green road signs that say Franklin, Washington, Indiana, and Lincolnway. In the downtown square, there is a definite direction pattern in which all drivers including tourists would have to follow. The signs are usually posted between the two traffic lights or on the traffic light post, so travelers be aware of your direction. \nWith the courthouse planted in the middle of the square, it definitely fits in with the architecture of the town. Most of the windows on the courthouse and even capturing within the whole town are either rectangular shaped or have the rectangular with the circular top. I could definitely see these window shapes in other places around the square including people’s apartments on top of the stores which range from Jano Bike Shop to Old Style Inn for families to sit down and enjoy meals together or where people can buy special valuables by peeking into the windows of Martin Binder Jewelers. All of the stores mainly on the north part of the square have a different variety of color and style starting with a dark green sign for Engstrom Jewelers to the hot pink with Bangel’s Accessories, which is a clothing store for women. \nThe courthouse is planted directly in the middle of the square with some distinct features surrounding it. The first thing that stands out to me is the stone that makes up the foundation of the building. Above the main entrance, there are pretty bulky pillars, which kind of reminded me of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. Also, in the front of the building I see three flags (one is USA, one is Indiana, the other one is a black POW Mania). There is rectangular parking around the courthouse and have benches near the sidewalks incase people need to sit down and take a break. Two benches that stood out to me are in a swivel shape with different artistic designs. The one has blocks of different colors like yellow, pink and blue and has pictures of cell phones and CD’s. The other bench has a light blue background that illustrates different places and events that go on in town, it even has the chapel tower at Valparaiso University (which coincidence is where I go to school) also it has the ruby slippers connected with the Wizard of Oz Festival and also popcorn kernels with the Popcorn Festival, both held every September. Benches like these give a unique look to downtown Valparaiso.  you’re coming out of any entrance of the courthouse, people can find walkways to lead you to all four corners of the square. \nThere are also lamp posts that exuberate some light on the night downtown scene. There are three different clocks that I noticed so I think from all corners of the square everybody can be updated on the time. Hopefully this makes people be attracted to come to downtown Valparaiso and see the interesting architecture and scenery.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sfsnlu4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.06045,41.46757]}},{"properties":{"name":"Unsacred Alone","description":"Posted by Ellen8788I’m not sure if I believe in sacredness.

I stood in the loft, crammed into the front row bench, stifled in my maroon University Singers robe, clasped tight around the neck, over a very furry black blouse (my cat had slept on my laundry the last time I’d washed it) a pair of backwards dress pants (I hadn’t figured out yet that the goes in back) and open-toe heels (it was 15 degrees outside).  I took the shoes off, hoping the ground might feel holier.  It didn’t.  It was 11 pm.  I was singing something Latin.  I forced my eyes open to avoid falling asleep standing up, with my mouth open, forming a round Latin vowel.  I saw 300 people below me, through my blurred, dried up contact lenses.  They were all feeling sacred.  Some of them were watching me.  I had to go down there.  I tripped down the spiral stars, keeping my eyes on the robe ahead of me, matching its pace.  When I got to the bottom of the stairs, something handed me a candle, and something else lit it.  I held it away from my face in fear, until lighting up the long hair in front of me seemed scarier.  I was in no condition to be handling an open flame—even if it was a holy candle.  The robes around me began moving, two by two, down the chapel aisle, behind a cross.  A sacred procession.  I moved my feet, I had to join.  Because last night, during rehearsal, Pastor Cunningham had said, “DON’T screw up.  And if you do screw up, make it look like you didn’t.”  I moved.  I found a robe to my left whose feet moved when mine did.  I didn’t screw up.  I even sang.  Gloh…oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…ria.  A sacred hymn.  300 people with candles leaned into the procession I didn’t screw up and sang at me, sacredly.  I kept moving, deeper down, through more robes, down more stairs, into the dark belly of the chapel, where I closed my eyes, blew out my candle and sank into the unsacred alone.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s99fbgp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.96777,41.4736]}},{"properties":{"name":"Up Close and Personal","description":"Posted by Laura886When I walk the halls of the Strimbu Gallery, it is as if I am walking down Bourbon St. in New Orleans.  The people I pass are loud and up in my personal space; so close that if I don’t watch where I’m walking glitter, feathers, and fuchsia lip stick may be smeared and clinging to my clothing.  Each frame’s captive I pass looks at me with vigor and vitality, as if teasing and tempting me to laugh or blush.  With the up close and personal view that Professor Tomasek takes I can almost hear their hearty laugher and the faint scent of alcohol that comes along with it.\r\n\tMixed in with these mischievous characters are those who are out to make a different kind of statement.  This is the first Mardi Gras after Hurricane Katrina hit.  Many people become walking billboards that object to the seeming lack of aid or urgency in restoring New Orleans, their home.  Some costumes even display moldy cockroach infested refrigerator doors.\r\n\tThen there are those who walk down the street in normal clothing or even a lack of clothing as their attire, as if just being there is all the effort they can afford.  As we heard from Sheryl St. Germain, many New Orleanians just wanted to keep the festival alive and to show it was of importance of them to have something remain constant in the city.  Being on the streets with others would give them a sense of togetherness.\r\n\tThis togetherness was shown in the smiling face of a couple dressed up as Pop-eye and Mary-Jane.  I imagine them as an old couple who has always known New Orleans as home.  They dress up every year. It is a time to relax, be merry and in the moment just like old times; just like before Katrina hit.  I wonder what happened to their home.  I’m glad the picture has captured their light hopeful spirits.\r\n\tFrom drag queens to objectors, a collaborating couple to those who just were, these pictures gave us a glimpse into it all.  We traveled through many different feelings of those who still wanted New Orleans culture to hold on, to still be celebrated.

I doubt that would be necessary in a town like Valparaiso, Valpo for short…or Valpa to Johnson from Von Tobel Lumber in Schererville, Indiana.\r\n\r\nIn Valpo, they probably have certain laws that govern how you can renovate the buildings in the “downtown square.”  Even if you were to own a building outright, you’d likely be forced to adhere to certain codes to make sure the buildings retain a certain amount of their original appearance.  Hell, even the houses near the square probably have acertain historical significance.  I’ll bet they do.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I mention it…if you live in any number of subdivided areas around the town, you may be asked not to put up a chain-link fence.  You may not be allowed to put up a TV antennae, you may be told what type of dog you can have, and where he might do HIS business.  Anyway…\r\n\r\nWhat you see on the square is the same as the square in Crown Point, Indiana—about 15 miles or so from here.  It’s the same as a square in southern Indiana, where I went with my friend Steve Helm to recruit some players for his team at Ancilla College in Donaldson, Indiana.  He pulled over to ask a couple with two children where Larry Bird used to live, and they completely ignored him.  Well, they looked at him, but they didn’t answer.  Wonder what that was all about—huh.  Anyway, it’s nice, but it’s not special.  I’ve seen two just like it in this state, and I don’t get out much.\r\n\r\nFor a small town, Valpo is large, but it’s still a small town.  I should know.  I’m a small town guy.  I’ve always lived in small towns.  The difference, politically, is that you can look the guy that’s doing what he’s doing to you in the eye while you grill a brat—that’s it really.  Actually, that distance in the throng is probably the only thing that makes the city a better place.  The anonymity.  Here in Valpo…I’ll bet everyone knows a little something about everyone.\r\n\r\nAnd the square…well, I think it’s like a Hollywood movie set.  Charming on the outside, but just a shell in a way—not real, like when you’re hiking somewhere and you can hear a train in the distance, and it snaps you back into the reality that you’re cornered.  You’re cornered  by progress—or something calling itself civilization.  Nothing against Valpo.  I like Valpo as much as the next guy, but Mayberry, North Carolina doesn’t exist either—as much as we’d all like to try and recreate it’s success.\r\n\r\nBut if you asked Johnson—he’d maybe tell you something else.  He came here years ago from Iraq.  I’m talking years ago too.  He calls it Valpa.  Valpa’s probably a very different place from the Valpo I write about. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s8qkagb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05292,41.47875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valparaiso","description":"Posted by RbuttonValparaiso seems to draw its importance from loose associations with iconic names, places, and people.

Even though the weather is often gloomy, Valparaiso’s streets still buzzed with business professionals and students from the near by Valparaiso University campus. They have fast paces walks as they hurry into the various local coffee stands or street Café’s. \n\nAs the wind blows down the back of your windbreaker, you stop at a cross walk looking for a button that will signal the walker sign. Where is that button? They are artistically, hidden on the top of a freestanding black post. \n\nCrossing the street one will often receive wafts of smells coming from one of the diverse restaurants in town. Pizza of pizza arise from Papa John’s or Tony’s eatery, smells of grease come from China House or Around the Clock, or the smell of a grilled hamburger from Buffalo Wild Wings, and the best smells come from the coffee Café’s that smell warm drinks and serve chocolate goodies. \n\nFood smells are not the only smell one gets while walking though the town. While walking down one of the alleys in Valparaiso one can smell garbage, or bits of sawdust coming from the new construction. Not everything in the downtown is new construction, but rather most of it is old, architecture. The main focus of the downtown is the City hall, and while walking past it ones nose will pick on in hints of ancient buildings. \n\nThe corners of downtown are covered with banks or jewelry stores. So if you need an ATM then there is nothing to fear because Valparaiso has plenty of them. Down the side streets of the main town are different clothing stores. Everything type of cloths for everyone is covered in the downtown: children’s, men’s, and women’s. \n\nThe neatest thing part of the downtown is a mural that was created on the side of a store called LifeStyles. If you were to just come into town and not know a thing about it, the mural would explain everything that the town has to offer. There are actually a bunch of hidden secrets about the town written into this artwork that make it apart of Valparaiso history. For example, there is one sign that reads: “Today’s special is a small coffee and a bagel for 7.95. Don’t let the comforts of the town fool you, because it is expensive. The people are all smiling and friendly while the Valparaiso Police are chasing after an escapee from the near by jail. Valparaiso Police are on the game at all times looking for criminals of all offenses. The near by jailhouse is an part of Valparaiso long history. The jail house is open for tours five days a week, and admission is free. \n\nIf you become tried while walking the streets of the square, then don’t fear because there is a wide verity of benches to take a rest on. Some of them are the simple, plain black, wired benches, while others are artfully done to be unique and colorful. Each of those benches represents Valparaiso in its on unique way.\n\nIf you are looking for a place to take a walk on a Sunday afternoon, have a cup of coffee, or stroll through the variety of stores, then Valparaiso’s downtown is the place to be. Take a few minutes to stop and look around, and smell the air to fully enjoy what Indiana has to offer.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sjavnun"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05418,41.46976]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valpo Pride?","description":"Posted by Laura886When talking to many students at Valparaiso University, there are often mixed emotions about why one came to Valpo and what makes them stay.  There are various wonderful things to be said about the university’s programs, size, and Christian atmosphere.  A common theme of second-guessing one’s decision based upon distaste for the small town atmosphere and dreary weather conditions come up as well.\r\n\tThe other day, in when talking to my younger sister, Katie, this topic of deciding on a college came up.  She is a senior in high school, so this is a decision that has come up in many of her conversations lately.  At times, she has considered Valparaiso University, simply for the fact that I go to school here.  She asked a man at her work about what he though about this idea as opposed to Concordia University, which is located near downtown Chicago.  His response was “that’s not even a toss-up, there’s nothing exciting about Valparaiso, IN.  There’s just nothing there.”\r\n\tKatie is a free-spirited girl who loves travel and adventure.  I consider myself to be very similar to her in these aspects, but yet here I sit in Valparaiso, IN.  Some of her other college ideas include schools in California, Texas, and North Carolina.  She feels drawn to these schools, but yet her ties to family keep her looking seriously at Midwest schools.\r\n\tThis is an idea that I find to be a huge factor in why many people are where they are.  They are in certain places to be near people they love.  This can make a dreary winter day bearable and a not so “exciting” location a place of fun memories.\r\n\tOther people, on the other hand, genuinely love the small-town feel.  Last week, when shopping in downtown Valpo, I overheard a woman taking about her feelings towards this small Midwestern city.  She said, “If I can’t find what I need in Valpo, then I don’t need it.  There are quaint antique shops and unique restaurants.  One doesn’t have to go too far to be satisfied.”  She seemed very comfortable with where she lives and even takes pride in its quaintness.  Everyone perceives place through different lenses.  A phrase that she said towards the end of the conversation sticks out to me as I think about people’s various reaction to place: “Each place can’t be everything to everyone”. \r\n\t\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sibaw2a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.08313,41.43861]}},{"properties":{"name":"Visit Downtown Valpo!","description":"Posted by Bambi1185Valparaiso, IndianaWhen traveling through Northwest Indiana, make sure to stop and visit the little town of Valparaiso.

There are several little specialty shops featuring bags of candy tied in cellophane with bright ribbon.  Cafes put their soup of the day chalkboards out on the sidewalk in front of the shops.  The majority of the businesses are women’s clothing stores like Seasons of the Square, The Closet Exchange, and Bangles.  But there is a decent combination of used goods and clothing stores, law and insurance offices (Langer and Langer, Follis and Associates), coffee and dessert places (Express Yourself, Designer Desserts), and specialty stores that feel like the gift shop in the front of Cracker Barrel.  Valpo Pet and Hobby is much smaller than commercial Pet Smart, but offers more for the small-town shopper’s sense of the specialty of yesteryear.  The front section of the store houses rows and rows of model trains, cars, planes, and the makings for little towns.  The back half of the shop smells like sawdust and fish.  They sell gerbils, lizards, rabbits, frogs, fish, etc.  Jimmy’s Café just down the street offers college kids a place to nurse their hangovers over fried eggs and pancakes.  Jano’s Sporting Goods store encouragers passers-by to “explore Valpo by bicycle” and showcases shiny blue and green bikes in the front window.  The city library is tucked away behind the bank, and though it’s not very large, it seems like one of the friendliest quiet places downtown.  Stone steps lead up to double front doors, the landscaping outside is simple, but inviting.  On a warmer day you can sit outside the small building and watch people walk to their cars or to a coffee shop.  Men and women jog by; people smile and wave.  It’s quiet because the plot is near the older, but comfortable homes that make up much of Valparaiso’s residential areas.  As you move back toward downtown, movement and noise pick up.  Buffalo Wild Wings and Old Style Inn give eaters and drinkers a place to go, but the square around the courthouse is fairly quiet in comparison with busier cities—still, friendly, and old-fashioned.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s8g7s41"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.059589,41.467479]}},{"properties":{"name":"Walkin around campus","description":"Posted by Bambi1185It was eight o’clock at night, and I just finished working out with my friend.

It didn’t take me long to remember the familiar smell of baking pizza and neon lights of the sole Papa Johns in town.\n\nEven when the sky is gray and the air humid and cool there are many people about at 3 in the afternoon.  Some wear business suits, probably coming from the town hall or one of the many banks in town.  Others are college students from just down Lincoln Way though there is surprisingly very few of them out and about (no thanks to the more modern side of the town where Target and Wal-Mart reign supreme).  The old beauty and antique stores I guess don’t tickle their fancy and most of the bars and pubs come alive when the sun sets.  The rest of the people are the townies that go about their own daily routine.\n\nWhile many of the buildings stay true to the old stone, brick and mortar fashion – the highest of them being the top three banks and town hall – in one area all of it is put aside and forgotten for just a moment.  Along the side of Michigan Jefferson, devoid of any shop entrances, lays a painted mural of the different shops in the town (at least I think them to be).  The brick wall, from one end to around the corner of the alleyway behind it, is filled with different charactures of shop owners and loafers dancing on top of awnings, drinking and having the time of their lives.  I wonder if this is the town Valpo was meant to be or was a different time.  There are no strange looks depicted in any of the portraits, just smiles and implied happiness.

My friend Jeff suggests, “Let’s go play Mini Golf at the fun center.” I always like to play Mini Golf in my spare time, and since I haven’t been there in a while, we all decided to make a night of it. We were sitting at the traffic light to turn into the parking lot and find a space to park. We proceed up to the building in back of the parking lot to get our clubs and golf balls. We nominated J.-P., my boyfriend to keep score since he was an expert at math. My golf ball was yellow. Jeff’s was blue. Brittney’s ball was green. J.-P.’s was red. \r\nNext to the building to get all the supplies was the putting green, there were two different trails (North and South). We decided to take the North Trail. Some of the holes were more complicated than others. One hole I remember the hole in a caved in part of the green. I had to remind myself on that hole not to hit it to hard or else it was not going to stay there and roll into the hole eventually. Some other holes had painted houses on the greens and whichever person had to shoot it up into the metal shoot and have it drop down to the next level. Once again, another hole that was completely complicated. The whole Mini Golf course had short light stands with two lights. The lights were different colors and it was pretty to see all the neat color combinations. All of us had to be very careful because there were streams next to some of the holes so we needed to make sure that our aim on our golf balls was pretty accurate.\r\n For most of the holes, I was getting an average of two strokes per hole. Jeff was getting approximately four strokes. J.-P. was usually two to three strokes. Brittney was averaging around three to four strokes per hole. We really did not care who was going to win because we just wanted to go out there and have fun. The last hole (which most of you know is the eighteenth hole) set up a certain challenge. There was a hole that was kind of on a little steep hill that you need to aim your golf ball too. If you hit the hole in wall, you would win a free round of Mini Golf on your next visit. Making sure that nobody cheated, they had a fence a couple feet in front of us with an open part so nobody would go up and cheat. Jeff, Brittney and I were unsuccessful of making it. J.-P. was able to make the hole one. That lucky duck he is. JP proceeded to go and sit on a bench nearby to total up the scores. I did not want to be antsy and go and see what he was adding up. The final result was JP beat me by two strokes. I was actually a little upset because I thought I had a wonderful game the whole way through. Although, I need to realize that we just had fun and I was not going to ruin the night for everyone. I am just hoping we can come back and have the same fun experience again.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sg0q0cu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.46559,41.51912]}},{"properties":{"name":"Winds and Grids","description":"Posted by ClentzSometimes you can just tell when a place and a person don\\'t completely match.

The theater is a half circle shape with about eight rows of red seats going around the stage. The stage floor is accentuated with pink and blue colors. For props, there is a big journal on stage that looks like one of those black and white journals filled with paperclips and a title \"Important Beezewax.\" The start character in the play is Junie B. Jones. \r\n\r\nI personally never read Junie B. Jones before, so I did not know what to expect. Junie B. Jones had a light yellow pant jumper with socks filled with bright rainbow colors and black shiny shoes. The big journal on stage folded out into different scenes ranging from a classroom to a kick ball tournament. \r\n\r\nThe journal is supposedly how Junie B. Jones communicates her thoughts. Through my eyes, the actors were filled with energy and had the most gorgeous voices. I even had a nice laugh at times. The lights were extensively dim while the lights were intensily shining on the actors on the stage. \r\n\r\nLeaving from that energetic performance, I would definitely want to go back and see another performance. I thought the end of the play was unique when they closed the big journal on stage because it reminded me of the ending of Junie B. Jones\\' experiences. An ending of a well and vibrant theater experience. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s8buxcr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.50319,41.55985]}},{"properties":{"name":"a visit","description":"Posted by RbuttonThis thing is upstairs right?  We walk up the pristine white staircase in the VUCA, with oak edging and the marks of newness, cleanness, and middle class suburban safety.  I run into several friends on the way and exchange hugs and promises to call.  As we weave toward our destination, we pause for a moment at a bulletin board, looking at internships in Chicago at the art institute, eagerly anticipating our futures.  When turn the corner to Professor Tomasek\\'s gallery of New Orleans I\\'m in a completely different place altogether.  The colors, the vibrancy, and the explicitness of the photos bare no resemblance to the Northern Indiana landscape I inhabit.  One photo shows bright features picturesquely encircling a man in drag.  Another image shows a man with a bright blue feather wig, and bright blue make-up grinning knowingly.  The faces aren\\'t different from the faces I see everyday but the colors, the costumes, and the expressions are distinct and different.  I re-walk through the gallery, examining the dates and begin to notice the difference between the more recent photos and pre-Katrina Marti-Gras.  In the more current pictures, the faces are sadder and more defiant.  The landscape is weathered and the costumes are more political.  The expressions are not so blissful and the images no longer seem as funny and lively.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2she5a5e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.07077,41.46743]}},{"properties":{"name":"all is quiet","description":"Posted by Schuettehoffman<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/in_valparaiso_u01.jpg\">Nothing like a semester break to make you realize that a place is more than just its location, more than just its buildings and landscape.

Especially when you’re on a college campus and there’s nothing more exciting happening than your walk to class.  It’s the same route every day.  Out of Lank’s south side door, down three steps, right at the railing.  You can take the street or the sidewalk, or cross through the grass.  Depends on your footwear.  Thanks to the construction, there’s a slightly new detour to be taken occasionally.  One of the best was the set of swinging gates at the beginning of the sidewalk—two of them, standing solo, in the snow.  The first time you see them, you pause and consider and feel like you’re in a Warner Brother’s cartoon.  You turn your head around, looking for an answer.  You make eye contact with a construction worker.  He shrugs his shoulders, palms facing the sky.  But after you’ve walked through the gates a few times, the novelty wears off.  It’s just part of the route.  Inside the fences, though, where you can’t walk—that’s where the excitement is.  Because the lack of grass is greener on the other side of green fence, maybe.  Caterpillars, earth-movers, cranes, drills, big red totem poles.  Temples for dwarves or altars for giants—massive concrete slabs laid on rusted iron columns.  Piles of riddled cement are the ruins of ancient menhirs, left by druids and dug up by Reith Riley.  Alright alright, druids have nothing to do with it.  But you do get the impression, as stacks of colossal pipes stare back at you while you walk, that a new Stonehenge is happening.  \r\n\r\nI walked through the gates one 8:55 am to see about 20 construction workers standing in a circle, doing early morning calisthenics.  They were wearing their yellow hardhats and reflecting jackets as they bent over to touch their steel-toed boots.   Then they put their cigarettes between their teeth held out their arms and swung them in little circles, 10 seconds forward, 10 backward.   They breathed deeply, blowing out steam in the freezing air.  Fog lurked behind them, rising from the Ditch.  I had stopped to watch them, of course.  One doesn’t see the builders of Stonehenge limbering up everyday.  The cult leader, with steely gray hair and harsh stubble, smiled back at my amazed face as he picked up his carafe and climbed in his fork lift.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2si7bo5y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04274,41.46501]}},{"properties":{"name":"hyperactivity","description":"Posted by Ellen87884:23 \r\ntomato soup with a huge dollop of sour cream, a pretzel so salty it’s hot, and nacho cheese.  propel.  a huge swig of berry flavored propel.  half the bottle.  black eyed peas.  where is the love?

No, mom, I have taken the train, by myself, before.  Well, what if I miss the 6 o’clock back, and have to take the 8.  after dark.  by myself.   I’ll be fine, mom.  \r\n\r\nShe won’t let me take the car to the Miller Station and park it there.  Wants to drop me off.  We’re running late.

There’s nothing interesting inside the train.  It\\'s mostly empty.  Out the window, there’s Smokey’s Ribs.  A blackened, graffitied, violated little hut, spitting grimy smoke out of a sooty pipe on its roof.  It’s surrounded by the rubble of abandoned buildings and two streets.  U.S. 12 and 7th Avenue.  It sits in the median, letting me watch it, daring me to shudder at the thought of going inside and ordering a pork sandwich.  A semi rumbles past, spitting smoke out of its pipe, and obscuring my view.\r\n\r\nIn the moment of opaqueness through my window, caused by the truck, I see a reflection gazing at mine.  It’s a young man in a skull cap, with a briefcase.  Our reflection’s eyes meet.  I resolve to look the longest, challenging his intrusion on my reflection, but he doesn’t look away.  I have to end it with a half-smile and a blink.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2sf6bitm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.2677,41.59788]}},{"properties":{"name":"the Green Bar","description":"Posted by Ellen8788The Old Style Inn would be better named the Green Bar. It has green upholstered bar stool, green lamp shades, green vases with green silk flower arrangements, and …chandeliers? Everything but their little plastic flames are mint green. Oh yes, and the bar is still decorated for St. Patrick’s Day, which means there are, additionally, a multitude of green-suited leprechauns lounging about, on tables with green-checkered table cloths and wrought iron/stained glass high chairs designed with grape leaves. Green grape leaves. The only variation is a dazzling Miller beer plaque on the wall behind the bar—a useless contraption flashing and spinning psychedelic colors around the brilliant word “Lite.” So you look out the window for relief, and see the vivid green grass of the Courthouse lawn. The building is the color of the sky—cold gray—with a tint of tan, but not enough warmth to contrast the enveloping green. The Court House is blackened toward the base, especially near the doors. There, the cement is the color of soot, like the trees dominating the lawn, bare, gnarled, and enormous. With intimidating breadth at the base, and the spindliest of inwardly curling branches higher up, those trees belong outside a haunted house, not the Courthouse. But perhaps you only think that because of the weather.The wind is blowing viciously…you can tell from the tattered American flag on the 5/3 Bank across the street…but the tree twigs don’t budge. They’re perfectly frozen against the cold grey sky. Oh, there’s a spot of color in the lower-left corner of the Green Bar’s window. It’s an oddly inverted plaster bench, bolted the Courthouse sidewalk. Possibly reminiscent of Chicago’s bulls, but these signify that Valparaiso is the county seat, you suppose. There’s City Hall to the right, white as ice. Makes the sky look like melted butter. In any case, this bench isn’t colorless. It’s painted with summer scenes. The purple-variegated windows of the VU chapel, blue Lake Michigan, a red fox, yellow popcorn, and an incongruous pair of pink shoes, center-bench. So obviously, there are better sights sometimes. And this gives you hope to abandon the Green Bar, heading into the cold, wind, and drizzle, looking for a better day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gx2s6t92fv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.1003,41.48492]}},{"properties":{"name":"weather and walking","description":"Posted by AndybrdThis road is not the easiest one to walk down in the winter.  The sidewalks are horrible, even in some of the best weather, but now, there is such a great risk of falling and dying.  On McIntyre Court, they do not clean the sidewalks, unless the owners of the houses decide to do so.  Normally this would not be a reason to complain, but it is a busy walkway for students.  At least for those who have to go to LaPorte for some reason.  So many people walk on it, that the snow becomes slush, and since no one salts this, it freezes as soon as the temperature drops, and then you have to walk on ice, which gets covered in more snow.  The sidewalk here is definitely not the nicest possible walk.\r\nAt least the views are not bad.  The homes on this street are actually decent looking houses.  There is one house on this street that has some interesting bushes.  The plants wrap around the house in a solid line.  This also seems to be one of the only places that has a cleaned sidewalk in front.  It is a nice relief, even if it is so brief, to be able to walk without mincing your steps or risking falling and ending your struggling life.  Sigh.  The biggest problem is that I like winter.  I love the snow.  But around here, it seems to turn to ice in no time at all.  It makes me not want to walk anywhere.  Unfortunately, that is my main form of transportation right now, since my bike lock is frozen.  The time to unfreeze it would not be long, but I am just too lazy to do so when I have the time.  So I walk, and this road is one that I must travel.
