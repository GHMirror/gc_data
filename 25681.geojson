And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:  \nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

The standard practice calls for the statue to be dug up once the property has sold and placed on the grateful seller\\'s mantle or in another place of honor. Some, however, who have trouble remembering where they interred their statues prefer to leave the buried saints where they\\'ve been placed to help protect the properties for the new owners.

An order of nuns, needing more land for a convent, buried their St. Joseph medals in the ground. They got the land, and word spread.

If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

Here\\'s a podcast of lessons learned from riding two real estate cycles:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/s8nmx\n\nOur goal is to protect potential homebuyers, particularly those contemplating risky loans in overvalued housing markets, from making costly mistakes. If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

Here\\'s a podcast of lessons learned from riding two real estate cycles:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/s8nmx\n\nOur goal is to protect potential homebuyers, particularly those contemplating risky loans in overvalued housing markets, from making costly mistakes. If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans.

If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market?

If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market?

We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans.

If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

Here\\'s a podcast of lessons learned from riding two real estate cycles:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/s8nmx\n\nOur goal is to protect potential homebuyers, particularly those contemplating risky loans in overvalued housing markets, from making costly mistakes. If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

Here\\'s a podcast of lessons learned from riding two real estate cycles:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/s8nmx\n\nOur goal is to protect potential homebuyers, particularly those contemplating risky loans in overvalued housing markets, from making costly mistakes. If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

Here\\'s a podcast of lessons learned from riding two real estate cycles:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/s8nmx\n\nOur goal is to protect potential homebuyers, particularly those contemplating risky loans in overvalued housing markets, from making costly mistakes. If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans.

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves.

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time.

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

If you were harmed by a previous real estate price correction: (1) what advice would you give to someone buying a home now, and (2) what should they know about the current housing market? If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/place/95502\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/7060\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans. Did you know there are more than 15 million AIDS orphans worldwide?\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kl5nc\n\nIf you are not in the housing market yourself, you can help friends save money AND save lives by emailing this link to anyone buying (or selling) a home.

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?

If price corrections are already underway locally, post your comments or locations of properties on this map:\nhttp://www.platial.com/realestatecafe/map/6343\n\nIf you are househunting outside Massachusetts, The Real Estate Cafe would be glad to refer you to an exclusive buyer agent -- perhaps one contributing to this map -- and rebate one-third of our referral fee (where allowed by law). We\\'ll donate the other third to help save lives or provide shelter subsidies for AIDS orphans.

As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as \"extremely overvalued,\" according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.\"\n\n\"The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,\" said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n\"And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,\" says DeKaser.\n\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as \"extremely overvalued.\"  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?
