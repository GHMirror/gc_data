There are signs that major quakes have occurred before; if repeated, they could drown wide swaths of land, as the mighty rivers that drain the Himalayas seem prone to suddenly shift course when perturbed. Lamont-Doherty seismologist Leonardo Seeber has been traveling with Bangladeshi and Indian geologists to survey surface geology. Lamont geophysicist Michael Steckler is installing and monitoring instruments recording natural sinkage and other movements of the surface. With the University of Dhaka’s Syed Humayun Akhter and colleagues, Lamont seismologist Won-Young Kim is expanding a network of seismometers designed to reveal the locations of faults buried by up to 12 miles of delta sand and mud. Steven Goodbred (Vanderbilt University) and colleagues are hand-boring some 250 wells, to reveal past river movements. Scientists also are trying to sort out ongoing sea-level rise from the natural sinking of land (which now may be greatly worsened by building of dams and pumping of groundwater). Some projections say that a fifth of Bangladesh will be inundated by a 3-foot rise in seas over the next century, displacing some 15 million people—but the earthquake project is already showing that much land may be sinking even faster than the sea is rising.

With an eye to what changing climate may mean, microbiologists Andrew Juhl and Craig Aumack are studying the basic processes at work here, including the formation of organic matter, and its sinkage through the water when the ice melts in spring. Using snowmobiles to traverse the frozen sea, they will remove 4- to 5-foot cores of ice with portable drills, inspect the ice underside with cameras and other instruments, and perform lab experiments on the cores. An overarching question: How will fast-warming northern climate and dissipating ice affect the availability of food in the arctic? In some areas, there are already signs that changes in the timing, speed and dynamics of the melt could have powerful effects on northern ecology. From May 20-27, the team will host a high-school teacher; during this time, they plan to range far out on the ice, and also connect with local cultural and educational organizations.

The subtropical North Atlantic, at the same latitude as the Sahara Desert, is one of the saltiest stretches of ocean on earth, the result of more freshwater evaporating from the sea surface than can be replenished by rainfall. The subtropical oceans are expected to get saltier as the planet warms, but the forecast could change if the processes that deliver freshwater to the subtropics—winds and large swirling eddies—also change.

Rich in gold and other minerals, these rocks are geologically young (about 8 million years) and still emerging. The processes connected to their exhumation come along with abundant volcanism and small earthquakes. To understand the unusual deep-earth processes and the human risk, in 2010 seismologists set out about 30 temporary seismometers under the sea, along the coasts and on islands. This is allowing the scientists to “see” into the earth, and image active faults and boundaries between rock units. Chief scientist Geoff Abers and colleagues recovered the instruments in 2011, traveling by boat and helicopter. At the same time, a small team including volcano expert Phillipp Ruprecht was collecting hardened lavas from volcanoes that have erupted in recent geologic time. With these samples, they hope to analyze chemistry that will tell them about the melting conditions far below, and shed light on the overall dynamic processes of this part of the world. <a href=\"http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/cdpapua\">Project web page </a><a href=\"http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/files/uploaded/file/EQSurvey%20Fact%20Sheet09.pdf\">Project fact sheet</a> ","Categories":null,"id":"a694y7m7l6e6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[150.831299,-9.714472]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"source":null,"contact_phone":null},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":56,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-15T04:24:12-04:00","id":239161}
