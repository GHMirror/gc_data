I now know the following things about mosses:\r\n\r\n1) They are very small\r\n2) There are a lot of them\r\n3) Did I mention they are small?\r\n\r\nOk, I learned a whole lof of other things, like terminology and what features you should look for to begin making an ID.  The instructor showed us a bunch of different mosses, but I figured I would try to memorize one common one, and this is it: <i>Atrichum selwynii</i>.  It grows on soil, the leaf is relatively large, the costa (midrib) is obvious and extends to the end of the leaf, the leaf has serrations you can see in a hand lens, and the leaf has a wavy pattern that you can see with the naked eye.  It was also all over the place in Huckleberry.","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4317734874_b7681f4a90_t.jpg","photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4317734874_b7681f4a90_s.jpg","longitude":-122.194,"id":"a6783i2qo47s","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4317734874_b7681f4a90_b.jpg","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/4596","user login":"kueda","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4317734874_b7681f4a90_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.194,37.8423]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3051/4614663268_ed20e5280e.jpg","place guess":"Butano State Park, San Mateo County, CA, USA","latitude":37.2176,"date observed":"2010-05-15","tag list":null,"taxon name":"Atypoides riversii","description":"Finally managed to spot some of these spiders in their turrets, and I even managed to coax a few further up by flicking a twig around the entrance.

There were 7 brown stripes and 8 white strips.

There were quite a few of them flitting around. Sharing the same order (Ordonata), dragonflies are closely related to damselflies. In fact, the two  are often confused for one another, due to the fact that they share habitats, life cycles, and general characteristics. However, there are several differences which, with careful observation, can help distinguish between these two suborders. Damselflies have eyes positioned far on the sides of their heads and have slender abdomens, compared to the thick abdomens of dragonflies. Dragonflies have a hindwing which is thicker at the base than the forewing, while the wings of the damselfly are relatively the same. Also, there are differences in the ways that they hold their wings. Dragonflies have theirs laid out horizontally while damselflies have wings that are angled above or in line with their abdomen. Their activity yields some distinct traits as well. Damselflies are less powerful than dragonflies and so tend to perch until prey flies by. Dragonflies actively fly in the open and swarm to catch prey. If you are lucky enough to observe a nymph, then it is easy to determine the correct identification. Damselfly nymphs are slim and small, while dragonfly nymphs are football-shaped and large with a point at the end of their abdomens. This particular specimen was chasing another dragonfly around, perhaps a possible mate. My proximity may have been possible because of this fact and the presence of the other dragonfly.","longitude":-83.8664,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4622538488_e7560e20d3_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4622538488_e7560e20d3_t.jpg","id":"a6783i80vaxs","user login":"tomtorres","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7247","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4622538488_e7560e20d3_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4622538488_e7560e20d3_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.8664,34.241]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4734571029_eef3714d96.jpg","place guess":"Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire, England","latitude":51.8387,"date observed":"2010-06-23","tag list":null,"taxon name":"Dropwort","description":null,"longitude":-0.605493,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4734571029_eef3714d96_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4734571029_eef3714d96_t.jpg","id":"a6783i2uzjwv","user login":"Tiggrx","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7676","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4734571029_eef3714d96_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4734571029_eef3714d96_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.605493,51.8387]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4814078503_f6da3fc36e.jpg","latitude":43.8357,"place guess":"West Ossipee, New Hampshire, United States","tag list":null,"date observed":"2010-07-14","taxon name":"Drosera","description":"This was a surprise: sundews growing along the banks of White Lake!

line\". Edith's Checkerspot is arguably the most studied, best known non-economic insect in North America, thanks to investigations performed by Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich of Stanford University and his students and colleagues over the past thirty years. The journals of population biology, ecology, and evolution contain scores of papers based on these seminal studies. Among the findings: some populations, especially those on serpentine soils, require an alteration of hostplants through the season, one replacing another as the first dessicates; colonies naturally flick on and off in an extinction-recolonization cycle--even the classic Stanford research site on Jasper Ridge--but are now dropping out of many former habitats for good, a trend significantly correlated with warming trends\".","longitude":-120.542,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4796056357_63699f7d78_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4796056357_63699f7d78_t.jpg","id":"a6783ig90pw9","user

There were quite a few of them flitting around. Sharing the same order (Ordonata), dragonflies are closely related to damselflies. In fact, the two  are often confused for one another, due to the fact that they share habitats, life cycles, and general characteristics. However, there are several differences which, with careful observation, can help distinguish between these two suborders. Damselflies have eyes positioned far on the sides of their heads and have slender abdomens, compared to the thick abdomens of dragonflies. Dragonflies have a hindwing which is thicker at the base than the forewing, while the wings of the damselfly are relatively the same. Also, there are differences in the ways that they hold their wings. Dragonflies have theirs laid out horizontally while damselflies have wings that are angled above or in line with their abdomen. Their activity yields some distinct traits as well. Damselflies are less powerful than dragonflies and so tend to perch until prey flies by. Dragonflies actively fly in the open and swarm to catch prey. If you are lucky enough to observe a nymph, then it is easy to determine the correct identification. Damselfly nymphs are slim and small, while dragonfly nymphs are football-shaped and large with a point at the end of their abdomens. This particular specimen was chasing another dragonfly around, perhaps a possible mate. My proximity may have been possible because of this fact and the presence of the other dragonfly.","longitude":-83.8664,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4665221734_9fa27f75b1_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4665221734_9fa27f75b1_t.jpg","id":"a6783igxhbij","user login":"tomtorres","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7247","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4665221734_9fa27f75b1_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4665221734_9fa27f75b1_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.8664,34.241]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4681342133_390193de14.jpg","place guess":"Kuramayama","latitude":34.8558,"date observed":"2010-05-29","tag list":"Pentatomidae","taxon name":"Family Pentatomidae","description":"This green shield bug was walking along the sides of a red gate qhere he stood out quite well.

The body is laterally compressed and at rest it curls into a C-shape. They invariable wriggle about on their sides. The upper antennae is longer than the lower pair and has a small branch part way along. The freshwater Gammarus lives in streams and rivers from lowland areas up into faster flowing hill country. If the current is fast it will shelter in weed or under stones. It also occurs in large ponds.\r\nThey are detrital feeders, which means they feed on any organic matter that is fine and decaying. There are a variety of ciliates which attach to their bodies as epizooites. (an animal living on another living thing but not as a parasite is called an epizooites). The sex of the offspring is determined by temperature, for example, in the estuarine species G. duebeni below 5°C it becomes a male, above this, a female.\r\nMales are larger than the females and carry the eggs after laying. Often the amle can be seen carrying the female prior to mating.

At first glance, it seemed most likely to be from either an owl or a hawk of some sort. From tip to bottom of shaft, it was 16-18 cm, 11-12 cm from the tip to the beginning of the abre shaft, with a shaft end of 4-5 cm. It was alternating white/brown stripes; The rainis was off center, with 2 cm and 1 cm at the sides. There was about 1 cm of fluff at the bottom of the feather, near the bare shaft. There were 7 brown stripes and 8 white strips. From scouring through scans of bird feathers from the possible species, I decided to pick Accipitridae, due to the high number of specimens sharing many feather-traits with the feather found, in terms of size, shape and coloration. A closer identification could be made, if the entire bird had been observed, since each species has it's own set of telling characteristics.","longitude":-83.832,"photosquare":"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/4642696378_4431409785_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/4642696378_4431409785_t.jpg","id":"a6783i59pjgj","user login":"tomtorres","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7296","photolarge":"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/4642696378_4431409785_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/4642696378_4431409785_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.832,34.7146]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4625346878_61c0c6179d.jpg","place guess":"Nivoliers, Cevennes, France","latitude":44.2642,"date observed":"2010-05-17","tag list":null,"taxon name":"Heartsease","description":null,"longitude":3.46101,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4625346878_61c0c6179d_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4625346878_61c0c6179d_t.jpg","id":"a6783ieom7x3","user login":"Tiggrx","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7176","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4625346878_61c0c6179d_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4625346878_61c0c6179d_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.46101,44.2642]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4636776910_1ab1b4028a.jpg","place guess":"Causse Noir, Cevennes, France","latitude":44.1781,"date observed":"2010-05-15","tag list":null,"taxon name":"Heath Beefly","description":null,"longitude":3.40645,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4636776910_1ab1b4028a_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4636776910_1ab1b4028a_t.jpg","id":"a6783igsmh0z","user login":"Tiggrx","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7283","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4636776910_1ab1b4028a_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4636776910_1ab1b4028a_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.40645,44.1781]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4665100741_88e80351d5.jpg","place guess":"Leith Hill, Surrey, England","latitude":51.1761,"date observed":"2010-05-30","tag list":null,"taxon name":"Heath Woodrush","description":null,"longitude":-0.373363,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4665100741_88e80351d5_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4665100741_88e80351d5_t.jpg","id":"a6783ibhyiqo","user login":"Tiggrx","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7424","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4665100741_88e80351d5_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4665100741_88e80351d5_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.373363,51.1761]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4658866188_05405e0fb4.jpg","place guess":"Gainesville college","latitude":null,"date observed":"2010-05-26","tag list":null,"taxon name":"Hedera helix","description":"It was found on the north tail at Gainesville college growing on a pecan tree","longitude":null,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4658866188_05405e0fb4_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4658866188_05405e0fb4_t.jpg","id":"a6783i5ly1k0","user login":"gsc","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7373","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4658866188_05405e0fb4_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4658866188_05405e0fb4_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4625117232_16bfb3d93e.jpg","place guess":"Baeza, Ecuador","latitude":-0.463553,"date observed":"2010-05-13","tag list":null,"taxon name":"Heliconiinae","description":"Possibly Eueides procula","longitude":-77.8928,"photosquare":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4625117232_16bfb3d93e_s.jpg","photothumb":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4625117232_16bfb3d93e_t.jpg","id":"a6783ibql6pp","user login":"flapack","observation url":"http://inaturalist.org/observations/7160","photolarge":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4625117232_16bfb3d93e_b.jpg","photosmall":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4625117232_16bfb3d93e_m.jpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.8928,-0.463553]}},{"properties":{"photomedium":"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4615516294_be7c169cf2.jpg","place guess":"Olmen -

It's bold markings and four yellow tufts were striking but I didn't know what species of moth or butterfly it was. A twitpic on twitter and a posting on the Amateur Wildlife Film-makers Network didn't take long to produce an answer - Jan Atkinson (@kittiwake70) and Stewart Canham came to my aid with it's identification as the caterpillar of a Vapourer Moth. Stewart added another fact - that the female moth was wingless, so with my interest piqued I did a little more research.\r\nThe Vapourer Moth, Orgyia antiqua from the family Lymantriidae, can be found in most of the UK with higher numbers in the south. Male Vapourer's are daylight flying moths, easily confused with a small brown butterfly. The caterpillars emerge in April and May and feed on deciduous trees and shrubs - my guess is it is making a good meal of my climbing rose, eating below the bud in the picture above.\r\nAfter pupation, the Vapourer's lifecycle differs dramatically depending on its sex. The female is flightless and remains close to its silk enclosed glossy black and hairy cocoon for its short life, releasing a pheromone to attract the flying males. Fertilised eggs are laid on the pupal cocoon and overwinter before emerging the next spring.\r\nThe males have dark, orange brown wings with a white, comma shaped spot on each wing and are predated by dragon and damselflies. As Stewart suggested, it is tempting to capture it and watch it pupate as the female (if it was one) would make an interesting photograph. Instead I think I will let nature run it's course and have a nose around for a cocoon site in the wild - you never know, I might get lucky!\r\n\r\nReferences - with some great additional photos of all the lifestages\r\nWikipedia -
