Newton, Bobby Seale, and Richard Aoki. Formed in October 1966, the party grew to national prominence in the United States and is an iconic representative of the counterculture revolutions of the 1960s. The group was founded on the principles of its Ten-Point Program, which called for greater autonomy of black Americans and correction of the injustices of racism.\n\nThe group\\'s political goals are often overshadowed by their confrontational and uncompromising views and approach toward agents of law enforcement, who the Black Panthers saw as the linchpin of racism that could only be overcome by a willingness to take up armed self-defense.\n\nThe Black Panther Party fell apart in the early 1970s under the weight of both internal feuding and the external pressures of federal, state, and local law enforcement\\'s campaign to undermine the organization with black propaganda, infiltration by agents provocateur and outright assassination<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6basr5j79yq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.269722,37.804444]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little Rock Central High","description":"Posted by Jmoore06Little Rock, AR On September 2, the night before school was to start, Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the state\\'s National Guard to surround Little Rock Central High School and prevent any black students from entering in order to protect citizens and property from possible violence by protesters he claimed were headed in caravans toward Little Rock.\n\nA federal judge granted an injunction against the Governor\\'s use of National Guard troops to prevent integration and they were withdrawn on September 20.\n\nWhen school resumed on Monday, September 23, Central High was surrounded by Little Rock policemen. About 1,000 people gathered in front of the school. The police escorted the nine black students to a side door where they quietly entered the building as classes were to begin. When the mob learned the blacks were inside, they began to challenge the police and surge toward the school with shouts and threats. Fearful the police would be unable to control the crowd, the school administration moved the black students out a side door before noon.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6basr24fx77"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.289444,34.746389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lunch Counter Sitin","description":"Posted by Jmoore06Greensboro, NCBlack students in Winston-Salem and Durham hold demonstrations at lunch counters.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6basqzeoy9i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.792222,36.0725]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lunch counter Sit-in in Greensboro, NC","description":"Posted by Jmoore06Greensboro, NCBlack students in Winston-Salem and Durham hold demonstrations at lunch counters.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6basr2z3ef8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.792222,36.0725]}},{"properties":{"name":"Malcolm X Killed","description":"Posted by Jmoore06Manhattan, NYNamed Malcolm Little by his parents, Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska.
