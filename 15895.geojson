The points represent the official NHC forecast locations of the center of a tropical cyclone. Forecast center positions are given for projections valid 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after the forecast's nominal initial time, provided that a closed surface wind circulation is expected to exist at the forecast projection time. It is important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, and that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the center.The points represent the official NHC forecast locations of the center of a tropical cyclone.\n\nUploaded into Geocommons as shp, dbf, and shx files.
