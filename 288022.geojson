The track line(s) are not a forecast product, however, and because there are an infinite number of ways to connect a set of forecast points, the lines should not be interpreted as representing a specific forecast for the location of a tropical cyclone in between official forecast points.  It is also important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, and that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the
