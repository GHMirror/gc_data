Sustainability approaches tend to address combined environmental,  economic,  and social issues,  while environmental management approaches tend to focus on issues like pollution or habitat restoration in isolation. The beginning of the 21st century represents a turning point for cities as sustainability subsumes environmental management practices and polices. SustainLane believes sustainability is a more appropriate approach for urban areas because it recognizes people and institutions as the primary actors that benefit from change with indirect benefits also accruing for natural systems as a result.&quot;","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"Cumulative":{"max":85.0,"mean":53.32,"variance":157.487346938776,"stdev":12.5493962778604,"min":32.0,"median":52.0},"Green
