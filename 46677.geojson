has two eighteen hole regulation courses and an eighteen hole executive track. The organization\\'s long-term plans are to eventually have a total of seventy-two holes available for play. The Panther Course is very scenic and challenging. The fairways have dogleg configurations and trees are abundant. The greens vary from large to small in size and some are heavily undulating. Water hazards and bunkers also come into play consistently throughout the design. This is\n    the first course in the large Orange County National facility. The Crooked Cat, which opened in the latter part of 1998, presents a challenge with an abundance of elevated and terraced fairways. The Tooth Course is an executive length, par 29, nine hole course. This course is best suited for those looking to sharpen their iron game. There are many natural elevation changes, and water comes into play on four holes. The training facilities on site include a thirty-six hole putting facility,\n    sand and chipping area, and a massive, circular-shaped driving range with more than 600 hitting stations. This range covers forty-two acres and is one mile in circumference. It is considered to be one of the largest in the United States. You can get all the training you need at the Phil Ritson Golf Institute that is on site. Call (407) 656-2626 for information on the schooling and training currently available. Tee times can be reserved by calling (888) PAR-3672. Although there is no nine\n    hole green fee, twilight rates are available daily, usually beginning after 2 PM during the peak season.
