This is a past city of the Inca people who believed it was a sacred place. This was a small ( a total of 5 miles) but very extrodinary city.\r\n  High above the Urubamba river is where this little city sits. Filled with palaces to temples to 150 houses. The main purpose it seems is the Inca\\'s astronomy center. Withsets of rocks and buildings using the the stars and sunlight to tell the date and times.\r\n  The Spaniards never did find Machu Picchu even though they suspected it.
