One cold February morning in 1983 I came out to the end of the jetty with my cousin Warren and watched enormous waves, reported to be 24- 28 feet tall, roll right in to the bay. Until, that is one crashed in to the jetty and knocked me down and dragged me towards the sharp dolos and rocks that surround the end of the jetty. My advice. View this place from a safe distance. I can still taste the saltwater on cold mornings. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7a49ddvwco6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.244063,40.764714]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cannibals?!?!","description":"Posted by GordoCannibal Island\\'s West CoastThe western end of Cannibal Island Road meets the Eel River and overlooks the mouth of the river.

I suggest that you go in with the tide and leave before it goes out or you can be left in a sticky flat of mud for a while. Awesome views of birds, oyster beds and what I believe a pristine dune ecosystem. Be quiet and move slowly and you can get very close to the wildlife for some excellent photos.

One not so well moon-lit night Marta, Lorna, Steve, Dave and I paddled out in our kayaks and explored the island. When we went to look up at the birds, we were met by a fecal and urine shower. Some fun. I guess that we should have called ahead or atleast brought a gift or something. Later that same night we paddled across the island when the tide was so high that the majority of the island was submerged.
