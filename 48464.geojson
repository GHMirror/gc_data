After World War II, the USSR placed a barrier in Germany.  It was called the Berlin Wall.  The sole purpose of it was to keep East Germany on the Communist side and West Germany on the Allies side.  This went throughout the Cold War and many years after that.  Fortunately, the Berlin Wall was broken down during President Ronald Reagan\\'s reign, and Germany has been free from Communist control ever since.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62gjqymkd4x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.5681152344,52.4426178712]}},{"properties":{"name":"Empire State Building from Park","description":"Posted by Fryguy<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/0/empire_state_building.jpg\">McCarren ParkThe Empire State Building is one of the most important buildings of trade and commerce in the United States.
