In the middle of the summer the weather was still cool and the wind was always brisk.  Seeing the glaciers was special because they won\\'t be here much longer at the rate they are melting.

The great aspect about this place is the fact that it is right on the water and doesn\\'t require a long drive to get to it.  The surroundings are nice and there is a decent amount of wildlife around.

You can hike up to the top on your own and not stay at the lodge overnight but then you are forced to come back down the same day.
