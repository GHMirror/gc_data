The company says it artist Karin Schwarz doesn\\'t remove the exhibit it will go to court, according to a Sao Paulo newspaper.\n\nSchwarz, though, isn\\'t backing down.\n\n\"Barbie is exploited by Mattel. She wears a bikini, she shows off her belly, has big breasts, and even has a boyfriend,\" she told the Jornal de Sao Paulo newspaper.\n\nHer exhibit, called \\'Amazing Girls\\', is on display at a bar in the town of Curitiba.\n\nA Brazilian spokesperson for Mattel said that \"Barbie is a very proper lady and she is not happy about being portrayed as something that she isn\\'t.\"\n\nBut Barbie is no friend of conservative Christians either.\n\nEarlier this year Concerned Women for America accused the doll, who is now 46, of  promoting gender confusion among children. (story) According to the group the Barbie Web site doll asks children their sex, providing three choices \"girl\", \"boy\", \"I don\\'t know\". \n\nBatman owner DC Comics ordered a New York gallery last year to remove an exhibit showed the superhero embracing and kissing sidekick Robin. (story)\n\nThe works of artist Mark Chamberlain had been on display at the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts Gallery on West 26th Street.  DC ordered the company to turn over all renderings in its possession.\n\nMy opinion: When you buy a Barbie doll, you are not engaging in a licensing agreement, you are not paying for the right to play with the doll in a pre-defined, limited manner (but when you buy a DVD this *is* exactly what you are actually doing).  A Barbie Doll is not a piece of media, historically, socially or culturally.  Mattel obviously has other ideas about its IP.  The idea that a doll could be declared as a piece of licensed media is a very interesting, and tantalizing prospect, expect to see it happening more and more in the future.

Designed by Canadian architect Moshe Safdie, Toronto Pearson\\'s new Terminal One empahsizes natural light and transparency: \" In an attempt to demystify the chaos of travel, many details in the building were designed to reveal the workings of an airport terminal.\" T01 will be an extention of this notion of transparency where artwork reveals complex processes through visual and aural representations.\n\nONLINE SUBMISSION\n\nPlease Submit Proposals through the online submission form (Requires Flash 8 plugin). Deadline for submissions is December 1st, 2006. Artist fees paid. T01 is curated by Michael Alstad and David Jhave Johnston.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06pexqif3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.628048,43.67917]}},{"properties":{"name":"TXTual healing, Brooklyn","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/dean1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 126 Smith St, Brooklyn, NY TXTual healing uses a cell phone a computer and a projector to create a mobile public performance by posting a person\\'s text messages into speech bubbles that are strategically placed on the facades of buildings. \n\n<img src=\"http://www.txtualhealing.com/images/mainimagetrim.jpg\" width=\"350\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06pfcxj7i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.990114,40.687476]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tag Houston","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.knittaplease.com\" href=\"www.knittaplease.com\">Knitta</a><img src=\"http://myspace-394.vo.llnwd.net/00291/49/39/291919394_l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Stop Sign at Dunlavy and Hawthorne\nHouston, Texas<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06pi807oy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.402205,29.742358]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tallbike Faculty (at least it was here in 2005)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072402/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/36/122072402_fb9f012abe_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072506/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/39/122072506_562344b920_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072109/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/36/122072109_a5ac7484d6_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072040/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/122072040_8f23640321_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072168/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/122072168_e8e69e0847_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072598/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/43/122072598_6b74f2305d_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072556/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/122072556_ddec7bce83_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072351/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/38/122072351_402dbbcc27_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55517823@N00/122072297/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/39/122072297_d6bbb8c926_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Oostzaanstraat, near WesterparkThe ever inspiring cluster of dedicated hard working tall bike innovators who keep the culture alive and thriving in amsterdam, where the saying goes \"if you\\'re normal, that\\'s weird enough.\"  This pack can be seen jousting in the Vondelpark most weekends in the summer.

Due to road construction, Mill Ends Park (24 inches across and located at the intersection of downtown Portland\\'s Southwest Taylor Street and Naito Parkway) will be moved 80 feet from its current location. The park will reside in the plaza area of Portland\\'s World Trade Center complex for approximately six months.\n\nAccording to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation officials, a move was necessary to protect the tiny green space from the threat posed by the much larger construction equipment. (What Portlanders won\\'t do to protect the environment.)\n\nWhen the Naito Parkway roadway improvements are completed in six or seven months, the park will be moved back to a new location on Naito Parkway, 7.5 feet east of its current home. The big - or little - move takes place on Tuesday, Feb. 7. Some sort of \"mobile platform,\" perhaps an all-terrain vehicle, will be used to move the park in its entirety. Mill Ends Park, which was dedicated as an official city park in 1976, is one of 200 parks managed by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Note: At this time, the city has no plans to move Portland\\'s 5,000-acre Forest Park. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06pq3ag68"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673286,45.516136]}},{"properties":{"name":"double take","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/430727468/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/180/430727468_e667b2310f.jpg\"></a>n lombard &amp; n new york ave, portland, or<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/hive/\">hive</a> posted a photo:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hive/430727468/\" title=\"double take\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/180/430727468_e667b2310f_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"double take\"></a>\n\n\n - Taken at 2:37 PM on March 22, 2007 - cameraphone upload by ShoZu<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06pdpfb44"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.75698,45.59233]}},{"properties":{"name":"mission tshirt","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/173306804_b8aad4cf82.jpg?v=0\">16th street, sf, ca<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06pqbo0fw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.421395,37.765041]}},{"properties":{"name":"prosthetic tree crutch","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/179428071_838abf1388.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> cannon beach, ora board holding up a heavy limb, that has become \"apart\" of the tree.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06phw3lhn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.961723,45.896908]}},{"properties":{"name":"roxy receipt","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>1121 SW Stark St, Portland, OR<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/hive/\">hive</a> posted a photo:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hive/380951767/\" title=\"roxy receipt\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/380951767_f6e3cfebff_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"roxy receipt\"></a>\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06pmrm65j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.682351,45.522368]}},{"properties":{"name":"urban iditarod","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/urbaniditarod/images/abw.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> SE water &amp; madison, under the hawthorne bridge, portland, orThe 5th Annual Portland Urban Iditarod will be run Saturday, March 4th, 2006. Show up at 11am. We mush at 11:30am sharp. You can pre-register by sending e-mail. The event is held on the same date the \"real\" race each year - the first Saturday of March.\n\nIn the Alaskan Iditarod, more than sixty dog sled teams race across the frozen tundra from Anchorage to Nome. In our urban version, teams of \"dogs\" lead by a musher will pull their sleds (shopping carts) through some of Portland\\'s most scenic areas. These teams of barking humans must negotiate through the unrelenting and unforgiving dangers of Portland\\'s urban frontier. As an incentive to run, dogs and mushers alike will have several \"rest stops\" to replenish lost fluids and discuss tales of mayhem. The course is over four miles, so dogs and mushers alike need to be ready and able to run their tails off.\n\nThe 5th annual Urban Iditarod will start at the Fire Station on S.E. Madison right next to the Willamette River and follow the same basic course as the 2005 event. The course map will be posted on the website as well as passed out at the race start once the \"rest stops\" are confirmed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a06ph6w02m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.665889,45.513001]}},{"properties":{"name":"“Don't Go Any Further”","description":"Posted by Kylebravo<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 4300 St. Claude, New Orleans, LA One thing I love about New Orleans is how all over the city the street names are cemented into the sidewalks in tile.
