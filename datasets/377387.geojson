Quoted $2,000 plus $500 scanning. Paul Hart is checking NJ references. Left VM for Paul 4/10/06. Need to call back. All the above people are now gone and Deborah Perrone is now Sec to Ast. supt. They are very aware of AppliTrack and that districts are moving from Winocular over to us. See keiths memo. Call #.16.2009 if she does not return my call - I did speak with her. Great discussion with Deb. She is fustrated with failure of admin to us things and likes AppliTrack and Dr. Monroe is way overloaded. Contact with Winocular is not finsihed until 2.1.09 Sk with her on 5.4.09 they are VERY interested but want to push off untile summer. She is recovering from shoulder surgery! Connie Bryson, IT Director, called Keith on 10/21/09 to inform him that Asst. Supe is planning on leaving Winocular for AppliTrack. Keith answered questions. Joanne Monroe is Asst. Supe. Connie's phone number is 732-786-2518 Fred tallked to Connie Bryson on 1026.09 and discussed some technical details. Fred then called Deborah Perrone. Order for amd email sent. They need to see a demo. om 11.18.09 email sent to Deborah and Dr. Monroe. I spoke with Deb and she was as harried as always - she could really use the support of AppliTrack. Dr. Monroe responded she's looking forward to working with us. Left message for Deborha on 12.07.09 and sent comp letter vai email on 12.08.2009 Great. We use the web site \"GoToMeeting\". I have conducted over 200. My part takes about 45 minutes with the whole demo going about 1 hour depending upon your group's questions. Every district is different but for a district of your size I would suggest the chief HR administrator, two(?) people in the HR office that will run the system, perhaps 1 tech person (although once AppliTrack is running your tech people have no function - than is one big reason why tech people like AppliTrack) and perhaps one or two building level administrator(s). Once we set the date/time I will send you the demo details. I will also sent the AppliTrack order form and \"Terms of Service\" document so that you can review them prior to the demo. You will see on your computer what I an doing on mine and we will talk over the phone so if you have more than 3 people you will want to project your computer and use a conference phone. Good dates for me would be January 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18 or 19 with almost any mid morning or mid after noon workable. We use the online demo that is part of our web page. You can go there at anytime and play with the demo yourself and learn more about AppliTrack's feature - it also has our user list. Feel free to call any of our users.

Buy the way - because of the tough economic times, once a District decides to go with AppliTrack, General ASP has authorized me to allow the first 3 months for free.
