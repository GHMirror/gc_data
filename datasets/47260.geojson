It also had a big back yard which led down to the river (a steep slope with an old wooden set of stairs). \nWe had no dock though so we couldn\\'t really fish down there, although we did try to launch our rubber boat from the bottom of the steps sometimes. \n\nThe backyard was also full of holes dug by previous owner\\'s dog.  I used one of these holes to make a Yoda house by thatching it across the top with sticks, twigs and grass. I kept my yoda figure in there quite a lot although it was a pain if it rained, or my dad wanted to mow the lawn. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6knc7nbna5i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.991765,46.921779]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bismarck and Mandan, ND (1976ish-1982)","description":"Posted by Jax2006<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/fa8168e5a500ffbd3a54bdd65abbbe78.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 204 8th Avenue NW, Mandan, NDWe moved here from Milwaukee and my sisters were born in Mandan in 1979. \nI went to Roosevelt Elementary School (teachers Mrs. Jacobson and Mrs. Matson) and then moved away right before 3rd grade.\nI started piano lessons here with Miss Mushik. \nLooking on the map here, there was a little restaurant about a block away (I think on Main) where I liked to go get ice cream.
