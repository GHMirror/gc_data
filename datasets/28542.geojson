We hiked a mile in the snow with our gear. We reached the entrance and she freaked. She started crying and telling me she would do anything else I wanted as long as we didn\\'t go in that hole. I was annoyed, frustrated and pushed. No luck. So, we walked back in the rain and snow. As we drove off the car got stuck in snow. We sat for several hours during which time my mom peed on the tires thinking that would help melt the snow and free us from our misery. Eventually we dug ourselves out using a piece of plastic.\r\n\r\nA few years later my mom, her husband, my brother and I went back. My mom thought she was going to hang out in the car while we did our thing. This time we forced her in the hole (see photo).

A popular tourist destination, the rock is adjacent to the beach and accessible by foot during low tide. Haystack Rock tide pools are home to many intertidal animals, including sea stars, anemone, crabs, chitons, limpets, and sea slugs. The rock is also a refuge for many sea birds including terns and puffins.\n\nGeology\n\nComposed of basalt, Haystack Rock was formed by lava flows emanating from the Grand Ronde Mountains 10 to 17 million years ago. The lava flows created many of the Oregon coast\\'s natural features, including Tillamook Head, Arch Cape, and Saddle Mountain. Haystack Rock was once joined to the coastline but years of erosion have since separated the monolith from the coast. Three smaller, adjacent rock formations to the south of Haystack Rock are collectively called \"The Needles\".\n[edit]\n\nEcology\n\nHaystack Rock was granted Marine Garden status by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1990. Collecting plants or animals is strictly prohibited. Climbing above the mean high tide level (barnacle line) disturbs nesting birds and is not allowed. The Haystack Rock Awareness Program is a volunteer association which conducts educational seminars at the rock during low tide between May and September.\n[edit]\n\nRecreation\n\nVisitors to Haystack Rock can view many species of marine wildlife in their natural habitat during low tide. The thin strip of rock and sand that connects it to the beach at these times features many tide pools. The area surrounding the rock is popular for picnicking, kite-flying, and bird-watching. Artists and photographers can be found capturing the beauty of Haystack Rock on canvas or on film. Haystack Rock is one of the most identifiable geological formations of Oregon. Many people each year become temporarily trapped on Haystack Rock when high tide engulfs the rock in water, necessitating rescue from the United States Coast Guard or local authorities. Oregon\\'s beaches are publicly owned, and there are several hotels along the beachfront within walking distance of Haystack Rock, making the area congested with tourists during the high season (May through September). On the contrary, visitors during the winter months will find a desolate, wet, windswept terrain, which many native Oregonians also appreciate.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640omzdxbug"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.969051,45.884407]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hoyt Arboretum","description":"Posted by Janedoe<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/105297.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/b74.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 4000 SW Fairview Blvd, Portland, ORTrees and such<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640omp8nuer"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.714996,45.5191]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hoyt Horse","description":"Posted by Brandon<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/IMG_0622_2.jpg\">NW 23rd and Hoyt, Portland, Oregon<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640omxedv7h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698617,45.527021]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ira Keller Fountain Park","description":"Posted by Dschargel<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/0/ira_keller_fountain_portland_orpl11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/0/small_P1010068.jpg\">Originally the Forecourt Fountain<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640on4c2er5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.679005,45.512617]}},{"properties":{"name":"Joan of Arc statue","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://urbanverb.com\" href=\"http://urbanverb.com\">Jake</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/IMG_04512.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> recently, some vandals threw black paint on it<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640omy7qlyt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.623,45.526374]}},{"properties":{"name":"Le Palais Ideal Du Facteur Cheval","description":"Posted by Brandon<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/Facteur_Cheval___Fa%C3%A7ade_Est.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 26390 Hauterives, FranceThe \"Ideal Palace\" was built by Ferdinand Cheval, who began construction in 1879 after stumbling over a stone and being inspired by the shape of stone.

According to numerous drugged and paranoid friends this volcanic park is meerly \r\ndormant. Asleep for now but soon to awake..... I prefer the more exciting of the two descriptions personally. Mount Tabor Park has basketball courts, tennis courts, a reservoir, hiking and biking trails AND annually boasts the PDX Soap Box Derby courtesy of Beulahland and others.  Right before sunset, bike with friends up belmont and around to the top of the hill, sit on the bench facing donwtown, open your beers and watch the sun set and the lights come up on hawthorne. Then bike down the hill on the other side and stop off at Sapphire Hotel for drinks and food. Tell Sheila Paige sent ya and ask her if her daughter still likes the new bike helmet. I also liked what this web-site had to say about the park. http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Oregon/BoringLavaField/VisitVolcano/mount_tabor.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640on2ano26"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.60185,45.51188]}},{"properties":{"name":"Multnomah County Library","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://www.multcolib.org/images/home_06.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/74195111_c3b68c2d51_t.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/74242874_0be4c1a696_t.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bulgar.no-ip.info/downloads/snimki/wall/Japanese%20Garden,%20Washington%20Park,%20Portland,%20Oregon.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.multcolib.org/books/zines/art/zineslogo.gif\"><img src=\"http://www.multcolib.org/images/home_03.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Get Learned!its the library yeeaaahhh!\r\nbrand new catalog...look for books, cds, dvds, videotapes, books on tape, tapes on books, books about videos, videos about tapes, dvds about places,cds about dvds.\r\nthis is one of the last places on the planet where you can still access information, education for FREE.\r\nI LOVE THE LIBRARY SO SHOULD YOU<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640omqvqq4r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.682567,45.519311]}},{"properties":{"name":"Multnomah Falls","description":"Posted by Bscoti<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/mfalls.jpg\">50000 Historic Columbia River Hwy, Corbett, OR 97019 Plummeting 620 feet from its origins on Larch Mountain, Multnomah Falls is the second highest year-round waterfall in the United States. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640on0iq6x7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.12702,45.575401]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oregon Caves","description":"Posted by Brandon<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/OregonCaves1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/Oregon_Caves_NM_086.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Oregon Caves is a national monument in the Siskiyou Mountains.

It is the one and only Wonder that does not need speculations concerning its appearance, size, and shape. It is the oldest, yet it is the only surviving of the Seven Ancient Wonders. It is the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nLocation\n\nAt the city of Giza, a necropolis of ancient Memphis, and today part of Greater Cairo, Egypt.\nHistory\n\nContrary to the common belief, only the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops), not all three Great Pyramids, is on top of the list of Wonders. The monument was built by the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty around the year 2560 BC to serve as a tomb when he dies. The tradition of pyramid building started in Ancient Egypt as a sophistication of the idea of a mastaba or \"platform\" covering the royal tomb. Later, several stacked mastabas were used. Early pyramids, such as the Step Pyramid of King Zoser (Djoser) at Saqqara by the famous Egyptian architect, Imhotep, illustrate this connection.\n\nThe great pyramid is believed to have been built over a 20 year period. The site was first prepared, and blocks of stone were transported and placed. An outer casing (which disappeared over the years) was then used to smooth the surface. Although it is not known how the blocks were put in place, several theories have been proposed. One theory involves the construction of a straight or spiral ramp that was raised as the construction proceeded. This ramp, coated with mud and water, eased the displacement of the blocks which were pushed (or pulled) into place. A second theory suggests that the blocks were placed using long levers with a short angled foot.\n\nThroughout their history, the pyramids of Giza have stimulated human imagination.

Due to road construction, Mill Ends Park (24 inches across and located at the intersection of downtown Portland\\'s Southwest Taylor Street and Naito Parkway) will be moved 80 feet from its current location. The park will reside in the plaza area of Portland\\'s World Trade Center complex for approximately six months.\n\nAccording to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation officials, a move was necessary to protect the tiny green space from the threat posed by the much larger construction equipment. (What Portlanders won\\'t do to protect the environment.)\n\nWhen the Naito Parkway roadway improvements are completed in six or seven months, the park will be moved back to a new location on Naito Parkway, 7.5 feet east of its current home. The big - or little - move takes place on Tuesday, Feb. 7. Some sort of \"mobile platform,\" perhaps an all-terrain vehicle, will be used to move the park in its entirety. Mill Ends Park, which was dedicated as an official city park in 1976, is one of 200 parks managed by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Note: At this time, the city has no plans to move Portland\\'s 5,000-acre Forest Park. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640omtax6ab"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673286,45.516136]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yellowstone National Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\" href=\"http://www.dirtyeye.com\">Barnaclebarnes</a><img src=\"http://data2.itc.nps.gov/parkphotos/roosveltarch%2Ejpg\"><img src=\"http://www.nps.gov/yell/slidefile/nationalparkareas/Images/04685.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1402.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1395.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.stafney.com/~tstafney/gallery/Other%20Stuff/20030925%20Road%20Trip/IMG_1444.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Long before any recorded human history in Yellowstone, a massive volcanic eruption spewed an immense volume of ash that covered all of the western U.S., much of the Midwest, northern Mexico and some areas of the eastern Pacific.
