I guess you could go at night, but I\\'d rather go during the day when you can see the ocean outside (and the prices are a little lower...) The staff is great. The buffett was out of chocolate covered strawberries, and when we noticed it, we sort of said to each other, \"that\\'s too bad. I really liked those\" or something along those lines. Not 5 minutes later, the waiter shows up AT OUR TABLE with a plate of freshly dipped chocolate covered strawberries. That\\'s what I call service.
