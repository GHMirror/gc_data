Flower St., Los Angeles, CA, United StatesThe Daily Grill story began in 1984, when Bob Spivak, along with his partners Mike Weinstock and Dick Shapiro, opened The Grill on the Alley, a bastion of straightforward, classic American cuisine, located in Beverly Hills.\r\rThe response was tremendous, as The Grill evolved into one of the Los Angeles area\\'s best-known, \"must-do\" places. In 1987, Shapiro, Spivak and Weinstock observed the public\\'s recognition of The Grill, and set out to create a version that would be available to a larger number of people and also less expensive.The result was the first Daily Grill, which was opened in Brentwood, the fashionable neighborhood of Los Angeles. A brief 18 months later, the trio opened the LA area\\'s second Daily Grill, and early in 1991 a third - Orange County\\'s first - made its debut. A fourth restaurant in Encino and a fifth in Studio City soon followed. The sixth Daily Grill debuted in Palm Desert in the El Paseo shopping center (the \"Rodeo Drive of the Desert\") in January, 1994.\r\rIn 1995, the company merged with Magellan Restaurant Systems of New Jersey to become Grill Concepts, Incorporated (Nasdaq: GRIL) and announced plans for major expansion.\r\rIn September, 1996, a seventh was added in Irvine, in California\\'s Orange County. An eighth was added in late 1996, located at Los Angeles International Airport (Tom Bradley International Terminal). More than 8,300 square feet, this Daily Grill is the largest full-service airport restaurant to operate in the United States.\r\rThree more Daily Grills were eventually opened in the Washington D.C. area, and in the summer of 1999, the newest location opened its doors at Citywalk, in the Universal Studios Hollywood complex.\r\rToday, Daily Grills continue their founders\\' commitment to serve big portions of traditional grill recipes, at affordable pri<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62afej5k5uv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.257746,34.049851]}},{"properties":{"name":"Engine Co No 28","description":"Posted by Puckbunny<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 644 S.
