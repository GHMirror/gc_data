The initial brewers crafted McMenamins\\' first unfiltered wheat ales and the first fruit ales (starting with blackberries scavenged from the vines off the parking lot). The Hillsdale is also notable for staging in the mid-1980s what likely was the first microbrew festival in Oregon. Today, the Hillsdale Brewfest, held every February, is considered the Grandaddy of all McMenamins brew fests. Another first at the Hillsdale was Alex Farnum, who was certainly the first female brewer to work for McMenamins and may well have been the first female brewer in Oregon.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a645v7mh4yot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.693493,45.478934]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lucky Labrador","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://www.oregonbeer.org/LL_logo.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 915 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Portland, ORDog friendly, dog-insired 21+ after 9pm<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a645v7npj7wo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.656471,45.51236]}},{"properties":{"name":"MacTarnahan's Brewery","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.portlandbrew.com/images/template_logo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2730 NW 31st Ave, 97210No tours, but 12 beers in the taproom and a view onto the copper tanks hauled over from a Bavarian monestary.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a645v7vp22os"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.713622,45.541611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oak Hills Brewery","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.mcmenamins.com/bin//brewlabels/oakhillslabel.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 14740 NW Cornell Rd, Ste 80, Portland, OR 97229Launched in the foothills of Beaverton in 1990, the Oak Hills brewpub has evolved into one of the companys primary training grounds for brewers.
