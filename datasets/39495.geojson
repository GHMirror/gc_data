It certainly takes a while to find your feet, as you attempt to weave a path through buses, trucks, nippy modern cars, mopeds, rickshaws, cows, bullock carts, hand-pulled trolleys and even the occasional elephant being ridden along with the flow of traffic. You\\'ll find unlikely juxtapositions are everywhere you look: suit-and-tie businessmen rub shoulders with traditionally dressed orthodox Hindus and Muslims; groups of young Levis-clad Delhi-ites pile into burger joints, bars and discos; turbaned snake charmers tease hypnotizing moans out of curved pipes; pundits pontificate while sadhus smoke their chillums; and ragged beggars clutching dusty children plead for a little help towards a meal.\r\n\r\nDelhi\\'s daunting scale becomes more manageable as you start to appreciate that, geographicall as well as historically, it consists of several distinct cities, an amalgamation and expansion of the \"Seven Cities\" of tradition (seven fortress settlements built at different times here by different rulers). The hub of the metropolis is New Delhi, an orderly plan of wide roads lined with sturdy colonial buildings, which was established soon after the imperial capital of British India moved here from Calcutta in 1911. Many of the city\\'s hotels are here, concentrated amid the colonnaded facades of Connaught Place. A couple of kilometres south, the broad, green east–west swathe of Raj Path links India Gate and the Indian parliamentary buildings, once considered to be the architectural jewels in the Imperial crown. Old Delhi, Shah Jahan\\'s seventeenth-century capital of Shahjahanabad, lies 3km northwest of Connaught Place. This is Delhi at its most quintessentially Indian, where the traditional lifestyle of its predominantly Muslim population has changed little over two hundred years. A visit to the mighty Lal Qila or Red Fort and Jami Masjid, India\\'s largest mosque, is a must, and should be combined with a stroll through the area\\'s ancient bazaars, a warren of clustered houses, buzzing with commotion, and infused with aromatic smells drifting from open-fronted restaurants, spice shops and temples.\r\n\r\nFirozabad, another of Delhi\\'s ex-capitals, is centred around Delhi Gate, while the other five former capitals, further south, are today all but deserted, standing as impressive reminders of long-vanished dynasties. Among them you\\'ll find the towering free-standing twelfth-century column erected by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the Qutb Minar – it marks the first capital, Qila Rai Pithora, and signalled the development of the city that visitors see today. Walls and dilapidated pillars survive from the fourteenth-century city of Tughluqabad, and Purana Qila, the sixth capital. Interspersed between these historic ruins are the grand tombs of Delhi\\'s former rulers, plus a plethora of Hindu temples, and domed mosques, introduced by the Muslims, which dramatically changed the conventional mould of Indian cities. Perhaps the finest expressions of the Moghuls\\' architectural genius were the grand charbagh (quartered garden) mausoleums of Humayun\\'s Tomb, and, most famously, the Taj Mahal in Agra. The major monument of the great Moghul period is Lal Qila (the Red Fort) in Old Delhi.\r\n\r\nAs befits a national capital, Delhi, with its many museums and art treasures, cultural performances and crafts, provides a showcase of the country\\'s diverse heritage. Shops trade in goods from every corner of India, and with a little legwork you can find anything from Tibetan carpets, antiques and jewellery to modern art and designer clothes. After years of economic isolation caused by India\\'s draconian post-Independence trading laws, Delhi is enjoying a tremendous economic boom. With plenty of spending money and a new sense of confidence among the wealthier classes, the city now boasts a great nightlife scene, with designer bars, chic cafés and good clubs. Its auditoria host a wide range of national music and dance events, drawing on the richness of India\\'s great classical traditions. Smart new cinemas show innumerable Bollywood and Hollywood movies, while theatres hold performances in both Hindi and English.\r\n\r\nCrafts Museum  \r\n \r\nImmediately north of Purana Qila on Bhairon Marg, the Crafts Museum (Tues–Sun 10am–5pm; free) is a uniquely dynamic exhibition of the rural arts and crafts of India. Its village complex displays an assortment of building traditions, bringing together cultures from across the subcontinent to provide a unique, if artificial, insight into rural life. Authentically constructed mud huts are beautifully decorated with folk art, and exhibits include woodcarvings, paintings, papier-mâché, embroidery and a full-sized wooden haveli from Gujarat. Live demonstrations by the artisans offer close-up glimpses of the folk arts that can be all too difficult to obtain elsewhere in the country. You can buy ritual objects, ornaments, rugs, shawls and books from the craftsmen and women or from the excellent museum shop.\r\n \r\nHumayun\\'s Tomb  \r\n \r\nClose to the medieval Muslim centre of Nizamuddin and 2km from Purana Qila, Humayun\\'s Tomb (daily dawn–dusk; ) stands at the crossroads of the Lodi and Mathura roads, 500m from Nizamuddin railway station (one stop from New Delhi station on the suburban line). Delhi\\'s first Moghul mausoleum, it was constructed from 1564 onwards after the death of the second Moghul emperor, under the watchful eye of Haji Begum, Humayun\\'s senior widow and mother of Akbar, who camped here for the duration. The grounds were later used to inter several prominent Moghuls, and served as a refuge for the last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, captured here by the British in 1857.\r\n\r\nThough later eclipsed by the Jami Masjid and the Taj Mahal, its sombre, Persian-style elegance marks this as one of Delhi\\'s finest historic sites. Constructed of red sandstone, inlaid with black and white marble, on a commanding podium looking towards the Yamuna, it stands in the centre of the formal charbagh, or quartered garden. The octagonal structure is crowned with a double dome that soars to a height of 38m – the inner shell forms the vaulted ceiling. Porches on each side rise to 12.2-metre-high pointed arches, flanked by outer bays and recessed windows with lattice screens of stone and marble. Below the cenotaph, inside the building, are the graves of Humayun and Haji Begum.\r\n\r\nNearby stands the Nila Gumbad (\"blue dome\"), an octagonal tomb with a dome of blue tiles, supposedly built by one of Akbar\\'s nobles to honour a faithful servant, and which may possibly predate Humayun\\'s Tomb. Within the grounds southeast of the main mausoleum, another impressive square mausoleum, with a double dome and two graves bearing Koranic inscriptions, is that of Humayun\\'s barber, a man considered important because he was trusted with holding a razor to the emperor\\'s throat.\r\n \r\nRaj Ghat  \r\n \r\nWhen Shah Jahan established his city in 1638, its eastern edges bordered the River Yamuna, and a line of ghats, or steps leading to the water, was installed along the riverbanks. Ghats have been used in India for centuries, primarily for worship, but also for washing clothes and bathing, and for the final ritual, cremation. Raj Ghat, the site of the cremations of three of modern India\\'s most revered figures, Mahatma Gandhi (1948), Indira Gandhi (1984) and her son Rajiv (1991), is more of a park than a ghat, lying well away from the river bank. Rajiv is honoured by a striking frieze and his mother marked by a red-grey stone monolith. The Mahatma\\'s samadhi, a low black plinth, receives a steady stream of visitors, and he is remembered through prayers here every Friday evening, and on the anniversaries of his birth and death (Oct 2 &amp; Jan 30). Opposite Raj Ghat, the small Gandhi Memorial Museum (daily except Thurs 9.30am–5.30pm; free) houses some of Gandhi\\'s photographs and writings, and on Sundays you can watch a film on his political and personal life (March–Oct Hindi 6pm, English 7pm; Nov–Feb 4 &amp; 5pm).\r\n \r\nOld Delhi (Shahjahanabad)  \r\n \r\nAlthough it\\'s not in fact the oldest part of Delhi, the seventeenth-century city of Shahjahanabad, built by the Moghul emperor, Shah Jahan, is known as OLD DELHI. The original city walls spread for seven miles, enclosing the sprawling fort, Lal Qila, and the formidable Jami Masjid, or \"Friday Mosque\". Old Delhi\\'s main thoroughfare, Chandni Chowk, a seething mass of hooting, pushing cars, tempos, cycle rickshaws and ox carts, was once a sublime canal lined with trees and some of the most opulent bazaars of the East. Today the city walls have crumbled, and of the fourteen old gates only five remain. It\\'s a fascinating area, but you\\'ll need stamina, patience and time to endure the crowds and traffic.\r\n \r\nJami Masjid  \r\n \r\nOld Delhi\\'s red-and-white Jami Masjid (no set hours; free; Rs50 for cameras), 500m southwest of the Red Fort, is India\\'s largest mosque. Soaring above the narrow streets of the old city, it may look huge from a distance, but feels nothing short of immense once you\\'ve climbed the wide staircases to the arched gateways and entered the open courtyard, large enough to accommodate the bending bodies of 25,000 worshippers. It was designed by Shah Jahan and built by a workforce of 5000 between 1644 and 1656. Originally called Masjid-i-Jahanuma (\"mosque commanding a view of the world\"), this grand structure stands on Bho Jhala, one of Shahjahanabad\\'s two hills, and looks east to the sprawling Red Fort, and down on the seething streets of Old Delhi all around. Broad red sandstone staircases lead to gateways on the east, north and southern sides, where worshippers and visitors alike must remove their shoes. Dress conservatively.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the courtyard, your eyes will be drawn to the three bulbous marble domes crowning the main prayer hall on the west side (facing Mecca), fronted by a series of high cusped arches, and sheltering the mihrab, the central niche in the west wall reserved for the prayer leader. The pool in the centre is used for ritual ablutions. At each corner of the square yard a slender minaret crowned with a marble dome rises to the sky, and it\\'s well worth climbing the tower south of the main sanctuary (Rs10) for an unrivalled view over Delhi. In the northeast corner a white shrine protects a collection of Muhammad\\'s relics, shrouded in rose petals and watched over by keepers who will, in exchange for a tip, reveal the contents: two sections of the Koran written on deerskin by relatives of the prophet, a red beard-hair of Muhammad\\'s, his sandals, and his \"footprint\" miraculously embedded in a marble slab.\r\n \r\nQutb Minar Complex  \r\n \r\nAbove the foundations of Lal Kot, settled in the eighth century by the Tomara Rajputs and developed in the twelfth century by the Chauhans, the first monuments of Muslim India are now known as the Qutb Minar Complex (daily dawn–dusk; ), and stand in well-tended grounds 13km south of Connaught Place off Aurobindo Marg; to get here take bus #505 from Ajmeri Gate. One of Delhi\\'s most famous landmarks, the fluted red sandstone tower of the Qutb Minar tapers upwards from the ruins, covered with intricate carvings and deeply inscribed verses from the Koran, to a height of 72.5m. In times past it was considered one of the \"Wonders of the East\", second only to the Taj Mahal – in the words of the Victorian historian, James Ferguson, \"the most beautiful example of its class known anywhere\"; but historian John Keay was perhaps more representative of the modern eye when he claimed that the tower \"[had] an unfortunate hint of the factory chimney and the brick kiln; a wisp of white smoke trailing from its summit would not seem out of place\".\r\n\r\nWork on the Qutb Minar started in 1199; it was Qutb-ud-din Aibak\\'s victory tower, celebrating the advent of the Muslim dominance of Delhi (and much of the subcontinent) that was to endure until 1857. For Qutb-ud-din, who died four years after gaining power, it marked the eastern extremity of the Islamic faith, casting the shadow of God over east and west. It was also a minaret, from which the muezzin called the faithful to prayer. Only the first storey has been ascribed to Qutb-ud-din\\'s short reign; the other four were built by his successor Iltutmish, and the top was restored in 1369 by Firoz Shah, who used marble to face the red sandstone.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the tower lie the ruins of India\\'s first mosque, Quwwat-ul-Islam (\"the Might of Islam\"), built by Qutb-ud-din using the remains of 27 Hindu and Jain temples and the help of Hindu artisans – their influence can be seen in the detail of the masonry and the indigenous corbelled arches. Steps lead to an impressive courtyard flanked by cloisters and supported by pillars unmistakably taken from a Hindu temple and adapted to accord with strict Islamic law forbidding iconic worship – all the faces of the decorative figures carved into the columns have been removed. Especially fine ornamental arches, rising as high as 16m, remain of what was once the prayer hall. Beautifully carved sandstone screens, combining Koranic calligraphy with the Indian lotus, form a facade immediately to the west of the mosque, facing Mecca. Iltutmish and his successors extended the building, enlarging the prayer hall and the cloisters and introducing geometric designs, calligraphy, glazed tiles set in brick, and squinches (arches set diagonally to a square to support a dome).\r\n\r\nIn complete contrast to the mainly Islamic surroundings, an Iron Pillar (7.2m) stands in the corner of the mosque, bearing fourth-century Sanskrit inscriptions of the Gupta period attributing it to the memory of King Chandragupta II (373–413). Once topped with an image of the Hindu bird god, Garuda, the extraordinary and virtually rust-free pillar, made of 98 percent pure iron, is a puzzle to metallurgists. It must have been transplanted here, but its origins remain hazy. Tradition has it that anyone who can encircle the column with their hands behind their back will have their wishes granted.\r\n\r\nAla-i-Darwaza, a mausoleum-like gateway with stone lattice screens, was added by Ala-ud-din Khalji (1296–1316). Its inlaid marble embellishments are ascribed to an influx of Pathan artisans from Byzantine Turkey, and the import of Seljuk influences – the true arches were the first in India. The south entrance to the complex is marked by yet another tower, Alai Minar, which was planned as grander and larger than the Qutb Minar but left abandoned after the construction of its first storey.\r\n\r\nOn a plinth west of Quwwat-ul-Islam, the tomb of Iltutmish, built in 1235 by the ruler himself, is said to be the first Muslim mausoleum in India (Hindus cremate their dead rather than bury them). A relatively plain exterior blending Indian and Muslim styles, with three ornate arches, hides an interior 9m square with geometric arabesque patterns combined with calligraphy and lotus and wheel motifs.\r\n\r\nPerched above the scrubland 150m southeast of the Qutb Minar, the octagonal Moghul tomb of Muhammad Quli Khan, one of Akbar\\'s courtiers, was somewhat bizarrely occupied by Sir Thomas Metcalfe, resident at the Moghul court, as a country house – the first floor above the sepulchre room was converted into a living apartment, and the chamber beneath the dome became dining room. The building now lies in ruins. Another crumbling Raj-era house nearby still boasts a very ornamental English fireplace and swimming tank. Outside the complex, north of the Qutb Minar, Adham Khan\\'s tomb stands on the remains of the walls of Lal Kot. A general in Akbar\\'s army, Khan was hurled from the ramparts of Agra Fort on the orders of the emperor after some murderous court feuding. You can get good views of both the tomb and the Qutb complex from the roof of the Church of St John, an incongruous little chapel with an Anglican nave, monastic cloisters and a Hindu chhapra (tower), tucked down a lane opposite the tomb entrance.\r\n \r\nHauz Khas  \r\n \r\nThe Soho of Delhi, Hauz Khas is a wealthy suburban development, packed with boutiques and restaurants, 12km southwest of Connaught Place. The \"village\", as it\\'s known, is just off Aurobindo Marg (or the Delhi–Mehrauli Road), which leads from the centre to the Qutb Minar Complex, and adjacent to a pleasant deer park. The road through the shopping enclave leads to the ruins of Ala-ud-din-Khalji\\'s large tank (enclosed reservoir) known as Hauz-i-Alai, built early in the fourteenth century to supply water to the inhabitants of Siri, Delhi\\'s second city. It was expanded almost fifty years later by Firoz Shah Tughlak, who added a two-storey madrasa (seminary), and a mosque at its northern end.\r\n\r\nIn among the anonymous tombs scattered throughout the area is that of Firoz Shah himself, situated on the edge of the tank. Its high walls, lofty dome, and doorway spanned by a lintel with a stone railing outside, are fine examples of Hindu Indian traditions effectively blended with Islamic architecture. At dawn every day, the surrounding woodlands and the bed of the immense tank, once the site of Timur\\'s camp, come alive with Delhi-ites out walking, practising yoga and jogging; in the evenings, Hauz Khas\\'s salubrious restaurants attract diners from all over the city.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
