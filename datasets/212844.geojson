She loved to draw, she loved to dance, she loved clothes. She designed costumes for the Roxy Theatre, which gave her expression in each. She learned about light and color and how the body moves -- and she also learned to work quickly and inventively. One show every week an a small budget saw to that. One day she saw an ad in the New Yorker -- a trapeze artist hanging by his toes, about ready to swing out -- the caption read: \"You've got to know when to let go.\"  She thought about that. Her period at the theatre had taught her much, but it was now repetitious, and besides, she yearned to design \"just clothes to wear\". Maybe it was time to let go. With sketch-book under arm, she went to see a woman executive of a leading store. Said the executive a bit sadly, \"My dear, you must specialize -- make up your mind to do sports clothes or coats or hats, or whatever. This is an era of specialization and you must concentrate on one thing -- or you'll never succeed.\" The young designer listened intently -- feeling doomed to be a limited designer -- instead of a whole one. She did want to specialize, she said, in her kind of clothes, for all sorts of occasions!\"","year":1933,"id":"a66hbvec6b9w","geo_precision":"unmatched","image":null,"style":null,"state":"NY"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.005973,40.714269]}},{"properties":{"geo_precision0":"city","biographical":"discovered by Harper's Bazaar by editor Carmel Snow and appointed chief designer for Adler &amp; Adler","company":null,"city":"New York","image source":"http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz0028w3nb","geo_score0":0.857,"image title":"Velvet Blouse Near Fountain with Pigeons","price":null,"theme":"Modern Nomad","geo_score":0.0,"country":"United States","main clothing type":"Separates","quote":null,"year":1938,"id":"a66hbvnjpnkf","geo_precision":"unmatched","image":"2.jpg","style":null,"state":"NY"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.005973,40.714269]}},{"properties":{"geo_precision0":"city","biographical":"costume design for films and custom work for starlettes","company":null,"city":"Los Angeles","image source":null,"geo_score0":0.857,"image title":null,"price":null,"theme":null,"geo_score":0.0,"country":"United States","main clothing type":null,"quote":null,"year":1943,"id":"a66hbvoygewi","geo_precision":"unmatched","image":null,"style":null,"state":"CA"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.243685,34.052234]}},{"properties":{"geo_precision0":"city","biographical":"switches to commercial work after returning from a trip to Paris","company":"Bonnie Cashin Designs","city":"Paris","image source":"http://www.bonniecashinfoundation.org/timeline.cfm","geo_score0":0.629,"image title":null,"price":null,"theme":null,"geo_score":0.0,"country":"France","main clothing type":null,"quote":"\"I don't; believe in \"costume\" for today's living.

It has brought, however, not only excitement, but fears, distrust and conjectures --- and many an inward inventory. On the threshold of space, it seems to me, that more than ever before, our own bit of space --- our own threshold --- looms greater in importance as a needed safety-value against today's pressures. Statistics show that more homes are being built, more furnishings being acquired, more art being sought, more cookbooks being bought, and more social life growing within the home than ever since Victorian times. I, for one, like this. I think it also means that the art of Housewifeliness is standing out as a very desirable glamour occupation -- and well it deserves it.
