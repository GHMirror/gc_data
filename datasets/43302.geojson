Main St, Lead, South DakotaThe story of the famous Black Hills Gold Rush has been told and retold. These accounts include countless history books, numerous fictional novels and most recently HBO’s loosely historical series, Deadwood.\n\nThe times of \"fabulous fortunes\" were sensational, wild, perhaps wicked and short lived. The actual Deadwood/Lead gold rush began in 1875 and ended in 1877. Yet gold was to play a huge role in the area’s history, economy and development for many, many years to come.\n\nToward the end of the big Black Hills gold rush, mining magnate, George Hearst arranged to purchase one of the most promising claims in the Lead/Deadwood area for 0,000 and incorporated it as the Homestake Mining Company. That was the beginning of a story with a list of accomplishments, both technological and civic that is over 126 years.\n\nBefore its closing in 2001 Homestake Gold Mine was the oldest, largest and deepest mine in the Western Hemisphere, reaching more than 8000 feet below the town of Lead. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0yuz9y74z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.765713,44.352181]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mammoth Site","description":"Posted by Paulobear<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/eastdigend.gif\">1800 Hwy 18, Hot Springs, South DakotaMore than 26,000 years ago, large Columbian and woolly mammoths were trapped and died in a spring-fed pond near what is now the southwest edge of Hot Springs, South Dakota.

The Homestead was restored in 1962 by Keith and Dorothy Crew. They started The Gasoline Station in 1973. In 1995 it was rebuilt. Both businesses are still operated by the Crew family.\n\nThe Prairie Homestead is one of the very few sod dwellings intact today. The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the Nation\\'s cultural resources worthy of preservation. In 1974 the Prairie Homestead was placed on this list. It is also an AAA approved attraction. This sod dugout was built by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ed Brown. They were early pioneers who came west looking for land where they could fulfill their dreams. When they reached the grassy prairies near the Badlands they filed on this 160 acres.\n\nThe homesteaders\\' living conditions in the early 1900s were similar to the conditions found in the Eastern United States 200 years earlier. However humble, it was their own and it was home. Many good pioneers survived this kind of living.\n\nWith thick sod walls and a dirt roof, this small bedroom stayed cool in summer and warmer in the severe winters than did the more modern frame buildings that were used here at that time. These little sod shanties and dugouts were common throughout the prairie. Most of them have disappeared, melted away by the prairie rains, caved in and returned to the earth from which they came.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0yv0vuv3j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-101.687611,44.055006]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sitting Bull Crystal Caverns","description":"Posted by Paulobear<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/OLDPHOTO.jpg\">Mt Rushmore Rd, Rapid City, South DakotaIn 1929, Alex and Mamie Duhamel and their sons, Bud and Pete, began exploring and developing an impressive cave located on their property in Rockerville Gulch, a beautiful red rock canyon just east of the old-west gold town of Rockerville. The Duhamel\\'s wanted to share this subterrainean geological treasure with visitors to the Black Hills and began preparations to lead tours through the caverns.\nBlack Elk (center), with friend Iron Hawk (left) and son Ben (right) playing a drum during the pageant. Black Elk and Iron Hawk both were survivors of the Battle of the Little Bighorn where General Custer was defeated.\nWith help from family friend and Lakota medicine man Black Elk, the Duhamels organized the Sioux Indian Pageant to help promote the caverns. The pageant offered a colorful and educational introduction to Lakota custom and culture. Indian families from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation were invited to spend the summers in the Hills participating in the pageant. In fact, it was Black Elk who chose the name Sitting Bull Crystal Caverns and Sioux Indian Pageant as a way to honor his friend and contemporary Sitting Bull, the famous Hunkpapa holy man who camped near the cave in the late 1800\\'s.\nThis relationship with the Lakota people carried over to the Duhamel Trading Post as well. The trading post gave the Lakota people the ability to get needed hardware, clothing, and food in exchange for artwork, crafts, and artifacts. Visitors to the caverns and pageant were given a unique opportunity to purchase these authentic Native American items.\n\t\nIn 1992, Bud was honored with the prestigious Ben Black Elk Award for \"promotion of Native American culture.\" A few years later, at 93 years old, Bud decided it might be time to retire so he turned over cave operations to his grandson, Peter Heffron.

Ceremonies and daily life revolved around sacred reverence for Tatanka\n \nWhere did buffalo originate?\nDuring the Ice Ages, much of the Earth’s seawater froze into glaciers, lowering sea level, and leaving dry land where there was once water. Shallow channels that separated land masses became grassy swales. One such “land bridge,” called Beringia, joined Siberia and Alaska. Archeologists theorize that the first people who came to this continent followed herds of horses, wooly mammoths, and ancient bison across this land bridge. When the ice ages ended, water filled in the low areas, again separating land masses. Of the animals that crossed the land bridge, wooly mammoths and horses eventually became extinct. Only the descendants of ancient bison — the buffalo we know today — survived to traverse the plains of North America in modern times.\n \nHow is a bison different from a buffalo?\nThe American bison is not a true buffalo in the scientific sense of the word, but most people use the word “buffalo” for this animal. Popular usage perpetuates the term “buffalo” even though “bison” is its scientific name. Bison and American buffalo are not two separate species. Here at Tatanka: Story of the Bison, we use both terms, interchangeably. The only true buffalo in the world are the cape buffalo and the water buffalo.\n \nSo, how did bison get the name buffalo?\nFrench voyageurs referred to them as les boefs, meaning oxen. It also could have come from their term bufle or buffe which referred to good buffe, or hide.\n \nWhat are some of the things Northern Plains tribes made out of the buffalo?\nBison were the basis of life for Plains Indians, providing spiritual inspiration, food, clothing, shelter, household items, tools, weapons, and ceremonial items. Plains Indians had over 100 uses for the various parts.\n \nHow many buffalo hides did it take to make a tipi?\nDepending on the size of individual animals, it may have taken up to 18 bison hides to make a tipi for a large family.\n \nHow did Lakota people make a tipi?\nTo make a tipi, buffalo hides were soaked in the brains of the animal as a lubricant to make the fibers of the hide pliable after they dried. This is known as “brain-tanning.” Since there was no thread, native people sewed with “sinew,” or long fibers from muscles located close to the spine, which were shredded into long, thin strips.\n \nHow did a buffalo jump work?\nA spectacular hunting method was to herd bison toward a precipice, or buffalo jump. Hunters working together could spook bison, getting them to stampede over a hidden drop off. Running bison, with no hint about the change in the lay of the land, raced toward certain death. People waiting at the bottom of the jump butchered the animals after they fell.\n \nWhat was a good buffalo horse worth?\nThe Lakota hunter with the fastest, bravest, and most experienced horse could bring home more meat. This meant more prestige in the community; it also meant that horses became an important medium of exchange. A proven buffalo horse was invaluable to its owner and seldom traded. If you owned an average horse, you could trade it for any of the following items considered of equal value:\nA good bow, 20 arrows, and a quiver\nA flintlock rifle\nTwo elk-tooth dresses\nA hide shield\nThree sets of eagle tail feathers\n \nHow many buffalo were there?\nIt is difficult to get an accurate handle on the number of bison that existed before 1800. At one time, experts estimated it to be 60 million. Recent assessments of carrying capacity of the Great Plains estimate that the number was more likely 30 million. At any rate, the population was decimated by hunting — with fewer than 1,000 animals surviving.\n \nHow many years did it take for the near-extermination of the bison?\nThe slaughter and near-extermination of bison did not take place in a few violent years. Large-scale killing began as early as the 1820s with the advent of the hide and robe market, but most of the slaughter took place between the1830s and 1860s. The supply of animals seemed inexhaustible.\n \nWhy were the buffalo slaughtered?\nFor profit. Hides and tongues meant money. Additionally, when Euro-Americans realized that the native culture would change drastically if buffalo were eliminated, it seemed like a concerted effort to eradicate the animal to change the people. In the process of destroying the buffalo population, hunters cleared the way for Westward expansion and the old way of life of the Plains Indians disappeared.\n \nWere the buffalo carcasses just left on the prairie?\nBuffalo hunters, having taken the parts of the bison that were saleable, left the remains behind to rot. Eventually tons of useless bleached bones littered the prairie. In a commercial world, nothing is worthless for very long. Bones, hooves, and horns, shipped to eastern refineries, became bone ash fertilizer or an ingredient in refining sugar. Homesteaders augmented their living by collecting bones that sold for between  and 2 a ton. When Plains Indians could no longer deliver buffalo hides, some of them turned to the bone market, as well. It took one hundred buffalo skeletons to make a ton of bones.\n \nHow did those 100 buffalo survive?\nSome men understood what lay ahead and captured or purchased bison for their ranches. The people who were instrumental in saving this species from extinction included Samuel Walking Coyote, Charles Allard, Michel Pablo, Charles Goodnight, Buffalo Jones, Pawnee Bill, Buffalo Bill, James “Scotty” Philip, and Fred DuPree.\n \nHow many buffalo are there today?\nToday bison numbers are up to over 400,000 animals in North America.\n \nIs it illegal to kill a buffalo?\nIt is not. Thousands of ranches raise bison for their meat.\n \nIs buffalo meat good to eat?\nThe taste of bison is difficult to distinguish from beef. It is darker red and does not have the marbling of beef. Bison meat is a healthy alternative to other meats, with fewer calories and less fat than a skinless chicken breast.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g0yv2pu400"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.699939,44.356628]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thunderhead Underground Falls","description":"Posted by Paulobear<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/thunderheadpics_op.jpg\">10940 W.
