A group of about 45 now pink-skinned students boarded a charter bus that would take them from Regal Palms Resort in sunny Orlando, FL, back to Valparaiso, IN, where the icy fingers of winter were slowly releasing their grip. Everyone was thinking about the poor trade in location and mulling over the almost twenty-four hour trip ahead. One student was beginning to get stir-crazy at only an hour in. This was bad news for those around him who were within ear-shot. A game was made up to keep him occupied, therefore getting his mind off of the thought of the many hours of sitting ahead.There was at least one person on the ride who was enjoying himself though. He was someone who chose to be on these kinds of long drives day in and day out. His name is Tom and he was the bus driver. He is a slight middle-aged man with a high-chipper voice; a voice that loves to utter Roger Rabbit impressions which laughably don’t sound too far off his normal tone. Students get on and off his bus and he always greets them with a smile and a bright hello. Most students like him, but few get to know him as being more than a smiling face and someone to whom they give a quick “thanks” as they hop off the bus. This is okay with most people, but for the inquisitive minded, one may want to know more about the journey of this little driver beyond the bus’ front seat: Where does he come from, how did he get to where he is, and where does he sees himself going?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgje584x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.673553,28.310337]}},{"properties":{"name":"2) Tom's Neighborhood","description":"Posted by Laura886Fort Wayne, INTom was born and raised in Fort Wayne, IN. He saw himself as a farm-boy even though he did not live on a farm. He lived in a mobile home that rested on a spacious two acre plot. For Tom, this plot of land was only good for exploring; he did his farm-work for an older-aged couple down the road. There Tom cared for eight horses and there at the age of eight he milked his first cow, drank his first glass of milk, and fell in love with the couple’s granddaughter. He lived a fairly carefree life back then. This area where Tom grew up was quiet and had a friendly, down-to-earth feel about it. Nobody was in too big of a rush.---Tom felt safe going out to explore the land, which was a great thing because his house was so small. He had a childhood partner-in-crime, Tim, who like Tom, had an interest in history and adventure. Throughout the town there were many abandoned houses, barns, and churches. Together they’d climb into the windows of these windows into the past and let their imaginations run wild. They liked to search for treasures that gave them hints to the building’s past.---This setting was perfect for Tom. He needed places to escape to and feel happy. He was a loved child, but his parents were both busy with work and his siblings were two sisters whose interests did not always line up with his. His stepmother, whom raised him like her own since Tom was two, worked on the line at an automobile assembly plant. She tried to be there for Tom. Tom always felt closer to her than he did to his father who had two jobs: one at Fallstaff Brewery and one as a mechanic at a local motorcycle shop. Tom’s father was not around very much and wanted to “do his own thing”. Along with this disconnected feeling Tom had towards his father, he also had this feeling towards his extended family. It took really dramatic events, like death, to bring them together. He thought much of this had to do with their moving away to other higher-paced places across the country and becoming too busy. ---Soon Tom became busier with activities of his own. He attended a small country high school, Leo High, who’s mascot was a lion. There he played French horn in the band and tried out cross-country. He didn’t stick with cross-country for long though, because he surprisingly found the races to not be long enough for his country-boy spirit of running the fields. So at the age of fifteen he trained and ran his first marathon, in a local race called the TV 33 Marathon. At one point he was able to run in front of one of the cameras. He said his phone was ringing off the hook after that, as many were impressed by the feat. Tom was very proud.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevge0helc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.128889,41.130556]}},{"properties":{"name":"3) Bell's Roller Skating Rink","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 7009 Us Highway 30 E, Fort Wayne, IN---During high school Tom kept busy through both school activities and also through a close friendship he created when visiting a skating rink twenty miles from his house. He met a very sweet girl, who eventually became his girlfriend. She didn’t live very close because her home was near the skating rink. The distance did not deter Tom from seeing her though. Every Saturday morning Tom would get up and bike the twenty miles to the skating rink where they’d meet and skate together. The rink was open from noon to five. Then from five to seven he’d hang out at a local mall and go back to the rink from seven to midnight, when the rink closed. Then early the next morning he’d ride back in time for church.---This went on happily for a while, then tragety hit. Tom’s sweet friend was killed one afternoon while babysitting. The ten-year-old boy she was watching was playing with his father’s gun and accidentally shot her. Tom was only sixteen, and this left him devastated. He backed away from any possible relationship for the next four years, though the effects still lingered on. As if this stage in Tom’s life was not difficult enough, he faced yet another huge obstacle at the age of sixteen. He was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an ongoing illness which causes an inflammation in the digestive tract, especially in the smaller intestines, and can be very painful.---During this time of struggle, Tom was also shown healing and miraculous blessings. One instance that Tom vividly recalls is when he got into a motorcycle accident at this very trying age of sixteen. He was going 30 mph and when the collision occurred. Tom remembered floating gently through the air and being placed on the ground on the side of the road, while his bike was ruined. He left the scene with only a scratched elbow. After revelations of God\\'s presence in his life, at the age of eighteen, Tom gave his heart to God: something he hadn’t done in all his years of going to church.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgo40l4v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.049015,41.069841]}},{"properties":{"name":"4) Red Lobster","description":"Posted by Laura8864825 Coldwater Rd, Fort Wayne, IN---Tom persevered and with the help of God was able to attend college at IPFW. He studied criminal law there. At twenty, Tom was a student cop. Crohn’s disease eventually got in the way of going into this type of profession so Tom went in a completely different direction, towards his love of cooking.---When Tom was in high school he had some experience in restaurants. He was a dishwasher, but had always wanted the opportunity to be filling the dishes with rich foods rather than scrubbing the plates of people’s leftover scraps. So when things did not go as well as he’d have liked with the criminal justice career, he knew where to turn. Tom’s first job as a chef was at Heritage House Smorgasbord. It was a buffet style restaurant with many feel good Midwestern foods. Tom spent three years working in this friendly environment where he was taught the basics and more of cooking.---From the homey Heritage House Smorgasbord, Tom moved on to a more fast paced Red Lobster cooking position. Here things were a little less personal. Tom felt like one in an assembly line of many. Tom looks back proudly on his expertise in the positions he was given though. He wanted to take whatever position he got and be the best he could be at it. Tom’s famous role at Red Lobster was “the fry guy”. It normally took two people to hold this fish frying position, but Tom was a quick and accurate chef and only one person was necessary when he his quick hands hovered over the frying baskets. It was a delicate process, they had to be in for only a certain amount of time: too much or too little and the basket of fish would be ruined. Tom spent much of three years buzzing around these sizzling baskets of seafood.---There found there was a small margin of error with all other areas of cooking at Red Lobster as well. Some meals were made or plated incorrectly. Pieces of the meal were then taking apart and Tom would scramble to find a sampler platter that needed a few fish sticks or onion rings that a messed up meal was not supposed to have. There was a margin of about five minutes that meals could be re-arranged before they’d be taking back to an extras table. The food that couldn’t be used would be placed on a list in the cooking area. When Tom would get a break, he’d look on the list to see what options were available. He’d head back and choose a “mess-up” dish to fill his stomach with some energy for more flipping and frying and tossing and chopping.---After three years here, Tom was offered a position at a Red Lobster in Tampa, FL. When he arrived he felt a little out of place. The hot, steamy tropical environment did not feel like home to him. Tom decided after only two months that he’d much rather live in a place that has four seasons, so he headed back to Fort Wayne. When he got back Red Lobster offered him a management position, but Tom wasn’t too sure if this area was where he’d want to continue his life’s journey.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgbfcx3d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.135688,41.122867]}},{"properties":{"name":"5) Marriott Fort Wayne","description":"Posted by Laura886305 E Washington Center Rd, Fort Wayne, IN---Tom prayed about it and a new position opened up. This position was not at the Red Lobster though. Tom’s new position was as a chef at Fort Wayne’s Marriott Hotel. Looking back Tom saw the move as a shift from glorified fast food, much of which wasn’t from scratch, to a place where cooking was more of an art. At the Marriott, Tom learned the delicacies of finer cooking from the hotel’s head executive chef. From him Tom priceless lessons about drive and energy, but also beauty and creativity. In time, Tom received his own prestigious position: head buffet chef. Two of his major events each week were the extravagant lay-outs served at the Sunday brunch and also the 4-7 happy hour buffets. Tom was given room to be creative with what was being served at the happy hour buffets. Many times he’d be given the task of creating dishes out of left-over ingredients of a previously made dish. Some of his specialties were his famous cheese-stuffed burgers, fettuccini alfredo, and various beef and chicken dishes.---While working as a chef at the Marriott, Tom was able to make some close friendships. Tom found the environment to be an easier to be involved with those around him than at the Red Lobster. His closest relationship was to the head chef, whom he still keeps in contact with today, but he also found close friendships in the restaurant\\'s waitresses. Tom was single and often a cheerful charming presence that didn’t threaten the waitresses. He recalls having to spoil them with positive affirmations and special treats. Tom found that fresh coffee in their systems made them more enjoyable.---There were many exciting yet hectic times for Tom as he worked as a chef at the Marriott Hotel. The hotel was located near Fort Wayne’s Coliseum, which was the concert arena for many big name music stars. The Marriott often was often the temporary home to the stars, many of whom Tom cooked for. Some of them included Morgan Fairchild, the Beach Boys, and the Judds. When these big names came to eat, Tom requested not to know whom he was cooking for because it would turn him into too much of a perfectionist to the point of taking too long or screwing things up.---While Tom enjoyed the life of high-end buffet chef, he grew tired of the high-paced, stressful aspects of this career path. He found himself slowly burning out. So Tom prayed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgie78uq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.138129,41.132867]}},{"properties":{"name":"6) Leo Elementary School","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 10404 Hosler Rd, Leo, INAfter praying about his situation, Tom felt a calling to be with children and be a mentor.  He wasn’t married and didn’t have children of his own, but longed for that interaction.  Through praying and meditating on the situation he thought back to a game he’d play as a child.  He would climb onto his bed and pretend that he was driving a bus full of children to and from school.  Tom recalls playing this game because, as a child, the person who had one of the biggest influences on his life was his bus driver.  Because of Tom’s father’s lack of attention, Tom found a man who cared about him and his daily life in his bus driver.  Tom decided he wanted the chance to give this gift back to children, and so took a position as a school bus driver.  A bus driving position would also give Tom a more low-key job position than the fast paced life of a chef.\r\nEvery day Tom would be a cheerful face for the children to be greeted by as they’d hop on the bus to go to school.  Tom many times hammed it up for the children with his zany cartoon voice impersonations.  The children were good for Tom as well; they gave him a reason to stay young.  He began to notice when children were glum and needed cheering up.  He noticed when children tried to hide their true selves from the children around them.  He picked up on aspects of many of the children’s home lives.  Tom tried to be there for them and make them feel that the bus was a place of comfort and trust.  He wanted them to know that he’d be a listening ear on the ride back from a rough day at school.  Through these interactions Tom became close with many of the children and kept in contact with quite a few of them from grade school into high school.\r\nOne of the most important things to Tom in this position was that he wanted people to know he was different.  When he’d first meet children, he found that they thought he was weird because he had such a cheery attitude for a bus driver.  He wanted others to see in him someone who was serving the Lord.  Tom found that no matter what job he was working at he could find enjoyment in it.  He said that he never had a job he didn’t like.  Each job was a stepping stone to a new place God was calling him.  Tom’s affirmation phrase was “Don’t work for man, work for the Lord”.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgljt7g4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.013864,41.223041]}},{"properties":{"name":"7) Parkview Hospital","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> 2200 Randallia Dr, Fort Wayne, IN---Tom spent thirteen years as a school bus driver. During this time, in 1991, Tom had to take some time off as he was going through a very rough time with Crohn’s disease. He was in great pain. When he went to the hospital about the situation he found himself in a dire situation, with only a fifty-fifty chance of survival. He went through a surgery where three-fourths of his bowels were removed. Tom used this trial as another opportunity to witness to other’s through his positive attitude. He wanted others to see how being a Christian changes one’s life. Tom lifted the spirits of many of those in the hospital also going through serious health complications.---Tom left the hospital with a lighter abdomen and lighter spirits. The effects of his surgery affect his daily life. Tom is a very tiny man, because through the removal of three-fourths of his bowels, food goes right through him. He could eat six-thousand calories a day and still not gain weight. Tom is reminded of God’s miraculous healing despite his rough medical times. He takes each day and the people in his life as wonderful blessings. Tom has learned not to take people for granted for tomorrow is not promised. In the most recent four years Tom has been clear of all major Crohn’s disease related issues.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgapi2jm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.111368,41.096061]}},{"properties":{"name":"8) Carson Beach","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> South Boston---After Tom’s 1991 victory, he started back up bus driving, but this time more in realm of charter bus transportation. This new position gave Tom a chance for adventure and seeing the world outside of the Midwestern city of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Through traveling tours of middle-school, high school, and college age students, Tom has been exposed to many types of vacations. Some that were education oriented, some purely vacation oriented, some service oriented, and some sports oriented. Most of the time Tom participates in whatever activities that group does. Some times he goes off on his own though and does a little spontaneous exploring of his own. One tour that Tom enjoyed in particular was a middle school East coast city tour including: Cape Cod, Long Island, NYC, Philadelphia, Boston, and Washington D.C. The city Tom most enjoyed of these was Boston, Massachusetts. There he’d go on a wondrous whale-watching tour off the Boston Harbor. They’d go out for three hours and breath the salty fresh air, feel the mist of the waves, and gaze across the brilliant blue waters which held the magnificent giants that burst through the surface.---Through tours of the cities, Tom has discovered not only diversity in nature and landscape, but also diversity in attitudes and lifestyles. Every big city has its own quirks. In New York City people keep to themselves. In Philadelphia, people are friendly and approachable. In Boston, people are very busy and the streets are very congested. It is considered among the bus drivers as one of the hardest places to drive; but Tom, as usual, was not detered by a challenging path.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgc28zi1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.047297,42.327522]}},{"properties":{"name":"9) Tom's Farmhouse","description":"Posted by Laura886Fort Wayne, INTom greatly enjoys seeing the world both through the student tours and through the front seat of a bus as he drives across the countryside.  His home base remains in Fort Wayne, Indiana though, the place he had lived practically his whole life, and a place he feels comfortable in.  He now lives on an acre of land in a beloved old farmhouse that he fixed up himself.  There he uses his cooking skills to host dinner parties with his friends.  Also he is known to make a wonderful lemon meringue pie for church get-togethers.  Through his often sporadic schedule, Tom has found that his true friends will always be there for him: many of whom are either neighbors or members of his church that he has gotten close to over the years. \r\nWhile he has lived in Fort Wayne for all forty-three years of his life, there is one thing that would convince him to move: a relationship.  Tom hopes that in the future, he may find someone to share a seat next to him on his journey’s in Fort Wayne or beyond.  Until then he’ll keep on following where God leads.  God will always be with Him; Tom has a chance to be a passenger and let someone else do the driving.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vevgfzmled"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.128889,41.130556]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20755","metadata":null,"contact_name":"laura886","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:laura886","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20755","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20755,platial:user=laura886","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":39309}
