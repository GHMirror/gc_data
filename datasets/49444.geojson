It is extremely hot and dry for most of the year but there are actually some beatuiful sights and wildflowers there.\n\nGenerally, the lower the altitude of a place, the higher the temperatures tend to be. This is especially true in Death Valley, due to the mountains that circle the valley. The valley creates extreme amounts of heat, creating temperatures that are among the highest on earth.

Its name is derived from the nickname for the state of New York. It stood as the world\\'s tallest building for more than forty years, from its completion in 1931 until construction of the World Trade Center\\'s North Tower was completed in 1972. It also holds the record for the longest time as the tallest building in the world, a record most experts agree no existing or future building will ever break.\r\n\r\nAt 9:40 a.m. on Saturday July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel William F. Smith, Jr., who was flying in a thick fog, accidentally crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building between the 79th and 80th floors, where the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council were located. One engine shot through the side opposite the impact and another plummeted down an elevator shaft. The fire was extinguished in 40 minutes.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lzotuifdzz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[74.00639,0.71417]}},{"properties":{"name":"Leaning Tower of Pisa","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://myspace.com/chazisraz\" href=\"http://myspace.com/chazisraz\">Chazisraz</a>Pisa, ItalyThe Leaning Tower of Pisa is a freestanding bell tower.

It was made by all manual labor and a large amount of workers.\r\n\r\nWhen Stonehenge became open to the public it was possible to walk amongst and even climb on the stones. However this ended in 1977 when the stones were roped off as a result of serious erosion now visitors are not permitted to touch the stones, but only walk around the monument from a short distance.
