The data displays the predicted lat/lon, the predicted date and time, and the predicted wind speed in knots. The predicted locations are predictions from 8.27.2008 till 9.1.2008. The predictions come from the National Hurricane Service division at the National Weather Service. The path shows that Gustav is headed toward the Gulf of Mexico and the SE USA.
