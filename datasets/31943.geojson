There was a man with his daughter.\n\nHe was trying to get the shopping done and the daughter was unhappy.  He looked uncomfortable as if this is something he is not used to doing. I had a sense that he missed whoever it was that was not with him. Perhaps it was all in my head; perhaps he was just a man and I am the one who felt lost. In any case, I overheard him say he was looking for a certain kind of peanut butter. He’d been looking quite a while. \n\nI knew where it was and I offered him the peanut butter. He had a surprised look on his face as if anyone offering any kind of help at all is a miracle. He looked again at his coupons (those frightening and confusing coupons) and said yup that was what he needs. He thanked me with gratitude in his eyes that went beyond just giving him peanut butter. He never stopped leaning on his cart. I wonder what the story is. When I warned him about the sugar on the floor, he was even more grateful. I cannot describe it. It’s as if I confirmed that this place was a special place or that people are nice. Am I speaking about Colorado Springs? I don’t know. I went on my way. \n\nCould I have done more? Yes. I realize now I could have gone to the manager and told her or him about the spill in the aisle. I’m still learning.
