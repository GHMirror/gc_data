She was wearing dark clothing, the CHP said, making her less visible in the dark.\n\nCHP spokesman Willie Williford said the woman was probably trying to get to a McDonalds or 7-Eleven on the other side of the highway.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people ... to make a run for it,\" Williford said. \"It\\'s light traffic at that time and they don\\'t realize how fast the cars are going. People say, \\'Oh that\\'s a football field away.\\' Well, a car travels the length of a football field in 2 seconds. I\\'ve personally handled three cases where people have been hit down there.\"\n\nE-mail Peter Fimrite at pfimrite@sfchronicle.com. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a670c2yoqwam"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.23281,38.08527]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Francisco, CA","description":"Posted by Ythtc<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/majicbus.jpg\">SAn francisco, ca<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a670c2vt1yqw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.418333,37.775]}},{"properties":{"name":"Walk San Francisco, your pedestrian advocacy organization","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/wtsd_childrenwalking.jpg\">1095 Market Street, San Francisco,  CAWalk San Francisco is a member based pedestrian advocacy organization that is making San Francisco a more livable and walkable city.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a670c2qcuffr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.412273,37.78052]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/7473","metadata":null,"contact_name":"madamegonzaga","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:madamegonzaga","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/7473","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=7473,platial:user=madamegonzaga","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47486}
