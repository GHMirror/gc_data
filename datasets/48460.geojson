Instead it led to a very narrow dead-end alley, sort of half underground, with a little staircase leading up to a small parking lot. There is a roar here, probably from something to do with the hospital incinerator whose smoke stack rises right above you. The white noise of the who-knows-what bounces off the cement walls around you and you realize that no one across the parking lot on the street would hear your screams if you needed to make them.\n\nIt\\'s the scariest place I\\'ve been in a while. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gi0g5wwu4d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698032,45.530816]}},{"properties":{"name":"Orbit Room Cafe","description":"Posted by Offcampustours<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 1900 Market St, San Francisco<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gi0g3zbvg5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.425002,37.770773]}},{"properties":{"name":"PDX airport terminal corridor","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.confectious.net\" href=\"http://www.confectious.net\">Egoodman</a>Only a few people use the corridor connecting the two terminals of PDX, even though there\\'s an extra-convenient people mover.
