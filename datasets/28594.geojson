the HIEP-THIEN-DAI (Temple of Divine Alliance / Legislative Body)\n\nCEREMONIAL DRESS OF THE HO-PHAP\nDescription : The ceremonial dress of the Ho-Phap includes a full form and a simple form.\n\nFor the full dress form, the Ho-Phap dresses in a uniform like an old-style marshal. He wears a high gold headdress (Kim-Khoi), the top of which ends in the shape of “Tam-Son” (three Mountains) and looks like a trident, as a symbol of his power of command over the Three Heavens of the West of the Nirvana (Tay-Phuong-Cuc-Lac).\n\nOn his feet he wears old-style boots which have the character “Phap” (Esoterism) on the toes.\n\nOver his clothing he wears another vestment which allows the left side of his clothing to be seen. On the spiritual side of Thuong-Pham, his right hand holds the staff “Giang-Ma-Xu” (Rule over Evil) which symbolises the Temporal assisting the Spiritual, while on the temporal side of Thuong-Sanh, his left hand holds the string of beads called “Tu-Bi” (Mercy) which symbolises the Spiritual guiding the Temporal. Around his waist is the three-coloured commander\\'s scarf (yellow, sky blue and red) which symbolises his great power over the union of the three ancient doctrines. Its knot lies right over the belly.\n\nThe simple form of dress is made of yellow silk (the symbol of Buddhism). He wears a head-covering called “Hon-Nguon-Mao” (Cosmo-Genesis or World-Creation) which is 10 centimetres high. On the front of this headdress, the three signs of the three ancient doctrines are embroidered: the “Binh-Bat-Du” (Golden Bowl of Sakyamuni), the “Phat-Chu” (Feather Duster of Purification) and the Book “Xuan-Thu” (Spring and Autumn). Above these three signs is the character “Phap” (Esoterism).\n\nOn his feet are shoes of the type called “Vo-Uu”. They are white and the character “Phap” is also on the toes. Around his waist is the three-coloured commander\\'s scarf just like the one worn with the full dress form.\n\nThe Ho-Phap wears the simple form of dress when he presides over the religious Tribunal, while the full form of dress is kept for days of major ceremonial when he presides from his throne.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av625serr1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[105.803562,15.946665]}},{"properties":{"name":"Capsters Launches Culturally Sensitive Workout Gear!","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/Picture_128.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av6231xijm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.889999,52.369998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Catholicism in the US","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/catholicpriestvestment.jpg\">Catholic Priest Vestment<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av61wx9hpz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.608275,45.138459]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chaderis in Afghanistan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/chaderi.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av61s0yc97"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[67.709953,33.93911]}},{"properties":{"name":"Christan Religious Costume","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/450px_Stoledeacon.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/450px_Stolepriest.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/445px_Vetements_cardinal_Gamarelli.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/WeddingStole12127.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/VisitationStole.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/BaptismalRobesS13_H21.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/DeaconessCrownH117.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/ShoulderCapeH60.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/BishopH51.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/BishopS18.gif\">Deacon stole, Priest stole, Cardinal Vestment, Wedding stole, Visitation stole, Baptismal Robes, Deaconess crown, Shoulder cape, Bishop robes<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av61u7mz53"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.608275,45.138459]}},{"properties":{"name":"Druid Dress and History","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/druids.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/druids@stnhnge.jpg\">Stonehenge  \tInside Out - South: Monday June 23, 2003\nDRUIDS\nDruids at Stonehenge\nStonehenge has special significance to Druids\n\nInside Out takes a look inside the secret world of the Druids. We go back in time to rediscover the true spirit of Druidism.\n\nTo most of us the Druids conjure up images of a mysterious, religious sect wearing strange robes and conducting archaic ceremonies out in the open air.\n\nThe problem is that they\\'re a secretive bunch. They don\\'t write down their ideas nor do they have a Holy Book.\n\nInside Out met a family whose mum became a Druid and looks at how it changed her and her familiy\\'s lives.\nA family story\n\nZoe Brice know better than anyone about having a Druid in the family. Zoe is 28 years old, and by day she works as a housing officer for a local council.\n\nShe and her half brother and sister were brought up by her dad after her mum walked out on the family and became a traveller.\n\nTwenty years later her mum, Denny Price, is the archdruidess of the Glastonbury order of druids.\nGlastonbury Tor\nGlastonbury Tor and the nearby Zodiac are sacred sites\n\nIt\\'s taken Zoe a long time to understand her mum\\'s actions and learn about her beliefs.\nDruid beliefs\n\nTo fully understand Druidism, you need to immerse yourself in ancient history, fantasy, myth and mystery.\n\nThe lineage of the Druid spiritual tradition can be traced back many thousands of years.\n\nThe origins of the Druids were as important religious figures among the Celts, who came to Britain in 1500 BC.\n\nIn this pre-Christian era, Druids acted as judges, doctors, diviners, sages, mystics, and clerical scholars. They were considered amongst the wisest and most respected members of Celtic society.\nDRUIDS -\nTHE DRUID PATH\n\nDruidry fosters the love of the land, earth, and the wild including:\n\n* Love of Peace\n\n* Love of Beauty - the bard and artists within\n\n* Love of Justice - non punitive justice and law\n\n* Love of Story and Myth - the power of mythology\n\n* Love of History and Reverence for Ancestors\n\n* Love of Trees - sacred groves and study of treelore\n\n* Love of Stones - stone circles and crystals\n\n* Love of Truth - wisdom\n\n* Love of Animals - druidry sees animals as sacred\n\n* Love of the Body\n\n* Love of the Sun, Moon and Stars\n\n* Love of Life\n\nThe name Druid itself is connected with the Celtic word for \\'oak tree\\'.\nModern Druids\n\nThere are around 10,000 practising Druids in Britain with Druid orders being spread around the country.\n\nThese Druid orders meet up regularly and continue the traditions of reading Celtic poetry, while dressed in robes and wearing ancient Celtic symbols.\n\nThere are three sets of people who Druids hold in exceptional honour - the bards, the ovates and the druids.\n\nThe bards are singers and poets, and the keepers of tradition.\n\nThe ovates are diviners and natural philosophers.\n\nThe Druids are learned in natural and moral philosophy.\n\nEach of the three groups has specific tasks and jobs to perform.\n\nIn 1989 the Council of British Druid Orders was formed with two or three founding member orders.\n\nThere are now twelve major orders all over the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Glastonbury Order of Druids is thousands of years old with its roots in antiquity.\n\nThere is evidence of early Druid activity in the giant earthworks south of Glastonbury Tor - known as Glastonbury Zodiac - which date back to 2770 BC.\nSpiritual rebirth\n\nDruids are believers in reincarnation. They believe that the soul is immortal and after a person dies, they are transported to the \\'Otherworld\\'.\n\nThey also believe that that person will come back again in another human body.\n\nSome put the growing interest in Druidism over the past decade down to the fact that spiritual concerns are once again coming to the fore in society.\nDruid ceremony\nSome historians claim Druids originated in Britain\n\nThere is also growing interest in the environment and the myths and legends of England.\n\nThis philosophy has proved attractive to a growing number of New Age travellers in the British countryside.\nStonehenge\n\nThe traditional meeting place of the Druids is Stonehenge which is pre-dates Druidism.\n\nDruids claim that their religion has marked the summer solstice at Stonehenge for nearly 800 years.\n\nToday\\'s Druids form their traditional circle around the stones every June, with the conch shell sounding to herald a new dawn and new season.\n\nThe Glastonbury Druids joined their colleagues in this celebration once again this year.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av61ur3uhk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.828721,51.178977]}},{"properties":{"name":"Egyptian Priest","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/priestegypt.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/45924213@N00/492180303/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/212/492180303_6dee97b037.jpg\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av61wnnb7c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.802498,26.820553]}},{"properties":{"name":"Greek Orthodox- transfigurationists","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/hscoufo_l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/zosticho.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/scoufo_f.jpg\">GreeceHoly Transfiguration Greek Orthodox Monastery is one of the sixteen monasteries that currently exist in the United States and Canada under the spiritual guidance of Elder Ephraim.\n\nlder Ephraim is a flesh son and spiritual son (during his early years) of nun Theophano.

pardah, the veil, and zananah, confinement of womenfolk to the interior apartments. The female became a greater liability for the male of the invaded populace who, weakened economically, had not only to feed his female dependants but also to be ready to protect their honour and chastity in those troubled times. This, among other causes, social as well as cultural, led to the practice of female infanticide, as also of child marriage. The state of a widow was the most pitiable. Polygamy was permissible for man, but a woman could not remarry even after the death of her husband. The smrtis enjoined upon the widow to practise sahamarana, lit. simultaneous death, commonly known as sati, by burning herself on the funeral pyre of her husband. Where concession was made and the widow allowed to live on, being pregnant or having infant children, for instance, she remained ostracized from society, submitting herself to rigorous discipline of self-denial.\n\nWith the advent of Sikhism appeared a liberating force in Indian society. Affirmation of the dignity of the human being, male as well as female, was central to Guru Nanak’s teaching. His mystical vision of the immanence of the Creator in all of His creation was concretized in a forceful enunciation of the gospel of equality. Guru Nanak said that all creatures were equal before God and that to make distinctions among them on the grounds of birth or sex was sinful. For women especially, he had many bold and sympathetic words to say. Quoted most often in this respect are verses from Asa ki Var, a long composition sung in sangat in the morning service.\n\n“Of woman are we born, of woman conceived; to woman engaged, to woman married. Women are befriended, by woman is the civilization continued. When woman dies, woman is sought for. It is by woman that the entire social order is maintained. Then why call her evil of whom are great men born?”\n\nIn another stanza in Asa ki Var, Guru Nanak rejects the prevalent superstition of sutak, according to which a woman giving birth to a child remains in pollution for a given number of days, depending upon the caste to which she belongs. Pollution is not in childbirth, says Guru Nanak\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6av61yeri73"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[82.759987,21.125829]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sunni Dress","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/2/sunni_insideiraq.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> IraqSunnis constitute the vast majority of the world\\'s Muslims.
