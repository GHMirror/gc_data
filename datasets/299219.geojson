While talking about   transborder migration from Bangladesh to India  we are   however   aware that   this is a controversial subject. The partition of Bengal in 1947 was the cruelest   partition in the history of the world  and  caused  forced  illegal  migration  from   erstwhile East Pakistan. It is estimated that there are  about  15  million   Bangladeshi  nationals living in India  illegally. West Bengal has a border   running  2 216 km along Bangladesh. The present study highlights push-pull   factors  of  illegal  Bangladeshi migration based on perceptions of respondents   obtained from a qualitative survey done  on the  basis  of  purposive sampling in   Kolkata and 24 parganas and two districts of West Bengal (WB)  an Indian State.   The  economic push factors that motivate people to leave Bangladesh are   instability  and economic depression  poverty  lack of employment opportunity    struggle for livelihood  forced grabbing of landed property from minority group    and  lack of industrialization in Bangladesh.  About 56% of the respondents   expressed that lack of industrialisation/lack of employment/economic insecurity   would be the probable cause of this migration. Among the demographic factors    population explosion in Bangladesh and lowest human development index may   be  the  most important cause of illegal migration from Bangladesh to West   Bengal.  Hindu minority group faced problems in connection with matrimonial   alliances. Educational curricula  which were framed according to Islamic   preaching and curtailment of facilities enjoyed by Hindu minority  group  were   responsible factor for illegal migration  of Hindu minority population. Another   cause  is  social insecurity. Political instability  fear of riots and terrorism in   Bangladesh  inhuman attitude and activities of the political leaders  absence of   democratic rights  Muslim domination  religious instigation by political leaders    insecurity  feeling of Hindus  are the major crucial issues that require to be   mentioned as political push factors. About 59% of the respondents are  of  the   opinion that religious fundamentalists/insecurity of the  minority   group/discriminating  law  and  order  against Hindus may be the factors that   motivated  migration  from  Bangladesh  to West Bengal. In terms of “ethnic   cleansing”  one can witness elimination of groups of minorities  by  dominant   ethnic group  curbing their rights controlling their influence in a state’s system.   Double standards are observed in punishing criminals. Police  officials  do  not   record complaints from  minority  community.  According to 85% of the   respondent economic opportunity in terms of job opportunity  economic security   prevailing in West Bengal worked as pull factors for migrants to West Bengal.   Geographic proximity of Bangladesh and West Bengal  the  linguistics  and   cultural similarities  same food habit  homo-ethnic  climate   belief  of  getting   shelter  cordiality  fellow-feeling  acceptance power of people of West Bengal   have contributed to the movements of population from  Bangladesh  to  West  Bengal.

However  crop failures unrelated to flooding have strong effects on mobility in which households that are not directly affected but live in severely affected areas are the most likely to move.

Many of the contradictions stem from the fact that the heterogeneous nature of Sahelian society both in terms of production system and ethnicity has not been fully taken into account when considering migratory behaviour of different populations. This study considers the relationships between seasonal labour migration and poverty for different Fulani populations in northern Burkina Faso  who represent the spectrum of production systems from pure pastoralist through agro-pastoralism to cultivation. There is a general trend of increasing participation in seasonal labour with increasing household wealth  limited financial and human resources mean that many of the poorer households are excluded from this option. However  the picture is complicated by other economic and ethnic differences among the populations. Agriculturalists are more likely to migrate than pastoralists who face year-round herding demands  and one Fulani subgroup  the FulBe DjelgoBe  is unlikely to migrate at all unless desperate. The impacts of circular labour migration also vary. For a few agriculturalists and agro-pastoralists  migration to the cities brings substantial rewards  for most the returns are small but may still be important. The chances of negative outcomes are much higher for pastoralists. Unless adequate provision is made to cover labour deficits in the migrants’ absence  the costs to domestic production may seriously outweigh any benefits in the long term. In times of hardship  widespread temporary out-migration of pastoralists is usually a sign of desperation and destitution.

These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However  empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such  agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic  economic  social  political  and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change  it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic  economic social and climate change.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Kniveton  D.

The methodology emphasizes the linkage between economic theories and empirical evidence  using econometric tools that are robust to the selection bias.

The structural model of migration decision revealed the importance of migration as a mere survival strategy in the study regions confronted with severe scarcity of natural resources. Results supported that even under the pessimistic scenario where the direct benefits of the regional integration program would go exclusively to the polar economy  households in the Sahel may still benefit from an increased economic attractiveness of this destination. First  because it is seasonal  the increased migration will translate into higher liquidity that enables households to overcome credit and insurance market failures and invest in their main agropastoral activities. Second  an interesting finding is also the role of the unsecured livestock activity as impediment to migration of the pastoralist groups.

But why do people stay in degraded areas while others leave? Why do migrants again leave the environmentally still stable destination areas and why does migration itself becomes causation for new migration? It is obvious that one needs a structural understanding of the environment in the political and cultural context of this region to understand its role as a driver for migration. On the basis of an empirical case-study the impact of progressive deterioration of environmental conditions is embedded in social and cultural structures. Being aware of this is necessary in order to really understand a migration pattern that at first glance could be misconstrued as being purely environmentally induced.

Current meteorological models are coarse grained and not well suited to the complex topology of the Andesâ€”so local-scale information is required for decisions. This article outlines a process for developing new local knowledge that can be used to enhance adaptive processes. This is a three-step process that includes assessment of local knowledge  the development of future scenarios  and the use of participatory research methods to identify alternative adaptation strategies. Initial analyses based on the survey of 330 households in nine communities indicate that northern Alitplano communities are more vulnerable than central Altiplano ones. In both areas  losses from climate shocks are high  but the types of hazards vary by location. The use of local knowledge indicators of climate is declining  and downscaling of climate forecasts is unlikely to occur due to the lack of data points and the large number of microclimates. Participatory mapping and research  where knowledge is shared  are processes that enhance adaptive capacity and are critical to building resilience.

This paper assesses the contemporary significance of migration as populations are affected by the dual impacts of natural environmental variability and structural land-use change in the Kalahari of Botswana. Three study areas  located across the arid to dry-sub-humid climatic gradient  were investigated. These had been redesignated as commercial ranching areas under the Tribal Grazing Lands Policy of 1975. Under this policy  pre-existing populations were to be resettled in specially designated Service Centres that were expected to reduce poverty and improve livelihood opportunities and household food security. The findings of this study reveal that the policy was accompanied by extensive population displacement rather than migration per se as ranch owners exercised their exlusive rights to the land. While some ranch populations moved to Service Centres  lack of infrastructure and alternative livelihood opportunities forced many of them back into ranch areas where many now live as squatters dependent on the goodwill of ranch owners. Thus the policy has not resulted in envisaged sedentarisation  but instead has produced a population of transients involved in a number of highly localised moves. The mobility patterns of absent householders provided some evidence to suggest that  despite rapid urbanisation  rural to urban migration from the study areas was limited  as were associated remittance flows  suggesting that TGLP areas may not be currently integrated within a national migration system. There were significant differences in the implementation of the policy between study areas and these differences have had a considerable bearing on the population's ability to respond to environmental variability. In one of the Study Areas (Ncojane)  severe drought has resulted in a more flexible implementation of ranches  fences had been taken down  and people and cattle were able to move between ranches in search of water and veld products. Population mobility here was thus a significant coping strategy  ironically where commercial ranch owners had reverted back to the old cattle-post system which emphasises circulation and reciprocity.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Sporton  D.

In examining archives  anthropological writings  and the results of field research from an anthropological perspective  Damas provides fresh insights into the policies and developments that led to the centralization of Inuit settlement during the 1950s and 1960s.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Damas  D.","2008":"2002","typ3":"typ6","id":"aabhsx44uj5i","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.6902861595154,45.4209405046496]}},{"properties":{"argentina":"Canada","argentina case study report":"Household access to capital and its effects on drought adaptation and migration  a case study of rural Alberta in the 1930s","buenos aires":"Ottawa","column_7":"This article reports findings from an empirical study of the impacts of drought on rural households in southeastern Alberta  Canada during the 1930s. In that decade  extreme summer heat conditions and low precipitation levels led to repeated crop failures. These extreme climatic conditions coincided with economic recession  falling commodity prices  and rising unemployment to create widespread hardship and suffering across the rural population. Thousands of households adapted by leaving the drought-stricken region and migrating to more northerly regions unaffected by drought  often suffering still further hardship as they reestablished themselves in a new environment. Through secondary research of historical documents and interviews with surviving migrants and non-migrants  this study identifies how economic  human  and social capital influenced the adaptive capacity  adaptation decisions  and migration behavior of rural households and describes how institutional responses affected household adaptation. Differential access to capital in its various forms was a key factor that distinguished households that adapted via migration from those that did not. The findings from this study of historical environment-related population change provide insights that enhance our broader understanding of potential future migration responses to the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and important considerations for policy-makers and planners seeking to build adaptive capacity in rural populations.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Gilbert  G.

The research used comparative analysis of key interlinked factors in this response involving drought/flood events  population  cropland area  farmer revolts  administrations establishment  and land reclamation policies. It draws the following conclusions  (1) seven peaks of migrants–reclamation in Northeast China were evident  most likely when frequent climatic disasters happened in North China  such as the drought–flood in 1851–1859  drought in 1875–1877  and drought 1927–1929  (2) six instances of policy transformation adopted to cope with extreme climatic events  including distinctive examples like changing to a firm policy prohibiting migration in 1740 and a subsequent lifting of that prohibition in 1860  and (3) the fast expansion of the northern agricultural boundary since the middle of the nineteenth century in this area benefited from a climate change trend from a cold period into a warm period. Altogether  over the past 300 years  extreme climatic disasters in North China have deepened the contradiction between the limited land resources and the rapidly increasing population and have resulted in migration and reclamation in Northeast China.

Drawing upon recent contributions to the literature on migration  and political ecological concerns for access to and control over resources  in this paper I present a framework for placing such issues founded on a Foucauldian conceptualization of power. This framework treats environment  economy  and society as both products of and productive of social differentiation  instrumental modes of power  and resistance. These forms shape actors' understanding and negotiation of their social  economic  and environmental contexts  and therefore their migration decisionmaking. I illustrate the application of this framework through the example of three villages in Ghana's Central Region  where rural environmental and economic changes appear to have driven a complex pattern of outmigration over the past thirty-five years.

The literature suggests  that the severe droughts of the early 1970s and mid-1980s  were the driving force behind this southern expansion of  mobile livestock raising. The conventional view is that  drought forced herders to seek greener pastures to the  south  an area that zebu cattle have previously avoided  because of the presence of tsetse flies  the vector of animal  sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). This “sudden push”  hypothesis places Sahelian herds in savanna pastures in a  matter of a 1–3 years. This stimulus-response model runs  counter to our observations and understanding of the social  and ecological processes influencing FulBe herd movements.  We challenge the “sudden shift” thesis at the  regional scale by arguing that the southerly expansion of  FulBe herds has proceeded according to a more complex  temporal frame that includes generational  biological  and  social historical timeframes and periodicities. We distinguish  between short-term shifts (“test movements”) and  more permanent shifts (“migration movements”).

An important aim of the project is to analyze the determinants and effects of the migration decision at the household level to be able to support the development of appropriate prevention  assistance and resettlement policies.  In this paper  we first develop a framework for analyzing the factors which have an impact on the household’s decision to stay in or migrate from a tsunami-affected  risky area.

In a second step  it is analyzed to what extent the same factors determine the probability of a household to receive financial  material  or psychological support.   The results of the regression analysis indicate that especially households who have been affected by the tsunami to a great extent (e.g. by a high number of dead  missing or seriously injured household members)  or households who have had bad experience with the sea already before the tsunami are more likely to migrate than others. Having relatives at a possible new place as well as having received financial and/or material support like tents or tools also both have a “pushing” impact on the household’s decision to leave the area. This implies that most current support schemes encourage people to leave the high-risk areas. Factors which decrease a households’ likelihood of migration are higher education  good access to information and the ownership of land and house  as well as support programs providing households with building material.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Grote  U.

We then use the estimated semielasticity to explore the potential magnitude of future emigration.

Long periods of over-exploitation due to population growth and poverty inevitably result in land degradation  sometimes irreversibly altering the carrying capacity of the land. This phenomenon  known as desertification  currently affects 3.6 billion hectares  the equivalent of one-quarter of the world’s total surface. The Commission on Immigration Reform [CIR] requested this preliminary study of environmental degradation related to unsustainable land and water use as one of the potential root causes of certain migration from Mexico to the United States. Perhaps as with no other country  migration from Mexico raises critical issues within the Commission’s mandate. The 2 000 mile border between Mexico and the United States historically has been porous. In the past thirty years the U.S. has deported more than seventeen million illegal Mexican immigrants. The large wage differential between the two countries and extensive migrant networks act as an enormous “pull” in motivating migration. The poverty and economic disparity in Mexico are strong factors which “push” migrants toward the U.S. Trade relations and the exchange of goods and services across the border heighten the need for stable relations with Mexico. Thus  migration from Mexico will continue to be an important focus for foreign policy development and  specifically  of concern to the Commission. The findings contained in this report suggest that serious impairment of Mexico’s agricultural lands may give rise to migration. There is evidence to suggest that a portion of the 900 000 persons who migrate annually from the arid and semiarid regions of Mexico do so because of the desertification processes which yearly impair 1 000 square miles of surface area and cause the abandonment of another 400 square miles of farmlands. As environmental degradation can often be addressed through targeted intervention  this report presents recommendations for future action by the Commission and/or Congress that go beyond reform of traditional migration policies and institutions. It identifies specific issues for further study and policy development as a first step in addressing Mexican migration related to desertification.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Schwartz Leighton  M.

Scientists claimed there were millions of “environmental refugees” in the late 1980s. The discussion of the links between environmental change and migration have since then been widely debated  especially because of the lack of empirical data on the linkages of the environment and migration. Within the last years the Nobel price winning International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC  2007) raised awareness about future impacts of climate change and stated that extreme weather events will occur more frequently and the number of people affected will be highest in the low-lying deltas of Asia and Africa.  Heavy rain in south eastern Africa in early 2008 flooded the low-lying river areas along the Zambezi River in Central Mozambique and displaced up to 80 000 people -- the second such occurrence within two years. This number adds to tens of thousands of people already displaced from floods and cyclones during 2000  2001 and 2007. Flooding in Mozambique provides a picture of the vulnerability many developing countries experience vis-à-vis extreme climate events. Resettlement has become a policy of last resort for a government trying to ensure safety in a populated area. Mozambique has in recent years become a prominent example of environmentally induced displacement/migration caused by flooding  and the efforts of a government to balance the safety of threatened people with the need to earn livelihoods on floodplains. Hence  this paper aims to understand the impacts of current extreme weather events  especially for a region of the world where the population is surviving via subsistence economy. This paper intends to decrease the lack of data on the linkages between the environment  displacement and migration and identify the major issues in dealing with these impacts.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Stal  M.","2008":"2011","typ3":"typ6","id":"aabhsx6d9mwq","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.4861111,-14.5027778]}},{"properties":{"argentina":"Niger","argentina case study report":"Niger","buenos aires":"Niamey","column_7":null,"geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Afifi   T.","2008":"2008","typ3":"typ6","id":"aabhswyh2z3u","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.5822235,14.8251685]}},{"properties":{"argentina":"Nigeria","argentina case study report":"Migratory Responses to Agricultural Risk in Northern Nigeria","buenos aires":"Abuja","column_7":"We investigate the extent that Nigerian households engage in internal migration to ensure against ex ante and ex post agricultural risk due to weather-related variability and shocks.

Long-distance moves are predicted by perceived declines in productivity  but the effect is weaker than in the model of short-distance mobility and even this effect is confined only to lower and non-Hindu castes. No other environmental characteristics affect the odds of making a distant move  thus casting doubt on the utility of the concept of environmental refugees in explaining interregional or international migration.

The forecasts are based on available data series  and on a Delphi survey of experts undertaken in the previous stage of the research project (‘Delphi Survey and Projection of Immigration to the UK with Particular Reference to Environmental Mobility’) commissioned by the Government Office for Science (GO-S).  In this part of the project  two types of models were considered. First of all  multivariate – vector autoregressive – (VAR) models were estimated  based not only on immigration  but also on four demo-economic determinants  global population growth  global old-age dependency ratio  gross national income (GNI) per capita in less developed countries  and GNI ratio between the richer and poorer countries of the world. The VAR models served as a basis for producing conditional forecasts of immigration  under four scenarios of the above-mentioned determinants adopted from another study (GO-S 2011). The second modelling approach comprised an ensemble of univariate – autoregressive – models (AR)  which relate immigration to its past history. In this case  formal methods of averaging forecasts yielded by various models were applied. In both approaches  forecasts of environmental migration were obtained as a fraction of the total immigration to the UK  and were fully expert-based.  In terms of central (median) tendencies  both models predict a decline in total immigration to the UK  from the current levels of 567 000 a year to either about 210 000–220 000 (VAR model) or about 332 000 (averaged AR forecasts) by 2060. The former result  however  involves extremely large predictive uncertainty and is therefore problematic in the context of policy planning. By contrast  the uncertainty of the averaged AR forecasts is much less  although still substantial. Clearly  however  the prediction error of such uncertain processes as migration when looking 50 years ahead would be expected to be large.  The most important output from the current forecasting exercise for the GO-S is a probabilistic estimate and forecast of environmental migration to the UK  with the surrounding uncertainty  the large magnitude of which is one of the key findings of this study. The univariate model presented in this paper suggests that there is a high likelihood that environmental immigration may increase slightly over the next few decades  but that the trend is less likely to be one involving ever-increasing numbers.  If policy makers were to use the median univariate forecast  then they would be thinking of the UK receiving between 25 000 and 27 000 people annually for environmental reasons between 2030 and 2060. Compared with the average expert estimates from the Delphi survey for current environment-linked mobility to the UK  this would represent a relatively small increase on the present day  and would still remain only a small percentage of the total immigration flow. Despite the surrounding – immanent and inescapable – uncertainty  which needs to be borne in mind when interpreting the results  we believe that this median estimate is useful to policy makers  providing the first serious attempt to quantify levels of environmental migration to the UK. Nevertheless  as researchers  we also recommend that policy makers pay attention to other possible futures  given the great uncertainty associated with forecasting environmental mobility. We believe that planners ‘with foresight’ should also consider the implications of the possible departures from the median trajectory  also presented in this report  even though some might interpret them as less probable. In terms of further applications of the results presented in this report  we argue that they can be useful both for scenario setting  as well as for a cost-based decision analysis of environmental immigration to the UK from now until 2060.","geo_score":0.714,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"McCollum  G.","2008":"2011","typ3":"typ1","id":"aabhsx1is98r","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.75,8.5833333]}},{"properties":{"argentina":"US","argentina case study report":"Finding Ways to Move  the Challenges of Relocation in Kivalina  Northwest Alaska","buenos aires":"Washington D.C.","column_7":null,"geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Adams  P.","2008":"2011","typ3":"typ6","id":"aabhsx0ucbty","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.9666667,18.8833333]}},{"properties":{"argentina":"US","argentina case study report":"Island abandonment and sea-level rise  An historical analog from the Chesapeake Bay  USA","buenos aires":"Washington D.C.","column_7":"Small islands are widely agreed to be vulnerable to human-induced sea-level rise during the 21st century and beyond  with forced abandonment of some low-lying oceanic islands being a real possibility. A regional abandonment of islands in the Chesapeake Bay  USA provides an historical analog of such vulnerability as this has been linked to a mid 19th Century acceleration in relative sea-level rise. Using a case study approach for Holland Island  Maryland  this hypothesis was tested using a range of physical and human historical data. While sea-level rise was the underlying driver  this analysis shows that the abandonment was more complex than a direct response to sea-level rise. Between 1850 and 1900  Holland Island was a booming community and population increased from 37 to 253  with immigration causing the majority of the increase. At the same time  the upland area where people made their homes was steadily diminishing  losing about 15 ha or 38% of the total. After 1900  the island experienced a decrease in population to 169 in 1916  with final abandonment in 1918  with the exception of one family who left by 1920. Final abandonment was triggered by this depopulation as the population fell below a level that could support critical community services  and the community lost faith in their future on Holland Island. It is likely that similar social processes determined the abandonment of the other Chesapeake Bay islands. Looking to the future  it shows that many small low-lying islands could be abandoned due to sea-level rise long before they become physically uninhabitable.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Arenstam Gibbons  S.","2008":"2006","typ3":"Typ5","id":"aabhsx83r8vn","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.9666667,18.8833333]}},{"properties":{"argentina":"US","argentina case study report":"Dynamic modeling of environmental amenity-driven migration with ecological feedbacks","buenos aires":"Washington D.C.","column_7":"Environmental amenity-driven migration presents a double-edged sword to policy makers concerned with both economic and ecological sustainability. Clearly the protection of environmental amenities is important  but what is the right balance between ecosystem protection and regional economic processes that simultaneously respond to and degrade ecological resources? We consider this question in the context of households that are attracted to a region by urban and lake amenities and a lake ecosystem that becomes degraded by land development. An analytical expression for the time evolution of population is derived from households' and firms' optimizing behaviors. Numerical methods with phase plane diagrams are used to study the steady state and transient dynamics of the resulting population-phosphorus coupled system. The system is found to be bi-stable under a range of parameter values with one attractor corresponding to a desired “balanced” economy-ecology state and the other to a very small population base with fully restored ecology. We examine the dynamics and quantify the resilience of the system in and away from the balanced steady state using phase plane diagrams that demarcate the two domains of attraction. Economic-ecological interactions fundamentally alter regional economic dynamics and influence the resilience of the balanced domain of attraction. For example  a one percent increase in the loadings coefficient associated with residential land development generates a three percent decline in the resilience of the balanced state. We find that economic feedbacks often increase system resilience. Initial increases in the attraction of urban amenities spur greater population growth that increases the resilience of the balanced state. In addition  price feedbacks that arise from capitalized (dis)amenities increase the resilience of the system to bad ecological shocks.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Chen  Y.

Du point de vue des discours  notamment médiatiques  le village est en voie d’être déplacé. Par contre  du point de vue de l’analyse des pratiques  la relocalisation du village semble bloquée pour une période indéterminée. En d’autres termes  un projet visant à améliorer la qualité de vie des habitants locaux a généré des effets inattendus  tel que le blocage du processus  la frustration des habitants  ou le manque de volonté de s’investir dans le projet. Cette situation paradoxale peut être décrite grâce à la notion de « motionless relocation » ou relocalisation immobile. Les causes de ce blocage sont à chercher dans la relation entre le personnel des administrations impliqué dans le projet et les activistes de la relocalisation  un groupe composé d’habitants et de dirigeant locaux de Kivalina. Ce travail montre que le changement climatique  souvent pensé comme une cause direct de la relocalisation  vient en fait s’ajouter à des dynamiques locales préexistant le projet actuel de relocalisation. Au final  les habitants de Kivalina sont présentés comme des agents actifs du changement social  plutôt que des individus écrasés par le poids des structures institutionnels.    Résumé anglais    Kivalina is an old Iñupiaq summer camp located on the southern end of a barrier reef island in Northwest Alaska. The location was transformed into a colonial settlement during the early 1900s. The population and the size of the village have been growing ever since then. For the last two decades  Kivalina residents have been experiencing significant local environmental changes and hazards such as severe erosion of the island. The situation has led to administrative  political  and engineering procedures which aim to relocate the village  or part of it  to a safer place. This process  more than an isolated event in the history of the village  can be seen as a long term chain of events that stretches over the second half of the 20th century. This process has been marked by periods of advances and other ones of blockages. Each generation of relocation activists for the last fifty years had to deal with relocation. On the level of discourses  the relocation is underway  while practices’ analysis shows that the village will remain on its actual location for an unknown period of time. In other words  the planning and the realization of a relocation project designed to improve living standards of Kivalina inhabitants has generated side effects. This paradox can be described as a situation of blockage  which crystalizes various representations of how the relocation should be undertaken. The current situation of the process can be described as a motionless relocation. I argue that the causes of the blockage are to be found in the individual and institutional relationships between the relocation activists composed of Kivalina leaders and residents  and the regional  state  and federal personnel involved in the relocation process. Furthermore  this work shows how climate change often thought to be the direct cause of relocation is in fact adding to existing local realities. At the end  Kivalina residents are not passive recipients of government interventions. They are rather participant actors of change.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Durrer  P.","2008":"2011","typ3":"typ6","id":"aabhsx4v8yxr","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.9666667,18.8833333]}},{"properties":{"argentina":"US","argentina case study report":"The long history of environmental migration  Assessing vulnerability construction and obstacles to successful relocation in Shishmaref  Alaska","buenos aires":"Washington D.C.","column_7":"Migration decisions are complex and are linked to multiple vulnerabilities  including changing ecological conditions precipitated by climate change.

Our research examines the case study of Shishmaref  Alaska  where relocation as an adaptation strategy to changing ecological conditions is the only sustainable option. We find that the colonial history in Shishmaref is explicitly linked to contemporary exposure to hazards and increased vulnerability. We further assess obstacles to a State sponsored relocation. These obstacles include disaster response protocol that does not adequately accommodate climate change scenarios. Relocation planning is further complicated by feelings of mis- and under-representation of local voices in political arenas. This case demonstrates the interrelatedness between historically constructed vulnerability and obstacles to adaptation planning.

In the context of disasters  much of the empirical research has focused on identifying places and populations that are vulnerable to catastrophic hurricane and flood disasters. However  there have not been parallel efforts to capture measures for displacement risk. This article seeks to fill this gap by focusing on (1) a preliminary conceptualization of displacement risk  (2) a set of related indicators and measures at various scales  including indicators tapping policy capacity and commitment  and (3) development of an operational displacement risk index (DRI) and results for a snapshot year of 2007. The study area  158 counties in the United States  was the coastal portion (an area two counties “deep”) of eight states. Findings suggest that the mean levels of DRI scores were much higher for coastal counties. Clusters of the highest DRI scores are particularly evident for coastal counties of Florida  especially the South Florida counties of Miami Dade  Monroe  Palm Beach  and Broward. Florida also scores high in terms of the top ten most vulnerable counties (i.e.  7 of the top 10) as well as exposure to hurricanes (i.e.  6 of the top 10 counties with the highest probability of hurricane strikes). Despite the limitations explained in the paper  we hope that the creation of the DRI has helped to fill a gap in knowledge and will lead to higher level theoretical and research discussions on the population displacement phenomenon  its determinants and planning and policy interventions.","geo_score":0.857,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Esnard  A.-M.

Initial research into the current dynamics of population displacement and migration linked to flooding in the upper reaches of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta was carried out in late 2007. Annual cyclical flooding in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam is a regular event and essential to the livelihoods of people living in the region. Over the last decade  however  there have been unusually large flooding events in the Mekong Delta region which have adversely impacted the lives and livelihoods of local communities. The research aimed to determine whether flooding could be considered a cause for migration or displacement. Results show that the impacts of regular flooding of the Mekong Delta can trigger independent household or individual migration decisions and are a cause for government-initiated resettlement of households. This research contributes to an increased understanding of the role of environmental change/degradation in causing displacement and migration  since forced migration and migration studies have more commonly focused on economic  political and social reasons for population displacement.","geo_score":0.714,"irianni  m. g.  maria celia   velázquez  guillermo angel   fernández equiza  ana maría   alvarez  gila oscar":"Dun  O.","2008":"2011","typ3":"typ6","id":"aabhsxbsp90n","geo_precision":"zip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.3276042938232,48.2328489341095]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":112,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-15T02:06:09-04:00","id":299219}
