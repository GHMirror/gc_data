When we were little it was the stupid things that kept us from just moving on to different friends as we grew up and changed. Things like how we had the same first name, our dads worked in the same place,  our cats had the same name, we had the same birthday. 10 years later our cats have both died, our dads no longer work there and we relize that the same birhtday is 4 years apart, yet we are still friends. Now our relationship is based on how we have a lot of the same memories, we have a lot of the same friends, he lives next door to my best friend, and the fact that we have been friends for so long that I don\\'t think either one of us would know what to do is we weren\\'t. As he gets older I see more and more of his dad in him, especially in his sense of humor. He\\'s a awesome guy and somebody that you only run across once in your life so you better sieze the moment. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67zflyu7rrb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.699674,40.85234]}},{"properties":{"name":"Belmont Elementary school","description":"Posted by Erinmichele<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/bel_close.GIF\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 3425 n 14th st 68521 lincoln neThis was the first school I ever attended starting at the age of 7 (I homeschooled before that).

My brother inlaw being a big fan gote excited and bet me 0 that I couldn\\'t get him to talk to me. So the night went on and I couldn\\'t get him to make eye contact and I had finally given up since he wouldn\\'t look at me and I thought it would be rude to walk up to him. On our way my sister stopped to do something and I sat on the coaches in the lobby with my brother inlaw as soo as we sat down guess who comes walking towards us? Of course, so I jump up and intoduce myself while my brother inlaw almost falls out of his seat laughing so hard. He explained the situation to him and paid up! :-D So that obviously was an amazing first impression (0 is a lot to a little kid).
