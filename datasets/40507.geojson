He is also a talented businessman whose wealth ranks him in the lower part of the Fortune 500 list.\n\nArchangel has fully feathered wings that span 16\\' and have a very flexible skeletal structure. He can fly by flapping his wings, and can reach speeds of up to 150 mph. Though he generally flies below the height of clouds at 6,500 feet, Archangel can reach a height of 10,000 feet with little effort. His wings are strong enough to carry aloft at least 200 pounds in addition to his own body weight. Archangel\\'s entire anatomy is adapted for flight, having hollow bones; a body virtually devoid of fat, granting him enhanced proportionate muscle strength; eyes that can withstand high-speed winds; enhanced eyesight enabling him to see at distances far greater than the average human; and a special respiratory membrane that extracts oxygen from the air at extreme velocities and altitudes. Since his secondary mutation, Archangel can heal fatal injuries and cure most known diseases at an accelerated speed by mixing his blood with that of the victims, so long as they have a compatible blood type.\n\nAfter genetic alteration by Apocalypse, Archangel\\'s feathers were composed of a razor-sharp organic steel-like material. He could expel these feathers at great speed and with tremendous force, enabling them to pierce even steel. The feathers were tipped with a paralyzing chemical generated by his body to which he was immune. He also briefly possessed the ability to convert his life-force into solid light to form a pair of energy wings. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g3pnvcxjs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Batman, Gotham City","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Gothammap.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/BatmanDarkNight288.jpg\">Gotham CityGotham City is a fictional city based on New York City and is the home of Batman.\n\nReal Name: Bruce Wayne\n\nFirst Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (1939)\n\nCreated By: Bob Kane\n\nPublisher: DC Comics\n\nTeam Affiliations: Justice League of America (JLA)\n\nCurrently Seen In : Batman, Detective Comics, Superman/Batman, Justice League of America, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight, Batman: Gotham Knights\n\nPowers: \nMaster detective.\nTechnological gadgets.\nKeen strategist.\nKnowledge of many martial arts.\n\nInteresting Fact: Batman had files on each and every member of the Justice League of America, with key information on how to beat his own teammates.\n\nOrigin: Bruce Wayne is the sole survivor of the Wayne family.

Steve Rogers was given another chance to serve his country though, as a General overheard his rejection and offers Steve a chance to fight the Nazi’s by being a part of a top-secret experiment. Steve agrees. Steve was given a super-solider serum and was blasted by radiation. After the process, Steve’s body was no longer sickly and frail but the pinnacle of human perfection. Unfortunately, the plans for the super-soldier serum were lost when a Nazi spy killed the scientist who kept the plans secreted away in his mind. Steve underwent extensive training and was soon put into action as Captain America, fighting Hitler and the Nazi oppressors. But his work was soon cut short when fighting Baron Zemo. Tied to a rocket with his sidekick, Bucky, Captain America was too late in freeing the two and the rocket exploded, killing Bucky and sending Captain America to what seemed to be an icy grave in the harsh Atlantic Ocean.

He was content to live there with his family, most importantly his sister Illyana, whom he loved and protected dearly. It was there that Professor X found Colossus and convinced him to join The X-Men. Peter grew to feel at home with The X-Men. In particular, he developed a relationship with Kitty Pryde, Shadow Cat.\n\nHis devotion to Illyana would come to a head when she died to the Legacy Virus, a Virus that was designed to kill mutants. Stricken with grief, Colossus left The X-Men to join Magneto and his Acolytes, but later rejoined The X-Men. Dr. Hank McCoy – The Beast – found a cure for the Legacy Virus, but would need a mutant to give up their life to disperse the cure quickly. Colossus injected himself with the cure and appeared to die, saving the mutant population.\n\nInstead, an alien by the name of Ord had abducted the nearly dead Colossus and revived him.

His mother pushed Scott and his brother Alex (Havok) out of the plane with the only parachute. Unfortunately, the parachute caught on fire and Scott hit his head, putting him into a coma and caused brain damage. Alex was adopted and Scott spent months in a coma, only to be sent to an orphanage when he awoke.\n\nLater, Scott’s mutant powers awoke to devastating effect. It would seem that the brain damage he suffered from the plane crash affected his ability to control his mutant powers. Scott unleashed a torrent of energy and blasted a crane apart and onto a crowd. A subsequent blast from Scott saved the crowd, but instead of praise, Scott suffered their anger and fear as they tried to pursue him. Scott fled and was eventually approached by Charles Xavier.\n\nCharles asked Scott to become the first in his new school for gifted youngsters.

He notes: \"Bharat and Antrikshak, Dr.John\\'s robots, were with him in most of the space sojourns.

This energy can be used to do just about anything the wielder can imagine, from blasting a ray of energy like a laser, protecting the user with a force field, allowing them to fly, and even create solid objects.\n\nMost wielders bring their own personality into the projection of their power such as John Stewart an architect whose green creations are extremely detailed to the smallest rivet of a structure. Others, like Kyle Rayner are through the eyes of an artist and are highly creative. In Hal Jordan’s case, his tend to be more forceful and less streamlined, but by no means less powerful. In fact, Hal is considered to be the greatest Green Lantern that has ever wielded a ring.\n\nThe downside to the rings is that they are not unlimited in power. The rings must be recharged up to full power. They do these with a device called, “The Green Lantern”. This is a lantern that is, of course, green and when the wielder puts the ring in the lantern and says,” In brightest day, in darkest night, No evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil\\'s might, BEWARE MY POWER ... Green Lantern\\'s Light! ,“ the ring is restored to full power.\n\nAt the beginning of the Green Lantern comics, the rings were inactive against the color yellow. This was because an entity known as Parallax was imprisoned in the Central Battery. Parallax is a creature that feeds off of fear, and that fear comes across as the color yellow. During the “Green Lantern Rebirth” mini-series, the lanterns learned to overcome this flaw in the rings. In overcoming fear, the color yellow holds no bar to them.\n\nInteresting Fact\nWhen Hal Jordan was removed as the current Green Lantern. A group of fans got together and formed the organization H.E.A.T., which stands for Hal\\'s Emerald Advancement Team.\n\nOrigin\nHal Jordan was a fighter test pilot for the Air Force. That all changed when on one day, he was mysteriously transported to a crashed spaceship. There he met Abin Sur, a Green Lantern. Abin Sur was dying and offered Hal the opportunity to succeed him. Hal Jordan accepted.\n\nWith the ring in his possession, Hal Jordan became the greatest member of the Green Lantern Corps. He became a founding member of the Justice League and has helped save the world countless times.That changed when Hal couldn’t save his hometown, Coast City, and it was destroyed by the villains Mongul and a Cyborg Superman, killing millions. This event shattered Hal and sent him on a dizzying course of destruction.\n\nHal tried to use the power of his ring to bring back Coast City and its citizens. But the Guardians of Oa, the leaders of the Green Lanterns, forbade him to do it. This sent Hal on a mission to get the full power of the ring from the Central Battery on the planet Oa. Hal seemingly went mad, when a parasite creature entered his body and Hal stopped calling himself Green Lantern, and emerged as Parallax.\n\nHis mission to restore Coast City destroyed most of the Green Lanterns and Guardians of Oa. Parallax was set to redo history as he saw it with the full power of the Green Lantern Central Battery, but the heroes of the DC universe stopped him. Alongside those heroes was the last of the Green Lanterns, newly appointed Kyle Rayner, who was given the power ring by Ganthet the last of the Guardians.\n\nIn the end, Hal, as Parallax, sacrificed himself when a giant alien was devouring the sun. Hal used his powers to reignite the sun and in doing so sacrificed his life as well. His spirit went and became one with the Spectre. An avenging spirit of God who righted wrongs and persecuted the guilty. Hal’s penance had begun.\n\nBut this was not Hal’s end. It was discovered that Parallax was an ancient enemy of the Green Lanterns and was imprisoned in the Central Battery for eons. This entity was still with Hal, but with the joined effort of the remaining Green Lanterns, (by this time there was John Stewart, an alien named Kilowog, current GL Kyle Raynerand onetime Lantern Guy Gardner), they reinstated Hal’s spirit into his body and defeated Parallax, sealing him again into the Central Battery, and restoring the Guardians to oversee the Green Lanterns. Hal is now the core Green Lantern of the DC universe.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g3pjo69in"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.156389,32.715278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Iceman, Long Island","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Iceman.gif\">Long Island, NYReal Name:\nRobert “Bobby” Drake\n\nFirst Appearance:\nThe Uncanny X-Men #1 (1963)\nCreated By:\nStan Lee and Jack Kirby\n\nPowers: \n\nAs Iceman, Bobby Drake has gone through a slow evolution with his powers. Often, when he was first with the X-Men, Bobby spent more of his time honing his comedic skills rather than his mutant abilities. At first, Bobby could only cover his body in snow. Early on in the X-Men comic book, he learned how to encase his body in a hard ice shell. Now, Bobby Drake can turn his entire body into living ice.\n\nIn this form, he is nearly indestructible. If he were to shatter or break apart, he can quickly reform himself with the help of a water source, or even using the moisture in the air. It has only been in recent years that he has been able to do this.\n\nIceman can also lower the temperature around him to extreme degrees, can fire ice missiles, and can use water and moisture to form just many different objects such as shields, walls, and an ice slide he uses for transportation. He can also create detailed items like ice sculptures, and other snow items like snowballs.

The problem is that due to Bobby’s poor self image, he holds himself back from his true potential.\n\nOrigin: \n\nRobert “Bobby” Drake was raised by his parents to be a fun-loving and caring son. They lived a quiet life in Long Island, but that soon changed. His mutant powers developed early, and Bobby’s parents had him keep his powers secret to avoid retaliation from the many people who fear and hate mutants.\n\nHe was unable to do so when he was forced to use his powers and show himself as a mutant. A mob formed and Bobby was rescued by Cyclops and Professor X. Bobby joined the X-Men and became the youngest member of the original team.\n\nBobby has always been known as a jokester and is a very loved and enjoyed member of the team. His joking, however, has often been a mask for his poor self image. He even left the X-Men for a short time to pursue a normal life as an accountant, but that was not to be.\n\nLately, Bobby has truly come into his own, expanding his powers and growing as a member of the X-Men. After the recent House of M events, it appeared that Bobby’s days as Iceman were over, as his powers seemed to have disappeared. It came out though, that Bobby had deactivated them subconsciously. Another indicator of what Bobby truly feels about himself. However, he remains a vital part of The X-Men and continues to fight for Xavier’s dream of peace between mutant and human.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g3prmxwac"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.94917,40.74472]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jean Grey, New York City","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/Jean_Grey.jpg\">New York CityReal Name: Jean Grey\n\nFirst Appearance: The Uncanny X-Men #1 (1963)\n\nCreated By: Stan Lee and Jack Kirby\n\nPowers: \nJean Grey is a powerful picnic with the powers of telepathy and telekinesis.

She could lift great amounts of weight, project telekinetic Shields to protect her and her friends, and also influence other\\'s minds.\n\nLater, with the arrival of the Phoenix, Jean\\'s powers would increase dramatically. At first, the Phoenix took the form of Jean Grey and absorbed part of her personality, while the real Jean Grey was in suspended animation.

She can fly, even in space, and even sense and change things at a molecular level. Even though it appears that Jean has died many times, she always seems to rise again as the Phoenix.

For years, her family tried to find a way to help her and it was only until Professor Charles Xavier blocked her mutant powers was she able to awaken.\n\nIt seemed her body and mind was unable to compensate with her newborn telepathic powers. Xavier helped to allow Jean to develop at a natural rate and met with her to help her develop and control her powers. She later joined Xavier\\'s Institute and became the first female member of The X-Men.\n\nHer fate was ultimately changed forever by the Phoenix force, made up of the sum of all life force in the universe. The Phoenix has merged with Jean Grey, giving her extraordinary abilities, far beyond that of any human or mutant. Even though the Phoenix has been destroyed, like the fable of history, it rises again and again. The two seem to be linked on a level far above host and parasite. As Jean has said herself, \"I\\'m always Jean and I\\'m always Phoenix.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g3pvfwboc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Juggernaut, Berkeley","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/juggernaut.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/juggernaut_2_.jpg\">Berkeley, CaliforniaReal name:  \tCain Marko\nNicknames: \t-\nAliases: \t-\nGender: \tmale\nHeight: \t6\\'10 (208 cm)\nWeight: \t900 lb (405 kg)\nEye Color: \t-\nHair Color: \t-\nPlace of Birth: \tBerkeley, California\nOccupation: \tAdventurer formerly Professional criminal, mercenary, soldier\nBase of Operations: \t-\nGroup Affiliation: \tX-Men, Excalibur, formerly partner of Black Tom Cassidy, member of Exemplars, Brotherhood, New World Order, eXiles, U.S.Army\nFirst Apearance: \tX-Men Vol.1 #12\nKnown relatives: \tKurt Marko (father, deceased), Marjorie Marko (mother, deceased), Sharon Xavier (step-mother, deceased), Charles Xavier (step-brother)\n\nJuggernaut Powers\n\nThe Juggernaut normally possesses Class 100 strength, enabling him to lift (press) over 100 tons. However, his strength in his current weakened state has been likened to roughly the same as the X-Man Colossus.\n\nThe Juggernaut\\'s body is completely invulnerable. His skin cannot be broken and he is incapable of feeling pain or sustaining any form of injury from any conventional physical attack,regardless of the amount of force or energy exerted against him. He can however be jarred or dazed and has some susceptibility to sensory attacks though he is affected considerably less than a normal human being and will recover completely almost as soon as the attack is over. The Juggernaut can generate at will a personal forcefield around himself extending to about 1 foot from his body. This forcefield appears to be completely impenetrable to any level of concussive force or any form of energy blasts regardless of their intensity. The Juggernaut is resistant to all toxins,poisons,gases and disease. He is self-contained by his magic and does not need to eat,drink,breathe,and cannot tire or become exhausted. The Juggernaut possesses untold power which enhances his strength to an as yet unknown degree and makes him a seemingly irresistible,unstoppable being. Once he begins to walk in a certain direction,no obstacle or natural force on Earth has been observed to be able to stop him. Apparently only he can stop himself. Some obstacles(many tons of rocks,for example) or forces(such as plasma-discharge cannons) may slow his pace considerably,but nothing purely physical has yet stopped him permanently from advancing.\n\nJuggernaut Equipment\n\nThe Juggernaut wears a helmet fashioned from an unknown mystical metal found in the dimension of Cyttorak that protects him from all forms of psionic attack. After several occasions where his helmet had been removed, Juggernaut made a skullcap of the same material.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g3pg4bfg1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.271667,37.871667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nightcrawler, New York City","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/nightcrawler.jpg\">New York CityReal Name: Kurt Wagner\n\nFirst Appearance: Giant Size X-Men #1 (1975)\n\nCreated By: Len Wein and Dave Cockrum\n\nPowers: \nNightcrawler\\'s main power is that of teleportation. He can move himself and what he\\'s carrying to nearly any location that he has seen. The farther he tries to teleport though, the more the risk he has of teleporting into a solid object. Nightcrawler teleports through an unknown dimension and leaves behind the smell of brimstone. This ability allows Nightcrawler to teleport in and out to attack his foes or make a speedy retreat.\n\nKurt is also extremely agile and is a trained acrobat and gymnast. He has a prehensile tail that is extremely strong as it can lift a human being and support Nightcrawler\\'s weight in his acrobatics. His feet also have a prehensile quality which he can use to hold himself up and cling to walls.\n\nNightcrawler\\'s blue fur allows him to blend into the shadows. This ability has also been tied to the dimension he travels to when he teleports. He can even appear to be in the shadows in broad daylight.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men, Ultimate X-Men\nCurrently Seen In:\nUncanny X-Men, Ultimate X-Men\n\nInteresting Fact: \nNightcrawler\\'s prehensile tail is so agile it can wield a sword, which Nightcrawler uses to great effect.\n\nOrigin: \nDemon, Evil, Spawn of the Devil. These are the things Kurt Wagner has been called since his birth. Kurt was born with blue hair, fanged teeth, and glowing yellow eyes in Germany. His mother, the mutant Mystique had the ability to change her appearance at will, but Kurt did not inherit those abilities. The people of the village feared Kurt, and to save her own life, Mystique threw Kurt over a waterfall.\n\nBut Kurt did not die, he survived and was found by the gypsy sorceress Margali Szardos, who raised Kurt as her own in a traveling circus. There, Kurt learned about acrobatics and gymnastics, performing with the circus. Fate would have this joyful time cut short.\n\nKurt was forced to kill his half-brother Stefan, who had gone mad and was killing children. The villagers of the area found out about Kurt and attributed the killings to him and tried to kill him. It was then that Professor X intervened and offered him a chance to learn more about his abilities, and more importantly, a place where Kurt could be himself and free from hate.\n\nKurt has been an integral part of the X-Men since Giant Size X-Men debuted in 1975. His joyful attitude and playful spirit brings a much needed heart to the X-Men. As Nightcrawler, Kurt is the swashbuckling hero with a pure heart and lightning quick wit and reflexes.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g3puiwgmu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spider-Man, New York City","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/250px_Spider_Man50.jpg\">New York City, NYReal Name: Peter Parker\n\nFirst Appearance: Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962)\n\nCreated By: Stan Lee and Steve Ditko\n\nPublisher: Marvel Comics\n\nTeam Affiliations: New Avengers\n\nCurrently Seen In: Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Marvel Knights Spider-Man, Spider-Man Unlimited, Best of Spider-Man, New Avengers.\n\nPowers: \nSuperhuman strength and agility.\nAbility to stick to surfaces.\nSpecial senses that warn of danger.\nWrist mounted web shooters.\n\nInteresting Fact: The publishers didn\\'t want to do a character named Spider-Man at first, they thought it was too scary.\n\nOrigin: Peter Parker was an orphaned teenage boy who was bit by a radioactive spider.

He has superhuman strength and agility and can perform amazing acrobatic feats. His feet are as agile as his hands and can be used to perform any action his hands are able to. He is also able to rapidly heal himself from injuries.\n\nThe Beast is also extremely intelligent, and is considered to have an intellect that rivals many of the elite thinkers in the Marvel universe. He has a doctorate from the Xavier Institute and is well versed in the areas of genetics and biochemistry.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men, Ultimate X-Men\nCurrently Seen In:\nAstonishing X-Men, Ultimate X-Men\n\nInteresting Fact: \nThe Beast’s blue fur and animalistic features are because Hank McCoy tested an unknown chemical on himself.\n\nOrigin: \nHank McCoy grew up with over-sized hands and feet that were early proof that he was a mutant. He made up for these deformities by becoming a star athlete, but as his mutant powers emerged and became known, he was asked to leave his school. Even his parents were cold to him and regarded him with suspicion and fear since his father worked at a local nuclear power plant and it was assumed that Hank’s mutations were because of this.\n\nProfessor X approached Hank and asked him to come as a student to the Xavier Institute where he would be free from prejudice, have an advanced education, and could work out in a highly advanced danger room. Hank quickly agreed. He became one of the first to graduate the school.\n\nLater, Hank worked for the Brand Corporation and there discovered a chemical that induced mutations. He found that his invention was going to be stolen and used it on himself to prevent this. The results truly make Hank McCoy a beast, with gray fur that later became blue, fangs, claws, and pointed ears. Despite this setback, Hank kept a happy-go-lucky outlook on life. He even worked with the Avengers, led the super hero team The Defenders, and helped to start X-Factor. Hank eventually returned to The X-Men.\n\nIt wasn’t until later that a second mutation brought about a more catlike appearance, and completely shook Hank’s belief in himself. Hank could feel his feral instincts wanting to come forth and he worries that he is becoming more beast than man. Even through all of this Hank McCoy continues to be easygoing and joyful around his teammates, often using his rapier wit to mask his fears.\n\nHanks is the current scientist in residence at the Xavier Institute. No matter what the future holds for him, Hank knows that he will always have an accepting home with The X-Men as they continue to fight to make the world a safe place for both mutants and humans.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66g3ptn6u1n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Flash, Keystone City","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/flash_comic.jpg\">PennsylvaniaKeystone City is a fictional city shown to be located in Pennsylvania.
