It\\'s not too far from Athens, and not terribly far from Gwinett County, but it\\'s quite a haul from here to Downtown Atlanta and even farther for us west of town.  Interesting that the NASCAR track down in Hampton isn\\'t all that close to Atlanta either, but I suppose it\\'s closer than Commerce.\r\n\r\nWell, here\\'s where I get my racing fix.  I can\\'t stand to watch the round track drivers ride around in a circle 500 times.  If that\\'s your fancy, bonus, but I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve wasted all my patience for a long sporting event on the baseball game.  Now when it comes to auto racing, I want it to be quick.\r\n\r\nBy the time it takes round track to finish one race, the drag strip has hosted scores of races.  The top fuel and funny cars here run in the low 4\\'s.  That\\'s a quarter of a mile in just over 4 seconds for those who don\\'t know.  The power that these machines generate is nothing short of incredible.  I saw a car with a jet engine at an air show at Dobbins AFB one time, and that thing looked slower than molasses compared to these cars.  I\\'m sure many of you have seen a Ferrari outrun a fighter jet for a quarter mile.  That\\'s what I\\'m talking about.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder, how much faster can they get?  If the races end in less than 3 seconds at that level, will people start to complain that they\\'re not getting their money\\'s worth?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qftur9wk2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.471889,34.262892]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dolphin Stadium","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/smallArial.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2269 Dan Marino Blvd  Miami Gardens, FLHome of the Dolphins and the Marlins.  Here, the Marlins have won two World Series, while the Dolphins haven\\'t won a SuperBowl since they moved from the Orange Bowl in downtown Miami.  In fact, the Dolphins haven\\'t won the SuperBowl in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nFormerly known as Joe Robbie and Pro Players Stadium, Dolphin Stadium is a great venue for football, and while it handles baseball just fine, it\\'s obviously not a stadium designed for baseball.\r\n\r\nThe Marlins organization and the City of Miami had talked earlier about building a new baseball stadium in downtown Miami, but I heard that the State of Florida wouldn\\'t back the deal with state funds.  As much as I would like to see the Marlins get the new stadium downtown, I have to back the governor on the decision he made.  For Atlanta and Georgia it\\'s easier....you have one team for each major sport and they\\'re all in one city, which just happens to be the capitol and regional hub.  In Florida, on the other hand, you\\'ve got multiple teams in each sport spread all over the state, and none of them are in Tallahassee.  So if you help build a stadium for the Marlins, why not the D-Rays or any other pro sports team for that matter?\r\n\r\nEnough preaching, I saw the Marlins play San Diego here one night with my sister and brother-in-law.  The Padres shut them down that night (that was when the Marlins were still one of the newest teams in the Majors).  They didn\\'t get good until 1997, when they won it all.  The Marlins have still never lost a post-season series.\r\n\r\nFlorida seems to have become Atlanta\\'s trouble team.  Montreal used to be the team that would beat Atlanta without mercy no matter how good the Braves played against everone else.  The Marlins have now seemed to fill that role.  Think about it, the Marlins have won two world series and were born into a division that the Braves have owned ever since the Marlins came into the league.  So while they\\'ve never been able to win a division, they still have not been beaten in a post-season series.  It\\'s quite a coincidence that because Florida and Colorado came into the league, the Major Leagues were forced to realign divisions.  Because of realignment, in order to have an even number of playoff contenders, the wild card slot had to be added.  Florida has won two World Series by getting into the playoffs as a wild card team.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qftwsy8at"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.238862,25.957968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Georgia Dome","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/gdome02.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAHome of the Falcons and the annual Peach Bowl.  I think it\\'ll host next year\\'s Final Four as well.  Sometimes they have concerts here, but the acoustics are terrible compared to Philips Arena.  I\\'ve been to the last two Peach Bowls here because they both featured Miami.  I wasn\\'t too happy with Miami\\'s performance against LSU, it kind of reminded me of the only Falcons game I went to.  They were playing San Francisco, and we were a little bit late, so by the time we walked in, it was already 14-0 49ers.  Oh well, at least we got to see the Falcons only points, which came from a field goal.  I think Frisco wound up beating us 49-3 or something like that, and to rub it in even more, that was when Deion had just gone to the Niners, ouch!  The only other Falcons games I\\'ve seen were at the old A-FC Stadium.  The teams should clue you in to how long ago it was.  I saw them play the St. Louis Cardinals and the LA Rams back in the 80s.\r\n\r\nThe Dome has also hosted a couple of SuperBowls.  My dad worked at them as a nacho vendor.  He didn\\'t get to see any of the game, but unlike me, he can say that he\\'s actually been to the SuperBowl.  He didn\\'t care anyway since the Falcons weren\\'t in it.  We also got to keep the left over cheese, so we had these giant jars of yellow stadium nacho cheese for months at our house.  I\\'m surprised that I haven\\'t suffered a heart attack or massive stroke by now.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qftvz8lm6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.400749,33.757457]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mark Light Field","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/mark_light_field_1_lg_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Coral Gables, FLHome of the Hurricanes baseball team.  With 4 College World Series titles, they have only one less National Championship than the football team.  The University has planned a multi-million dollar renovation for the baseball facility, and Alex Rodriguez, ever the gentleman, has kicked in over  million for the project.

It\\'s connected to the Omni Hotel and the CNN Center. I had dinner there and got a kickass hoody from the Braves store there when I went to the Peach Bowl just before New Years. Well, I think the reason that I\\'ve never been to Philips is that the Hawks have sucked in recent years, and I\\'m even less of a hockey fan than a basketball fan, so I doubt I\\'d ever go to a Thrashers game unless the tickets were free, even if they were a top team, which they\\'re not. They\\'ve had several good concerts there, but I\\'ve never been to any. Most of the concerts that I\\'ve been to were at Lakewood. \r\n\r\nThe Omni however, which sat precisely where Philips sits now, I\\'ve been to several times. Mostly to Hawks games back in the 80s and a few in the early 90s. The Hawks had playoff caliber teams back then with Nique, Kevin Willis, Spud Webb, and Doc Rivers, but ever since that crew left, the Hawks haven\\'t been able to get off the ground. My parents told me that they took me to a hockey game when I was little, back when we had the Flames, but I don\\'t remember it. Of course, the Flames had a good team after they moved to Calgary. \r\n\r\nI remember the last time I went to the Omni, I saw Soundgarden back in 96 or 97.  They were doing a makeup show for the one they did in Atlanta that was somewhat disrupted by the Olympic hoopla.  I think it was right around the time that they came out with their last album. Well, after that, they had Metallica, which I didn\\'t get to go to, and then they tore the place down, to build Philips.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qftzqe7md"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.396801,33.757314]}},{"properties":{"name":"Russ Chandler Stadium","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/484792023.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAThis is where Georgia Tech plays baseball.  I go here to watch the Canes play when Miami is in town, now that Miami is in the ACC.  The last time I went, they got blown off the field (I think because it was so cold that night), but they wound up winning that series.\r\n\r\nBy the way, our coach who has won multiple College World Series Titles, Jim Morris, was previously Tech\\'s baseball coach.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qfu6wjada"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.394913,33.777792]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Chop Shop (A-FC Stadium, RIP)","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/fulton03.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAHome of the Braves and Falcons from 1966, when the team moved here from Milwaukee until after the 1996 Olympic Games, when the Olympic Stadium was converted to Turner Field.  The Falcons moved to the Georgia Dome when it was built in 1991.  Here, Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth\\'s homerun record (before my time).  When I was a kid, Dale Murphy and Bob Horner were the big stars for the Braves.  They were terrible in the 80s, it got so bad that Ted Turner even held races at the stadium with ostrich powered chariots as a promotional to get fans to come watch the games.  Then in the 90s, everything changed, we got Bobby Cox as manager and John Schuerholz as GM, and that relationship has produced results: 14 consecutive division titles, 5 pennants, &amp; a world championship aint bad considering what we had just one year before our first pennant, last place.\r\n\r\nI remember one night after going to see a game against San Diego in \\'91, people were out of their heads, the stadium was so loud that I couldn\\'t even think...I\\'m not exaggerating.  Everyone was doing the Tomahawk Chop, shouting that war chant, I mean at the top of their lungs..10s of thousands of people, it got pretty roudy.  Anyway, that whole season, we were one loss away from being put out of the division race by the Dodgers.  We caught them and barely stayed ahead.  That night against the Padres, we were losing, then we tied it, and in the bottom of the ninth, I think it was Ron Gant that hit a 2 run homer to win the game.  I\\'ve been to many concerts, but I\\'ve never heard a place so loud in all my days.  The fans were so excited that they continued bellowing that war chant out into the parking lot, and there\\'s a tunnel that connects two lots under Capitol Avenue, and I remember the mass of people walking through there doing that war chant at the top of their lungs and hearing it echo through the tunnel.\r\n\r\nSee, back in those days, we couldn\\'t even comprehend that an Atlanta team would do well in sports, sure the Hawks were decent, and we had a few individual stars like Nique, Aaron, Niekro, and Murphy, but never so much as a first place finish.\r\n\r\nThe first Braves batter to step to the plate here was Felipe Alou, and the last batter to step up to the plate in the regular season was his son, Moises Alou, playing for Montreal.  His father, Felipe was the Expos manager at the time, too.  Freaky.  The final game was honorably a World Series game played against New York in 1996.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qfu9xp8fx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.389462,33.740365]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Orange Bowl","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/7a15f04536020a13061237e8dfbcb489.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Miami, FLHome of the Hurricanes.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qfu7okoun"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.219936,25.778098]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Rat Hole","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/joshmc1978_ratslogo2_100x100.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlantic City, NJThe nickname of my football stadium for my FFLWA (Fantasy Football League of West Atlanta) Team, the New Jersey Rats (formerly the Akron Rubbers).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qfu2jx2oi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.423333,39.364167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tropicana Field","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/tropic06.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/082200.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/16467313.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/DSCN0610.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/tropicana_field.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> One Tropicana Dr  St Petersburg, FLHome of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and at one time, the Tampa Bay Lightning of the NHL.  It was originally called the Sun Coast Dome and later the Thunder Dome.  This was a great hockey venue for a good hockey team, but this is a terrible baseball venue for a terrible baseball team.  I went there last year when I was staying on Treasure Island for vacation.  They got beat by New York, which was one of the teams that they actually played well against last season.  I love the coloring of the place and the design, but I just don\\'t like the idea of playing baseball and football in a dome down here.  I love the Falcons, and I\\'m glad they don\\'t have to share with the Braves anymore, but I just don\\'t get it.  The climate is awesome down here and in Atlanta.  If they can play baseball and football out in the open in New York, Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia, and Boston, why can\\'t they play out in the open down here?  It gets just as hot and humid up there in the summer.  I\\'ll give Detroit and Minneapolis a free pass on this, but why we have domes in Atlanta, Tampa, and New Orleans is beyond me.  Don\\'t give me the hot and humid excuse either, Miami never used a dome and Houston has done away with theirs.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qftzfky8i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.653494,27.768393]}},{"properties":{"name":"Turner Field","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/image06.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner70.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner_field1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/turner_field2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Atlanta, GAHome of the Braves. It was the Olympic Stadium built for the Centennial Olympic Games in 1996. Ironically, baseball, which was the only Olympic event that I got to see, was played at the old AFC Stadium. Last summer, my brother-in-law took me to a game, and since his friend\\'s grandmother knows Henry Aaron, we were somehow able to get Aaron\\'s seats. We ended up sitting literally behind homeplate. I don\\'t mean a couple rows back or so, I mean it was us, then the wall, then the umpire\\'s butt. Best seats I\\'ve ever had. They played the Cubs that night, and after a rain delay of 1.5 hours with some bad lightning, they ended up winning the game. \r\n\r\nThe first game I got to see here was a playoff game against Florida in 1997. We won the game, but of course we lost that series because the Marlins went on to win their first World Series that year. \r\n\r\nI miss the memories of A-FC Stadium, but this ballpark has better seats and is more stylish. It\\'s truly a stadium built for baseball whereas A-FC was designed to save money by utilizing the generic, bland, coliseum style stadium for multiple sports, of course, mainly baseball and football. Ironically, Turner Field was originally that Olympic Stadium, which had that same bland coliseum shape. They just tore out some pieces in order to shape it how it is today.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67qfu7elw5q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.389634,33.735279]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/3084","metadata":null,"contact_name":"mountainmaverick","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:mountainmaverick","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/3084","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=3084,platial:user=mountainmaverick","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":46848}
