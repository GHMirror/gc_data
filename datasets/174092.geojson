Even the Mai Mai have decided to sign on for peace once again.\n \nWe sincerely hope that it is true.  There have been no serious incidents of fighting since Christmas. When the Congolese government and CNDP met Nigerian ex-President Obasanjo in Nairobi before Christmas, it became obvious that they had nothing to fight about with the Congolese government, so they went home and started fighting amongst themselves. Nkunda heads one faction, and his second in command, Bosco, heads the other. Both are indicted war criminals.  Strangely, it is the Bosco faction that has signed the peace agreement in the latest round of peace talks; but Nkunda has said Bosco does not speak for the CNDP.\n  \nAll of this manoeuvering is the subject of endless speculation: maybe the split is engineered so that Rwanda can have two options:  peace or war.  According to the peace deal, the Rwanda army will come into Congo officially, and hunt down the FDLR alongside the Congolese army, and all the CNDP will join the Congolese army (Back to square one!  Do not pass Go! Do not collect 200!) On the other hand, the Rwandans keep their options open to continue fighting as before alongside the other half of the CNDP.  \n  \nSome rather sinister indications about what is really going on have come from Kigali. At the US embassy party, the new ambassador appointed in August apparently said that one of the objectives of his government in the region would be to redraw unjust boundaries that were fixed in colonial times.  We can only hope that the Obama administration will take a more impartial and intelligent approach to resolving conflict in this region.\n  \nThe FDLR militia of course are not happy about this agreement. The only FDLR that can be easily found are the ones who have settled into villages in North and South Kivu.  To hunt them down means more suffering and violence for people in the rural areas. The ones who are really dangerous are in the forest, constantly on the move and impossible to find.  The women of the region, (Hotense Maliro, media officer from HEAL Africa is one of their leaders) have organised together as Sauti ya Wamama WaKongomani (Voice of the Women of Congo).  They held a demonstration on Friday in Goma, and are planning to lobby the Ministers here in Goma for the talks, for a peaceful approach to the FDLR.  There is no space and no future for them in Rwanda; the only lasting solution is to give them space to settle in Congo, and approach them with messages of inclusion and peace building. This is the challenge of the church, and our partners the Nehemiah committees are prepared to take up this challenge.\nHEAL AFrica's public health expert, Joseph Ciza, has been pushing to get involved in action for children sent by their families and villages into the Mai Mai militia.  On his trip to Kayna at the end of December, he met maybe one adult officer for twenty armed children. People are so desperate for protection that they are sending hundreds of their children to learn to be fighters.  Please pray for wisdom for us, how to equip the Nehemiah Committees to bring these children home and settle them back into the normal life of a child.\nSo the message of this letter is mainly hopeful, but with reservations because politicians have their own agendas and never tell us the whole truth.  Continued prayer is needed! Thank you for being alongside us with your prayers.","longitude":28.828125,"verified":"NO","id":"5","incident date":"08/02/2009 01:01","location":"DRC"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[]}},{"properties":{"category":"DEATHS, PROPERTY LOSS, LOOTING, ARMED GROUPS,","latitude":-1.2034,"serial":109,"incident title":"An AVSI national staff killed at Rutchuru, on manday 15thDec08","approved":"YES","description":"The UN OCHA office in Goma called for a meeting in Kiwandja on Monday 15th.

Ninety fresh cases of rape were documented over this past month by a mobile team with HEAL Africa in Goma, a co-sponsor of the petition. The actual number is assumed much higher, since civilians are hiding in the bush or remain out of reach by humanitarian groups. Rape is also stigmatized. The Congo crisis has been declared a 'humanitarian disaster' by UN officials, with an estimated 1 million people newly displaced.\n\n \n\n\"The women of Congo continue to pay the highest price for the conflict in Congo,\" states Judy Anderson, Executive Director of the US branch of HEAL Africa.  \"They are exposed to rape as they go to their fields, to the market, to the nearest water source to collect water for their household's use, or to the nearest source of fuel to cook their food.  Children are also vulnerable.\" Of the 90 cases, she explains, \"half of them have been raped in Goma. The other 45 were raped in the IDP camp of Kibati.\" Some often involve brutal gang rapes and weapons.\n\n \n\nThe global petition is a joint effort by the HEAL Africa teams in the DRC &amp; US, and the Talk to the Future web magazine. It comes as Congolese women are continuing their growing protest against sexual violence in North Kivu.

Depuis qu’il y a eu un peu d’accalmi pour permettre les familles d’enterrer leurs victimes tués, la distribution des vivres pour les déplacés seraient aussi encours. L’alerte significatif est celui du camp des déplacés de KANYARUCHINYA situé juste entre Kibati et Munigi. Ce camp abrite 6555 ménages. Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas le lieu, quand vous quittez Goma vers Kibumba c’est juste l’endroit ou l’on extrait du sable pour la construction en générale.\nAujourd’hui le 11 novembre 2008 la distribution des vivres (Sardines, Riz, Farine, Lait, Poissons-Makayabo,…) sous l’étiquette du gouvernement a fait état d’échec. Deux petites camionnettes « Fusso » ne transportant chacune pas plus de 6 tonnes devaient se rendre à Kanyaruchinga. Arrivés sur le lieu la population (les déplacés) a signifiée aux membres du Gouvernorat chargés de la distribution que les vivres étaient insignifiant. Les12 tonnes dans 6555 Ménages causeraient aussi un dégât car il fallait se battre ou faire des acrobaties ne fus ce que pour avoir un paquet de la farine. Les déplacés proposeront que les vivres ne soient pas distribués des accidents. Ce qui fut fait. Malheureusement et du fait que ces déplacés ont refusés cette gouttelette de vivres ils seront gratuitement surnommé ou appelé « Interahamwe ». Vous vous rendez compte de la situation que nos frères déplacés endurent. Nous osons penser que l’union de tout les congolais ferait la force. Il se dit que quand la tête est malade c’est tout le corps qui en souffre. La lutte continue. Faisons ce qui est possible pour aider cette population autochtone en disparition.                    Further information on the humanitarian crisis causing a state of alert in North Kivu, more precisely in Goma.  Since there has been a bit of a reprieve, the families are able to bury their dead.  Distribution of supplies for the displaced might also take place.  The significant alarm comes from the camp for displaced persons in KANYARUCHINYA, situated between Kibati and Munigi.  This camp houses 6555 families.  For those who don't know this place, when you leave Goma toward Kibumba, it's where you can get sand for general construction purposes.\n\nToday, November 11, 2008, the distribution of supplies (sardines, rice, flour, milk, fish, etc.) under the direction of the government was a huge failure.  Two small trucks \"Fusso\" not carrying more 6 tons each had to return to Kanyaruchinga.  Upon arrival to the displaced persons camp, members of the government in charge of supplies distribution were informed that the supplies were insufficient.  Furthermore, 12 tons for 6555 families causes more harm than good because the people would need to fight each other or do acrobats in order to get a packet of flour.  The displaced propose that the distributed supplies don't distribute accidents, which is what they have been doing.  Unfortunately and because of the fact that the displaced refused this meager droplet of supplies, they will now be shamefully nicknamed \"Interahamwe\".  You realize the situation of our displaced brothers continues.  We dare to think that the uniting all the Congolese would be powerful.  It is said that when the head is sick, the whole body suffers.  The struggle continues.

The gunshots’ unknown origins sowed panic in the village and the camps of the IDPs. Groups of people were observed moving toward the city of Goma and the city was overtaken again with terror.  One thing is certain, there is gunfire is being exchanged because a high officer of the FARDC came to these parts with a wound under his right collar bone.\nThe directors of the provinces (governor and commander of the 8th military region of Goma) called for the people to calm down and not to get carried away by rumors.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a quote of a villager in Goma, met on site at 13h30: “We remain affected by the latest macabre events from October 29 and we expect compensation for the crimes committed against the civilians in Kiwanja on November 5 and 6 by the CNDP.  We feel our lives were endangered.” \nFurthermore, the information coming from Kiwanja profoundly affects the entire city; because around 10h, corroborating sources went in to investigate the hundreds of civilians massacred after the confrontation. PARECO units and certain from CNDP have testified that there were several bodies of well known youth among the corpses, whose throats had been mercilessly and intentionally slashed by spears, machetes, and daggers in their own homes.  These heinous acts are directly attributed to the CNDP, who had come to “clean up the city of Kiwanja after the escape of pro-government militia PARECO”, according their spokesperson Betrand Bisimwa and the major Muhire. \n\nFor the population, the question to answer is why did MONUC, who had a strong logistical presence in the town, and other witnesses only persuade the Mai Mai unit to leave the town?  Why didn’t they intervene to stop the carnage perpetrated from house to house by the rebels of the CNDP? The presence of this United Nations organization is confusing and casts doubt into the minds of many Congolese citizens of this city, who still continue to feel threatened and on the brink of death despite the UN’s strong presence in the city.

The problem now is an administrative one: they people have moved into South Kivu (Goma is the capital of the province of Norh Kivu), so they are off the radar screen of the agencies around Goma.  They are too far from Bukavu (the capital of South Kivu) to get help from that province.  Thank God, I got a call from our friends in Australia, CNEC, they responded immediately with a generous donation to fight the cholera.  So today, we are planning to take out water purification tablets, and 20 litre jerry cans.  We will also take some plastic sheeting to leave at Kirotshe.  That may encourage the people to come back and camp near the hospital where they can get clean water and be nearer to the North Kivu aid agencies.  That’s a small advantage for HEAL Africa of being a local NGO – we do not have to stop at borders!  We can go where the need is.\nI am trying to arrange to get our vehicles back from the north. We are hobbled without them. We will send drivers up to Butembo (which is a couple of hundred miles north of Goma) by plane, and I will try to negotiate safe passage with the commander of the CNDP, to allow them to drive south to Goma.

Le problème actuellement est d'ordre administratif: de nombreuses personnes ont fui dans le Sud Kinvu (Goma est la capitale provinciale du Nord Kivu) ; elles se trouvent donc en dehors de la zone d'action des agences qui sont basées à Goma. Et elles se trouvent trop loin de Bukavu (la capitale du Sud Kivu) pour recevoir de l'aide dans cette province. Dieu merci, j'ai reçu un appel téléphonique de nos amis en Australie, le CNEC; ils ont répondu immédiatement avec une généreuse donation pour combattre le choléra. Donc, aujourd'hui, nous projetons de sortir des tablettes de purification d'eau, ainsi que des jerrycans de 20 litres. Nous prendrons également des feuilles en plastique pour laisser à Kirotshe. Cela pourrait encourager les gens à revenir et à camper près de l'hôpital où ils peuvent accéder à de l'eau propre et être plus proches des agences d'aide du Nord Kivu.

They are people from Masisi territory, from Kabashe, Karuba, Ngungu and the hills around.  These miserable and desperate people have been on the run since September and October, when the clashes started between FARDC (the DR Congo Army) and CNDP in the west.

But with the rout of the FARDC last week, they were once again looted.  Soldiers took their plastic sheeting for their own camps, leaving the civilian families shivering in the rain.

They also called on the UN and all humanitarian agencies assisting those affected to “continue to sustain and increase their support.” \n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said today that the total number of displaced in North Kivu since September is estimated to be 252,000 people, on top of the existing 800,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from previous hostilities. \n\nToday’s meeting also called on Mr. Ban to strengthen the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in the DRC, known as MONUC, and provide adequate resources to address the volatile situation. \n\nThe 17,000-strong MONUC has been stretched to the limit in recent weeks trying to carry out its mandate to protect civilians amid the violence.

He said the United States, if nothing else, should be more supportive of empowering MONUC, the U.N. mission in eastern Congo, and approving and allowing for a multi-national force to be deployed there. \n\nHe said, \"We need MONUC strengthened. We need a multi-national force. We must have this. And this force needs to stay there with the men and the mandate.

We [have] come to a level that the army cannot protect the civilians. All the women I met say that we are expecting, we are looking to our sisters in America to help us so that the war may cease in Congo.\"\n\nSpeaking at a conference in New York on how to bring peace to Congo, Kurumba said she is very worried the situation will endanger the small improvements in security and economic well being that women have seen during recent months of relative calm.\n\nHarvard Medical School professor, Dr. Michael VanRooyen, has worked in international disaster relief and humanitarian aid. He said his recent work with focus groups of men and women who have suffered from the violence in eastern Congo has given him insight into what the people want, and need. He said women victims in particular would like to see the United States provide more practical assistance.  \n\nHe added, \"It was actually very interesting to get their take on what they thought they needed, and one of the things that we thought is access to medical services and psycho-social support, and they want job training. They want to be independent and they want to have individual financial power, which is a huge issue.\"\n\nBut it is an issue in which all the speakers on the panel said the United States can play an important role.

People have dispersed over a vast, inhospitable area without access to shelter, water, food, and medicines. The fighting has severely hampered the ability of aid agencies to reach those in need. With renewed fighting in the last two days, many more have been forced to run again in search of safety.  \n \n“The world cannot look away again as thousands suffer in eastern Congo. The people of Congo deserve more,” said Juliette Prodhan, head of Oxfam in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “We have had fine words and important meetings but these must now be put into action by providing additional troops to safeguard the people. We need more urgency, more action and more commitment.”  \n \nAt least 100 civilians have been killed and more than 200 wounded since combat resumed in late August 2008 between the forces of the rebel commander Laurent Nkunda and Congolese army soldiers. Many of those killed were trapped in combat zones, unable to flee, while others were deliberately killed by combatants. Child protection agencies report that 37 children were recruited into military service last week by Mai Mai militia in the town of Rutshuru. An estimated 150 children have been forcibly recruited since heavy fighting resumed in August.  \n \nWith UN troops stretched thin and occupied on multiple fronts, increased military capacity is urgently required to keep the people of eastern Congo safe. In addition to the latest fighting in North Kivu, MONUC’s capacity is further stretched by the need to respond to armed groups attacking civilians in Ituri and in the Dungu area of Province Orientale, where the Lord’s Resistance Army last month attacked and kidnapped civilians, forcing tens of thousands to flee.  \n \nEU ambassadors met on October 31 in Brussels to consider the United Nations’ request for an EU force, but made no commitment to help. Diplomats said they preferred to see MONUC use its existing troops more efficiently before deciding whether an EU force was needed.  \n \n“UN peacekeepers need to do more to protect civilians, who desperately need their help,” said Anneke Van Woudenberg, senior researcher in the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “More troops and resources are urgently needed to shore up the blue helmets, and the EU is well placed to move quickly.”  \n \nDeployment of additional troops should be combined with sustained diplomatic pressure to help end the political and humanitarian crisis, ensure security for the local population, and hold to account those responsible for abusing civilians.  \n \nA fragile ceasefire between Nkunda’s forces and the Congolese army, signed in January, collapsed in late August. Nkunda’s rebel troops moved toward Goma on October 29, but stopped short of entering the town before declaring a unilateral ceasefire. The ceasefire was broken on November 4 when fighting resumed in Kiwanja, a neighboring town to Rutshuru, resulting in the deaths of more than 20 civilians. MONUC troops were again unable to protect the population of Kiwanja.  \n \nThousands of civilians trying to flee fighting have been unsure where to turn for safety. After taking control of Rutshuru on October 28, Nkunda’s forces encouraged the town’s inhabitants to dismantle displacement camps where more than 26,000 people had sought refuge with assistance from humanitarian agencies.  \n \nSome civilians fled to Goma, North Kivu’s capital, swelling the population to over 700,000 people, but there too civilians were attacked. On the night of October 29, at least 20 civilians were killed, including 5 children, and more than 13 people were wounded when soldiers looted shops, attacked civilian homes, raped women and girls, and stole vehicles before fleeing from advancing rebels. Focused on defending Goma’s perimeter from the rebel advance, MONUC troops were unable to protect Goma’s civilian population.  \n \nDuring the past eight weeks, an estimated 250,000 civilians have been forced from their homes. The total number of people displaced in North and South Kivu is now over 1.2 million, many without access to critical humanitarian aid.  \n \nOngoing combat and targeted attacks against humanitarian workers have made it especially difficult for aid agencies to reach those in need. Humanitarian workers in North Kivu have suffered 35 attacks since the end of August, including car-jackings, armed robberies, and physical assaults. A large number of these attacks were carried out by Congolese army soldiers.  \n \n“Action to protect civilians must be the top priority for international and regional leaders in Nairobi this weekend and for EU foreign ministers due to meet in Brussels on Monday,” said Kubuya Muhangi of CRONGD North Kivu. “Not responding to the demands of the UN secretary-general, who has requested reinforcements for MONUC, is not an option.”  \n \nSignatories to this statement include: ActionAid, ENOUGH, Human Rights Watch, Mercy Corps, Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Oxfam, Conseil Régional des Organisations Non Gouvernementales de Développement (CRONGD) - North Kivu, Promotion et Appui aux Initiatives Féminines (PAIF) – North Kivu, Institut Congolaise pour la Justice et la Paix (ICJP) – South Kivu, and Association des Femmes Juristes du Congo (AFEJUCO) – South Kivu.","longitude":28.03710937,"verified":"YES","id":"97","incident date":"07/11/2008 04:04","location":"Goma and all Congo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[]}},{"properties":{"category":"DEATHS, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE , GOVERNMENT FORCES, CIVILIANS, ARMED GROUPS, HUMANITARIAN ACTIONS,","latitude":-3.404562003,"serial":11,"incident title":"DRC: Tens of thousands displaced in renewed fighting in North Kivu","approved":"YES","description":"DRC: Tens of thousands displaced in renewed fighting in North Kivu \n\nPhoto: Courtesy UNHCR  \nCivilians fleeing fighting in North Kivu province: Renewed fighting on 6 November has displaced tens of thousands more \nKINSHASA, 6 November 2008 (IRIN) - Tens of thousands of internally displaced people (IDPs) fled fresh fighting on 6 November between the army and fighters loyal to renegade general, Laurent Nkunda, in two areas of North Kivu, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), just as aid workers had started distributing relief aid, UN sources told IRIN. \n\nThe most affected IDPs were in Kiwandja in Rutshuru territory, about 70km north of Goma, the provincial capital, and in Nyanzale, 60km north of Goma. \n\n“FARDC [the Army] abandoned their headquarters in Nyanzale and a large number of displaced civilians are on the road, fleeing the fighting, which broke out at 7.30am on Thursday [6 November] between FARDC and CNDP [Congrès national pour la défense du peuple],” Madnodje Mounoubai, a spokesman for the UN Mission in Congo (MONUC), told IRIN. \n\nThe fighting occurred one week after Nkunda declared a unilateral ceasefire just as his fighters were several kilometres from Goma. \n\nFrancesca Fontanini, external relations officer for the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, in Goma, said a “massive food distribution” got under way on 5 November in six UNHCR-run camps for tens of thousands of IDPs. \n\n“A four-truck UNHCR convoy carrying 33 tonnes of various aid items, including plastic sheeting, blankets, kitchen sets and jerry cans crossed Wednesday [5 November] from Rwanda into Goma, the capital of the conflict-hit province in eastern DRC,” she said. “The aid, from regional emergency stockpiles in Tanzania, was scheduled for immediate distribution.” \n\nAccording to Fontanini, the food distribution was the first in North Kivu since serious conflict between the Congolese army and Nkunda’s fighters sent tens of thousands of displaced people fleeing for their lives. Many IDPS ended up in the six camps. \n\n\nPhoto: IRIN  \nAn IDP camp: Aid agencies had started distributing relief aid when fighting resumed in parts of North Kivu \n\"The aid operations were made possible following a ceasefire and relative calm over the past few days but reports of fresh fighting on Tuesday [4 November] between the pro-government Mai-Mai militia and Nkunda's forces in the Rutshuru region are threatening to restrict the movement of humanitarian agencies once more,\" she said. \n\nEarlier in the week, Fontanini said, UNHCR had helped to improve shelter and sanitation facilities at the crowded Kibati IDP camp, which is close to Goma and whose population grew from 15,000 to some 65,000 people in the space of a few days. \n\nThe biggest obstacle for humanitarian workers in North Kivu, she said, was the reduced or non-existent access to the most vulnerable civilians. \n\nMore than 250,000 people have been displaced since the fighting resumed in August in North Kivu. \n\nei/bn/js/mw","longitude":28.03710937,"verified":"YES","id":"98","incident date":"06/11/2008 07:07","location":"Kiwandja in Ruthshuru , 70 km N of Goma;  Nyanzale, 60 kn N of Goma"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[]}},{"properties":{"category":"DEATHS, GOVERNMENT FORCES, CIVILIANS, ARMED GROUPS, VERIFIED SOURCES, HUMANITARIAN ACTIONS,","latitude":-1.6791667,"serial":8,"incident title":"DRC: At least 20 civilians killed in North Kivu clashes","approved":"YES","description":"DRC: At least 20 civilians killed in North Kivu clashes \n\nPhoto: Eddy Isango/IRIN  \nMore people have been displaced in renewed fighting near Goma, capital of North Kivu Province  \nKINSHASA, 7 November 2008 (IRIN) - Tens of civilians were killed and many more wounded during fighting between rebels of the Congrès national pour la libération du Congo (CNDP) led by renegade general, Laurent Nkunda, and a coalition of regular army and Mai Mai militias in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), UN sources and human rights activists said. \n\n“Eyewitnesses in Kiwanja [near Rutshuru, 70km north of Goma in North Kivu] told Human Rights Watch [HRW] that at least 20 persons were killed and another 33 wounded during a battle for the town and in the clean-up operations by Nkunda’s forces that followed,” said Anneke van Woudenberg, senior Africa researcher at HRW. \n\nOn 6 November, CNDP rebels re-seized Nyanzale, Kikuku and Kiwanja villages before leaving, said Jean-Paul Dietrich, the MONUC (UN Mission in Congo) military spokesman. \n\n“The army abandoned its positions with the advance of the rebels, who withdrew to the surrounding hills shortly after their attack on these villages,” said Dietrich. \n\nMONUC has opened an investigation into the killings.\n\n“Armoured cars came down yesterday [6 November] to prevent attacks continuing this morning and a team went to the site to verify the allegations,” said Dietrich.\n\nMONUC’s spokeswoman in Goma, Sylvie van den Wildenberg, said the force was very worried about possible atrocities in Kiwanja.\n\nAccording to HRW, UN peacekeepers based in the area were apparently unable to protect civilians from attack. \n\n“Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda’s forces and government-backed Mai Mai militias deliberately killed civilians in Kiwanja ... on November 4-5, 2008. UN peacekeepers based in the area were apparently unable to protect civilians from attack,” Van Woudenberg explained.  \n\nHowever, MONUC spokesman Madnodje Mounoubai countered that when fighting began, civilians headed to the MONUC camp in large numbers. “So the first thing MONUC did was to make sure those who came to the camp received protection and security.” \n\nGovernment spokesman Lambert Mende said that “such crimes should not go unpunished” and condemned “in the strongest terms the criminal behaviour of this armed group, Laurent Nkunda’s CNDP”.\n\nFor its part, the CNDP said those who died were not civilians. “We took the precaution of gathering the population in a stadium and those who remained were soldiers or fighters in civlian clothes who fought with our men,” said the CNDP spokesman, Bertrand Bismwa. \n\nAccording to HRW, after re-establishing control of Kiwanja on 5 November, Nkunda’s rebels ordered the population of some 30,000 inhabitants to leave the town and then systematically sought out and killed civilians, particularly men, whom they accused of supporting their enemies. \n\nPeople in Kiwanja told HRW they heard screams into the night and saw bodies on the streets the following morning. \n\nOne of those killed in Kiwanja was Alfred Nzonzo Bitwahiki, a journalist working for a local radio station, Radio RACOU.  \n\nWitnesses also reported that pro-government Mai Mai militias targeted civilians in Kiwanja, including those they accused of supporting Nkunda’s forces. \n\nOn 4 November, at least six people, including a foreign journalist, Thomas Scheen, of the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, were abducted by Mai Mai militias in Kiwanja.

Things continue tense with the military standoff.  The Congolese prime minister has gone back to Kinshasa.  \"We hope that the African Union will help mediate talks and arrive at a peaceful solution for all the people, a longterm durable peace\"   he said, \"We hope the Obama spirit will help.  We need to remove the spirit of punishment\", referring to some of the rhetoric being bandied about.  Referring to the election results in the US, he said, \"Now America becomes more interesting.  A superpower can bring equal rights to those who can \"digest\" it.  America becomes a superpower because it respects the rights of someone like Obama.\"  \n \nThe hospital has many women, (some wives of FARDC military and others).    They've put  women's injuries as the priority patients.  They are also preparing proactively for the cholera that follows many people in crowded rooms in Goma.    For the story of one such woman who fled the advance of the CNDP a few days ago and landed in the hospital with her six children, check our website and our first podcast from Goma!  As you know, HEAL Africa is building a media capacity.   It's important that Congolese stories be told by the Congolese.  \n \nHe said that the rebels are letting food into Goma without trouble.  They are putting in alternate government in the towns they control. They just check all vehicles for military.  The UN is patrolling the town.  \n \n On Tuesday night, in Jo's words, \"People's body language is saying that something worse can happen...The language is bad between Kinshasa, Nkunda, and Rwanda.  We think it's the last crisis before there is a solution sent by God--or someone who will make them sit down and talk.  It is clear that Kabila, Rwanda and the Congolese have completely different agendas.\"\n \nA planeload of medicine and supplies for the refugees  from Samaritan's Purse arrived from Nairobi on Tuesday, and with Jo's help was able to land and get through Goma.  \n \nAbout 50 military wounded came into the HEAL Africa hospital yesterday.  What is available at the hospital today is a drop in the bucket compared to what will be needed if there's a further catastrophe.  There are medicines available locally for purchase which are appropriate, so your donations will go directly to work in Goma.\n \nDr. Jo said this morning he'd talked with the pharmacist who's preparing in case of cholera.  They need about $20,000. to cover the cost of being ready.  The medicines are available locally through an agency.  \n \nAnd another short update from Desiree Zwank seconded from EED to Heal Africa:\n \n\"At the moment, noone can really say what is going to happen next, and there has been more fighting between CNDP rebel forces and the FARDC last night. My colleagues at HEAL, who have seen so much in the last two decades, are afraid of what is yet to come. With prices on the market staggering; they can hardly afford to feed their families. Yet their solidarity does not falter: in many households, up to three families who have fled from their local villages are camping out until things get better. Several colleagues have told me that above everything else, they are worried about the traumatic impact that the current situation has on their children, who are scared and can't find sleep at night. Schools remain closed. On top of all this, HEAL's development agents have to look on as the hard work that everybody has invested into the healing and rebuilding of communities in Nord Kivu is once again destroyed.\"","longitude":29.25109863,"verified":"YES","id":"101","incident date":"05/11/2008 10:10","location":"Goma"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":null,"metadata":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"source":null,"contact_phone":null},"source":null,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":102,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-13T03:44:05-04:00","id":174092}
