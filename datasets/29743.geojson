This is because oiling a bird is a potential criminal offense. The feather sample and the bird (if it dies) are considered state evidence. After the bird is examined, there is a minimum of a 48 hour <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/oiled_murre_photo.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/oiled_murre_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Oiled_murre_photo\" title=\"Oiled_murre_photo\"></a> waiting period before it is washed. This is because it needs to be healthy enough to withstand the stress of being washed. When birds in the wild are oiled, their overall health rapidly deteriorates. They are debilitated either by the toxic effects of ingesting oil, or by exhaustion and starvation. Therefore, the chance that an oiled bird will survive decreases, as the length of time until the bird is rescued increases. \n\nToday, the oiled Murre that came in on Saturday was ready to be washed. He had been hydrated, fed, and medicated for a couple days and appeared to be healthy enough. The black oil on the bird felt hard and caked on. It smelled very toxic. It was so sad to see such a beautiful, innocent creature in such a decrepit state. The actual washing (see video) took about a half hour and used a couple hundred gallons of water! The bird was very weak afterwards and was given IV fluids. He was then put in a specially designed, net bottom cage, with a warm dryer. \n\nThere are many different types of oil that can contaminate birds. One way to help decrease the amount of oil in the environment is to keep your car well-maintained to prevent oil and fuel leakage on the ground and in water. Or better yet, walk, cycle or even take the bus whenever possible!\n\n \n        \n                           \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk17imjt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/03/06 Handling a Brown Pelican","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca<a></a>\n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              An interesting question came up today about whether rescued birds know that you’re trying to help them. The answer is usually a definitive, “no.” However, today at the IBRRC, a Snowy Egret, who was a former patient, returned and was hanging around outside. He appeared to be oiled. The rehab supervisors lured him into one of the outside aviaries by leaving a trail of fish to the door. He was then given his intake exam and evaluated for oiling. This sick egret probably came back because he knew the IBRRC was a good place to get some fish. Jay Holcomb, the director of the IBRRC, told me a story about another Egret who also returned to the center. He went right into the building and up on the couch. He had been cut all the way up his body. The bird seemed to know that the IBRRC was a safe place to go when he was hurt. However, most of the birds that are rehabilitated are pretty stressed and most likely see us as very large predators. Proper handling techniques help to minimize this, and help protect the handler and the bird. Some people have compared their perspective to being abducted by aliens! It must be pretty scary for them, but the alternative, falling victim to predators, is pretty grim. I also assisted with the intake of a Brown Pelican today. He was found on a beach with a possible injured wing. Handling a pelican proved to be a pretty tricky feat for a newcomer! Pelicans don’t seem that big until your right up next to them! While Michelle examined him, I had one one finger in between his bill and the rest of my fingers holding it closed. Since pelicans have undeveloped nostrils, holding their bills completely closed would prevent them from breathing. My other arm was wrapped around his body, which felt surprisingly like bubble wrap! They feel like bubble wrap because pelicans have internal air sacks beneath their skin and in their bones that aid in buoyancy. It was also pretty scary because he was a feisty bird. But at the IBRRC, feisty is considered to be a good sign...the meaner the better! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlujz6vqfd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/04/06 Washing an Oiled Snowy Egret","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca<a></a>\n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              Today, for the first time, I assisted with the washing of an oiled bird. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Egret\">Snowy Egret</a> that had been readmitted to the IBRRC was healthy enough to undergo the washing procedure. I was really excited <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/egret_after_wash_1.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"157\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/egret_after_wash_1.jpg\" alt=\"Egret_after_wash_1\" title=\"Egret_after_wash_1\"></a>to be able to help. However, I was pretty nervous because I know you only have one shot to remove the oil from a bird. One wash is very stressful and can be life threatening for a bird. Making a mistake and leaving oil on the bird is not an option. \n\nDuring the wash, I assisted Jay Holcomb by handling the bird. Holding the bird and feeling its heart beating in my hands was like nothing I’ve ever experienced. You literally have the bird’s life in your hands. That is a huge responsibility.This Egret was another bird that was the victim of incidental oiling. This is oiling that is result of regular human activities. This particular bird had food or vegetable oil on him that probably came from the back of a restaraunt. The washing of this one bird took so much time, care, and so many resources. It’s astounding to think of this being done on a grand scale, which would be the circumstances in an oil spill. The rescuers feel an obligation to help these animals because they are living on this planet and inevitably contribute to harming them. They take responsibility for their actions and try to put right some of the detrimental effects of human interaction with the environment, and in turn, make the world a better place.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk113hom"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/05/06 Ruddy Duck Release","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca<a></a>\n                     \n         \n                        \n                           \n\n                              The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruddy_duck\">Ruddy Duck</a> that had been attacked by a cat last week was ready for release today! She had needed a five day course of antibiotics. Cat claws carry bacteria <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/ruddy_duck_hissing.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/ruddy_duck_hissing.jpg\" title=\"Ruddy_duck_hissing\" alt=\"Ruddy_duck_hissing\"></a>that can cause serious infections in birds. If you like ducks, you would love a Ruddy Duck. They are small and stout, only about a foot long. The Ruddy Duck at the IBRRC was a female. She had a grayish brown body with a dark bill and a dark cheek stripe. The males are really cool looking. They have a rust colored body, a blue bill and a white face with a black cap. They are so cute! And the best part about them is that when they’re angry, they hiss at you. I love the fact that they are so little and defenseless, but they still put up a fight! Apparently they hatch with an attitude problem. They come out of the egg hissing. I think Ruddy Ducks are my new favorite bird. I\\'m so happy that she was able to be released today (see video).\n\nIn the afternoon, I assisted Julie Burco, a Veterinarian and PhD candidate from UC Davis, with something that I chose not to post any pictures of... a necropsy. It was pretty gruesome. However, I am not that squeamish of a person, and as a biologist, I found it pretty interesting. Julie is researching better ways to test for Aspergillosis, a fungal infection. This is very important work because it is a life threatening infection in the airways of birds. This fungus is everywhere in the environment, but causes problems in birds (or even people) with compromised immune systems. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk75ih4x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/06/06 My Last Day","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca<a></a>\n                     \n   \n                        \n                           \n\n                              Today was my last day at the IBRRC. I assisted Megan with washing of another oiled Murre today. Megan gave me an overview of all the proper holds to do when washing a bird. I felt more \nconfident this time, since this was my second time assisting with a wash. During the wash, Megan <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bald_spots_murre.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Bald_spots_murre\" title=\"Bald_spots_murre\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/bald_spots_murre.jpg\"></a>\nnoticed that the oil had burned away some of the bird\\'s feathers. Oil can also burn the bird’s skin. This is so sad. It must be very painful for them. This Murre had crude oil on his feathers. One way he might have been contaminated is through sunken ships off the coastlines. These ships can seep oil and contaminate birds for years and years. One particular sunken ship is located off the coast of Santa Cruz and has been seeping oil for the past 2 years, and possibly the past 30 years!\n\nJay Holcomb had “coincidentally” asked everyone what their favorite dessert was yesterday. So today at lunchtime, the IBRRC staff presented me with an angel food cake with chocolate icing…yummy! They also gave me a certificate of adoption for the Ruddy Duck that we released yesterday. The  program at the IBRRCs people to sponsor a bird, and in turn, watch the bird\\'s final evaluation and Federal banding. They then get to accompany the IBRRC staff to the bird’s release at a local site and actually open the cage to set the bird free! The donations raised from the adoption program help fund the rehabilitation program and go directly to animal care. I feel so grateful that I was able to have a glimpse into an extraordinary world that is ordinary to these special people. The people who work in animal rehab have a passion and deep yearning to help these injured animals. It was wonderful to be in the presence of people who really make a difference. The next stop in my adventure is the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, CA.

The MMC rescues and rehabilitates all types of marine mammals. They also have great programs for research and education. I was really excited to be there. The drive to the center was beautiful, with winding roads and cliffs by the ocean. When I arrived at the MMC, Jim Oswald, the Communications Manager, gave me a tour. The center is huge and very <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/mmc.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/mmc.jpg\" title=\"Mmc\" alt=\"Mmc\"></a> spread out. It’s built on an old army base, Fort Cronkhite, which is located within the Marin Headlands. Also, it’s right next to a beautiful beach that is famous for surfing…great office! The staff of the rehab facility is comprised of veterinarians, vet techs, and whole bunch of volunteers. There is also a separate Harbor Seal hospital. The bulk of the animal care is carried out by the volunteers. Currently, they are taking care of California Sea Lions, Steller Sea Lions, Harbor Seals. I have been around marine mammals before, but only in the wild. It was pretty remarkable to see the animals up so close! After lunch, Jim turned me over to the staff. I was given an Animal Basic Care and Safety course. I then learned how to use a herding board. Herding boards are used to help move the animals or to encourage them to stay. This made me kind of nervous. I inevitably heard stories of people who have been bitten during this job. Besides, these animals are huge! It seems more likely that they would be herding me!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk7bjv11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.771738,36.801201]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/11/06  Eagle Auto","description":"Posted by Dawnblog8515 San Leandro St., Oakland, CA   \n\n\n                     <a></a>\n                     \n                   \n                        \n                           \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   When a member of the public calls the <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/\">Marine Mammal Center</a> to report a stranded animal, one of 800 volunteers respond, day or night, 365 days a year.

It was probably a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Shark\">great white shark.</a> Great white sharks stalk their prey from below and <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/elephant_seal_shark_bite.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"146\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/elephant_seal_shark_bite.jpg\" title=\"Elephant_seal_shark_bite\" alt=\"Elephant_seal_shark_bite\"></a>\nstrike with a swift surprise attack. They inflict a large, potentially fatal, bite to the poor seal. The seal often dies from massive trauma or blood loss. However, if the shark doesn\\'t bite any vital areas or if the bite is shallow, the lucky ones can sometimes escape. This is probably what happened to our patient. She was very lucky to have survived. If the MMC hadn’t rescued her, she probably would have died on the beach. After seeing the elephant seal post recovery, it\\'s hard to imagine her being so brutally attacked. They are so cute and curious. Everytime I walked by her pen, she would watch me by turning her neck all the way around to see what I was up to.\n\nGreat whites and Orcas, or killer whales, actively feed on elephant seals, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals in coastal waters along central California. They are especially common around the Farallon Islands (off the coast of San Francisco), Año Nuevo State Reserve and the Marin Headlands. Consequently, this is right around the area where the MMC, and the surfing beach, are located! In my opinion, an area so densely populated with the animals on which these great predators feed, seems like the last place I would want to go surfing! I’ve seen those pictures of what the surfboard looks like from 20 feet below the water…it looks like a seal! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlukal48hy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.771738,36.801201]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/16/06 Baby Fur Seal","description":"Posted by Dawnblog200 Dolan Rd, Moss Landing, CA <a></a>\n                     \n\n                        \n                           \n\n                              A new baby <a href=\"http://www.tmmc.org/learning/education/pinnipeds/nofurseal.asp\">fur seal</a> arrived at the <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/\">Marine Mammal Center</a>. She\\'s really small, cute, and furry! She was found alone on a beach, without her mother. Sometimes a pup\\'s mother will go out to find food and <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/baby_fur_seal.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"174\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/baby_fur_seal.jpg\" title=\"Baby_fur_seal\" alt=\"Baby_fur_seal\"></a>never make it back. This could be because she falls victim to a shark or killer whale attack. Isn\\'t that so sad? I can imagine the little pup waiting on beach. The pups are too young to be able to feed on their own and are left stranded on the beach. They would end up starving to death without the help of rescuers. This pup was very thin when she arrived, only about 20 pounds. She has a great appetite though and seems to be fattening up (see video). Even though she is really cute and cuddly looking, we have to be careful not to be too friendly with her. Pups can imprint on their caretakers very easily. There is a rule at the MMC about not talking too close to the pens. This goes for all the patients at the MMC. They are wild animals and the goal is to release them back into the wild. Therefore, they need to keep their natural fear<a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/fur_seal_with_fish.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"132\" alt=\"Fur_seal_with_fish\" title=\"Fur_seal_with_fish\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/fur_seal_with_fish.jpg\"></a>\n of humans. If you think about it, they should be afraid of us. Probably not anyone reading this blog, but unfortunately there are people out there that they should be afraid of. Another reason baby animals come to the MMC is the result of overzealous rescuers. People will sometimes see a baby seal on the beach and assume the seal is stranded, when the mother is only out in the ocean finding food. They then scoop up the baby, thinking they are doing the right thing. I’ve heard stories at the MMC about people rescuing seals and trying to raise them in their bathtubs! The best thing to do if you see a stranded marine mammal is to notify the MMC or a local wildlife rescue agency.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlujvngvgc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.771738,36.801201]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/17/06 Sea Lion Bite","description":"Posted by Dawnblog200 Dolan Rd, Moss Landing, CA <a></a>\n                     \n               \n                        \n                           \n\n                              Today, I drove down to a satellite center of the <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org\">MMC</a>, called Monterey Bay Operations, or MBO. This is <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sea_lion.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Sea_lion\" title=\"Sea_lion\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/sea_lion.jpg\"></a>the triage station where most of the calls reporting an injured or stranded marine mammal are taken. Basically, it’s where the story starts. When a call comes in, Sue, the field manager, gathers as much information as possible. Volunteers are then sent out to investigate, by boat if necessary, and potentially bring back the animal.\n\nLast Thursday, a call came in reporting a Monterey. Deborah was one of four volunteers who responded that day. Rounding up a huge wild animal from the beach is not such an easy feat. During the rescue, Deborah was bitten on the elbow. She had to have a couple stitches, but it could have been a lot worse. One of the major risks of being bitten is contracting zoonoses, pronounced “zoo-e-no-seas.” Zoonoses are contagious diseases that humans can contract from animals. I find this stuff pretty scary. A particularly nasty one, that is not uncommon, is called inger.s is a painful bacterial infection that results in swelling and potential permanent disabling of the affected area. In the past, they used to amputate the affected finger! Now, an antibiotic is used. It\\'s been a week since Deborah was bitten, and you’ll be happy to know she is healing up nicely and still has all her digits! She named the sea lion “Vienna”, since she’ll be traveling there soon. There must be animals that need rescuing in Vienna. Don’t you think Dawn should send me there?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlukafi6t0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.771738,36.801201]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/18/06 Sea Lion Release and the BBC","description":"Posted by Dawnblog200 Dolan Rd, Moss Landing, CA  <a></a>\n                     \n     \n                        \n                           \n                              Today was an exciting day at the <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/\">MMC</a>. Three <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion\">California sea lions</a> were ready to be released! Also, the <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bbc.jpeg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"112\" alt=\"Bbc\" title=\"Bbc\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/bbc.jpeg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/\">BBC</a> was there doing a story on the sea lions. They had been following them for a few weeks and were there to film the release. There was a lot of action at the MMC today!\n\nFive sea lions were originally scheduled for the release. Four of them were infected with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis\">leptospirosis </a>and one had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domoic_acid\">domoic acid</a> poisoning.

It is also the same bacteria that pregnant women are at risk of contracting from house cats. Sadly, one of the animals with leptospirosis showed significant signs of kidney failure and was not fit for release. Also, the sea lion with domoic acid poisoning died over the weekend. So, five sea lions for release was reduced to three. I was so sad for the two that didn’t make it. I guess the best thing to do is focus on the positive, the fact that three were able to be rehabilitated and released. If it weren’t for the MMC, they all would have died. Around 11:00 in the morning, we loaded up the sea lions into their respective carrying cases. They were very resistant as usual. I like the fact that they have spirit. It shows that they have a lot of life left.\n\nin them. They then had to be weighed and hauled into the MMC truck. Since they were being released on the MMC beach, we didn’t have too far of a drive. When we got down to the beach, there was a huge crowd! There was a school group there and some of members of the public, as well as the BBC crew. It was pretty exciting. We opened the carrying cases at the same time, so the sea lions could be released together. When they finally dove into the ocean, they noticed each other. They swam over to each other touched their muzzles together. They looked like they were kissing! I know they don’t have human emotions, but that was pretty close if you ask me. They seemed so happy to be free!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk0gi920"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.771738,36.801201]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/20/06 My Last Day at the MMC","description":"Posted by Dawnblog200 Dolan Rd, Moss Landing, CA <a></a>\n                     \n             \n                        \n                           \n                              Today was my last day at the <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org\">MMC</a>, and it was busy. Much of the day was spent tending to Astro and Myrtle. Astro and Myrtle are <a href=\"http://www.tmmc.org/learning/education/pinnipeds/stellarsea.asp\">Steller sea lions</a>. Since Steller sea lions are on the threatened species list, they are kept in the quarantine area. This is to prevent them from exposure to the diseases that many <a href=\"http://www.tmmc.org/learning/education/pinnipeds/casealion.asp\">California sea lions</a> have, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis\">leptospirosis</a>. Researchers believe that the major reason for the Steller\\'s low population numbers is a decline in fish stocks. Also, sea lions spend a lot of time around <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/baby_astro.jpg\"><img alt=\"Baby_astro\" title=\"Baby_astro\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/baby_astro.jpg\"></a>fishing boats. They can end up tangled in nets or even shot by fishermen who see them as threat to their livelihood. It’s so hard to believe that there are people out there who would do this. However, there are because the MMC rescues sea lions with bullets, or even arrows, in their heads. This is highly illegal and can result in federal prosecution under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nAstro and Myrtle were both rescued as pups stranded without there mothers. Myrtle is a little over a year old and Astro was born in June. Astro still had his umbilical cord attached when he was brought in! He is still a baby…a big baby! The staff is in the process of weening him off of his bottle, which is made up of ground Atlantic herring, salmon oil, and cream…yum! Just like a human baby, he is very reluctant to give it up. It was really fun to watch him take the bottle (see video). He makes such a funny noise. The goal is to release him by next Spring and Myrtle sooner. They need to be mature enough to be able to survive in the wild. It seemed so weird that my time at the MMC was ending, since I had so looked forward to being there. It was such a rewarding experience being able to work so closely with the marine mammals. Judging by the number of volunteers at the MMC, it seems that I am not alone in my fascination with these animals. I think people see a likeness in the marine mammals to themselves. It’s such a great thing, because without the help of volunteers and donors, many of these animals would not survive. I am so thankful that I was able to spend time there. It was an experience I will never forget. Next stop…the IBRRC in San Pedro, CA. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk6whj1p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.771738,36.801201]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/25/06 Chow Time","description":"Posted by Dawnblog3601 South Gaffey Street, San Pedro, CA<a></a>\n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              One of the first things to do in the morning at the <a href=\"http://www.ibrrc.org\">IBRRC</a> is to feed all the hungry birds. Some of them are fed whole food, while others need to be gavage (tube) fed. Today, I fed the ducks, the goose, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coot\">coot</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican\">pelicans</a>, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eared_grebe\">grebes</a>.

They eat duck pellets, mixed with a little bit of ground up oyster shell, and \ngreens. The oyster shell is added because ducks in the wild sift when they feed. The ducks were really excited about the lettuce, but kind of turned their bills up at the pellets. Next, I fed the goose duck pellets and lettuce. He pretty much felt the same way as the ducks. I then fed the pelicans whole fish in water. In the wild, pelicans plunge for their fish and scoop them up with water. They can hold up to three gallons of water in their pouch! They let the water drain out the sides of their mouths before swallowing the fish. I fed the coot next. The coot eats what they call, “coot soup.” This is a delicious mixture of seeds, grains, lettuce, duck pellets, krill, cut up fish, live meal worms, and water. Cutting up the raw, squishy fish with scissors and picking up live meal worms was a pretty gross job! Finally, I fed the little Eared Grebes. They got the same mixture as the coot, without the duck pellets and the seeds. They seemed to really like the live meal worms…yum!  It was really fun to watch the birds eat. It’s also a great way to gauge their overall health. I know that when I don’t feel good, I don’t feel like eating. It seems to work the same way with birds. If you watch the video, you’ll notice that the coot came right up to me when I entered his pen. He is very used to people because he was somebody’s pet for a few weeks. A member of the public found him as a chick and tried to raise him at her house. This was a bad idea. Birds and other wild animals need to remain wild in order to be able to survive in their natural habitats. He was turned over to the IBRRCa few weeks when he started “eating too much.” He’s too habituated to people now to just release, so he\\'s going to a sort of “half way house.” He\\'s being placed with someone with a huge pond in their backyard, where many bird species come and go. He will be fed there and can remain there if he wants. In the future, if he wants, he can return to the wild.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlujwuwo5p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.292804,33.707019]}},{"properties":{"name":"9/27/06 First Day at the IBRRC","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca <a></a>\n                     \n     \n                        \n                           \n                              <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/img_0056_14.jpg\"><img title=\"Img_0056_14\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Img_0056_14\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/img_0056_14.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>\n\nMy adventure begins! I kicked off my expedition today at the International Bird Rescue and Research  Center in Solano County, California. The <a href=\"http://ibrrc.org/\">IBRRC</a> rehabilitates aquatic birds that are the victims of oils spills, as well as birds with other injuries and illnesses. When I arrived at the IBRRC, the director of the center, Jay Holcomb, gave me a tour. It was much bigger than I expected. The center <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/img_0056_13.jpg\"></a>is equipped with outside cold and warm water pools for rehabilitating the birds, as well as an indoor hospital and washing facility.\n\nAfter the tour, I jumped right into the daily activities. The day began with rounds. This was a meeting where the wildlife rehab supervisor, Michelle, debriefed everyone on all the “patients” in the facility. Today there were orants, pelicans, grebes, murres, egrets and a heron. Throughout the day the patients were fed, bandaged, given medicine, and moved in and out of the therapeutic pools. It was amazing to see how the patients were evaluated and cared for based on their individual needs.p&gt;The day ended with an event that is the goal of every animal rescue. This was the release of a green heron who had been a patient at the IBRRC for about two weeks. He was brought in as a baby that fell out of his nest. He was rescued, rehabilitated and today, he was released! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlujxd5ly4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"9/28/06 Caring for Mallard Ducks, Western Gulls, Pelicans and Murres","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca \n\n\n<a></a>\n                     \n          \n                        \n                           \n\n                              <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/murres_22_3.jpg\"><img title=\"Murres_22_3\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Murres_22_3\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/murres_22_3.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>My second day at the IBRRC was busy. There were three new patients today, including two Mallard Ducks and a Western Gull. There was a female brown pelican in the intensive care unit that required a lot of care. She was severely emaciated with a broken wing. Megan, the rehabilitation assistant manager, alternated fluids with gavage (tube) feedings throughout the day. \n\nThe Murres that we cared for yesterday were doing much better today. One of the Murres was <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/murres_22.jpg\"></a>brought in two weeks ago with oil spots that caused her feathers to lose their waterproofing. She was then unable to feed because of the risk of freezing in the water. Also, since aquatic birds are not meant to spend so much time on land, she developed sores on her feet and hocks. She was washed with Dawn to remove the oil and the rehab supervisors bandaged her feet. This gave her a chance to work on her waterproofing by <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bandagedmurre_20_2.jpg\"><img title=\"Bandagedmurre_20_2\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Bandagedmurre_20_2\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/bandagedmurre_20_2.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>preening herself without hurting her feet. She was then put in a warm pool so she could work on wet spots on her feathers without<a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bandagedmurre_20.jpg\"></a> getting too cold. Finally, she was transferred to the cold pool where birds normally preen intensively for several minutes (see video). Today, she was swimming in the cold pool and eating fish with the rest of the Murres. It was great to see that all the hard work and care paid off.\n\nThis Murre was th e victim of incidental oil. This occurs from oil that gets into the waterways from regular human activities, instead of a major oil spill. One way to help prevent this is to avoid topping off at the gas pump. This can cause gas to spill onto the ground. The residue can then end up in the ocean where these animals live.  \n        \n                           \n                           \n\n                         \n                        \n                     <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlujw58mvg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"9/29/06 Imping Gives Birds with Broken Feathers a Chance","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca \n\n       <a></a>\n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/murres_feeding_1.jpg\"><img title=\"Murres_feeding_1\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Murres_feeding_1\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/murres_feeding_1.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>There was good news at the IBRRC today.

Sources of oil are eliminated in every area possible. Fish and vegetable oils are very hard to remove from feathers. That\\'s why it\\'s important to place cooking oils and fats in a sealed container in the garbage instead of pouring them down the kitchen drain.\n\nToday I learned about a very specialized practice called imping. This involves <a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/nightsmelt.jpg\"></a>grafting donor feathers onto the shaft of broken feathers of birds that would otherwise have no chance of survival (kind of like a hair transplant). This practice gives the birds a chance to survive in the wild until their natural molting process replaces the broken feathers. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t work well on diving birds because the glue that is used for grafting breaks down. Maybe someone will invent something that will hold in the water. It’s amazing what can be done when talented and dedicated people care.\n        \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlukai00ii"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"9/30/06 Murres Are Healthy and Back in Their Natural Habitat!","description":"Posted by Dawnblog<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca                     <a></a>\n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              Early this morning, Marge (a long standing volunteer at the IBRRC) and I drove to a town near the Golden Gate Bridge. It was about an hour away from the IBRRC, and it was a beautiful drive. We passed through a wetlands area along the way and saw numerous species of birds, including: Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, American Avocets, Cormorants and Marbled Godwits...and that was just from the car! There were chirps coming from the backseat the whole way. The Murres didn’t know that they were about to be set free.\n\nWhen we arrived, we each took a carrying case full of Murres and set it down by the water. We then opened the cases and let the Murres take a look around. It took just a minute for them to hop right out and start swimming away. It was great to see the them healthy and back in their natural habitat!\n\nEven with the Murres gone, things didn’t stay quiet for long at the IBRRC. Soon after we got back, two new patients arrived. One was an adorable little Ruddy Duck that had been attacked by a cat. The other was an oiled Murre. They both had to have their initial intake exam and have treatment plans determined. New patients, combined with caring for all the existing patients, proved to be a challenging yet rewarding day in wildlife rescue.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk30jsl4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"Anchor Post","description":"Posted by Dawnblog36.8277,-121.73298<a></a>\n                     \n    \n                        \n                           \n\n                              <img alt=\"Harbor_seals_1\" title=\"Harbor_seals_1\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/harbor_seals_1.jpg\">After\nspending a month around injured and sick birds and marine mammals, I\ndecided it would be nice to spend some time around some healthy ones. I\ndrove down to the best place I know to view these animals in their\nnatural habitat, Elkhorn Slough in Moss<img width=\"200\" height=\"216\" alt=\"Christy_on_safari\" title=\"Christy_on_safari\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/christy_on_safari.jpg\">\nLanding, CA. Elkhorn Slough is one of California\\'s largest wetlands,\nlocated in central Monterey Bay. I was able to book a tour on Elkhorn Slough Safari.\nThe safari tour is the best way to view the wildlife in Elkhorn Slough because you are up on a pontoon boat and get a great view. There is also an on board Naturalist that guides the tour. Besides, the captain of the boat, knows all the best spots to go, since he has been doing this for about 12 years. \n\nDuring the tour, we saw numerous species of shorebirds and <img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/captains_inn_room_1.jpg\" title=\"Captains_inn_room_1\" alt=\"Captains_inn_room_1\">\nraptors, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Pelican\">Brown Pelicans</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbled_Godwit\">Marbled Godwits</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_avocet\">American Avocets,</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egret\">Egrets</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_Kingfisher\">Belted Kingfishers,</a> and many, many more. We also saw <a href=\"http://www.tmmc.org/learning/education/pinnipeds/harborseal.asp\">harbor seals</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tmmc.org/learning/education/pinnipeds/casealion.asp\">sea lions</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.tmmc.org/learning/education/mammalinfo/seaotter.asp\">sea otters</a>.\nWe actually counted the number of sea otters and harbor seals we\nsaw…72 harbor seals and 51 sea otters! The sea otters were right next\nto the boat! I could hear them cracking clam shells! It was so\nrefreshing to see all the healthy animals in their natural environment.\n\nAfterwards, I stayed at the Captain’s Inn at Moss Landing. This is a really nice B&amp;B that was originally the historic 1906\nPacific Coast Steamship Company building. The beds in all of the rooms are made from boats. I could see birds and harbor seals from the hot tub in my room! I felt very refreshed after my stay in Moss Landing and ready to tackle my next adventure.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk5uvs1f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.73298,36.8277]}},{"properties":{"name":"Anchor Post","description":"Posted by Dawnblog3601 South Gaffey Street, San Pedro, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk8afess"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.292804,33.707019]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bilbao","description":"Posted by DawnblogBilbao<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk5om2z1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.923424,43.256967]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brazil","description":"Posted by Dawnblogbrazil<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlukb0nxrw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-51.92528,-14.235004]}},{"properties":{"name":"CCTV Now Also Delivers Rebukes in UK","description":"Posted by DawnblogUK<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlujyj9t9f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[98.85389,55.076946]}},{"properties":{"name":"Casa","description":"Posted by DawnblogCoria, Cáceres, España<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk4rfexl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.539727,39.983582]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eagle Auto Company","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a>8515 San Leandro St., Oakland, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk8408ii"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.188843,37.746962]}},{"properties":{"name":"First Day IBRRC San Pedro","description":"Posted by Dawnblog3601 South Gaffey Street, San Pedro, CA<a></a>\n                     \n    \n                        \n                           \n                              Today was my first day at the<a href=\"http://www.ibrrc.org\"> IBRRC</a> in San Pedro.

The center has two huge outdoor aviaries with pools. One is 93 feet long and is big enough for pelicans to fly through it. They also have four pelagic pools, which are used to rehabilitate many different species of birds. Inside, there is a bird hospital area with a two-way communication system.  School groups and other visitors can watch and talk to rehabilitators while they care for birds.  Today, a school group watched as Erin Kellogg, the rehab manager, examined and drew blood from a<a href=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/night_heron2.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"244\" alt=\"Night_heron2\" title=\"Night_heron2\" src=\"http://www.dawndifferences.com/images/night_heron2.jpg\"></a> new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Gull\">Western Gull</a>. A large portion of the birds that come in to the center, about one third, are the victims of derelict fishing gear. Derelict fishing gear is lost or abandoned fishing nets, lines, pots, and traps. The majority of this gear doesn’t decompose in seawater. It remains in the ocean for many years, trapping and injuring, or killing, birds and marine mammals. One current patient, a Black-Crowned Night Heron, was found tangled in abandoned fishing line. The fishing line was wrapped so tightly around his toes that it cut off his circulation.  Sadly, a couple of his toes had to be amputated. However, since his surgery, he’s been healing up nicely and he’s expected to make a full recovery.  So far, I’ve heard of oiled birds and marine mammals, but an oiled turtle? The IBRRC is currently rehabilitating a turtle that came in to the center covered in black tar. He looked completely black when he arrived. Now that he has been washed with Dawn, he is a pretty green color again. I was so surprised and happy to see a turtle at the center. I think it’s great that Dawn works on carapaces, as well as fur and feathers! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nlujwddemx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.292804,33.707019]}},{"properties":{"name":"GuangZhou","description":"Posted by DawnblogChina<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7nluk2yw62f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hello Readers","description":"Posted by Dawnblog4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca\n                  \n                     <a></a>\n                     \n                        \n                           \n\nMy name is Christy and I am the winner of the Dawn Difference Diaries Contest! I’m from Willistown, Pennsylvania and I have a Biology degree from Penn State University.\n\nOne of my favorite past experiences was as a Naturalist on Elkhorn Slough in Moss Landing, CA. I was involved in the identification and recording of the numbers and types of wildlife species on the wetlands area. Daily outings provided the opportunity to observe sea otters, harbor seals, and numerous waterfowl and migratory shorebirds. Also, I am an avid birder and have spent countless hours observing birds and other wildlife during photography expeditions. I also enjoy sailing, yoga, painting, playing guitar and snowboarding.\n\n\nIn the future, I would like to take a more hands on approach to wildlife rehabilitation. During this adventure, I hope to deepen and broaden my understanding of the issues surrounding this important field. Also, I believe that by participating in this program I will be contributing to the education of the public about the protection of the animals with whom we share this planet. I feel that education is one of the best ways to aid in minimizing the effects of human activities on wildlife. I am so excited to meet the individuals who really make a difference in this field and hopefully make a difference too!\n\nThanks!\n\nChristy\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\"
