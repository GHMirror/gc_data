The Big Ben Clock is used to ring in the London New Year and is a rallying point for the New Year\\'s celebration of the entire country of England. \r\n\r\n Although most people refer to the entire tower as the Big Ben Clock Tower, the name Big Ben actually refers to the bell housed within the tower.  The bell itself weighs almost 14 tons, and takes its name from the man who first ordered the bell, Sir Benjamin Hall.  The four clock faces of the Big Ben in London are each 23 feet in diameter; the biggest of its kind when it was constructed.  Certain pieces of the clock face of the Big Ben in London have been designed for easy removal, to allow for cleaning and maintenance of the clock hands. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64fqdxbjt12"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.0,51.0]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eiffel Tower","description":"Posted by Kendallcrouse<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/180px_Eiffel_Tower_from_base_5_.jpg\">Named after its designer, engineer Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in Paris and one of the most recognized structures in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Eiffel tower was created 1887-1889 by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. The month of the completion of the Eiffel tower is March 28, 89. It took 2 years 2 months and 5 days to complete it.It is made of 9441 tons of steel.

Four sides, 170 to 190 feet long, were designed for three tiers of guns; the gorge, mainly officers\\' quarters, mounted guns only on the third tier. Enlisted men\\'s barracks paralleled the gunrooms on the two flanks. A sally port pierced the center of the gorge, opening onto a wharf. The fort was designed for an armament of 135 guns and a garrison of 650 men. But by December 1860 Fort Sumter was 90 percent completed, standing empty, with only 15 cannon mounted and ready. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64fqdxtvi7b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.8747,32.7523]}},{"properties":{"name":"Iwo Jima","description":"Posted by Kendallcrouse<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/Iwo_Jima_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/1967_iwo_jima_2_.jpg\">The Battle of Iwo Jima was fought between the United States and the Japanese Empire in February and March 1945 during the Pacific Campaign of World War II. Ground fighting on the island took place over approximately 35 days, lasting from the landings of February 19 to a final Japanese charge the morning of March 26, 1945. The U.S. invasion, known as Operation Detachment, was charged with the mission of capturing the airfields on Iwo Jima.\r\n\r\nThe battle was marked by some of the fiercest fighting of the campaign.Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the battle, over 20,000 were killed and only 216 taken prisoner.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64fqe7oflga"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[141.316667,24.783333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Leaning Tower of Pisa","description":"Posted by Kendallcrouse<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_4_.jpg\">Leaning Tower of Pisa is a bell tower at Pisa, Italy. It is famous for leaning 141/2 feet out of line when measured from the seventh story. It tilts because its foundation was built on unstable soil. Construction of the tower began in 1173 and ended between 1360 and 1370. The ground beneath the tower first started to sink after the first three stories were built. \r\n\r\nIn 1990, the tower was closed for repairs. At that time, its lean had been increasing an average of 1/20 of an inch per year. Engineers hope to stabilize the tower\\'s foundation and straighten it slightly to prevent it from eventually collapsing and falling over. By 1994, their efforts had straightened the tower\\'s lean about 2/5 of an inch.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64fqe46q0n4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[10.0,43.0]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Rushmore","description":"Posted by Kendallcrouse<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/288px_Mount_Rushmore_National_Memorial_2_.jpg\">Mount Rushmore National Memorial, near Keystone, South Dakota, is a monumental granite sculpture located within the United States Presidential Memorial that represents the first 150 years of the history of the United States of America with 60-foot sculptures of the heads of former United States presidents: George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865).
