This four acre facility is currently the only full-function plutonium handling facility in the U.S. It opened in April 1978 at a cost of $70 million, and houses 400 scientists and engineers. The 150,000 square foot PF-4 (Plutonium Facility-4) is the actual plutonium processing area of TA-55.\r\rIn recent years plans have lagged to reestablish pit manufacturing capability at TA-55. In March 1998 LANL announced the successful fabrication of a weapon pit, the first since 1989. By March 2000 TA-55 had produced three engineering pits for the W88, but were projecting that a certifiable weapons pit would only be available \"in the next few years\" (originally this milestone was slated for 2000). The Stockpile Stewardship Environmental Impact Statement called for Los Alamos to develop the capability to make 20 to 50 pits a year eventually; current DOE plans call for Los Alamos to be able to fabricate up to 20 war-reserve pits a year by 2007. Los Alamos will also support stockpile maintenance by requalifying 100 pits a year (this implies a remanufacturing lifecycle of at least 250 years for all active weapons, and nearly 50 years for requalification). Current estimates of pit lifetime range from 30 to 90 years.\r\rLos Alamos also loads targets with tritium for use by Sandia in manufacturing neutron generators under the NTTL (Neutron Tube Target Loading) project. In 1999 NTTL loaded 450 targets for Sandia for the W76 warhead.\r\rUntil FY 1984 Los Alamos had the capability to fabricate and assembly nuclear weapon test devices. This function was terminated due to persistent security problems, and is now handled by the Nevada Test Site.","zipcode":"94551","geo_score":0.857,"what":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)","id":"a7kyqd7kanv0","geo_precision":"zip","state":"California"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.921498,37.680181]}},{"properties":{"city":"Las Vegas","details":"NTS is currently the only U.S. facility capable of manufacturing nuclear explosive devices.

Over the period 1990-1996 Pantex averaged 1347 dismantlements a year.

Richardson also announced that a new $500 million plant to disassemble the pits (plutonium cores) of nuclear bombs would be built at Savannah River. The facility will disassemble nuclear pits and convert the recovered plutonium metal to an oxide form suitable for disposition. Disposal methods would include fabricating the plutonium oxide into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, which would be burned in existing domestic reactors, and immobilization of the plutonium in ceramic surrounded by vitrified high level waste. The DOE is currently conducting a demonstration of a prototype pit disassembly and conversion system at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The demonstration, which involves dismantling of pits over a two-to-three year period, provides information for designing and operating the full-scale pit disassembly and conversion facility. The full-scale facility is to be designed and constructed over 1999-2004, with production operations beginning in 2005. Up to 50 tonnes of plutonium is expected to be disposed of by this facility. Construction and operation of the full-scale facility is contingent on reaching agreement with Russia on plutonium disposition.","zipcode":"29801","geo_score":0.857,"what":"Savannah River Test Site (SRS)","id":"a7kyqd9qtfxn","geo_precision":"zip","state":"South Carolina"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.719275,33.612639]}},{"properties":{"city":"Oak Ridge","details":"Located at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, this was one of the two original production sites for nuclear weapons material established by the Manhattan Project, the selection of this site was on September 19, 1942 (code named Site X) was in fact the first major decision taken as part of the Project.

It now has responsibility for dismantling secondaries from disasembled weapons, and maintains custody of U.S. stocks of weapons grade enriched uranium, and the reserve stockpile of secondaries that are kept intact.
