In their early years, they boasted that their Lacuna Towers were \"the tallest buildings east of the LA River and west of the Pomona Valley.\"  They were technically incorrect because building heights include the radio antennas on top, and others had them, but at 18 stories, it was very tall and nobody disputed it.  In 1975, crosstown civic rivals, The City of Industry, attempted to steal away the \"tallest building\" title with their Turnbull Tower, which was 19 stories tall.  Commerce retaliated by quietly erecting a 40 foot-tall radio tower on the Lacuna, and hired a Berlin artist to attach illuminated plastic hologram panels to it, so it would resemble a solid, lit structure.  They just as quietly stopped mentioning the \"tallest building\" title when high winds knocked the tower down, into the adjacent electric substation, causing a small fire that cut power to the entire city.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbgjpskk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.15247,33.99518]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alton Square","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/alton_plaza.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/altonsquare_main.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 5305 Alton Parkway, Irvine, CA 92604A plaza where you can enjoy gourmet pizzas outdoor, on cushioned seating.

It has its own shopping district, business association, pier and recreation center with the landmark Belmont Pool where an Olympic gold medalist has taught swim lessons for years.  Several thousand residents consider this quaint and quirky community a city unto itself and at one time, it actually was a separate city.\n\n      In 1906, it took shape as the fastest growing subdivision in Long Beach and was called Belmont Heights. Originally designed as an Italian-styled city running along canals, developers Frank Shaw &amp; George C. Flint scrapped plans because of cost and logistics. Another nearby community, Naples, did become the Italian styled village, offering houses on canals, a promenade with a large fountain and even gondoliers.\n\nAll Belmont wanted was a pier. In 1908, angry residents of Belmont Heights voted to become the City of Belmont. Fed up over high taxes imposed by the City of Long Beach, they decided they could do better on their own. During its brief period as a city, Belmont determined that its residents could not afford what they wanted even more than tax reductions. So just one year later they voted to rejoin Long Beach with the understanding a pier would be built. Belmont got its pier in 1915 and the charming community built its lifestyle around its prized possession and sandy beaches surrounding it.\n\nThe current pier was built in 1966, replacing a wooden pier that stood for over 50 years. The 1,620 foot-long concrete pier has experienced structural damage and needs revamping. New restrooms will be added to the mid section of the pier and enhancements such as lighting and electrical updating is expected to bring more activity to the region.\n\nThe pier is located at Ocean and 39th Place. It offers free public fishing with no license  required as long as you stay on the pier to fish. Pay parking is available in a public lot near the base of the pier.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bb7uft39"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.148882,33.755441]}},{"properties":{"name":"Best Western Park Place Inn and Mini Suites","description":"Posted by Markema<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/lobby2004_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 1544 Harbor Boulevard Anaheim, CA 92802Adjacent to the Disneyland® Resort and Theme Park, the hotel offers 199 rooms for the families and business groups visiting Anaheim.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbldx498"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.914934,33.80984]}},{"properties":{"name":"Better Business Bureau","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 550 W Orangethorpe Ave, Placentia, CABetter Business Bureau (714) 985-8900<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbgzpltt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.877372,33.861163]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bistango","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 19100 Von Karman Ave Ste 100, Irvine, CAWide-open atrium in the middle of an upscale office building.

Daily specials like mussel pasta with tomato sauce, grilled chicken stuffed with spinach, roast veal and pasta with fresh tomato sauce, olive oil and basil are just a few examples of the delectables you might find on the agenda here. Pizza is excellent here, and the salads are very filling. All pastas are homemade; stop in on a Friday for the ethereal gnocchi. Beer and wine are served; the wine selection is very, very good. Pasquini\\'s is South Coast Plaza\\'s friendliest restaurant, a landmark for more than 20 years amidst the boutiques that come and go. In a perfect world, there would be table service here. But the counter service works for them, and they do an overwhelming amount of business every day. It\\'s a family-run business, augmented by the presence of the magnificent Angelo Capello, who Orange County diners will remember from the heyday of the Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel\\'s gone-but-not-forgotten Alfredo\\'s. Capello is alive and well and at the helm here.

Outside the patio is usually busy no matter what month it is. Girls defiantly sport short black skirts even in the middle of December. Inside the restaurant is warm and busy. The spacious brick building is completely hidden by scores of original paintings. Many of Orange County\\'s would-be artists are invited to use the space, not only as a gallery, but also as an open studio. Feel free to watch the artist at work, but stay far enough back that he won\\'t splash ochre on your Dockers.     Dining here is highly enjoyable and not at all expensive. Everything on the menu is an appetizer portion, but the chefs aren\\'t stingy with the food. A signature appetizer is the antipasto platter, which includes Parma ham and some wonderful anchovy-tinged tapenade. It\\'s large enough to be a meal for two. The Tango salad is also quite good. It features chunks of mildly flavored, chunky house-smoked salmon. Cajun chicken egg rolls are spicy on their own, but once you dip them in the accompanying Creole mustard -- look out. To drink, order a glass of red or white sangria. -- Lena Katz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbd1adgp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.889878,33.782107]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cedar Creek Inn","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 20 Pointe Dr., Brea, CA, United StatesCasual; live jazz entertainment; business clientele.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbkskcfk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.877131,33.92554]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_8626_primary.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 12700 Center Court Dr., Cerritos, CA, United StatesThe Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, (CCPA) is the Southland\\'s premier performing arts and conference facility, offering great performances in music, dance and theater and unique facilities for meetings, banquets and special events.\r\rOwned and operated by the City of Cerritos, CCPA presents an annual season from August through May.

The sleepy market is pungent with the aroma of curry, turmeric, fenugreek and cardamom, all draping around you like six yards of a sari.\n\nLaxmi has been around for 16 years and exists as a small temple of cluttered, unmanicured hominess stocked with English teas, sacks of jasmine rice, frozen meals of curry and a thriving selection of Indian movies and CDs.\n\nPass all this by and walk to the back where a short buffet is ready every day around 11 a.m. The lamb curry is tender, vegetable meatballs sit in a creamy yellow gravy, rolled chickpea crackers are wonderful snacks. Maybe the lentil soup is too watery, but the naan, charred in spots, is never insipid.\n\nThere are battered and fried potatoes that are perfectly creamy inside. And the pakoras, lentil fritters, are smooth and spicy.\n\nAll this requires a sweet ending. The rice pudding is milky and flavored with cinnamon and cardamom and fat raisins. The gulab jamun are deep-fried dumplings tasting vaguely of sweetened condensed milk soaking in simple syrup. You can also fill up on plain lassi or mango lassi, both are thick, creamy slushies made from yogurt.\n\nThere\\'s also a vast menu of Indian specialties, including parathas (stuffed pan-roasted wheat breads), outstanding biryanis (a pile of saffron-yellow rice flecked with spices and mixed with tender lamb or chicken), and vegetarian dishes such as baingan bharta (lucious eggplant simmered with onions and cinnamon) and aloo-poori (spicy potatoes served with deep-fried whole wheat bread).\n\nYou\\'ll be shocked by the length of dosas - they\\'ll seem like baseball bats. The large, diaphanous crepe is rolled around a filling of spicy potato and served with two sauces, one is made of coconut, the other tart and bright red from tomato. On the same plate is a dark pickle that\\'s as assaulting as anything you\\'ve evertasted.\n\nThe tika masala is one of a few dishes where spices take a back seat to a sweet, creamy gravy. It\\'s excellent with either lamb or chicken.\n\nSomeone in the kitchen here is making this soul food with imprecision, and yet, it\\'ll sink permanently into your psyche.\n\n-ocregister<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bblxzxlc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.823544,33.739661]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lazy Dog","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 16310 Beach Blvd, Huntington Beach, CA, 92683One thing\\'s for sure: The dawgs behind this new Huntington Beach hot spot are anything but lazy.

You\\'ll find that all the streets are named after different places in California...and the pools...and the parks. Hicks Canyon Elementary School is adjacent to the community so kids can actually walk to school without going outside the neighborhoods. Right outside is Hicks Canyon public park where parents usually watch baseball and soccer games; there are biking trails that lead to the foothills on both sides; and a local shopping center. The community is also very pedestrian and dog-friendly - residents like to walk to the grocery store, or their dogs, or kids in strollers at anytime of the day. 1/2 block away is my favorite coffee shop, Champagne Bakery, and 1 1/2 block away is my favorite bookstore.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbfbnbql"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.769972,33.728337]}},{"properties":{"name":"Occent Merchant Services","description":"Posted by Bryantepus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> 129 W.

As I grew up, my friends and I would float at night in swimming pools the temperature of blood; pools the color of Earth as seen from outer space. We would spend our summer days and nights bathed in chlorine - lit by the pure blue lights installed underneath diving boards. I used to think that the heat would suck every last drop from your swimming pool or redden our skins until it had the hue of raw flesh. I remembered you saying... And some people like summer. \"Have a great summer,\" their yearbook inscriptions bellow happily, as if they actually want me to enjoy myself, as if they actually would notice if I imploded in front of them. But with graduation here and the fact that I will probably never see any of my school mates again hovering in my brain, I can honestly say that I am going to have the best summer of my life and even my new manager at work can\\'t stop me.

The Dish: When Midwesterners crave a roast beef and smoked cheddar sandwich on fresh-baked Asiago cheese bread or a turkey artichoke panini, this is where they go. Widely known in the heartland for its fresh-baked artisan breads and delicious pastries, the bakery chain is in the process of expanding to the West Coast. Several locations are opening in 2003-04, most of them in California. Outstanding baked goods and heart-healthy recipes should make it an instant favorite with Left Coast denizens.     The Scene: Spacious, upscale and handsomely decorated, these bakeries are a favorite for breakfast, lunch, a light dinner or a quick snack. All kinds of people frequent them, from health gurus to self-styled food critics to hungry families. The dining area is usually quite pleasant, though during the lunch rush it can get overly crowded. The restaurants also do quite a bit of takeout business.

After experimenting with alternative food items, he opened three Taco-Tia stands between 1954 and 1955, which he later sold to his partners. He then opened the first Taco Bell in Downey, California on March 21, 1962.\n\nThe first Taco Bell franchise was sold in 1964 and the company went public in 1969. In 1978, Bell sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain was spun off along with Pepsi\\'s other fast food restaurant holdings as Tricon Global Restaurants in October 1997. Tricon became Yum! Brands, Inc. in May 2002.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Taco Bell changed its menu due to pressure concerning the nutritional value of items labeled \"Lite\". It was believed the term lite was vague or possibly deceptive. Many of the items were dropped entirely from the menu; one such item was the \"Taco Lite\", a fried flour tortilla shell with beef, sour cream, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. Some items were altered to change the nutritional values, such as the removal of black olives from the list of ingredients, in an effort to reduce sodium.\n\nIn early 1995, Taco Bell transformed the familiar rainbow logo, in favor of a simpler pink/purple combo logo in an effort to revitalize their almost 20 year old logo.\n\nOn April 1, 1996, Taco Bell took out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times announcing that they had purchased the Liberty Bell to \"reduce the country\\'s debt\" and renamed it to \"the Taco Liberty Bell.\" Thousands of people who did not immediately get the April Fool\\'s Day hoax protested.\n\nIn 2003, Costa Rican Taco Bell franchises temporary marketed their tacos as \"Tacos ticos,\" because for Costa Ricans, the word \"taco\" refers to what is known in Mexico as a flauta. (\"Tico\" and \"Costarrican\" are colloqial terms for natives of Costa Rica.)\n\nIn 2004, Taco Bell bought the naming rights to the Boise State Pavilion in Boise, Idaho and renamed the stadium the Taco Bell Arena.\n\nIn 2004, PepsiCo and Taco Bell introduced Mountain Dew Baja Blast. The tropical-lime flavored drink is exclusive to Taco Bell stores. Along with this, Taco Bell introduced its Mountain Dew Viva Variety! promotional campaign, where a sign shows three cups of Mountain Dew, one normal, one Code Red and one Baja Blast.\n\nAdded to the official menu in early 2006, the Crunchwrap Supreme is Taco Bell\\'s latest permanent product. Their most recent \"limited time only\" item was the Chicken Caesar Grilled Stuft Burrito.\n\nIn Canada, there were no Taco Bells in the province of Quebec before 2006. Priszm Brandz announced in April of that year that their first Quebec Taco Bell would open in suburban Montreal during the summer with 20 to 30 more to follow across the province.\n\n-wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbnuydpd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.850298,33.68305]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Melting Pot","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/Irvine,_CAIrvine1.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2646 Dupont Dr. Ste.

They have the natural and organic foods you\\'ve come to expect, along with delicious market-fresh produce that arrives daily. There\\'s a hearthstone bakery, located at the front of the store, where you can see speciality breads baked throughout the day. Their international food court caters to all cultures and all the locals can be typically seen eating in the dining area.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbgooudb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.826715,33.665005]}},{"properties":{"name":"Willis, Don - California Business Complex","description":"Posted by System681 S Tustin St, Orange, CAWillis, Don - California Business Complex (714) 633-0125<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbntdxh4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.835593,33.777602]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yaba Java","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 12908 Main St, Garden Grove, CA, 92840Supporting neighborhood businesses can feel like an obligation these days, but in some cases -- and Yaba Java is definitely one of them -- it\\'s a pleasure. The little family-owned coffee shop has more specialty drinks than any of the big guns do, and it also offers a variety of non-coffee-based specialties. Try the Almond Roca Mocha, the chocolate-coconut iced blended, or any of the flavored hot chocolates, and your nerves will soon be a-buzz with epicurean delight (and caffeine). Pastries, sandwiches and bagels are available. However, for the truly self-indulgent, there\\'s a whole selection of hand-dipped, homemade (in the proprietor\\'s home, not in the store itself) chocolate treats. There are chocolate-covered almonds, marshmallows, graham crackers, maraschino cherries and more.     The place is on the small side and cozy in that typical thrown-together, study-groups-welcome, casual, coffee-shop style. Board games are available, and you can usually scrounge up some reading material if you look around. In nice weather, the pretty outdoor patio is the place to be -- otherwise, try to snag the big leather sofa. If you\\'re there on Friday night, you\\'ll find yourself smack in the center of the Garden Grove Classic Car Show, which takes place weekly (weather permitting) on the Main Street historic strip right outside. -- Lena Katz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbavnxya"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.940977,33.775271]}},{"properties":{"name":"Your Business Network","description":"Posted by Bradporcellato<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/YBN_copy_47_.JPG\">santa  anaYBN Orange County<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bbcux4vl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.866944,33.745556]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zankou Chicken","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/foodimages%5CHalfCkHero.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/foodimages%5CTarnaPlt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2424 W. Ball Road, Anaheim, CAIt\\'s probably the best rotisserie chicken you\\'ll ever find - the color of 24-carat gold, with crispy skin and tender meat. It comes with a pungent garlic paste that you\\'ll taste for hours, if not days, afterward.

Breakfast selections include raisin brioche French toast, Belgian waffles, a panini sandwich and a smoked salmon omelette. The pastries are made on the premises and are available for takeout. The business crowd dominates at lunch and they love starting with warm pita and hummus, which precedes entrees like soujouk arrabbiata -- a spicy penne with Armenian sausage -- and a chicken tahini pita. Dinner is more formal and Babaganooj, a roasted, pureed eggplant with tahini and garlic is a great starter while main dishes include chicken geras, which is stuffed with wild rice, almonds and sour cherry sauce. There are plenty of seafood or vegetarian items on the menu as well, and a Sunday brunch that people swear by.     Zov\\'s offers cooking classes on certain nights and its catering business is booming. Customers here are loyal, but novelist Dean Koontz took it one step further and dedicated a book to Zov. -- Victoria Namkung<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a688bblt1970"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.827622,33.759706]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/725255","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jpowell74","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jpowell74","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/725255","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":115,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=725255,platial:user=jpowell74","published":"2010-03-02T17:00:00Z","id":27132}
