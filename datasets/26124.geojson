Runs alongside Liverpool Street Station, connecting Bishopsgate to Exchange Square.\n\nWhat? An enclosed, dimly lit walkway of daunting length (218 paces). Accessed at one end by furtive, slimline escalators a little beyond Café Nero, and at the other by stairs close to the Broadgate Venus. Some good views of the station platforms for people who like good views of station platforms.\n\nWhy use? One of several alternatives for office workers north and east of the station wishing to reach the platforms without braving the outside world. No charity muggers here.\n\nAlso good for? (1) A rapid, rain-free rollerblading route (it’s deserted at weekends); (2) film location work, by virtue of the Orwellian oppressiveness; (3) laughing at high-speed rollerbladers crashing into film crews. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642461f1apt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0809,51.518]}},{"properties":{"name":"10.

Piddling little dogleg to the East of Chancery Lane. Yes, we’re back near Samuel Johnson Land again.\n\nWhat? Surely London’s least grimy alley. Sandblasted and scrubbed to the point that you could eat your dinner off it whilst performing open heart surgery. The largely useless route was built just before the Great Fire by a chap called Thomas Took (and not the filthy little Hobbitsy). Over the years, it’s housed the poet Sheridan (in a debtor’s prison) and, briefly, Charles Dickens (but then he lived everywhere).\n\nWhy use? Fans of hidden London may wish to make a pilgrimage to this spot. Until recently one of two entrances to the semi-secret tunnels and bunker beneath Holborn could be found in Took’s Court. The visible infrastructure was demolished and redeveloped a couple of years ago, hence why everything looks so clinical, spangly and new.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245u9zbsi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.11075,51.51703]}},{"properties":{"name":"11.

As its name suggests, this one runs alongside St Bride\\'s church, south of Fleet Street, and turns 90 degrees at the north-west to lead into the church.\n\nWhat?\nLooking something like an open sewer in our photo, this is actually quite a pleasant place. Hitch up over that wall, and you\\'ll be in the churchyard, a quiet, contemplative space to sit.\n\nWhy use?\nIf you only visit one church this year, make it St Bride\\'s. You don\\'t need to be all gody or anything to appreciate the layers of history in this place. From the tiered spire, which influenced the first wedding cake, to the crypt, which houses a small musuem and significant Roman remains - this is one of those London spots that almost sweats with history (see picture). Did we mention that the first printing press was set up in the churhyard in 1501? And way, way before that, this was a place of ancient pagan worship. There\\'s just too much for this one little column to cover. Do go and have a look some time.\n\nAlso good for?\n1. Banksy spotting. There\\'s a faded rat just out of shot to the left of this picture. 2. Entrance to the Old Bell pub (bit cluttered with suits, but one of the gems of Fleet Street).\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245xe0rlu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.10552,51.51394]}},{"properties":{"name":"12.

Dingy little dogleg behind King\\'s Cross Thameslink.\n\nWhat? Ah, St Chad. You know, the brother of St Cedd and St Cynibild? Founder of the moanstery at Barrow-upon-Humber? Patron saint of rigged elections? No? Since ancient times, this spot contained a small, health-giving spring dedicated to the saint. St Chad\\'s Well, was one of several ancient and important water supplies associated with the River Fleet. The passageway probably predates the Victorian redevelopment in which the Midland Railway carved up the surrounding area, obliterating all trace of the well. The Fleet still flows close by, buried beside the railway.\n\nWhy use? Well, it\\'s a nice little shortcut between Gray\\'s Inn Road and King\\'s Cross Road. But more importantly, it houses the superb 06 St Chad\\'sPlace. This swanky but friendly bar gets everything just about right. But riddle us this: how can a bar look so full of life while playing non-stop Smiths and Morrissey? And with one whole wall sporting a lifesize image of a Thameslink train? What were they thinking? Make sure you visit.\n\nAlso good for? A rail bridge in the passage makes a superb vantage point for over-tall trainspotters with a mono-passion for Thameslink.\n\nSorry, we mean \\'First Capital Connect\\'. What kind of a shitty, customer unfriendly rebranding was that? We know the franchise changed hands, but couldn\\'t the new owners have invented a catchier name? What\\'s the new equivalent of saying \\'I\\'m going to catch the Thameslink\\'? Should we call it the FCC? And what the deuce are the stations going to be? Is King\\'s Cross Thameslink to become the unwieldy King\\'s Cross First Capital Connect (KCFCC). Sounds like a Holloway Road chicken outlet.

That set of steps you see leads up from New Bridge Street into a small lane known as Pilgrim Street. The view from the other end is equally impressive, with the wedding-cake tower of St Brides framed by office buildings.\n\nWhat? Because much of its course is open to vehicles, this narrow route behind the CityThameslink building only partly qualifies for our column on account of the pedestrianised western end. It leads into an extended network of ancient alleyways to the south west of the cathedral.\n\nWhy use? Certainly, it\\'s a good spot to impress visitors to the city, with the dome of St Paul\\'s rising above the steps. All very Oliver Twist, but without the filth and petty theft. It\\'s also a crafty means of getting into the Thameslink station without having to fight through the hordes on Ludgate Hill.\n\nAlso good for? Budding archaeologists. The Roman city wall is presumed to have crossed Pilgrim Street on its way down to the Thames. However, no remains have ever been found along this stretch, so perhaps there\\'s a major archaeological find just waiting to happen. In Medieval times, the wall was rebuilt and actually ran the length of Pilgrim Street.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642463dz85p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.10373,51.51375]}},{"properties":{"name":"14.

Refurbished shortcut at the back of Holborn Tube station.\n\nWhat? The most recent and blandest of several \\'turnstiles\\' in the area - Great Turnstile and Little Turnstile are the others. These alleys once contained gateposts to prevent livestock escaping from the grazing areas now known as Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields. No sign of the posts, or the sheep, remains today. In fact, there\\'s no sign of anything but wheelie bins down the curiosity vacuum that is New Turnstile. Perhaps that\\'s why Camden Council decided to install the crazy, wobbly paving you see in the picture. Whoooa, how whacky.\n\nWhy use? In conjunction with the marginally more exciting Gate Street, this forms one of London\\'s most useful shortcuts. Holborn station in the rush hour is one of London\\'s most pressing pedestrian bottlenecks and several people have paid with their lives on the dangerous crossroads outside. Cutting down these back streets is much quicker than forcing your way through the throng.\n\nAlso good for? The bendy paving undulates with the perfect frequency to counter the swaying effects of alcohol. Especially useful in Holborn, whose many great pubs include The Ship Tavern on nearby Little Turnstile.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245r89fre"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.11964,51.51748]}},{"properties":{"name":"15.

Long, sloping alley dropping from Maiden Lane down to Strand.\nWhat? Named after, unsurprisingly, the Bull Inn tavern, which once stood at the foot of the hill. A narrow cutting between the Adelphi and Vaudeville theatres widens in the middle, allowing in a little daylight. Charmingly spooky, if you ignore the smell.\nWhy use? This alley checks all our boxes. 1. It has history. Actor William Terris was murdered \\'yards from this spot\\' in 1897, according to a notice toward the Strand end. This is slightly stretching the truth, as Terris was actually stabbed round the corner on Maiden Lane. With his dieing breath he vowed to return, and his spectre has been spotted by the credulous in several local spots, including Covent Garden Tube. 2. It has a good pub. The Nell Gwynne, named of course for the famous mistress of Charles II, who lived locally. The Nell is a tiny, old-man sort of place, with a winningly old-fashioned interior and several real ales. Also has its own ghost and \\'Hellish stairs to the toilets\\'. 3. The cutting is eminently practical for avoiding herds of tourists in surrounding Covent Garden precincts.\nAlso good for? Homeless sleeping and pavement pissing, judging from the smell.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424628t965"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12276,51.51039]}},{"properties":{"name":"15.

Please mind your head.\nWhat?Perhaps one of the shortest short-cuts we\\'ve yet featured, this alleyway is nevertheless a relative heavyweight historically. The Court was constructed in 1688, becoming one of the first areas to be built upon in this area. It soon gained a reputation as an excellent place to catch cholera, syphillis, or an extreme case of death thanks to the overcrowding and squalor. One notable sampler of the area\\'s unsavoury character was the writer John Dryden, who is said to have been mugged and almost murdered while walking down Lazenby Court. This is probably nonsense though.\nWhy Use?File this one under the burgeoning catagory of passages with good pubs down them. The Lamb and Flag, although usually too busy to contemplate, is an excellent place for a cheeky half. In darker times, the hostelry was known as the Bucket of Blood. You\\'d have thought Dryden would have got the hint.\nAlso Good for?Given the name...topical James Bond tie-ins (we can link anything on this site!).\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642462lkw3w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12571,51.5118]}},{"properties":{"name":"16.

North-east corner of Red Lion Square, connecting through to Theobald\\'s Road.\nWhat? Pleasant diagonal, taking in quaint eateries and not-so-quaint pink flats built on heavily war-damaged land. Formerly called Little Conduit Street, the passage takes its name from a water channel built by the philanthropic William Lamb in the 16th century. Originally, similar alleys existed at all four corners of the square, but road alterations have removed most traces of the other three.\nWhy use? Another one with a good pub, this. The Dolphin at the Theobald\\'s Road end is a pokey smokey kind of place, with a high proportion of regulars. It also boasts a haunted clock, which was pulled from the rubble when the pub was destroyed in WWI. The opposing Enterprise is also worth a visit.\nAlso good for? A particularly quirky bookshop that keeps very strange hours and an eminently browsable stock. Also, check out Conway Hall at the Red Lion Square end. This \\'hub for free speech and progressive thought\\' is London\\'s spiritual home for morality and ethics. Not so progressive in its interior decorating, though. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245qxnmt8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.11802,51.51988]}},{"properties":{"name":"17.

A little north-east of fragrant Hyde Park Corner. Built on the site of the ancient May Fairs, after which the wider area is named.\n\nWhat? A charming conglomeration of pokey eateries, thrusting awnings and cluttered passages, all colleced under the one name. The result is the most atmospheric of Mayfair\\'s many antiquated enclaves.\n\nWhy use? Bask in a piece of semi-genuine old English lovliness, without the usual tourist hordes. Can get busy in the summer, though.\n\nAlso good for? Pubs (again!!). Ye Grapesand the King\\'s Arms are two of the area\\'s finest if you catch them at the right time. Also, prozzies. In situ for generations; and even by appointment to a certain former Mayoral candidate. There was still a touch of the sordid on our visit, with prominent canvases of luxuriously splayed nudes in a local gallery window.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642465iy4gm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.147,51.50647]}},{"properties":{"name":"18 Kingly Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245zpcjl8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13941,51.5129]}},{"properties":{"name":"18.

One of several upper-class tunnels in SW1. This one connects Jermyn Street to the A4 (or Piccadilly to you and me).\n\nWhat? Ah, a scene straight off of a Victorian Christmas card. But appearances can be deceiving. Princes Arcade was the last such thoroughfare to be built in the area and dates from as late as 1933.\n\nWhy use? Festive shopping. And if ever a hall was decked with boughs of holly, this is it. You\\'ll find shop after shop of luxury-class tat for the toff who has everything. Take these, for example. An ideal gift for fans of dogs in period military costume.\n\nAlso good for?

A clement thoroughfare connecting Oxford Street (near Bond Street Tube) to Wigmore Street.\n\nWhat? It might be full of beautiful people today, but St Kitt\\'s was once a rather slummy backwater known as Barretts Court. It later found some semblance of respectability under the guidance of Octavia Hill, one of the Victorian founders of the National Trust, who bought the noisome plot and rechristened it after her pet saint. A local plaque speaks of cheesemongers, drapers and chandlers lining the street at that time. All trades that wouldn\\'t look out of place today, along this cutting of bright shops and inviting eateries.\n\nWhy use? If you\\'re stuck on Oxford Street during the New Year sales and are close to screaming, seek out this alleyway and all will be calm again. It\\'s like escaping into Mayfair, only less exclusive and more focussed on food and speciality shops. Our favourite is \\'Under two flags\\', a tiny outlet on the east side selling toy soldiers like it\\'s still 1807.\n\nAlso good for? Al fresco dining is nothing special in London these days, but St Christopher\\'s Place boasts one of the largest concentrations of pavement dining in the West End.

Brunswick Square to Mecklenburgh Square\n\nWhere? Obscure Bloomsbury hinterland, North of Coram’s Fields.\n\nWhat? A leafy, nameless passageway connecting the northern ends of the two squares. The track is unsigned and little known even by locals. It runs through land once owned by the Foundling Hospital, a charitable children’s institution whose patrons included Hogarth and Handel. The passage separates the so-called Coram Community Campus from an acre or so of Astroturf to the south.\n\nWhy use? The little-known Foundling Museum is sited at the Brunswick end. This is definitely worth a visit if you’re a fan of Twistian tales of woebegone orphans. They’ve got an impressive art collection too. Also nearby is the art-house Renoir Cinema and the soon-to-be reborn Brunswick Centre (‘a high-street for Bloomsbury’ say the posters). Unless you’re lucky enough to live in or around Mecklenburgh Square, however, there are quicker routes to all of these.\n\nAlso good for?

This part of Cowcross Street would have then overlooked the River Fleet, which today lies buried beneath the Metropolitan Line tracks. Back then, herds of cattle would have been herded daily past the entrance of this passage, on their way to Smithfield Market. From whence the name Cowcross Street.\r\n\r\nWhy use? There\\'s no particularly good reason to use this passage, other than a more atmospheric alternative to Turnmill Street. However, it does lead to St John\\'s Gardens, a very small, and somehow morose, patch of turf.

Short pedestrian route between Charing Cross Road and St Martin\\'s Lane.\n\nWhat? In the heart of glitzy, neon tourist-town, it\\'s heartening to find such a contrasting bastion of antiquity. The shop fronts have not, we\\'re told, been altered in more than a century. All of which made this the perfect location for filming recent period piece \\'Miss Potter\\'. The Victorian frontages belie the true age of this street, which dates to the late 17th Century. It\\'s named after Robert Cecil, the leading minister whom Elizabeth I referred to as her elf, on account of his gurnsome features. Now famed for its books, the street has previously had associations with other artforms. Many early film companies were based here in the early 20th Century, leading to its erstwhile nickname Flicker Alley. Fitting, then, that it has a handsome representation in the 21st Century, courtesy of Flickr. There\\'s also evidence that the young Mozart lived here, very briefly, in 1764.\n\nWhy use?

Barely visible on most maps, this little dog-leg sits within the precincts of the ancient St Bartholomew\\'s Church, Smithfield.\n\nWhat? This is one of our favourite parts of town for poking around and feeling the history. The nearby church is one of London\\'s most beautiful, and to step inside when the incense is burning can bring tears of wonder to the most hardened atheist. Cloth Court is one of numerous surviving passages and courts in the area. The cloth association comes from the ancient Bartholomew Fair, which for 700 years was one of Europe\\'s biggest textile markets. This was finally banned by the no-fun Victorians, who wanted to stamp out the chaos and crime associated with the event. Many London Greats have lived nearby. Inigo Jones, Ben Franklin, William Hogarth...it\\'s an impressive list. The blue plaque you see in the photo is to poet laureate John Betjaman, who lived on the corner above what is now an outlet of Jamie\\'s wine bar, bearing his name.\n\nWhy use? Well, it doesn\\'t really go anywhere, so your visit here is simply to breath in the history...and/or the stench of stale urine.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642464xsvtl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.10016,51.51903]}},{"properties":{"name":"23.

A sibling to Bull Inn Court, running down ancient sloped from Maiden Lane to Strand.\n\nWhat? To avoid the cliché of calling this lane \\'Dickensian\\', we\\'d like to proclaim it a passage of Coxian dimension. The gas-lit southern end oozes atmosphere. It\\'s a creepy, quiet place where only drunks loiter for long. We expect, and find, the now familiar stench of last night\\'s bladder urge.\n\nThrough the Stuart and Georgian eras, the neighbourhood was alive with seedy, vice-ridden markets. It\\'s not clear whether the alley takes its name from the exchange of goods, or bodily fluids. Later, the court housed a troupe of errand-runners and odd-jobbers known as the Corps of Commissionaires - ex-servicemen with their own special uniform and military band. The Corps is still active today, having transmogrified into a security outfit.\n\nWhy use? Get to the heart of Covent Garden without having to walk past loads of overpriced outdoor-persuits shops. And, as usual, bypass the tourists.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245xaque2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12338,51.51016]}},{"properties":{"name":"24.

Surviving bastion of the Ripper\\'s London in the heart of Spitalfields.\n\nWhat? The sickly lighting only adds to the troubling atmosphere of Artillery Passage. The short passage has changed little since the days of Jack the Ripper. His final victim, Mary Kelly was dissected just yards from the eastern end of Artillery Passage, where today a multistorey car park stands. Appropriately, someone had daubed a lifesize image of the Ripper on a nearby wall - through that glowing opening to the left. Which has a macabre roundness about it, considering Jack was no stranger to graffiti himself.\n\nArtillery passage and the nearby Lane take their names from, predictably, an old military training ground. The artillery field was established by Henry VIII after nicking the land from the nearby St Mary Spital priory (remains of which can now be seen in the new Spitalfields development). The street was layed out in the 1680s. Today it mostly contains eateries of one stripe or another, cashing in on the tourist trade.\n\nWhy use? You\\'ll certainly pass this way if you\\'re on one of the many Ripper tours. If you\\'ve never been here before it\\'s worth making a trip over to see a genuine, untouched bit of old London. It\\'s also a convenient route if you\\'re heading to Brick Lane from Liverpool Street.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642464n4k5e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.07743,51.51813]}},{"properties":{"name":"25 Grosvenor Street (offices visited by Litvinenko)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642461q1qsw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.14733,51.51185]}},{"properties":{"name":"25.

Part-pedestrianised route in the heart of Soho, linking Wardour and Dean Streets. Sounds like a sack of French excrement. Isn\\'t.\n\nWhat? Meard Street is a street of two halves, with a western end closed to traffic and an eastern cul-de-sac. This reflects the origins of the street, which started life as a pair of courtyards. The unified route was built in the 1720-30s by the carpenter John Meard, who was also responsible for the slightly eccentric spire of nearby St Anne\\'s church. Many of the original houses remain, and it\\'s perhaps the best place in Soho to admire Georgian architecture.\n\nWhy use?\nGood for street art. Not only does a faded Banksy rat grace the corner of one building, but a peculiar stone nose can be seen poking out from a wall at the eastern end. And then there\\'s this. http://london.thewayweseeit.org/index.php?full=1&amp;lo=48&amp;iid=862&amp;page=slide<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642463pyxk1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13335,51.51316]}},{"properties":{"name":"26.

Sticking in Soho for another week, this little cutting will take you from Lexington Street to Hopkin Street.\n\nWhat? A rather anonymous alleyway, which seems to evade the attentions of the usual reference books. We\\'re not even sure why it\\'s called Silver Place; perhaps as a nominative . A number of markets have existed closeby over the centuries, so perhaps one of these specialised in silver. To the north-east, when the passage was called Pulteney Court, stood the Lion Brewery (1801 to 1937). The brewery played an important role in the history of public health. Many locals died during an outbreak of cholera in 1854. Dr John Snow theorised that this might be down to an infected water source - the Broad Street pump. One of the clinchers in his argument was the lack of fatalities amongst the brewery workers, who rarely drank anything other than beer. Snow thus became the first to demonstrate that cholera is a water-borne disease, the first step in eliminating it as a risk to public health.\n\nWhy use? If you\\'re an ageing bohemian and want to remain in Soho. Silver Place perhaps takes its name from the follicular hue of its denizens. To the south-east corner stands Pargiter Court - a residential block now used as retirement flats. A plaque notes that when the building was erected in 1886, the local vestry ordered the inclusion of iron balconies to \\'encourage a taste for window gardening\\'. The ornate ironmongery can still be seen today.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642461pxxv2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13589,51.513]}},{"properties":{"name":"27.

Northern strand in a City cavalcade of passages. This one\\'s located in the snickety heaven south-west of St Paul\\'s.\n\nWhat? Cobb\\'s Court was a new, if modest, addition to the City after the Great Fire, built on ground formerly occupied by St Anne, Blackfriars. Passage-master Ivor Hoole suggests the name may come from Paul Cobb, Mayor of Bedford, who had documented liason\\'s with the best-named builder in London\\'s history - Nicholas If-Jesus-Had-Not-Died-For-Thee-Thou-Hadst-Been-Damned Barbon. (No, really.) Hilariously, the southern section was formerly called Postboy Passage. The now familiar trickle of dubious liquid was, we\\'re happy to report, just a leaky drain.\n\nWhy use? Hmm, well, if you want to pass unnoticed from the overgenerously named Ludgate Broadway to Carter Lane, then this is for you. Otherwise, one of the less worthy entries in our series.

Just north of Tower Hill (see map below) on Cooper\\'s Row, a hotel forecourt leads through to a hidden section of London\\'s Roman wall. An opening to the left (where that chap\\'s passing through) leads out towards Minories.\n\nWhat? Where else in London can you enjoy an Italian coffee next to a 1900 year-old Italian relic? The courtyard of the Grange City Hotel conceals one of the few surviving sections of Roman wall, sited just metres from the tourist hub of Tower Hill. Most of what you see in the photo is Medieval, but the red-banded foundations are from the time of the Caesars. A transmural passage and a style (of no substance) lead to nowhere in particular.\n\nWhy use? Impress friends and family by showing them one of those recondite sites that have yet to reach most guide books.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245t2g02s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0762,51.51067]}},{"properties":{"name":"29.

SE1, close to Borough Tube and St George’s church.\n\nWhat? ‘Dickensian’ is an adjective so steeped in cliché that we have a rule at Londonist: whenever the word slips into a post, we get the writer to pay a sovereign towards upkeep of the local orphanage. Here, however, we can wield the description with justified impunity. This alley (formerly Angel Court) really is Dickensian. Look, it appears in Little Dorrit:\n\n    Whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on the very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea Goal; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; will stand among the crowded ghosts of many miserable years.\n\nHe’s right. That high wall you see on the right is the boundary of Marshalsea Prison – a debtor’s gaol which housed Dickens’ father in 1824. The prison was closed later in the century, but a few remains can be seen.\n\nThis one really, really does smell of piss.\n\nWhy use? The passage has an opening into St George’s Gardens – one of the few local areas of green. The park occupies the site of the Marshalsea, and attracts an apt community of down-and-outers. Be careful not to get locked in by the council workers who turn up with Marley-like chains at closing time.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245x4f1rn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.09255,51.50178]}},{"properties":{"name":"3.

Connects St Martin’s Lane (next to the ENO) to Bedfordbury.\n\nWhat? Catherine Brydges of Chandos, wife of the Fourth Earl of Bedford, must have been delighted to have this back passage named after her. It’s a lengthy thoroughfare of extremely mean width. Expect tailbacks whenever folk of ample carriage attempt to pass through. Perhaps because the passage is lined with rear entrances to pubs and eateries (and even a private club), the expected waft of tramp’s piss never quite materialises.\n\nWhy use? You’re a Londoner, you’ve stumbled into the dreaded tourist precincts, and you’re stuck in a chaotic sea of confused theatregoers. If you want to move anywhere, you have two options. (1) Wait for the capricious drift of plate tectonics. (2) Learn to use passages such as this. Knowledge of the numerous shortcuts of the West End is invaluable if you want to get around at anything approaching normal speed.\n\nAlso good for? (1) Giving portly pursuers and hammerhead sharks the slip. (2) Low-budget reenactments of the Star Wars trench finalé.

Steep cutting leading up from the west side of Heath Street, Hampstead.\n\nWhat? The slopes of Holly Hill couldn\\'t be more quaint if they were tended by a hobbit\\'s grandmother. This passage takes you to the highest strata of Hampstead society, past seriously expensive properties. No hint of tramp\\'s piss here. If any commoner released his bladder upon these august flagstones, all trace of the besmirchment would be quickly washed away. By the maid. With leftover Moet and/or Chandon.\n\nThe twisting alley eventually reaches a plateau, from which can be seen The City, in some of its glory.\n\nWhy use? As is so often the case with these passages, Holly Bush Steps leads to one of London\\'s finest pubs. The Holly Bush dates from 1643 and was one of many, many favourite drinking holes of Samuel Jhonson.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642460hat2h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1788,51.55754]}},{"properties":{"name":"31.

Erm, King\\'s Cross. But it\\'s more than just a platform. It\\'s a sneaky back passage.\n\nWhat? Harry Potter\\'s Platform 9 3/4 isn\\'t the only secret portal on the station. Platform 1 runs along the east side of the main building - it\\'s the one with the pirate-themed pasty stall and the AMT coffee kiosk. The powers that be allow pedestrians to wander the length as a rainproof alternative to York Way. A cobbled slip road at yon end leads up to the junction with Wharfdale Road.\n\nThe route is an endangered species. As part of a redevelopment of the station, Metronet plans to close off platform access to all but ticket holders. Local residents and workers have lobbied the authorities, and the decision now rests with Camden Council.\n\nWhy use? York Way is grim, so if you ever need to head that way, consider Platform 1 as an alternative (although the diesel fumes at the \\'country end\\' of the station are also off-putting). A Wotsit of trainspotters can usually be found basking in the fumes.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642463xh5gs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12295,51.53213]}},{"properties":{"name":"4.

Semi-visible snicket linking the enigmatic Ely Place to Hatton Garden.\n\nWhat? Anyone who claims familiarity with London’s passageways will know that we had to cover this one sooner rather than later. As well as being Elizabeth I’s alleyway of choice, it was once patrolled by a costumed beadle and wasn’t considered part of London at all. So much oddness in so little space.\n\nWhy use? The Old Mitre Tavern, one of London’s canonical must-see boozers, takes up the north side. This is the Lizzy link. She once danced around a maypole tree at this place, and the stump in the bar is a remnant of this – or so the legend goes.\n\nAlso good for? Evading arrest. The long arm of the law needs to be rather elastic if it’s to reach you down here. The passage and connecting Ely Place are traditionally part of Cambridgeshire, so neither the Met nor the City Police can wield authority. A ‘fact’ particularly handy for gem thieves, given the convenience of the Hatton Garden diamond quarter. Sadly, the more responsible sources for some reason insist on accuracy over anecdote, and claim this quirk of law is no longer the case.

Part of that baffling network of passages just north of Fleet Street. Well maintained and currently undergoing a refurb of street furniture (check out the inky-black water feature - not pictured).\n\nWhat? A twisting, partly covered alley with some character left, despite one too many modern developments.\n\nWhy use? The route is trodden by many a lexiphile, for it leads to Gough Square and the house-museum of Dr Johnson (creator of the first decent English dictionary).\n\nAlso good for? Dashing your faith in seemingly reasonable assumptions. Dr Johnson not only lived in nearby Gough Square, but also resided in Johnson’s Court for nearly 11 years. Yet the name of the passage has nothing to do with him. It is called for Thomas Johnson, a tailor who lived here some 200 years before Samuel.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245ylz8rt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.10844,51.51448]}},{"properties":{"name":"55 Broadway (1927-29)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/Holden_55_Broadway.jpg\">The headquarters of the London Underground, and St James Tube station, are perhaps not as impressive as they once were. Surrounded by later less-significant buildings of similar height, 55 Broadway fails to really stand out. Eighty years ago, however, this cruciform building was the tallest office complex in London.

There can’t be many shortcuts that lead to a Royal Palace, but, by Jove, here’s one. The aptly named Crown Passage spills out onto Pall Mall, close to the redbrick St James Palace. Its other end reaches King Street.\nWhat? Narrow and crowded with ancient buildings and swinging signs - feels very ye olde worlde. A jumble of sandwich shops (yes, that is a Pret) and one of London’s finest pubs make for a well-trodden byway.\nWhy use? A visit to the unexpectedly down-to-earth Red Lion is one of the few reasons to go to St James if you are not of noble blood. The pub claims the second oldest licence in the West End. We choose to believe that locals have included the Queen Mum (God rest her soul), given that Clarence House is also nearby. Sadly, aficionados of vagrant piss will be disappointed.

But with its cobbled surface and general out-of-the-wayness it feels like a right proper alley. Also possesses its own localised weather systems, judging by the ever-preset rain whenever we visit.\n\nWhy use? You have absolutely no business being down here unless you require access to one of the adjoining properties.

Frequented by upper-class gents with square briefcases and weird handshakes. It hasn’t always been so hushed, though. 150 years ago, over 1000 people (mostly Irish) resided here, in just 13 houses.\n\nWhy use? The passage leads nowhere useful and runs parallel to two alternative routes. But it is good, excellent in fact, for cycle parking. For all those biwheeled moaners who say there’s nowhere to chain up bikes in central London, well looky here. A five minute walk from the heart of Covent Garden and not a single velocipede in evidence, despite ample provision.\n\nAlso good for? 1. Ideal course for beginners’ croquet. 2. Playing knock-a-door-run with befuddled Freemasons.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642464x5u74"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.11993,51.51522]}},{"properties":{"name":"81 Newman Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642462pninb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13551,51.51694]}},{"properties":{"name":"89 St James Square - Monty","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424664umwq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13535,51.50722]}},{"properties":{"name":"9.

In an area of the City where unlikely street names are two-a-penny (Seething Lane, Mincing Lane, Savage Gardens), French Ordinary Court is perhaps the wackiest of all. It links Fenchurch Street to Crutched Friars (there’s another one) via some fancy brickwork vaulting.\n\nWhat? Two passages in one - a veritable ginnel glut. The northern, open-air end is known as St Katherine’s Row, as it runs through the churchyard of the long-demolished St Katherine Coleman. Further down, the alley passes under railway tracks, and is named French Ordinary Court. (This is the dark, creepy section shown in the photo.) The southernmost part unexpectedly widens into a car park. The unusual name, so it’s reckoned, derives from a Gallic eatery once located near the site. An ‘ordinary’ was a fixed-price meal purveyed in such restaurants. The eating place was destroyed during the Great Fire and never replaced.\n\nWhy use? Good views of the Lloyds Registry of Shipping extension, designed by Lord Rogers. A kind of update on his more famous Lloyds Building. Also, the cavernous stretches to the southern end of the passage are worth a visit for their sheer atmospheric pleasure.\n\nAlso good for? 1. An as-yet undiscovered goldmine for carjackers, druggies, graffiti artists and other ne’er-do-wells. 2. Ideal location for Vincent Price impersonations.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245znos1x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.07846,51.51141]}},{"properties":{"name":"A bomb in Wardour Street -

The building was designed by the great Charles Holden, who also gave us Senate House and a medley of underground stations. Epstein was asked to decorate the façade with artwork showing the great men of medicine. He thought otherwise and proceeded to sculpt, in situ, an assortment of larger-than-life, mostly naked figures called the ‘Ages of Man’. The result shocked Edwardian society. The Evening Standard, as reactionary now as it’s always been, famously described them as: “A form of statuary which no careful father would wish his daughter, or no discriminating young man, his fiancée, to see.\" As always with such things, they flocked in their thousands to view such an outrage. Their present defacement has nothing to do with angry crowds, however. In the 1930s it literally began raining men when a crumbling stone penis crashed to the floor. The building’s owners were ordered to secure the carvings, and all overhanging parts, be they heads, limbs or cocks, were hacked away.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245wc7gn2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.123848,51.509624]}},{"properties":{"name":"BT Tower (The War Machines)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>BT <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642463y4fge"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.138488,51.521815]}},{"properties":{"name":"Baker Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>Home of the fourth and sixth Dr Whos?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245rt7ybb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.156384,51.519586]}},{"properties":{"name":"Baker Street - Gerry Rafferty","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424642lw58"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.15591,51.51857]}},{"properties":{"name":"Balfron Tower, Brownfield Estate, Poplar (1964)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Balfron_Tower_Goldfinger.jpg\">Look familiar?

Goldfinger lived here himself for a short while, and would host champagne evenings for the tenants at which he would grill them for ideas and improvements he then incorporated into Trellick.

On the same estate are Carradale and Glenkerry Houses, also designed by our man, and incorporating many of the same features. Particularly Glenkerry, which is 14 storeys high and also sports a concrete \\'head\\' atop the lift shaft.

It rises from New Oxford Street as though a colony of upwardly mobile coral had decided to stop farting about on the seabed and learn some simple geometry. The 34 storey building has courted controversy, and even conspiracy, since it arrived on the then-pristine skyline in 1966. It has too often stood empty, flouted the planning laws of the time, and has overshadowed the historic parish of St Giles to the point where the latter now languishes in obscurity. On the other hand, it has plenty of character for a building of its height, and has received Grade II listed status. It’s also reasonably thin, so those who don’t like it are only offended from its broadsides.\n\nCentre Point divides opinions like few other buildings in London. Even on the Londonist team, debates on its merits, or lack of them, have almost come to blows.

As usual, Holden wished to decorate the building in sculpture, and commissioned the leading artists of the day (including Henry Moore and Eric Gill), to decorate the outside of the building. To the consternation of many (still scandalised by the figures on the Strand, and the Rima nudity), Jacob Epstein was invited to submit two works: Day and Night. The former, and most controversial, appears to show a rampant act of paedophilia. Legend has it that the smaller figure once bore a much longer penis, but this was truncated by Epstein after another bout of public outrage, and even offers of resignation from senior London Underground staff. A good account of the controversy surrounding the works is given in the best book about London from 2005: ‘From Here to Here’<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245xvkb8g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.133402,51.499473]}},{"properties":{"name":"Denmark Street, The Kinks","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245syh1q2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12941,51.51529]}},{"properties":{"name":"Do the Strand, Roxy Music","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424634t7af"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12508,51.5088]}},{"properties":{"name":"Don't go back to Dalston, Razorlight","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245tm1q14"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.06793,51.5482]}},{"properties":{"name":"Down at the Old Bull and Bush, Hunting, Krone, Stirling and Von Tilzer","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245vj74r4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.18224,51.56689]}},{"properties":{"name":"Downing Street Kindling, Larrikin Love","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642461vis4a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12727,51.50321]}},{"properties":{"name":"Drapers Gardens (1962-67)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://www.geocities.com/PicketFence/4191/drapers.jpg\">Drapers Gardens (far right) is a much disliked high-rise in the middle of the city.

The reverse of the head is all machine, looking something akin to a printing press.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642463nn4le"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.071701,51.503019]}},{"properties":{"name":"Heathrow (2 jets test positive for polonium)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64246200svm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.46005,51.47112]}},{"properties":{"name":"Highgate cemetary (Litvinenko buried here 7 Dec 2006)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642460nk45g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.14546,51.56611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Homage to Leonardo, Belgrave Square (1982)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Plazotta_Homage_to_Leonardo_Belgrave_Square.jpg\">Just to confuse matters, works exist of this name by both Paolozzi and Plazzotta.

We started to appreciate the proportions, the scale, the fact that this must have been a serious landmark when it was built in the early 1960s. We actually started thinking that this would not be a bad place to live. But maybe that’s because it towers over Elephant and Castle roundabout, and suddenly it all looks very beautiful in comparison.

As the name implies, this was once the Treasury, before it moved to even more impressive headquarters just down the road. Today, the building mostly houses the Cabinet Office. What we see is mostly Barry’s work, but the building also contains sections from an earlier structure by John Soane. Surviving fragments of Henry VIII’s Whitehall Palace can also be found within, including tennis courts, turrets and a fireplace.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245pvh918"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126665,51.503327]}},{"properties":{"name":"One Kemble Street, off Kingsway, (1964-68)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://www.urban75.org/photos/london/images/lon550.jpg\">Even to the most architecturally illiterate, One Kemble Street is clearly from the same stable as Centre Point. In fact, it looks like the earlier building has undergone vegetative propagation, and budded of a mini-me, plumper, shorter version of itself. The drum-like structure, perhaps appropriately, perhaps ironically, houses CABE (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment).

To try and rectify this we\\'ve been aiming to get out and about a bit more in order to see what\\'s inside some of the buildings that we dismiss as nothing more than good backdrops to bad photographs. We decided to aim high for our first group excursion and thanks to Nick, our political insider who finds himself in the thick of it most days, we set off with a special invitation to explore the Palace of Westminster.\n\nThis has turned out to be quite a long post, so in case you don’t stay with us until the end, here’s the take-home message: you must go visit! It’s easier than you might think to get inside. Indeed, it’s every UK citizen\\'s right to get at least as far as the Central Lobby. See the end of the post for more details.\n\nThe first thing that struck us as we wound our way through the security cordon was the lack of people. Every day we despair at the queue to the London Dungeon as we walk past, and yet here we were at the heart of British politics with nearly a thousand years of history on the other side of the security portacabins and we didn\\'t have a single exchange student to slap out of the way. There\\'s obviously room for improvement in getting the visitor numbers up, but we\\'ll get to that later. If the imposing chaps with machine guns are putting you off then we can reveal that they were quick to let us through despite the fact that we were all carrying excitable bulges in our pockets.\n\n\n    What\\'s this, sir?\n    Would you believe it\\'s a strange fruit?\n    Of course. We\\'re never surprised at the strange fruit that passes through here sir. Off you go.\n\nAnd before we knew it we were inside (Chinese pears and all), following in the footsteps of Royalty, politicians and reality television celebrities.\n\nContinue reading after the jump for an extended peek at what exactly the Houses of Parliament contain, and the best way to get yourself inside without having to run for office.\nParliament.jpg\n\nFirst, a little history. The Palace started as small abbey or minster to the west of London – hence the name WESTMINSTER. This church was subsequently enlarged and became Westminster Abbey. In 1099, William Rufus decided to build himself a new gaff, now known as the Palace of Westminster. Throughout the Middle Ages the Palace continued to be one of the principal homes of the monarch. However, whereas its palatial status has remained unchanged, its appearance has not. Numerous fires, notably in 1512 and 1834, have seen to that (we also seem to remember a flying saucer taking a chunk out of Big Ben).\n\nThe current building is the third Palace of Westminster. After the 1834 fire, a competition to design a replacement was won by Charles Barry (exterior), and Augustus Pugin (interior). Whilst Barry was the more well known at the time, it is Pugin\\'s name and designs that have since become more renowned.\n\nThe new palace cost £2 million, has 1500 rooms, 3 miles of corridor, 40 lifts, 100 stairways and over 3000 workers. The main building has four levels, split into three distinct and colour-coded sections: gold for royalty, red for Lords, and green for Commons (see our handy little map). Many of the surrounding buildings are also part of The Parliamentary Estate, most famously, Portcullis House. This building, to the North, is a complete contrast to the gothic style of the Palace, being a modern, light, airy building. Many MPs, including those of the Shadow Cabinet, have chosen to have their offices in Portcullis House, rather than the Palace itself.\n\nWhen Londonist came to visit, we were taken around the traditional line of route, shown numerically on the map:\n\nNorman Porch (1)\nWho he? Not a person, but a room. This grand portal welcomes the Queen when she arrives for the state opening of parliament. When originally built it was intended to house the busts of Norman monarchs, hence the name. However, the cash ran out, and the room now contains the busts of 16 former Prime Ministers who have sat in the House of Lords. Stained glass windows by Pugin depict a young Queen Vic and Edward the Confessor (now there’s a Royal scandal).\n\nThe Royal Robing Room (2)\nWidely viewed as the Palace’s most elegant room, this is where the Queen enrobes before state opening. A kind of extremely upmarket changing room. It was also used as the main sitting chamber of the House of Lords when the Commons moved into the normal Lords’ Chamber during the Blitz.\n\nThe Admission of St Tristram to the Fellowship of the Round Table dominates the room and indeed images of King Arthur and his Knights are everywhere. As are raucous school children, who seemed to accumulate in this room more than any other on our visit. Perhaps they were looking for the world’s first ever flushing toilet, designed by a certain Thomas Crapper, which is hidden behind a panel in the wall.\n\nAnd there’s another connection with children here. The room is also a monument to the families of the chief architects: Barry’s son designed the magnificent fireplace and Pugin’s son-in-law provided the stained glass.\n\nPaintings depict the true virtues of chivalry. Originally, there were meant to be seven although the artist died after he finished the 5th, so the other two areas are now filled with portraits of Queen Victoria (again!) and Prince Albert. The marquetry on the floor contains all of the different woods that are native to the UK.\n\nThe Royal Gallery (3)\nThis is the second largest room in the palace, beaten only by Westminster Hall, and is probably the largest sitting room that you will ever see!\n\nMargaret Thatcher once invited (then) President Reagan to address both Houses in Westminster Hall; a great and rare honour. However, the Commons rejected the invitation, as a gentle reminder to Maggie that this is a gift only the Commons can give, NOT the Prime Minister. Reagan spoke here, in the Royal Gallery, instead. (Rumour has it that he wasn\\'t too put out as he was just happy to be with Thatcher, his ‘best man in Engerland’ - an early sign of impending Alzheimer\\'s perhaps.)\n\nPortraits and statues of various kings and queens adorn the room. Charles I’s original death warrant is on display, along with, incongruously, some of Einstein’s letters.\n\nFrescos by Daniel Maclise on each side depict battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar. They took several years each to complete and nearly drove the artist mad. An example of the uniform of every regiment that fought in the battles can be seen. When Charles De Gaulle addressed both Houses, curtains were hung over the paintings, completely covering them, so as not to offend him. Legend has it that he later wondered at the size of the windows in the gallery and was even more perplexed that the curtains remained closed.\n\nPrince\\'s Chamber (4)\nThis exists for no reason other than as a legacy from the old Palace. It is decorated with portraits and reliefs of Tudor and Stuart monarchs, with a pronounced Tudor theme in the decoration. In fact the only non-Tudor item is a statue of a young Queen Victoria (she gets everywhere in this place) flanked by personifications of Justice and Mercy. When the statue was originally commissioned, Victoria was sat on the same level as Justice and Mercy. When she saw it, the queen decided that she was the greater, and so a plinth was commissioned, bringing her head higher than those of Justice and Mercy.\nlords.jpg\n\nHouse of Lords (5)\nThe House of Lords only has seats for 350 of the 700 peers. The throne is covered in gold leaf and is divided into three distinct parts: the Queen and Prince Phillip sit in the middle, flanked by Prince Charles and Princess Anne on either side. Minor Royals and Bishops may sit on the steps leading up to the throne. The Lords\\' area of the Palace of Westminster is both larger and more ornate than the Commons end, with red furnishings, much gold leaf and brass work. We found ourselves walking in a Pugin wonderland.\n\nHere, the queen reads out her annual speech at the opening of parliament. Despite her good breeding she\\'s not averse at having things put in her mouth and that speech is actually written by the Prime Minister. It sets out the ruling party’s policies for the next session of Parliament. The public gallery extends around the chamber. A low, red curtain borders the gallery. This was installed in the 1960s to protect the modesty of miniskirt-wearing ladies (forcing the Lords to take their brownies down to the tube to begin the still honoured tradition of the up-skirt-escalator shot).\n\nThe dangling microphones and loudspeakers in the backs of the chairs were installed in the 1960s, and are essential for elderly Lords to be able to hear proceedings, and indeed to speak loudly enough to be heard from one end of the chamber to the other. There\\'s a slight optical illusion at play here as they seem to shift in and out of sight and, rather than looking out of place, the Terry Gilliamesque technology actually adds to the bizarre tone of the place.\n\nThe Lord Chancellor sits on the ‘woolsack’ (literally a sack of wool, Britain\\'s largest export in the 19th Century, and a sign of its trading power - an upgrade would mean him sitting on the \\'Beckhamsack\\', not a reform that we back for obvious reasons of taste). He performs similar duties to those of the speaker in the House of Commons.\n\nGovernment peers sit on the right, opposition peers on the left. There are also benches in the middle, known as \\'crossbenches\\', where Lords with no party allegiance sit.\n\nThe Statues around the chamber represent the sixteen earls who forced the King to sign Magna Carta in 1215.\n\nThe Bar of the House is the furthest into the House of Lords that any non-peer can go. It is also the area into which MPs cram (all 646 of them) in order to hear the Queen’s speech. We passed beyond the bar and through the Lords’ Lobby (6), to reach the Central Lobby.\n\nThere is a straight line of sight between the Commons and the Lords. When all the doors are opened the Speaker in the Commons can see right through to the throne and the woolsack in the House of Lords. This is a design feature to show the idea of unity between the Monarchy, Lords and Commons, and to show that all three are of equal importance.\nlobby.jpg\n\nCentral Lobby (7)\nThis is the heart of the Palace, where everything comes together. It is every British citizen’s right to walk in off the street and demand to see their MP (if he or she isn\\'t sporting a leotard on Channel Four, that is). This is known as Lobbying, a phrase derived from the location in which you meet your MP, the central lobby. The space also contains a working post office, which is open to all members of the public (Londonist encourages you to go through security with the excuse \"I\\'m going to the post office to buy some stamps\" and see how far you get.)\n\nThe lobby is adorned with marble statues of famous statesmen of the 19th century, including Gladstone. The four patron saints of the United Kingdom are also displayed here in the form of four mosaics. The symmetry of the centre of the building (a very Pugin-esque idea) is about the point in the middle of this room. This is also where you’ll find Nick Robinson and other reporters during news broadcasts.\n\nMembers\\' Lobby (8)\nThe House of Commons Members\\' Lobby is where MPs congregate before a debate. It is adorned with statues and busts of great statesmen. Churchill and David Lloyd George are the most prominent, situated by the entrance to the House of Commons chamber. The bronze of Churchill\\'s foot has become very polished due to the custom of touching it before a debate for good luck. With the rise of the Liberal Democrats, the same has started to happen to Lloyd George’s foot. You can also see the pigeonholes used by the MPs for internal mail. Say what you like about George Galloway bringing politics into disrepute, but it was HIS name that had the schoolchildren excited as they ran their fingers across the names. Blair and Brown, in contrast failed, to raise a murmur.\n\nBusts of all the deceased Prime Ministers of the 20th Century can also be found in this room. If only we’d known during our recent stalk.\n\nDivision Lobby\nThere are two division lobbies in the House of Commons. The ‘No’ lobby on the right, and the ‘Aye’ or yes lobby on the left. All the furniture in the lobbies was donated by Commonwealth countries. The furniture in the No lobby, for example, comes from Uganda\n\nWhen a division in the House is called, MPs file into the lobbies according to how they want to vote. The division bell rings throughout the entire building and throughout many buildings in the Westminster vicinity, including popular pubs and bars frequented by MPs. They have 8 minutes to get to the lobby before the doors are locked. They then walk through the lobby, and between the clerk’s desks. A division normally takes around 15 minutes, but the record is 9 minutes (when England were playing in the World Cup). After the desks, MPs must bow their heads to the tellers to prove their identity. (It was common in the early 20th Century for MPs to send their assistants in disguise.)\ncommons.jpg\n\n\nHouse of Commons (9)\nA couple of us had actually been into the House of Commons before - sort of - although that House had had a couple of rows missing being only a mock-up built for television drama and part of the Manchester Granada Studios tour. There you got to sit in the seats and heckle the opposition tourists across the way before having your photo taken next to a fake Number Ten. Perfect for Northerners not wanting to give up cheap beer and gravy in return for a glimpse of the real thing. Faced now with the actual House of Commons, a sense of unreality again crept in as security guards kept a watchful eye on anyone tempted to take Blair\\'s seat or even touch the spot where the Iron Lady\\'s arse was not for turning.\n\nThe recently installed bullet-proof/bomb-proof/idiot-proof security screen above would have been invisible were it not for the jarringly out of place metal supports rammed into the roof. A necessary evil perhaps to protect our elected members from purple flour and worse, but also sad to see. Elsewhere in the Palace are other smaller and less intrusive signs of civil disobedience, but you need a keen eye to spot them. (Look out for the statue of the Second Earl of Falkland and take note that the tip of his sword is cracked. Back in the day, a suffragette handcuffed herself to that very spot only for an overzealous policeman to pull her and the tip of the blade free.)\n\nOur spirits were lifted somewhat when an unnamed insider told us that the books covering the desk that separates the government from the opposition concealed a hidden piece of graffiti. A phrase that would be better suited on a school desk than this huge imposing gift of Canadian wood, but which offers a window into the mentality of British politics: ‘Tony Blair is a cunt‘. As we left, still under the close eye of the security guards, it would be hard to imagine a member of the public getting away with such an act of vandalism and we couldn\\'t help but wonder which of Tony\\'s cabinet carried a penknife.\n\nThe Chamber is rather plain compared with that of the Lords. In large part, this is the fault of the Germans. Not a reference to the Windsors (no monarch has been allowed in this room since Charles I), but a rather good shot by the Luftwaffe over 60 years ago. The chamber was rebuilt after the war by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the man behind Battersea Power Station, the red phone box, the Tate modern, etc. etc. (We really must get round to stalking him one of these days.) A blackened, fire-damaged arch remains in the Members’ Lobby, as a reminder of that fateful evening during WWII.\n\nLooking towards House of Lords, the Opposition sit on the left and the Government benches are on the right. The Liberal Democrats and other parties are located on the opposition side on the section of benches nearest the House of Lords, and everybody else is behind them (including…sometimes…George Galloway, who sits in the corner, facing the wall, with a Dunce cap on).\n\nUp above the Speakers Chair is the press gallery. The press are not allowed to use modern technology, and so must rely on their pen, paper and shorthand skills. The Hansard recorders (Hansard is the \\'minutes\\' of the Commons, recording all happenings) also sit in there with their shorthand machines. As soon as the debates for that day have ended, the machines are taken away to the publishers. Overnight, the debates are collated and printed, to be on every MP’s desk the next morning. MPs have 24 hours to amend Hansard before it becomes a permanent record of events.\n\nThe cameras and the sound system were installed in the 1960s. It is now possible for the public to watch proceedings on digital television on the BBC Parliament channel, which is almost as popular as QVC.\n\nThe two red lines that run along the length of the chamber are called Sword Lines. When members still commonly carried swords there was a danger of a debate becoming over-heated and developing into a mass sword fight. To counter this threat, these two lines were installed. They are two swords lengths and a foot apart. Any MP who speaks must do so from behind these lines. This prevents an MP from lunging across the chamber to take his opposition out. Nowadays, MPs don’t carry swords, but sword racks still remain in the Members’ Cloakroom, now used mostly for umbrellas and perhaps spare walking sticks for the more infirm backbenchers.\n\nThe White Line that can be seen going across the throat of the chamber is the Bar of the House. Similar to the equivalent in the House of Lords, it is as far as any non-MP can go while the House is in session.\n\nThe Sergeant at Arms or one of his deputies sits in on all debates. The Sergeant is responsible for security matters within the House of Commons and makes sure that MPs abide by the strict rules of the House. He is the only person allowed to carry a sword, a sign of his disciplinary role, although it is only used for ceremonial purposes and perhaps opening the mail. The position and effectiveness of the Sergeant at Arms was recently questioned when the pro-foxhunt demonstrators, led by Brian Ferry\\'s son Otis, broke into the house. There is now room off-camera for an armed police officer to keep an eye on proceedings, so if you think your own Fathers4Justice style campaign could do with a shot in the arm think again unless you want to end up looking like a George Romero extra. That would liven things up on the Parliament channel though.\n\nSt Stephens Chapel (10)\nThis is no longer a chapel. It is now only a rather elaborate corridor forming the public entrance into Central Lobby. The Gold Studs in the floor are where the original speaker\\'s chair and clerks\\' table of the Commons were situated (in the first Palace). Stained glass windows show every constituency in Britain.\nHall.jpg\n\nWestminster Hall (11)\nWestminster Hall is the only original part of the building started in 1099 that survives today. When the monarch still lived in the Palace, Henry VIII used it as a tennis court, and was obviously as free and easy with his lobbing as he was with his wife swapping, as Tudor tennis balls have been found in the rafters ever since. The only PM ever to be assassinated (so far) was shot here - Spencer Percieval was killed on the steps with a musket in 1812. Quality name, Spencer.\n\nSeveral historic events have been held in here, from the trial and impeachment of the Earl of Strafford (Thomas Wentworth), to the trial of Charles I, Winston Churchill lying in state, and most recently the Queen Mother also lying in state (on a still evening the faint smell of gin and formaldehyde still hangs in the air).\n\nWestminster Hall also houses the Secondary Chamber, confusingly also called Westminster Hall, which runs in conjunction with the main chamber. This gives backbenchers a greater chance of getting their views on the record.\n\nThe Hall also acts as a place where visiting statesmen can give a speech to both houses and is thought to be much more prestigious than the Royal Robing Room. Most recently, Nelson Mandela addressed both Houses here.\nPortcullis House roof.jpg\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\nOur official tour over, we were treated to the sights, sounds and, yes, even the smells that your common-or-garden tourist doesn’t get to see. First of all came the fag area, sensibly kept outdoors for fear of a third devastating fire. A new glass canopy has been installed here at great expense and minimal expertise. Anyone over six foot is liable to crack their head on the low supports.\n\nThe canteen offered heavily subsidised meals with huge variety. We half-inched an embossed serviette or two as keepsakes. (There really was no end to our starry-eyed souvenir accumulation, by the way. During the rest of the day, we got our paws on parliamentary magazines, post-it notes and acknowledgement slips. We even withdrew cash from the Palace ATMs, just so we could make our bank statements look impressive for a change.)\n\nPerhaps the greatest privilege was a cheeky few minutes on the Thameside terrace. We weren’t supposed to be here, but the security were rather nice about it all, until we tried taking photos.\n\nAfter a brief visit to the office area, we took a magic tunnel over to Portcullis House, in all its greenhouse glory (pictured). The highlight here was the many paintings of modern parliamentarians in a riot of clashing styles. We particularly liked the triptych of Blair, Kennedy and Hague, each panel of which was painted to a width proportional to each leader’s number of seats.\n\nWe finished the day in a somewhat threadbare bar overlooking Parliament Square. It felt like an old out-of-favour country hotel bar, in need of redecoration.

Posh, mostly white carriers of the Y chromosome flock here to network at the numerous Gentlemen’s Clubs. Barry designed two of them: The Reform Club and the Travellers’.\n\nThe Reform is perhaps the most well-known gentleman’s club in the world, as a consequence of admitting one very famous, albeit fictional, member. It was in this building that Phileas Fogg made the notorious wager that he could master the globe in 80 days (presumably using budget airlines). Jules Verne’s adventure story has since been taken on by the likes of Michael Palin, Steve Coogan and a cartoon lion. The literary association continues today, and they even have their own blog. The club was founded by Whigs in 1838, as a gathering point for like-minded liberals who supported the Reform Act (legislation that greatly increased voting rights). Members have included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Winston Churchill and Menzies Campbell.\n\nNext door (on the left of the image) is the Traveller’s Club, also designed by Barry. This is the oldest of the Pall Mall clubs and was created as a meeting point for well-off men with well-thumbed passports. Members have included the Duke of Wellington, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, John Simpson and Charles Barry himself.\n\nBoth clubs are in a similar ‘Renaissance Palace’ style, much influenced by Barry’s travels through Italy. The Traveller’s was built in 1832, and was the first building of its type in Britain. Barry’s sequel of 1841, however, is the better of the two. Taller, wider, stronger, and faced with Portland Stone, the Reform renders the Traveller’s almost anonymous.\n\nUnfortunately, on our Stalk, the Reform was undergoing renovation, so rather than show you a mess of scaffolding, we’ve nicked the photo off of Wikipedia. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245vbvcv4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.133303,51.506652]}},{"properties":{"name":"Richmond, The Faces","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245ufg27v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.30341,51.46123]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rossmore Road - Barry Andrews","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424603ivyz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.16372,51.52522]}},{"properties":{"name":"Royal College of Surgeons (1835)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/Barry_Surgeons.jpg\">This impressive, ionic-order building to the South of Lincoln’s Inn Fields was designed by Barry as a new home for the recently chartered Royal Society of Surgeons (the Latin text running across the façade says the charter was granted in 1800). The college contains one of London’s little-known and recently refurbished attractions: the Hunterian Museum of anatomical curiosities. This wonderful collection was bequeathed by 18th Century anatomist John Hunter, whose statue can be found across the road in the park. Unfortunately, the building took a direct hit in 1941, and the only original parts are the portico and library.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424633h0mf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.116322,51.515259]}},{"properties":{"name":"Royal Garden Hotel (1965; reclad 1997) Kensington High Street and Ramada Jarvis Hotel, Bayswater Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://www.hotelvantage-london-hotels.com/london_hotels/images/hotel/jarvis_hyde_park_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://image.pegs.com/images/UI/07642/07642_b1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> LondonNeither of these buildings are iconic or of any merit, but weÃ¢ÂÂve included them because of their prominent locations.

The arrested motion captured in the group reminds us of former stalkee Enzo Plazzotta. The energy of the piece is incredible, especially give that Epstein was still honing it on the day he died, aged 79. (The bronze was posthumously cast.) A group of lanky-limbed individuals and their dog bound towards Hyde Park. The diabolic character chivvying them along is Greek God Pan, playing a tune on his eponymous pipes. It is, at first, hard to think of a more inappropriate setting, hidden away near a virtually disused access road.

Nineteen floors of Portland stone founded on granite: it’s a true tower of strength. Hitler thought so. Had he conquered England, this was to have been his headquarters. Its qualities of power have also spilled into fiction. This is the Ministry of Truth in Orwell’s 1984; Richard III’s power base in the Ian McKellen reworking; and the short-lived command-centre-cum-sanctuary in Wyndham’s Day of the Triffids. Holden also designed many of the surrounding buildings, though his complete scheme was never realised. Senate House itself was to have been the tallest building in London, but fell foul of financial restrictions.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642462arllm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12895,51.521141]}},{"properties":{"name":"Seven Sisters Road, Dan Reed Network","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245vwesmx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0933,51.57174]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shad Thames (Resurrection of the Daleks)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245w6jc4a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.074329,51.503667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shelly's Neal Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/shellys.jpg\">Photo from Art of the State<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245qgg80m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12447,51.51361]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sheraton Park Lane","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245qr2e79"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.14724,51.50492]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sheraton Park Tower Hotel (1968-73)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://www.milesfaster.co.uk/london-hotels/images-a/sheraton-parktower-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> The third generation inherits none of the charms of its predecessors.

This time, he pulled off something really special, with a 160-foot tower of complex geometry, topped by an unusual spire like a set of Tudor chimneys bound together. Unfortunately, like at Greenwich, the nave was gutted during WWII, though this has since been rebuilt. The grounds are worth exploring. Obelisks and memorials are spaciously distributed while all the tombstones seem to have migrated to the perimeter.

This most ancient of sites has been hallowed ground for at least 2000 years. Hawksmoor built his most unusual church on the site, following the demolition of a short-lived Wren design that had been cobbled together from the Great Fire remnant of the medieval church. Small and squat, but surprisingly capacious, the Baroque design looks something like a sabre-toothed frog from the rusticated front. Hawksmoor’s church almost suffered the same fate as the Wren predecessor in the early 1900s, when it was due to be dismantled to make way for Bank Tube station. Fortunately, after a public outcry, a compromise was reached whereby only the crypt was destroyed, necessitating the removal of hundreds of interred bodies. Think about that next time you’re passing through the station’s passages late at night.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424628yqf1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.088121,51.512745]}},{"properties":{"name":"St Pauls steps (The Invasion)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642463ol2kc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.099521,51.513657]}},{"properties":{"name":"St Pauls, Balls Pond Road","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/St_Pauls_Balls_Pond_Road.jpg\">Barry church in Islington<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245tdmfu1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.087842,51.546478]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sudbury Hill Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>sudbury<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245qmxlwn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.336456,51.557062]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sudbury Town Tube","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>sudbury<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424640rcqz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.315514,51.550818]}},{"properties":{"name":"Suicide on Downing Street, Tim Finn","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424651rczp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12776,51.5034]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sunny Goodge Street, Donovan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245xtp3ug"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13458,51.51983]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sunny South Kensington, Donovan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642464wzmrz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.17707,51.49496]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tardis at Earls Court","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642460o0xtk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.192674,51.491937]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tennants Row","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a>Home of the tenth Dr Who?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245ynp9f0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.348172,51.461574]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Artist as Hephaestus, 34-36 High Holborn (1987)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Holborn_Paolozzi_Artist_as_Hyohaestus.jpg\">Man, machine, mingled and meshed.

At 52 storeys and 183 m, this was Britain\\'s tallest building for a decade, before the arrival of the Docklands skyscrapers. Familiarity leads most of us to view this building as rather bland, though that\\'s not entirely fair. The tower is novel for several reasons, and is certainly of a more striking design than the majority of the City\\'s tall buildings. NatWest moved out following a terrorist attack in 1993, but its hallmarks are very much in evidence. View the tower from above, and the three overlapping hexagons are intentionally similar to the NatWest logo.\n\nWe may have uncovered another curious feature programmed into the building\\'s design. If you look at aerial views, the three lead faces of the hexagons point with near-perfect alignment towards London\\'s three great markets at Spitalfields, Old Billingsgate and Smithfield. Coincidence? Or symbolism that banking is at the heart of commerce?\n\nIf you want to ponder such things from the best of all perspectives, you can attempt to reserve a table at the very top.

This familiar slab in west London resembles a pre-stressed, compressed Nessie. Trellick is Goldfinger’s tallest London building, at 31 storeys (120 m including mast). The block contains 217 flats of mostly social housing, but with significant numbers of private residents. Some of these surprisingly spacious apartments will set you back over a third of a million pounds.\n\nLondonista Greg offers the following insight.\n\n    The elevator in the service-tower only stops every three floors, because of the way the flats are laid out. So in the service tower, in the spaces where the landings would be where the lift doesn\\'t stop, Goldfinger designed ‘hobby rooms’ — in his naive utopian imagination, this is where the men of Trellick would do woodworking, and the women would do cross-stitch together, as a community. Obviously, this was doomed to fail from the start, and in the ‘dark days’ of Trellick, when it was all crack dealers and rapists, the hobby rooms, which had no toilets or kitchens, became flats for squatters. Classy! Today the rooms are locked. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245q6fxxq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.205581,51.523598]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trent Park (Mawdryn Undead)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245qa9bsz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.134325,51.659566]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trinity Church, Cloudesley Square","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/Trinity_Church_Cloudesley_Square.jpg\">Clearly modeled on Kings College, Cambridge.

The garden is in a state of neglect, with filthy ponds and lichen-ridden flagstones.

This is Epstein’s Rima relief, named for one of Hudson’s characters. It’s hard to imagine how such an innocuous piece of work could cause any emotion, never mind anger, but Epstein had a knack for provoking such feelings.

Ballet was one of the artist’s favoured subjects, and this bronze sculpture is well placed, close to the opera house. The model is either lacing up her ballet shoes or carefully squeezing a spot. We suspect the former. Note in the background a fine row of old K-2 phone boxes, left there for the tourists.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6424610l10x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.12248,51.513644]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zimbabwe House, 429 Strand (1907-8)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"www.londonist.com\" href=\"www.londonist.com\">Londonist</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/Holden_Zimbabwe_House.jpg\">We’ve been here before. Long-time readers will remember the controversial sculptures by Jacob Epstein that adorn this building, most of which have had their features hacked away. Well, their story can be read here www.londonist.com/archives/2006/01/londonist_stalk_3.php. Today we’re concerned with the building. One of Holden’s (and Epstein’s) first big commissions, it’s a reasonably impressive set of offices on the Strand, originally built to house the British Medical Association. The typical Holden mixture of granite and Portland stone creates a building of character and mass, albeit one that most people on the bustling Strand will never notice.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64245s30tp0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.123985,51.509594]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/222451","metadata":null,"contact_name":"londonist","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:londonist","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/222451","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":281,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=222451,platial:user=londonist","published":"2010-03-02T17:00:00Z","id":26124}
