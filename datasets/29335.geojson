Though he didn’t make it to Korea himself, he stayed in the military, becoming an officer and a fighter pilot. In 1966, he went to Vietnam as part of a squadron of specially modified two-seat F-105 “Wild Weasel” aircraft that had the job of finding and destroying surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites. On April 19, 1967, Colonel, then Major, Thorsness and his electronic warfare officer, Captain Harold E. Johnson, were on a missile suppression mission over North Vietnam. He and his wingman attacked and silenced a surface-to-air missile site with air-to-ground missiles and then destroyed a second site with bombs. In the attack on the second missile site, Colonel Thorsness’ wingman was shot down by intensive antiaircraft fire and the two crewmembers abandoned their aircraft. Colonel Thorsness circled the descending parachutes to keep the crewmembers in sight and relay their position to the Search and Rescue Center. During this maneuver, a MIG-17 was sighted in the area. Thorsness immediately initiated an attack and destroyed the MIG.\n\nBecause his aircraft was low on fuel, Colonel Thorsness was forced to depart the area in search of a tanker. Upon being advised that two helicopters were orbiting over the downed crew’s position and that there were hostile MIGs in the area posing a serious threat to the helicopters, despite his low fuel condition, Colonel Thorsness decided to return through a hostile environment of surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft defenses to the downed crew’s position. As he approached the area, he spotted four MIG-17 aircraft and immediately initiated an attack, damaging one and driving the others away from the rescue scene.\n\nWhen it became apparent that an aircraft in the area was critically low on fuel and the crew would have to abandon the aircraft unless they could reach a tanker, Thorsness, although critically short on fuel himself, helped avert further possible loss of life and a friendly aircraft by recovering at a forward operating base, thus allowing the aircraft in emergency fuel condition to refuel safely. Just as Thorsness landed, his fuel ran out and the engine shut down.\n\nTwo weeks later, he was shot down over North Vietnam on his ninety-third mission. He bailed out and was captured and wound up as a prisoner of war for a period of six years during which time he suffered torture on a regular basis. He was released in March, 1973 and was presented with his Medal of Honor on October 15, 1973. Ten days later, no longer able to fly fighters due to injuries sustained in captivity, he retired from the Air Force.\n\nDuring his career, Colonel Thorsness earned the Medal of Honor, the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross with five Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Purple Heart with one Oak Leaf Cluster. He currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.

However, it was not until after he left the service that the flicker of interest that was kindled there became his consuming fire. \nOrlando began serious study in Chinese kenpo-karate in October, 1968.  Shortly thereafter he switched to kung fu, studying under Al Dacascos (then teaching in Denver, Colorado).  His training with Dacascos lasted three years until a back operation made it impossible to continue in Dacascos\\' high-kicking style of kung fu.  It was back to Chinese kenpo.  There Bob received his first-degree black belt from Dr. John P. Cochran.  Although Bob has subsequently earned additional rank, he prefers to say that he is a student of the arts and leave it at that .Ever a student of the arts, Bob\\'s quest for knowledge has taken him into aikido, Small-Circle Jujitsu, grappling, iaido, arnis de mano, and eskrima.  However, what has impacted him the most are the years he has spent studying Chinese kuntao and Dutch-Indonesian pukulan pentjak silat under Dutch-Indonesian master Willem de Thouars.  After a decade of training with de Thouars, Bob received his teaching certificate from him in 1994. \nA graduate of a Jesuit university, Bob is the author of Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals: The Brutal Arts of the Archipelago and Martial Arts America: A Western Approach to Eastern Arts.  He has also produced three videos:  A nearly two hour production, Fighting Arts of Indonesia: Combat Secrets of Silat and Kuntao (a companion to his first book); a two-tape video production titled, Reflex Action: From Training Drills to Fighting Skills;  and a four volume DVD series, Fighting Footwork of Kuntao and Silat.

He was told by industry \"experts\" not to bother with the original Benji film; that it wouldn\\'t work. He proved the experts wrong and now he\\'s at it again with his new best selling book The Soul of a Horse being published by the Crown/Harmony imprint of Random House on April 29, 2008. A book that will likely set traditional thinking about horses on its ear.\n\nJoe Camp showed us the heart and soul of a dog when he created Benji. Now, in this engaging, emotional, and often humorous story, he deftly lures us into the heart and soul of a horse, unlocking the mystery of a majestic creature who has survived on earth, without assistance, for fifty-five million years.\n\nMonty Roberts, author of the New York Times Bestseller The Man Who Listens to Horses , and world renowned clinician, said, \"Imagine how inadequate it makes me feel to realize how recently Joe came into horses. The man is a natural when it comes to understanding how animals tick and a genius at telling us their story. The Soul of a Horse is a must read for those who love animals of any species.\"\n\nCamp has written, produced and directed seven theatrical motion pictures (including all of the Benji movies) cumulatively grossing well over the equivalent of 00 million in today\\'s dollars, making him one of the most successful independent filmmakers of all time.\n\nJoe has also written three novels from his own screenplays, the inspirational non-fiction book Benji &amp; Me , and several children\\'s books.\n\nCamp ignored industry \"experts\" who said the original Benji movie would never work. He raised the money from private sources to produce the film, but when completed the movie was turned down by every major film distributor in Hollywood. Camp and his partner Ed Vanston had to form their own distribution company and release the picture themselves worldwide from their offices in Dallas, with Camp personally developing the marketing strategy, writing advertising copy and press releases, and supervising each and every booking. In spite of the many obstacles, Variety reported the picture was the #3 grossing movie of the year.\n\nIn advance of release of the 2004 film Benji Off the Leash , Camp and his floppy-eared star traveled the nation for months, appearing on television, radio, in newspapers and magazines, promoting the film while passionately making a case for Hollywood to \"clean up\" their family films, and extolling the values of adopting pets from shelters. \"This time around,\" Camp says, \"it\\'s all about proving that you can put food on the table and, at the same time, make a positive difference in peoples\\' lives. It\\'s about living life with purpose, on purpose.\"\n\nWhen Camp struck out across the country in the Fall of 2001 to find the new Benji in an animal shelter, media flocked to follow him around. The American Humane Association had reported that the original Benji\\'s rescue from a shelter had caused more than one million adoptions. Camp wanted to recreate that model. Local and network television, radio and newspapers covered the search, with the ultimate selection being a feature on ABC\\'s Primetime Thursday . The search and Benji\\'s new movie generated more than one billion media exposures for the efforts of shelters and rescue groups all across the nation.\n\nIn addition to his books and movies, Camp has also written, directed and produced four network television specials and a network series.\n\nOne of Joe\\'s favorite pastimes is working with the Piney Woods School in Mississippi. This historically black boarding school educates mostly high-risk kids from families below the poverty level, yet usually sends 100% of its graduates to college, many to some of the best colleges and universities in the country. \"Of all we\\'ve done,\" says Camp, \"we\\'re most proud of the things we\\'ve accomplished for these kids. And the rewards are the greatest.\"\n\nEven with all the accomplishments and media exposure, Camp is still in awe of his own success. \"Inside, I\\'m still a kid sitting in a dark theater in Little Rock, Arkansas, watching Disney\\'s \\'Song of the South\\' with happy tears rolling down my cheeks,\" he says, \"or reading books like the Black Stallion. To be able to bring that magical happiness to others is very special.\"\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ekpbbxtu07"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.012886,33.205222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mr. John Giduck","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/02/2/John_Beslan_photo%5B1%5D_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Golden, CO, USA  80402John Giduck has a Bachelor’s Degree from Penn State and a law degree from the University of Denver.

While at Notre Dame I founded the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism in 1975 and was the director of the Center until 1993. To learn more about me and what I have done over the years, you can consult my vita.\n\nAs a member of the Department of History, I taught both undergraduate and graduate students. Though I taught courses in a variety of areas, my field of specialty was American Catholic history. I have published a number of books in this field. My most recent book was In Search of an American Catholicism: A History of Religion and Culture in Tension, published by Oxford University Press in 2002. It is an interpretive study of the relationship between Catholicism and American culture over the course of the past two hundred years. I have also written a general history entitled The American Catholic Experience: A History from Colonial Times to the Present. Published in 1985 it is regarded as the standard history of American Catholicism. Originally published by Doubleday, it is presently available in paperback from the University of Notre Dame Press. Both of these books as well as others can also be purchased through Amazon.com.\n\nI am currently a professor emeritus. Though no longer teaching I am still writing. My most recent publication was an essay on Catholicism in the Midwest, entitled “A Different Breed of Catholics.” It was published in a volume on Religion and Public Life in the Midwest, (eds.) Philip Barlow and Mark Silk. At Notre Dame I taught a course on the Irish American experience for more than fifteen years. Using this as a basis I am writing a history of Irish America. This should be completed in 2007 and will appear in print with Bloomsbury Press sometime in 2008 or 2009. Be sure to check it out, it promises to be the definitive history of the Irish Americans. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ekpb68ysyc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.239586,41.701884]}},{"properties":{"name":"Patrick Tracey","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/3/patricktracey.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Boston, MA USAPatrick Tracey, author of Stalking Irish Madness: Searching for the Roots of My Family\\'s Schizophrenia published by Bantam.\n\nPatrick Tracey, a former contributing writer for the Washington City Paper and Regardie’s in Washington, D.C., has also written for Ms. magazine and the Washington Post.
