If that phrase has a flippant air then it is unintended and unwelcome, I just don't know how else to put it. Likewise what do say to your best friend, your constant travelling partner of the past 6 months, when they call to tell you they are being deported? Do you say \"It'll be alright.\", 'cause it won't, certainly not now, maybe not ever. What words soften the blow of accusing eyes delivering a fast-track conviction, how do you comfort a person become a...criminal in the blink of an eye? You only need have an immigration official cast an eye over your passport to know they are not from an organisation to be crossed, be you on the border of Australia or Zambia. A sullen, unflinching seriousness must either be rigorously instilled in them or else the recruitment process heavily selects against individuals displaying more than a ounce of levity. Withering stares are their weapon, suspicion their sixth sense. I can't imagine the feelings that must course through a person pulled aside at customs, knowing that they had something to hide. How difficult it must be to conceal your body's reaction to the stress, sweat pin-pricking the brow and palms, the face flushing red or draining white, words tripping over each other and tumbling from your mouth like passengers from a sinking ship. The ache in your stomach as fear closes its grip around you. Maybe a small voice inside desperately clutches at ration, meekly insisting that this is all an inconvenience of routine, an unlucky hitch to be politely passed. Perhaps the immigration officials say the same, reassuring you of the weary banality of their task, the box-ticking formalities before you are on your way. Do they mean it as a slight kindness or a cruel trompe l'œil? They probably take you to some anonymous room few travelers will lay nervous eyes upon, magnolia'd to nothingness, the walls dripping with portent. There would be questions I imagine, innocent and probing, scripted to subtly unwrap your story and peel back your deception. To see through the hand close to your face. You are all in, your current life the wager, the stakes never higher. And then it is over, now there is merely the admin of tearing you from dreams and happiness, an heartrending reset. And...and...nothing, enough, this disrespectful conjecture has gone on longer than I intended. I can no better put myself in this position than I can that of a man in the dock shuddering at the crack of a judge's gavel. But since that dark day I've felt a kind of ethereal detachment or impotence that I've failed to allay or, perhaps worse, adequately express. And for that I am sorry. Hoping things will work out for the best without actually doing anything to influence their course is building a house on the shifting sands of serendipity. And for that I am sorry. That you aren't in the only place in the world that you want to be. For that I am truly sorry. I miss you man.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5954255553045539820","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/5954255553045539820/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5954255553045539820","updated":{"end_time":"2013/01/11 06:29:33 -0500","original":"2013-01-11T22:29:32.682+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2013/01/11 06:29:32 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[114.9122038,-34.0590292],[115.2349268,-34.0590292],[115.2349268,-33.8483232],[114.9122038,-33.8483232],[114.9122038,-34.0590292]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/07/river-of-golden-dreams.html","title":"River of golden dreams","published":{"end_time":"2012/07/25 00:00:00 -0400","original":"2012-07-24T14:00:00.000+10:00","granularity":"day","time":"2012/07/24 00:00:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/07/river-of-golden-dreams.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wy72tj5","description":"Day 237 - Margaret RiverThe train cut through an orange land so sparse that not even clouds bloomed in its yawning blue sky. It passed stations so small that the platforms could hold 3 or 4 people at most. I saw dwellings here and there, each a battle against nature won though the ongoing war still inevitably lost. From the eastern hubbub to this western desolation I wondered, as I would many times over the coming months, how on earth I ended up here. I carried a knot in my stomach, whether from fear or food deprivation I couldn't be sure. This was new, this was different. Barring a few days in Brazil I had never so boldly struck out on my own. Leaving behind a pleasant Sydney existence, friends, a well paid job, the comfort of familiarity, to start again on the other side, to create a life over again. Yeah it was probably fear. I changed from train to bus at the end of the line and the landscape softened as we continued south. Wetter and greener, life returned in the form of new and exotic birds and the yin-yang of friesian cows. But I was not here for the fauna, rather it was the region's flora that had pulled me 2500 miles across the continent. The first vineyards I spotted were at a place called Wilybrup, the vines as bare of foliage as the rows were of workers, not a great sign of impending employment. The bus deposited me, appropriately enough, at a bus stop in the centre of Margaret River. I was struck by a wave of uncertainty over what I would do next. Were would I live? Were would I work? Who would I drink with down the pub? Nobody could answer these questions but me, I was going to have to take full responsibility for my own life for once. I gathered my luggage, I gathered myself and set off for a hostel whose name I had noted down in a sole concession to planning. The Margaret River Lodge YHA would be my home for the next 3 months but as I strode down its driveway I could have no idea of the bacchanalian chaos that lay ahead. All was quiet for now though so I dropped my pack on my bunk and decided to swing by the various agencies in the town that organised vineyard work. \"Have you got any experience?\", \"No\". \"Have you got a car?\", \"No\". The look that resulted from my regrettably honest answers to these two standard questions did not fill me with confidence with regard to my employability and, by extension, my second year visa. But the agencies took my name and number and sent me on my way damned with faint encouragement. After covering them all I retired to the pub in the knowledge I could do little more to secure appropriate work. As if to amplify my home-from-homesickness the song 'Mr. Brightside' played as I drank my extortionate pint. Were people looking at me as I mouthed the words? Was the lump in my throat as visibly big as it felt? It wasn't the first TBS (take me back to Sydney) moment I would have here, it wasn't the last.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5382396104415756553","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/5382396104415756553/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5382396104415756553","updated":{"end_time":"2012/12/23 04:21:45 -0500","original":"2012-12-23T20:21:44.814+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/12/23 04:21:44 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[115.07003528941,-33.9532402018377],[115.07507828941,-33.9532402018377],[115.07507828941,-33.9499472018377],[115.07003528941,-33.9499472018377],[115.07003528941,-33.9532402018377]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/06/low-winter-sun.html","title":"Low winter sun","published":{"end_time":"2012/06/18 06:21:00 -0400","original":"2012-06-18T20:20:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/06/18 06:20:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/06/low-winter-sun.html#comment-form","id":"abf03ws9n03j","description":"Day 201 - SydneyA solitude wraps me as I walk, the ferries blow their funereal horns as if through some foggy dock on the eve of war. I turn up the collar on my favourite (only) winter coat and press on over the swing bridge and past destroyer, submarine and  magnificent 3-masted sail ship. Wooden boards give a resonant thud as my smart-shod feet strike them and ibis stalk the grassy swath to my left. The sun traces its shallow arc in the sky as I arrive at the office and day two hundred and one stirs to life. The transience had paused and routine replaced it. Faces and places became familiar and relationships lasted past a day or two of crossed paths. Heck, such was the order of my life I had even taken to eating muesli for breakfast (with soy milk, natch). My job was going well, I worked with Kim and Lorraine auditing the company's Australian contractors and daily impressed my colleagues with technical wizardry and savoir faire. On the home front myself and Michael had moved into a hostel for the general well-being of all involved in our previous accommodation and we passed the evenings eating kangaroo and watching the dirge that Australian terrestrial TV stations deem suitable for broadcast. CBH continued to lubricate our social interactions and despite numerous ejections never held a grudge. The weather was improving such that a dip in the sea became a pleasurable pastime rather than a masochistic trial. In short life was pretty good. I have, in the past, wondered at the draw of Australia. Having seen several friends visit never to return to the motherland I was curious to understand the country's enrapturing power. It didn't take long before I was experiencing such emotions of my own, I felt the pull. My imagination was swiftly crafting a life here, so far from everything I had known for the last 30 years. And that, I think, is what it was for me. 30 years living in the same country, the same continent, the same hemisphere suddenly seemed like a long time, too long. Here was a brave new world abundant with possibilities that maybe I wouldn't have seen ensconced in my English groove, ever ploughing in the same direction. I felt like I had straightened my shuffling hunch, had lifted my eyes from the road. I found I liked Australia not for what it was but for what it wasn't. My mind raced ahead - I could extend my visa for a further year provided I undertook 3 months of 'specified' work. What this amounts to is going to Australia's more rural regions and doing jobs the natives don't want to do, I would have to work on my Polish accent. The black fly in the chardonnay was the fact that second visas are only granted to people under the age of 31. Some quick calculations gave the following result - Months of regional work required = 3Months until I turned 31 = 3¼ Time was, to put it mildly, tight. This would be a high stakes gamble as I would need to leave my job at Accenture, book a flight to the boondocks and pray I could pick up work immediately. More than a week spent without specified employment and there would be no second visa for me not to mention the cost of the plane tickets to bear. My attempts to secure a job before I left Sydney were coming to naught so on the advice of a drunken man in a pub I would soon be travelling to the other side of this vast country and the vineyards of Margaret River.

We were now regulars at the Coogee Bay Hotel (henceforth CBH), a bar known (to locals at least) as 'the animal pen'. We had taken in the famed Bondi Beach. I had swum on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. I had a job. Once more I had plunged into the masked ball of interviews where every interviewer pretends that they are offering the world's greatest job and every interviewee maintains the fantasy and professes to have dreamed of one day having such a position. I could now add 'Senior Administrator' to my garlanded résumé. The company? Accenture Plc., a multinational management consultancy firm with 250,000 employees worldwide. Well to be accurate 250,001. Not bad in less than a week. with a view from my desk of Sydney CBD 'fallen on my feet' would be an apt phrase to use. Before I started though myself and Mike found the time to catch up with our Irish partners in (petty) crime from Bolivia and Chile. Little had we expected to meet Dee and Darren again so soon when we bid them farewell at the bus station in Santiago and what a pleasure it was to see familiar faces. Another old face (30 to be precise) was Jon, a friend of mine from back home. A full ten years had passed since we went our separate ways after college. He had settled into life on the other side of the planet with a girlfriend, baby on the way and the hint of an Australian accent to complete the look. Me and Mike attended his 30th birthday party in the King's Cross area of Sydney. There is also an area called Paddington though I failed to find Fenchurch or Marylebone (yeah, yeah Paddington isn't on the Monopoly board, creative license innit). I also temporarily suspended my contempt for rugby league as a silly, bastardised form of the game in order to watch State of Origin, an annual competition between New South Wales and Queensland. The three match series resulted in a heartbreaking last game loss for NSW but myself, Mike, the girls and their posse of Irish friends drowned our 'sorrows' at CBH regardless. We had (we thought) ensconced ourselves back into normal life rather well. Australian bank account, phone number, a necktie or two and a local - all the trappings of civilised existence were obtained and all my earnings squandered at the aforementioned public house.

And cold. Everybody likes surprises don't they? Unexpectedly finding two men in your flat when you return from work qualifies as a surprise right? The alarmed screams seemed to indicate so. Scaring Amy and Jayne has proved to be one of life's simple pleasures but traveling nearly 5000 miles to do it could be deemed excessive. Myself and Michael would have to find something else to do in the land of Oz. That something else was the perpetuation of travel by way of the accumulation of capital. Gainful employment in short. Like a bombshell we had exploded back into the girl's ordered existence and with the shrapnel flung wide we settled into catching up over a couple of boxes of goon. Bangkok's sweltering temperatures and dollar beers lay far behind us though we were as culturally, economically and meteorologically as close to home as we had been so far been on this trip. And yet despite the cold (have I mentioned that it's cold?), the cost and the (temporary) abandonment of a life of perpetual leisure there was a strange thrill in me. A thrill of a new life to be created and all the possibilities that lay therein. Do we ever give up on reinvention of ourselves? Or if not reinvention then refinement, the smoothing of rough edges, the banishment of undesirable traits? Do we all hold dear the promise that a better us lies inside and if only the conditions were just right that person could be realised? People rarely change fundamentally so why do we strive for an unreachable goal? But we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past (Fitzgerald, 1925). It seems driven by a difficulty in accepting ourselves as we are, as we ever were, as we ever will be. Travel is the perfect foil to this frustrated vision. Another place, another person. Throw off your rusted shackles, climb from the indenture of your rut, feel the warm sunlight of possibility upon your face. We all seek our own particular brand of reinvention. Mine is best described as wanting to look into a mirror and see myself and not a vampiric transparency. But the only mirrors I look into are those in friend's and foreigner's faces and the reflections define the person I see. It is a self-worth dependent on others, it is an unhealthy stare. It is rabid insecurity alleviated by adulation. I once suggested that praise fell on me as lightly as snowflakes but I was wrong. It nourishes a ravenous beast, a dead-eyed monster with poisonous fangs. I don't know if that is a harsh assessment composed of words better suited to hyperbole than honest analysis. I don't know if this is catharsis or needy evisceration. I don't know if it is harder to forgive oneself or others for character flaws and failings. I often find myself trapped in the foolish notion that every feeling ostensibly manifested must be the opposite inside, that every weakness we perceive in other peeple must be present tenfold within ourselves. We care so inextricably deeply about what other people think of us but to successfully reinvent yourself it is only necessary to change the opinion of one person. And that person is you.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2596710736755947852","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2596710736755947852/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2596710736755947852","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:34:15 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:34:14.125+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:34:14 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[151.2355055,-33.9338213],[151.2749875,-33.9338213],[151.2749875,-33.9074683],[151.2355055,-33.9074683],[151.2355055,-33.9338213]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/sparks.html","title":"Sparks","published":{"end_time":"2012/05/10 16:48:00 -0400","original":"2012-05-11T06:47:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/05/10 16:47:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/sparks.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wyr7xik","description":"Year - 0We all, no matter the person, find ourselves at a point. The moment I started writing this - a point. The moment I finish - a point. The moment you start reading this - a point. The moment you finish - you get the idea. And a myriad of events but moreso decisions lead us to these variad points. Our decisions but, again, moreso other people's decisions brought us to this crossroads. A crossroads unlike any we've seen before and, with apologies for being obtuse, unlike any we'll see again. And this laboured point springs to my mind as I walk outside everyday, as I walk out onto the streets of Bangkok and look across to the Khao San Road. It forces me to question my own imagination, I read 'The Beach', I dreamed of the viscerality of this place, I dreamed of the real world no matter how fake it actually was. In a previous life I dreamed of another thing, a world that lay beyond my own that I promised myself I would see, that I would drown in, in the utter bliss of something else. And so I suppose that explains the mild lance of electricity that passes through me everyday as I walk barefoot into the chaotic vivance that greets me. How the tamest inclination shapes our weaving path, malleable beings are we not?  If I have learned anything, it is one thing. There is no freedom in location. Our prisons follow in persistent troop behind us. We can choose to look only forwards and that may work but more likely a fool's paradise is sought, a white beach with blue seas and coconut heaved palms absent of any ill but, more pertinently, absent of ourselves. For we are a troubled generation, corrupted by ease and blighted by want. There exists a wonderfully pertinent line that has America being the only country that went from barbarity to decadence without civilisation in between. What a microcosm this generation is. And so we spread across the globe in search of something the homeland couldn't provide, of a future our parents granted us but for innumerate reasons chose not themselves. But nonetheless I have outdone myself, I think a little of my delight in standing each day in Bangkok's stifling heat is the realisation that somehow through poor velocity and great fortune I am in the place that I desired to be. Damn my incapacity to roll around on the floor kicking my heels and whoop! Though we must return to freedom. What freedom I have now, a terrifying freedom, a license to ill, an absence of reason not to make myself happy. Who else can we blame now? If I may speak for the general population I'd say the blanket of discontent is a reasonably warm and comfortable one. It is a patchwork of obligation and imperative.  How does this lost generation find itself? In the anarchy of Khao San or in the peace of a Buddhist temple? I fear we know too much and know too little. We have the world at our feet and we trample it in selfish search for fulfillment. The noblest of aims drives our parents to give us this gift and yet it is simplest of evolution's gifts that we have it. We all play this zero sum game, the environment varies but the rules endure. You can't help but laugh at life's unblinking stare.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7258333008014782287","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/7258333008014782287/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7258333008014782287","updated":{"end_time":"2012/05/11 06:15:50 -0400","original":"2012-05-11T20:15:49.788+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/05/11 06:15:49 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[100.492694510193,13.7574870103442],[100.497629510193,13.7574870103442],[100.497629510193,13.7613430103442],[100.492694510193,13.7613430103442],[100.492694510193,13.7574870103442]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/09/never-mind-bollocks.html","title":"Never mind the bollocks","published":{"end_time":"2012/05/02 22:53:00 -0400","original":"2012-05-03T12:52:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/05/02 22:52:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/09/never-mind-bollocks.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wrp9vjd","description":"Day 155 - BangkokIf there is 1 place synonymous or perhaps infamous with the backpacker circuit then surely this is it. If there is 1 place whose reality so precisely matched my expectation of it, whose sights, sounds and smells mirrored those of an imagination  fed by popular media then surely it was here. I woke after the first proper sleep in days and walked out onto the balcony of the Romruen Resort. Beyond the sliding glass door was a wall of heat, thick air enveloped me and mocked sweat glands sprung desperately into action. We had arrived in the world's hottest city or its outskirts at least. Eschewing originality the bags were repacked and the two of us headed for the traveller's rite of passage that is the Khao San Road. It isn't Thailand, it isn't really Bangkok, it is something else. A road constructed from dreams of escape and the unquenchable thirst for the exotic. You could write it off as a parody of travel, a hollow shell of culture that ceased long ago to represent anything other than the human desire for hedonism. But hate this place and you must hate your own hypocrisy because you created it, you, me and our kind. Personally I was torn. Sipping a Chang outside one of the road's numerous bars my eyes roved for vomiting revellers to disdain while I hoped for a divine wind to lift me above the plastic chairs and the predictable. But I also savoured the unbridled, unabashed vigour of the place. From the tattoo parlours (was 30 a little late to be getting inked? I decided not) and bootleg DVD stalls to the on-street massages and fried insects it is a rough symphony of experiences.Tania hooked us up with a friend of hers called Prim who took us to what was reputedly the best place for Pad Thai in the city of 50,000 places to eat. After months in South America's culinary monoculture spices and fire filled my mouth and dormant areas of my tongue awakened. Perhaps though the novelty was over-exploited a few days later when I loaded a dish so heavily with chilli that it scalded my tongue. The Taling Chan Floating Market was another haven of fine cuisine. Fish pulled fresh from the water were grilled by wizened women on small boats moored to the bobbing pontoon on which we ate at tables so low Borrowers would stoop to them. A motorised launch took us around the back canals among wooden houses teetering on the edge and past local children frolicking in the murky waters. Huge shoals of catfish tussled over the pieces of bread thrown from our boat, the scene was a writhing silver mass of contorted scale.The dawning reality of diminishing funds had made it clear that our plans for a grand tour of South America and South East Asia were unrealistic. At least consecutively unrealistic. The galling spectre of work was rearing its ugly head. The two of us would have to sweat and strive for money, not something we had had to do for yea....months. Discovering the average wage in Thailand to be around $6 a day it didn't seem the likeliest of countries in which to fill the travel coffers. Neither myself nor Michael, despite having checked, found ourselves qualified English teachers either (the Thais are getting awfully bureaucratic these days) so that avenue of employment was uncompromising also. We had no choice but to go to a distant outpost of the Western world. A country, nay, continent that lay essentially unclaimed by colonising Europe well into the 18th century. It hadn't featured prominently on any 'must-see' lists of mine but travel is an unruly beast and try to control it as you may it never ceases to surprise. So we were off to see the wizard in the land to the south, to seek our fortune and renew old acquaintances. Speaking of which we'd met by this time a couple of expats from way back. Ali and Jo had been living and working in Bangkok for some years and furnished us with friendly company, extensive recommendations and, kindest of all, accommodation for our final few days there. A great night out in the Patpong area (the 2nd syllable of that name will give you a clue as to its fame) granted a slightly scary glimpse at what this city has to offer, but only a glimpse. I eagerly await the day I can return here but for now we go south.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4359062064925787563","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/4359062064925787563/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4359062064925787563","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:35:07 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:35:06.387+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:35:06 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[100.490569832947,13.7558716386547],[100.500440832947,13.7558716386547],[100.500440832947,13.7635836386547],[100.490569832947,13.7635836386547],[100.490569832947,13.7558716386547]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-best-bits-of-americas.html","title":"The best bits of the Americas","published":{"end_time":"2012/05/01 22:44:00 -0400","original":"2012-05-02T12:43:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/05/01 22:43:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-best-bits-of-americas.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wzv0vir","description":"In no particular order other than chronologically. <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com.au/2011/12/dont-step-on-cracks.html#bestbit\">McSorley's Irish Bar</a></b><i>“...36 beers stagger us but not as much as the $90 bill...”</i>Our first night on our first day in our first country of many to come found us in this Irish bar whose history dates back well over a hundred years. Presidents, poets and paupers drank here and now so had we two peripatetic Englishmen. Conversation was struck up with locals on the timeless and ever novel subject of differing nationalities and backgrounds, a scene to be repeated again and again on this trip. We staggered home happy, drunk and with empty wallets, a scene to be repeated again and again on this trip. <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com.au/2011/12/swimming-with-sharks.html#bestbit\">Snorkeling in Belize</a></b><i>“...I felt as if part of the ocean.”</i>I must confess to an apprehension of the water borne of watching a particular film as a child, I believe the medical condition is known as 'Spielbergian scarring'. I didn't realise though that Mike's watery inhibitions put mine to shame. But he did it and he loved it and little did he know that it was to be the tip of the (defrosted) iceberg.  <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/surface-tension.html\">Scuba in Utila</a></b><i>“The best left turn I ever made.”</i>Though I hesitate to rank these experiences, if someone put a gun to my head (which surprisingly hasn't happened on this trip yet) I would say Utila is primus inter pares. The bubble of our brief existence there reflected in the bubbles floating up from our breathing apparatus. The joy of the unexpected, the unplanned, suffused the two weeks and we took away great friendships, description-defying sights and fond memories of the time we became divers. <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/rapid-improvement-required.html\">White water rafting</a></b><i>“The raft bounced, yawed, pitched and....flipped.”</i>I generally make a basic, and flawed, assumption of instant aptitude at any activity (sporting or otherwise) that I am about to try for the first time. I also exhibit a reliable irritation when it turns out I am no good at said activity. On the downside I was no good at white water testing. On the upside I was so bad it didn't leave a spare second to indulge in annoyance, I was too busy trying not to drown. <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/day-46-isla-omotepethe-island-is-formed.html\">Quad biking in Nicaragua</a></b><i>“...roads whose condition could only only have been worsened by the addition of landmines.”</i>It's not that I <i>can't</i> drive, it's simply that no country in the world legally recognises my ability to do so. Thankfully quad bikes come with no such restrictive licensing conditions putting one at liberty to climb on with minimal instruction and be endangering pedestrian lives within minutes. If only it were so easy with cars...  <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/28-buses-later.html#bestbit\">Horse riding in Colombia</a></b><i>“We were disappointed not to be supplied with Stetsons...”</i>Sweeping vistas at a canter and a bit of Inca shit thrown in for good measure, this was a delightful morning spent in the hills of western Colombia. If there is any theme about the best bits I have listed so far it's that most of them could, fortune being cruel, have resulted in serious injury or death. I'd have to say though that any part of this trip that didn't result in serious injury or death was a best bit for me!  <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/rising-damp.html\">The Journey to Macchu Picchu</a></b><i>“...it was scenery you could not tear your eyes away from.”</i>Alright it didn't have the physical endeavor of the Inca Trail but the bus journey over the Andes providing awe-inspiring scenery and a reverence for Mother Nature in her rugged glory.  <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/dark-heart.html\">Jungle trekking</a></b><i>“...an inner bellow to the jungle at the sheer bloody masculinity of it all.”</i>It was hard but it was real...ish. Alright we would have probably died if Pedro wasn't with us but we did our own walking, caught our own fish and sweated our own sweat. I loved every torturous minute of it. In retrospect.  <b><a href=\"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/drink-feck-spoons-potatoes-maggie.html\">Santiago</a></b><i>“...fueled by Heineken and Clos we rolled back the years...”</i>It wasn't big, it wasn't clever, our parents wouldn't have been vastly impressed but we had the craic in Santiago alright! We also did nothing for the reputation of the English and Irish abroad, of that I can be sure. And what was lacking... <b>Cider</b>This drink seems to have entirely failed to penetrate beyond England, Ireland and Northern France. A minor tragedy. <b>Rugby</b>Okay the Argies have it but no other countries seem to appreciate the glory of this sport. As for trying to watch the Six Nations... <b>Curry</b>South America, it's better if you just stop trying in all honesty, my tastebuds may never forgive you. <b>Quilts</b>17 blankets vs 1 quilt. Embrace the duck-down will you? <b>Good sandwiches</b>See: Curry. <b>Beer with gas</b>Chile, Argentina, I'm looking at you.

From Rio to São Paulo and a couple of days in Bogota of table-tennis (82-0 Michael, eighty two - nil) and quinoa education before another flight north to Los Angeles via Miami. 24 hours in the city of angels gave enough time for a stroll along Santa Monica Boulevard with its parade of entertainers, freaks and pot peddlers. Tanned, athletic bodies pumped volleyballs back and forth on Venice Beach. Clean streets, straight lines, faintly familiar conventions. Even my fingernails, usually blackened with transit, were a pristine white through no doing of my own. Skateboarders looped and leapt along the promenade, sharks fought over morsels at the aquarium and the Hollywood sign remained elusive. After a wholesome dawdle there were two happy travellers when a pub was found stocking both cider and Newcastle Brown Ale. The novelty pushed us slightly toward overindulgence considering the next flight was mere hours away. In fact a couple of audacious queue jumps were required at the airport to ensure we made our flight and the third we did just for fun. I hadn't seen a place like this since my first visit to India in 2009. Viscous noise, a language in an unfathomable script and people...everywhere. Beijing wrestled with my senses in a way that perhaps nowhere else has in 3 years. I felt again like the green traveller I was back then, taking childish delight in things like Coke cans in hanzi (Chinese script). I recalled the feelings I had on first stepping into India's hot, smogged sun. The wonderous foreigness of it all, the world upside down that lay before me. It was heady and headaching (the car horns anyway) but intoxicatingly moreish. I hope I never run out of places like that to visit as I hope I will lever run out of adjectives to draw them. There was only a waking day to pass in China's heaving capital so we beelined for the people-lined Tiananmen Square. Indeed a long line of people jagged back and forth across the square like a game of snake got out of hand. Officials desperately laid more rope barriers at the rear to contain its rapid growth. Other party workers barked through megaphones at anyone who strayed from the state-sanctioned path. Out of the naivety created by Lonely Planet's cruel abandonment or maybe just because we're English we joined the queue in ignorance of its destination. And we shall ever wonder for we were ejected from it 5 minutes later, Michael for wearing flip-flops (a thing of no little wonder in Beijing) and me, well I guess the official just didn't like me. Dismayed but unbowed (probably a cultural faux-pas) we set off in search of the Forbidden City that alledgedly sat somewhere on the square's perimeter. A tourist information centre that spoke no English, a helpful but similarly linguistically limited tour guide and several maps failed to aid in its locating. We did eventually find the city under a giant portrait of Mao, a great leap forward after an hour of searching. Walking among its cypress trees was a pleasant respite from the press of people outside. We discovered the little red flags on sale from street vendors outside the walls were due to the fact it was National Day and wasn't just regular patriotic fervour. In contrast to the square the Forbidden City was relatively quiet, perhaps on this of all days reconciling the Communist (ish) present with the imperial past is more difficult? Maybe it also explains the rather shoddy presentation of artifacts within the old palace and general lackadasical maintenance. Better that though, I suppose, that the over-enthusiatic restoration that has blighted other Chinese sights like the Great Wall. The vast National Museum provided more hours diversion that we had remaining (and covered more miles than Michael had left in his feet) but a brisk pace took in the hundreds of thousands of years of history contained in the basement. The Cultural Revolution received its own treatment on a separate level, its coverage, at times, almost amusingly incomplete. China, from the briefest of glimpes that I had seen is an entralling country. A country in which high idealism battles human desire and the old certainty of control cedes to new, neon-tinged freedoms. But I wax lyrical, I know not enough, necesito regresar. That, I say with a note of sadness, is the last Spanish I will use for sometime. Back to loud, hopeful English and creative gesture for as we make the short hop from Beijing to Bangkok the Americas are truly, distantly behind us. And what of these 5 months? Those 150 days? How does one summarise 16 countries and so many miles of travel? What pathetic fallacy can do it justice? Am I the wiser for it? Heavens if not! But still, everyday life finds new ways to test your wisdom, to throw all certainty into doubt and confusion. And sometimes the more you see the less you understand and I have surely seen a lot. But see you must. Sweat and shiver, laugh and cry. Walk until your feet burn, swim until your hands shrivel. Listen until your eardrums ache and stare into the sun until your eyes scorch. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience, and if it hurts, you know what? It was probably worth it (The Beach, 2000). So the only wisdom or advice I could offer you is to see the world for yourself. Because it is there, because it is beauty.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3908250369163620283","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3908250369163620283/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3908250369163620283","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:31:25 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:31:24.543+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:31:24 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[116.3779452,39.893842],[116.4174272,39.893842],[116.4174272,39.918203],[116.3779452,39.918203],[116.3779452,39.893842]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/rio-lly-bad-pun-here.html","title":"","published":{"end_time":"2012/04/21 09:43:00 -0400","original":"2012-04-21T23:42:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/04/21 09:42:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/rio-lly-bad-pun-here.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x2qpfoy","description":"Day 143 - Rio de JaneiroIt was early morning in Rio and Christ peered through the mist. Text messages flew back and forth.\"I'm here\"\"At the hostel?\"\"Yeah\"\"Are you? Which room?\"\"6\"\"The girl at reception days you haven't checked in and they don't even have a room 6\"\"Oh. Where am I then?\"Not at the right hostel as it turned out. Still, I had a welcome little sleep in one of their beds before sheepishly leaving. Little else of blog-worthy note occurred for the rest of the day. Mike and I watched Barcelona cede the La Liga title to some awful team from Madrid and got drunk with a pair of English girls whilst espousing the joys of our jungle tour (moreso me than Mike) as they were headed to Bolivia next. We did manage to find diversions other than football and intoxication (important though they are) in the rest of our time in Rio and spent a peaceful few hours striking around a tropical rainforest within the city limits. Hummingbirds buzzed around us as we are lunch in a restaurant in the forest, hovering at feeders hanging from the ceiling (the birds, not us). You had to marvel at the ferocity with which they fought the earth's inner pull. As we walked back to the bus stop we witnessed a creature defying gravity with rather less success. Ambling along, the trees above us shook and a drizzle of leaves fluttered slowly down to the road. Small monkeys leapt nimbly from branch to branch before, out of nowhere, a furry shape plunged onto the hard concrete with a resounding slap. Did he jump or was he pushed? Either way the little ape lay still before the two dumbfounded big apes. A bit like a cat landing on its back this seemed to defy the laws of nature as we knew them. After a few astonished moments there was a twitch and a painfully slow clambering back onto feet (and hands). How he survived the 50 foot drop I don't know but he now gingerly hobbled across the road and began to climb a tree. Another monkey came down to meet him and he climbed on its back seemingly shaken but without serious physical damage. We swung by the Maracana Stadium on our way home, one of football's meccas, that is under extensive redevelopment for the World Cup in 2014.The next day saw an ill-fated attempt to visit Christ the Redeemer but he was too thickly wrapped in opaque cloud to make the view from the top (one of the redeeming features) worth the ascent. Instead another green excursion was taken, this time to the city's botanical gardens. Their tranquility was shared with Dennis, a Turkish man in Brazil for studying purposes. As is traditional myself and Michael found an Irish pub in the evening whose entry fee and stunning prices necessitated a short stay. Long enough though to appreciate the live music provided by a young girl on an acoustic guitar. Perched on her stool and playing to muted applause she had a curious solitude to her as she broke the still air with her lonely strum. The following day I walked the famous sandy swathes of Copacabana and Ipanema with Camilla, a Polish girl who had been in the same hostel as me in São Paulo. We drank from fresh coconut, watched people plucked from the sea by helicopter and met a friend of hers called Estefania. Hot sun, cold beer and a free (if painful) massage from Ipanema's powerful waves. That night the 3 of us and Michael hit Lapa, a lively neighbourhood popular with local muggers. It seemed that they, and indeed all its usual inhabitants had taken the evening off though and the wild revelry was sadly missed.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7739648899065561734","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/7739648899065561734/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7739648899065561734","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:25:06 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:25:05.719+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:25:05 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-43.1862261265259,-22.9675409234569],[-43.1763551265259,-22.9675409234569],[-43.1763551265259,-22.9602309234569],[-43.1862261265259,-22.9602309234569],[-43.1862261265259,-22.9675409234569]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/sampa-oww-low.html","title":"Sampa, oww, low","published":{"end_time":"2012/04/18 09:12:00 -0400","original":"2012-04-18T23:11:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/04/18 09:11:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/sampa-oww-low.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wy45oxg","description":"Day 140 - São PauloTears of frustration and pain lurked threateningly at the corners of my eyes. An overnight bus journey to South America's largest city had turned into a trip of torment. Whether it was my hours of walking the previous day or another, unknown cause I was in a bit of a sorry state. My right leg, from top to bottom, was a barely functional mass of discomfort. The muscles howled with indignation at every attempted movement. I shivered uncontrollably for several hours as the bus bisected São Paulo's vast suburbs and now I struggled to stand at the terminal as I waited for my bag. Porters descended on the bus, jostling in their hurry and running over my foot with their trollies. Eventually the crowds dispersed and I managed to retrieve my luggage. Doing my best to swallow self-pity I hobbled to a taxi and headed for a hostel Mike had recommended having arrived there the day before. Several hours of sleep proved somewhat restorative despite loud jazz music outside the room, screaming children in a school next door and pounding roadworks in the street!Despite lacking any standout attractions and a rather shaky start (which I think I briefly mentioned?) my few days in São Paulo were enjoyable. After my afflicted limb had regained most of its strength and the shivers had stopped I was beset by a turbulent stomach and pounding headaches meaning I barely made it further than the hostel courtyard for the first 2 days. Thankfully I was staying with a sociable bunch of people who seemed to share my disinclination to stray far from the accommodation. We did make it down to the corner café where an amusing, improvised game was devised involving a small basket, a person's head and some scrunched up bits of greasy paper. Sadly it is probably too late to be included in the 2012 Olympics schedule. The following day I roused myself to serious movement by taking a walking tour of the sprawling metropolis with Rosa, a Dutch girl well versed in the art form of 'glitch' (I have no idea either). She had been to São Paulo many times so proved an able guide. Owing to my leg's fragility frequent stops for beer were an unfortunate necessity. We perused shops selling stuff and things, wondered at the compete absence of billboards, saw neatly dissected animals at the market and studied strange, cryptic graffiti plastering tall buildings. There was enough time for a detailed chat about chlamydia with a pair of Swedes back at the hostel before I had to get an overnight bus to Rio. Retrieving my bag from the hostel storage bunker I was saying my goodbyes when there was a tickling sensation on the back of my neck. A flick of my hand sent a cockroach flying to the ground, lovely. A circuitous route via bus and subway left me once again haring it through a terminal with minutes to spare. Thankfully if there is one thing reliable about South American buses it is the unreliability of their departure times. Next up - the marvellous city.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3875044703230400057","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3875044703230400057/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3875044703230400057","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:23:52 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:23:51.238+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:23:51 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-47.2705322,-24.0147493],[-46.0071042,-24.0147493],[-46.0071042,-23.0831373],[-47.2705322,-23.0831373],[-47.2705322,-24.0147493]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/10-things-i-hate-about-this-bus.html","title":"10 things I hate about this bus","published":{"end_time":"2012/04/16 22:04:00 -0400","original":"2012-04-17T12:03:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/04/16 22:03:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/10-things-i-hate-about-this-bus.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wskxw4j","description":"Day 139 - Automotive hell1, lights off from the off.2, no movies.3, people are playing music off their phones4, no food provided, I want my packed lunch.5, aircon is set to stun.6, the decor is shit.7, I want to go somewhere snowy and it's taking me to Sao Paulo.8, the woman that has just spent 20 minutes in the driver's cabin may have been administering executive relief, this service is not available to passengers.9, not enough stops.10, the conductor is forced to wear claret trousers with a salmon pink shirt and a claret tie, that is cruel.11, the seat next to me isn't occupied by a pretty Brazilian girl with tight clothes and loose morals.12, too many stops.13, it cost eighty dollars.14, it's trying to kill me.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4361940321951045211","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/4361940321951045211/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4361940321951045211","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:15:30 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:15:29.612+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:15:29 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-55.50292975,-28.7728653970648],[-45.39550775,-28.7728653970648],[-45.39550775,-21.3983323970648],[-55.50292975,-21.3983323970648],[-55.50292975,-28.7728653970648]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/goosed.html","title":"Goosed","published":{"end_time":"2012/04/13 23:24:00 -0400","original":"2012-04-14T13:23:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/04/13 23:23:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/goosed.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x14qdju","description":"Day 136 - Foz do IguazuI wouldn't have thought it odd had a church bell struck a single, sonorous note right at that point. For I was alone, frighteningly literally. The Argentinian-Brazilian border was at my back, the bus I crossed on at my front, going at 40mph and not turning around. \"What are we going to do now?\" I could only ask myself. I had just set foot in a country whose language might as well have been Sanskrit for all I knew. Looking about for a clue, the merest hint of what I should do next having discounted my initial idea of getting into the foetal position. I noticed a fellow former passenger had also been deserted and approached with my best 'help the poor gringo' look. Rudimentary Spanish gleaned the information that more buses were imminent. He also informed that should I need a hostel his friend was picking him up shortly and they could take me to such a place. I had to question the merits of my decision as I sat in the back of the car heading to the aforementioned hostel but, I reasoned, Stevan and Diego seemed nice chaps. When decisions like this pan out you attribute yourself a wonderful judge of character and not a little intrepid. When they don't, a hopeless (and hopefully still living) knave.I had judged well, both men were as they said they were and it was indeed a hostel to which I was brought. It was a backpacker factory for sure, the slick operation, the wallpaper of signs and notices left no doubt as to that but I found it unexpectedly agreeable. Perhaps its quiet appealed, a limited residence left me talking primarily to Stevan (in Spanish), Diego (in Portuguese) and Luisa the chef (in gesture) both nights I was there. After a first couple of hours at the bar of being entertained by some dubious musical choices and far too many UB40 tracks (i.e. more than zero) I felt Stevan required the benefit of my DJ'ing expertise *cough*. We tried Irish punk and some Jay-Z before a bit of American heavy rock piqued his interest. I retired to bed feeling my work was done for the day.War had broken out again between Argentina and Britain. Again it was over a tiny, insignificant patch of green in the middle of nowhere. Again the sly South Americans were first to the scene, again the British were not far behind. With surprise the aggressors struck the first blow raining down exocets from every direction. Britain was shaken, doubting its resolve, its ability to protect its own territory from the assault. But slowly, but surely with a stiff upper lip, blitz spirit and other worn clichés it clawed itself back into contention. Guile and persistence and a healthy dose of spin ensured the day was won. Stevan, you must play on that ping-pong table everyday, forshame!Time moved at its constant metre and I could spend no longer gathering my senses. I was here to see the Iguazu falls. Vast torrents of water surge over 275 sheer drops falling 260 feet into the eroded river bed below. As I waited at a lonely bus stop between the sight and the city where every passing motorist looked at me with an odd curiosity I planned the full day that lay ahead. The falls were for the evening before I got my next bus, first stop - Paraguay. Just over the river from Foz lies Ciudad de Este in South America's 2nd poorest country (after Bolivia). A bus took me from Foz city centre up to and over the international border without a single \"passaporté señor\". With no Brazilian exit stamp in my passport mild concern at the possible difficulties involved in reentry couldn't help but strike me. Oh well, I was here now. Here in a bustling city of commerce inundated with malls and stalls. Vendors proffered their wares in the welcome tongue of Spanish as I strolled the main thoroughfare. But I had little time for window(less) shopping so purchased a computer cable and sat down over a beer to plan my clandestine return to Brazil. As chance would have it the Paraguayans hop over this most porous of borders in great numbers and with apparent ease on the back of motorbikes. This would take the different means of transport I have used to swap countries on this trip to 7. My rider weaved through oncoming traffic slowing for not a second as we passed customs and immigration offices and I had made it back without Brazil ever knowing I'd left.The sun blazed and a slight limp developed. Sitting on the bus to the waterfalls back in Foz I suddenly remembered a monument in the city that I wished to see. But after an hour of walking there was still no sight of it. Reasoning that I had enough time to reach it on foot if I got a taxi back, I could then fit in the falls and get my bus to Sao Paulo at 7pm. When I did reach the monument I stood at the meeting point of three countries, to my left the land of Argentina and to my right Paraguay, my feet planted firmly on Brazilian soil. An interesting location with one major, potentially ruinous problem - it was near deserted. The odd car came and went but not a single taxi in sight, another 90 minute walk would blast a giant hole through my packed itinerary and necessitate missing the main sight I was here for in order to make my bus on time. A minibus arrived with a couple of Japanese tourists in it. They came, they saw, they were swiftly leaving, no time to waste. Emboldened by desperation I negotiated a free lift back down the road and fortune had me on track again. Fortune bestowed greater gifts still when it transpired that the falls were also their next destination and they would happily take me all the way there.I stood alone for the first time since I had reached this world-renowned sight and as the sun sank slowly in the sky I contemplated. Having done the tourist shuffle, having waited for a gap to open up on the viewing platform so I could take an identical picture I was left feeling unmoved. Standing solitary on another viewpoint further downstream little lizards scuttled back and forth, dragonflies buzzed around and around, hawks wheeled circles in the air. All of them in their circles just as the water below was in its circle, flowing to the sea where it will return to the sky and plunge down onto the mountains once more. Every creature in its own little circle, every element following its cycle. It is all circles really, life and death, decay and rebirth, growth and retreat, erosion and eruption. What is the point if everything ends up where it starts? What does it all matter? Nothing and everything. All matter returns to the earth and all earth returns to the stars, just as we erect monuments to perpetuity so we tear them down, or nature does it for us. All is just matter so nothing truly matters, but what else can we do? I felt, as I often have at these major sights, underwhelmed. That a lone little waterfall hidden somewhere secluded amongst the trees could have the same impact on a person as these mighty falls. That it isn't about the size of the location it's how you use it.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2719336518294909271","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2719336518294909271/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2719336518294909271","updated":{"end_time":"2012/12/23 03:49:38 -0500","original":"2012-12-23T19:49:37.245+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/12/23 03:49:37 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-54.9040286,-25.7761188],[-54.2723146,-25.7761188],[-54.2723146,-25.3176768],[-54.9040286,-25.3176768],[-54.9040286,-25.7761188]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/na-triobloidi.html","title":"Na Trioblóidí","published":{"end_time":"2012/04/09 04:59:00 -0400","original":"2012-04-09T18:58:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/04/09 04:58:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/05/na-triobloidi.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wriuv5y","description":"Day 131 - Buenos AiresI think I finally put my finger on it in Buenos Aires. An explanation for a malaise grown over recent weeks that niggled and pricked my waking hours. I thought I could shake it, I just needed a bit more sleep. But it was emotional lethargy that saw days pass in this coolest of capitals without the slightest endeavour to sample its 'je ne sais quoi'. There were broad boulevards, architecture redolent of Paris and beautiful public spaces but somehow the city lacked something. It was I that lacked something though I realised. It suddenly struck me that we all form a connection to the place in which we live. We invest something in our home and it in turn invests something in us. The wandering alien severs his connection and loses a certain sense of belonging. I had no door to shut the world behind, no space to claim as my own. I was caught in a river whose course was unknown but whose current was insistent. Despite the new-found clarity and understanding I stood, or rather lay, surprised at this revelation. I hadn't anticipated a form of homesickness and certainly not so soon. It seems the wider world had taught me something about myself, fancy.The hourglass didn't cease though even as my activity did. Every hour another grain of sand. 17 days left, 3000 miles to Bogota. I couldn't hang around the hostel all day plaguing Leon with music requests and bothering Cecilia with psychoanalysis. Make hay. So I ate fantastic steaks and monotone pizzas. I saw the tombs of San Martín and Eva Peron. Perused quirky antiques and drank endlessly flat beer. And edged inexorably towards a reckoning. A violent putsch and a nearly punch. Spite laden eyes narrow and black. Desperate remonstration fought chilling logic. A sudden crossroads without traffic lights or speed limits. The great unraveling or an inevitable check? Absolute or absolution? Reality swirled like a stirred cappuccino. It melted like the persistence of memory. Simple streaks of variance contorted into gaping, fanged mouths poised to devour us whole.  Gravity slipped Newton's leash and quadrangles twisted like a Rubik's cube. A volcano had erupted and I knew not how long its ash would cover the sky. I followed a faint light in the gloom, it pulsed, it flickered, it dimmed beyond sight at times but I followed. What else could I do?","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8586715982680662436","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8586715982680662436/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8586715982680662436","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:21:12 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:21:11.132+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:21:11 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-58.3814229419556,-34.6092151897451],[-58.3789549419556,-34.6092151897451],[-58.3789549419556,-34.6075811897451],[-58.3814229419556,-34.6075811897451],[-58.3814229419556,-34.6092151897451]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/drink-feck-spoons-potatoes-maggie.html","title":"Drink!

I had been sent down to the lobby to ask humbly, futilely if we could stay another night. I was beginning to get the impression we could not. The seeds of this behavioural nadir were sown several days earlier when, having come to the end of our Bolivian tour, we found that Darren, Dee, Teresa and Sofia were also heading down into Chile. Our collective first stop was San Pedro de Atacama, a little tourist town on the edge of the world's driest desert. After washing the dirt of the road from ourselves myself and Michael decided a spot of lunch was in order. Having located a pleasant venue on the main plaza we were joined before long by, as chance would have it, a couple of Irish and a pair of Germans. 16ish pitchers of beer later we had negotiated San Pedro's odd licensing laws, almost stopped moaning about Chile's high prices and, most miraculously of all, booked our onward bus for the next day (thanks Teresa!)The German girls had perhaps felt a prophetic twinge and elected to go their own way after we reached Santiago; the Anglo-Irish connection remained strong. Grand plans to see the capital's sights were made as the 4 of us sat outside a bar, grand plans were unmade as we ordered another round of beers. Waiting for the Irish outside Burger King a drunken Englishman provided entertainment by taking a running dive into a large pile of rubbish. I can't say which drunken Englishman it was. It wasn't me. Video coming to a Facebook near you soon. We returned our hotel provisioned with wine and snacks and continued our libations (bender). We found a small patio area with some fellow guests who quite obviously hadn't had the tiring, emotional evening that we had. The only conversation I can remember is Mike and Darren convincing them that the latter was a 'Cheese Mechanic' en-route to Australia by request of the government to teach the country how to make...well...cheese. All I know of the other conversions were that they were of sufficient volume to draw complaints. Darren had run out of cigarettes so I accompanied him on a foray to the local shops. Having purchased the smokes and insulted the football team of every male member of staff in the store we returned to find an asleep Mike, slumped in his chair and a bored Dee inserting cheese puffs into his nose, mouth and ears.\"Lo siento\". It was no user, my tardy, poorly pronounced, apology would sway the manager not one bit. Hotel Londres in Santiago would not be accommodating us again. Okay so I knew about the noise we had made the previous night. I was aware the manager had witnessed me and Mike wrestling over who got the better bed. What I did not know until I had returned upstairs to deliver the bad news was that a drunken Englishman had urinated in front of the night porter. I can't say which drunken Englishman it was. It wasn't me. Alas, video not coming to a Facebook near you soon. Had I realised the cause of the wet towel lying on the bedroom floor in the morning I might have spent the time wasted negotiating with the Hotel manager packing my bag instead. Turns out (after we were turned out) that a major music festival was being held in Santiago that weekend and hotel rooms were, to say the least, in demand. But for a husband and wife team who packed all 4 of us and all our bags into their jeep and drove us from hotel to hotel we might have been sleeping in the park. Which is ironic given that the park was where we spent most of our remaining time in the capital. Our new accommodation was near to a pleasant green area replete with bars, restaurants, market stalls and a playground. A playground where fueled by Heineken and Clos we rolled back the years to careen down slides and soar on swings, to climb trees and hurl fistfuls of dirt. We ate picnics on the grass and Mike gave haircuts by lamplight.And that is all can really tell you of Chile. Of its sights, its culture I am ignorant. Of its landscape and nature I know little. Of the fact it was one of the highlights of the trip I am certain.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2509131259593033018","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2509131259593033018/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2509131259593033018","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:17:35 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:17:34.022+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:17:34 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.8134275,-34.2649677],[-69.2865725,-34.2649677],[-69.2865725,-32.5683657],[-71.8134275,-32.5683657],[-71.8134275,-34.2649677]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/dark-heart.html","title":"Dark Heart","published":{"end_time":"2012/03/28 21:18:00 -0400","original":"2012-03-29T12:17:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/03/28 21:17:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/dark-heart.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x5uo7gv","description":"Day 120 - Somewhere in the jungleA beast as elusive as the jaguar was our quarry. As rare too as the spotted cat in these modern times; we hunted for it in the rainforest. Three days and two nights we would spend on its trail, a search to test the body and mind to their limits. We chased the real, we sought a prize no less than ´The Authentic Experience™´. Not for us the comforts of a jungle lodge. Nor either the luxuries of meals thrice daily or bottled water in our bag. There was no bag in fact, only a mosquito net and a guide named Pedro. Everything we needed, food and drink and shelter would come from the forest. A casual, curious click on the ´Extreme´ section of the Mogli Jungle Tours website was all it was. Alcohol is a substance of many abilities but I am ever astounded at the way it turns bad ideas into good ones, questionable into compelling. As another glass of red wine slipped down in a restaurant in La Paz far from the jungle my life suddenly became incomplete having never held a tarantula or eaten a termite. No other tour would do, it was ´Survivors´ or nothing. Rurrenabaque sits on the banks of the River Beni and would be the jumping off point for our Amazon adventure. A turbulent hour by propeller plane from La Paz we left behind the chilly altitude of the capital for beating sun and thick, humid air. The town seems to exist solely to send tourists off into nature’s sweaty embrace. Tour agencies throng the high street outnumbered only by outfitters selling anything and everything an intrepid explorer might need, from repellent to rubber boots. And knives. Big, mean knives that Mike persuaded me were essential to our survival. So there I stood in my new wellies wearing a shirt last owned by someone from, judging by the arm patch, the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief. I gazed upstream to where the jungle swallowed the river and, in my head, beyond that to the living hell where our steel would be put to use. On one shoulder a mosquito net, the sole concession to comfort allowed, on the other a camera to record our daring exploits for posterity. At my feet a murky flow that would cross a continent to find a great ocean. In front of me the rickety launch that would speed us 3 hours along the Beni to a remote jungle camp. The launch drew a slow arc in the water, the engine fired and that would be the last we’d see of it for 3 days. As I watched its departure burning pinpricks of pain erupted across my hand. I pulled it away from the tree against which I had leant to find both the hand and the tree festooned with the insectoid agents of Satan (they even sport his team colour) that are fire ants. Named both for their red hue and the flaming viciousness of their bite they attack without provocation, hang on with fierce tenacity and probably taught Pedro a whole new set of English language curses he’d never heard before. ´Lesson 1 - Mind your manos (hands)´. It was quite a nice jungle camp as it turned out, or so it seemed for the 30 seconds it took me, Michael and Pedro to walk straight through it. Our first challenge came within another 30 seconds. Pedro waltzed over the log laying some 5 feet above the stream and with an instruction of \"tranquilla\" (calm) beckoned me to follow. I looked at the trunk that seemed to grow more slender before my eyes, I looked at the stream and its unknown depth, its unsighted bottom and I....opted to wade. Fortunately our knowledgeable, experienced guide assured me that this would not be a problem. Unfortunately, I discovered as the water slipped over the top of my boots, that this was not true. A trail snaked, no, sneaked into the green maze. From the clutter of bended branch decked with leaves to the loamy leaf-littered soil, it was a wall of nature. It burst from the ground and covered the sky, it ensconced with a brutal edge. Our party was not the only using the trail as a large paw print attested, a jaguar had been this very way of late. Onward. And onward. Beads of sweat raced each other down my forehead before dropping off the end of my nose like it was a leaky tap. Trails were fond morning memories, Pedro hacked out a path seen only by him through grasping, snagging, scratching growth. The occasional fire ant hopped aboard for a stinging ride and proved as adept at biting through our clothes as they had our skin. Sustained by what forest fruit we found, hunger was nothing to the all-conquering discomfort of thirst. Water poured from every pore and my mouth ran dry. Fantastic images of cold Fanta straight from the fridge occupied my thoughts. Torturous remembrances of frosty beer straight from the tap dominated my conscious. And suddenly the most rhetorical question I have every heard rang out \"agua?\" Cool, fresh, slightly woody water bubbled out of the hefty lump of tree I suspended above my head and down into a parched desert held wide open and grateful for every drop. Pedro had identified the exposed roots of a tree that was not entirely unlike every other tree around us and with a few dashes of his machete furnished me with a rather unconventional drinking vessel. The sound of wild pigs nearby even failed to distract from the liquid bounty. ´Lesson 2 - Drink as much as you can, when you can´. A more interesting four-legged discovery of rodential significance was the capybara wallowing in a pool next to where we pitched camp for the night. As interesting as a glimpse of the world’s largest rodent was darkness would soon be upon us and a shelter was needed. A simple but sturdy construction of wood and fronded leaf was soon thrown up. As the night began its songs and its screams I stretched weary limbs and closed tired eyes. The night survived I rose, squeezed reluctant feet back into ill-fitting boots, packed my mosquito net into a backpack that Pedro had crafted, with considerable skill, from palm leaves and prepared to set out for another day under the canopy. It seems though that our jungle trekking stripes were earned on day 1 (the imaginary stripes that I now wore on the arm of my imaginary combat fatigues) for after a couple of hours walking we had already found our next campsite. We dropped our gear, hung up a ´Gone fishin´ sign and went hunting for bait. Bait, it transpired, would be the classic, cliché even, earthworm dug from a muddy bank and threaded onto sizeable hooks. The equipment was even simpler than the bait, line wound round a wooden spool. The fishing technique beat everything for its uncomplicatedness, after locating fish-filled pool (ask your guide to help in this), toss in hook and line and sink ´er. Slowly pull the line back to you and if you feel a bite give a mighty heave and pull the fish onto the bank. Easy. Or so I thought after Pedro had, with his very first cast, pulled in a 7 inch catfish. My catch took longer to come, in fact it needed a change of pool. A second location was so inhabited by buzzing, airborne nuisances we might as well have been fly-fishing! Arf! Our haul was OK so far with a few little roach added, but it was only likely to arouse our appetites without bedding them back down. I gave the line a sharp yank and out of nowhere a healthy, hearty catfish lay wildly flapping on the bank. I took the back of my knife to the unfortunate creature’s head and unleashed an inner bellow to the jungle at the sheer bloody masculinity of it all. ´Course Pedro came back from his spot with a whole string of fish and managed it without looking half as pleased with himself as I did but then again I expect he’s done this before. We washed and gutted the catch down by the river, scales glittered like sequins as the flow carried them away. After an hour or so of cooking in bamboo over an open fire I savoured the freshest fish of my life in all its succulent, flaky perfection. Dessert was a writhing white grub I found in a log. It had a delicate, buttery flavour I think would go well with steamed spinach. I watched the sunset through a peach-coloured sky scored by dashes of burnt orange and pink. Light peeked over the distant tree line to subtly illuminate the waters of a river that will, many miles from here, flow into the mighty Amazon. The cicadas had started their chirruping in the darkening jungle behind me while squawking macaws flew overhead in pairs, always pairs, returning home to roost. A waterfall downstream provided a low but constant thrum as the two fishermen were silhouetted against the shore (this part I imagine as I was one of those men). Some of the earlier catch had been reserved for bigger quarry and now myself and Pedro whirled weighed lines around our heads like lassos and out into the river’s powerful pull. And then we waited, in a meditative silence, for a twitch or a quiver. It never came. I didn’t care one bit. There was such peaceful solemnity to be found sitting by that river a fish on the line might only have disturbed it. The sun died after a last gasp of searing colour and compelled us to end our sojourn. But it had soothed my soul, if only for a while. It was beauty. The previous evening had been rounded out with a night walk in search of nocturnal animals. Apart from an endearingly cute tree mouse and a nearly sighted ocelot there wasn’t much to see, apart from a pristine darkness, a blacker-than-black, an absence of light as I have never seen before. Day 3 dawned and owing to our campsite’s proximity to the river I was able to drink most greedily of its muddy water. Suitably refreshed so began the trek back to civilisation. Time passed quickly as the terrain changed, one minute sandy and firm the next a glutinous orange bog. We passed a fallen log covered in thousands of tiny mushrooms not bigger than a pinhead. We passed trees with giant buttress roots taller than a man. We passed the tracks of pigs moving at speed and the jaguar tracks beside them from the animal no doubt inducing their haste. I was sad to be leaving the jungle despite the deprivation and discomfort. I wanted to see more, to see the weird and wonderful that may lie through the next thicket. But I took pleasure from having completed the tour, from having ´survived´, from having done all that was asked of me by man and by nature. ´Lesson 3 - Do that which you cannot in order that you might´. Next time 20 days, now that would be a test.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/575535827437095449","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/575535827437095449/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/575535827437095449","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:11:32 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:11:31.356+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:11:31 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-67.6072973,-14.5037302],[-67.4493693,-14.5037302],[-67.4493693,-14.3807142],[-67.6072973,-14.3807142],[-67.6072973,-14.5037302]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/red-white-and-blue.html","title":"Red, white and blue","published":{"end_time":"2012/03/25 14:34:00 -0400","original":"2012-03-26T05:33:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/03/25 14:33:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/red-white-and-blue.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wrhyhkd","description":"Day 117 - Salar de UyuniTraditional Bolivian recipe -Take 1 large, flat plain (about 4000 square miles)Add a few pinches of salt (about 1 trillion)Leave to bake under a hot sun for a years (about 10 thousand)You're done, tourists will eat it up. The salt flats south of Uyuni are a remorseless sheet of crystalline white formed by the drying of a lake. Perpetually clear skies mean the sun bounces blindingly off the highly reflective surface and wearing sunglasses is a near necessity in this sterile emptiness. We stood outside the office where we had booked our 3 day tour awaiting our fellow tourees, people came and people went though two parents and their 3 boisterous children seemed to be lingering, how I prayed it it wouldn't be them. When our 4x4 did arrive it was preloaded with 3 girls and a boy of similar ages to ourselves, no guarantee of good times but a welcome start nonetheless. Darren and Dee were a couple from Ireland, Teresa and Sofia sisters from Germany. Myself and Darren discovered quickly that we both supported football teams from the north of England who wore red and were managed by Scots. Alas he had chosen poorly but I resolved to treat him with the kindness and respect that have always marked English-Irish relations. After a scenic graveyard of trains and a little too long staring at the flats the evening was drawing in. The place we stayed for the night was a ghost town in all but population (though I include stray dogs in the census). The building itself was a simple concrete hall with dorms leading off it and fronted by an enclosed courtyard for vehicles. The toilets flushed by means of a jug of water and the fact that hot showers were charged for allowed me to continue my soap dodging for another day. Our group seated itself at one of the tables in the *ahem* dining room and feasted upon a welcome snack of tea and dry crackers. we were eventually served a proper meal and having sourced some social lubricant in bottles stayed up talking about families and the Irish gave us an overview of the little town in the Emerald Isle from whence they came (and its eclectic cast of characters). The generator flicked off but the conversation continued by torchlight while outside a starscape of startling density covered the sky. A thousand twinkling dots broke the black canvas and my eyes swept back and forth without cease over the universe's infinite light show. It was an eloquent, wordless explanation of mankind's drive to explore space. Morning came to Nowheresville, Bolivia and found a tour party starting forlornly at a stricken 4x4. Luckily it was not our tour party but another one who had shared our breezeblock palace for the night. Our tour guide Pedro (no not the same one) endeavored to assist in their hour of need. Deducing that it was a battery issue his solution appeared to be to remove the working one from our vehicle and give it to them. To collective relief (from one group anyway) he was only using it to jump start the other car with a couple of spanners and his body as a human electrical conductor. The second day of the tour took in rock formations carved into bizarre shapes by grating winds. Pedro never missed an opportunity to point out their vague resemblance to native animals. Lagoons  provided occasional respite from the deserted land. They took a variety of hues though variety is probably too strong a term, after seeing our 5th green-blue pool of water Pedro's inquiry of \"photograph?\" was met with a resounding \"no\". One lagoon was different though. The colour of sacrificial blood dripping down the steps of an Incan pyramid, icebergs of white borax ringed its shores. Flamingoes stalked the shallows filtering out whatever goodness they could find in the seething water. It was a justly rewarding sight for enduring the (relative) monotony of the other lagoons and one I shall not forget. Our evening's rest would be taken in a building of striking similarity to the one of the previous day. The major difference being that it lacked any kind of town surrounding it. It lacked any kind of anything surrounding it. Isolated though we were Darren and I had located the the corner shop cum off-license within 10 minutes of arrival. Our group reconvened around the dining table and wearily munched on more dry crackers. The next table along had been laid out for a tour group that had yet to arrive and it had a noticeably higher classs of biscuit on it. Theft is perhaps not the most approrpiate word, a temporary and highly subtle switch was effected though. Anyway it was clear by this point that we had no good will to lose. The girl in the kitchen met the simplest and politest request with barely supressed contempt. Our cheery (and slightly ironic) smiles as she passed the table actually elicited a snarl. If I were being charitable I might say that the fact she had to share a room with Pedro that night may have been weighing on her mind. The previous evening's leftover food was presented to us as dinner (I cannot prove this) and the night played out much  the same - wine, laughter and mild, good-natured racism. Darren shivered in a sleeping bag in the front seat, Mike wrapped himself in a picnic rug in the back and and all of us wondered what what earthly purpose being up at half four in the morning in freezing temperatures could serve. The purpose, it turned out, was hot geysers, gas bursting from the earth with a sulphurous tang. We gladly huddled around one to feel its warmth. Next stop was a hot spring whose steaming surface promised respite from the frigid air. There was only the small matter of stripping off off behind a hut to change into swimming shorts. Dee led the way and spent a quarter of an hour trying to presuade the rest of us it was a worthwhile experience. And it was. Warmth seeped back into my bones as the sun rose over the horizon. The tour was almost done, we were bearing down on the Chilean border where Pedro would leave us. Far less that the sights it was the sounds that will define my memories of these 3 days. The sounds of bottle tops popping and laughter erupting.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2918890640462789050","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2918890640462789050/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2918890640462789050","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:16:32 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:16:31.118+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:16:31 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-77.7026082,-27.8485649],[-57.4877642,-27.8485649],[-57.4877642,-12.6258229],[-77.7026082,-12.6258229],[-77.7026082,-27.8485649]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/this-trip-sponsored-by-clos.html","title":"This trip sponsored by Clos","published":{"end_time":"2012/03/11 16:30:00 -0400","original":"2012-03-12T07:29:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/03/11 16:29:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/this-trip-sponsored-by-clos.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x49y1vm","description":"Day 103 - La PazAfter a morning of syringe shopping and staring at baby llama fetuses in the witches market we relaxed over a pint in the self-appointed ´5th best bar in La Paz´. Notwithstanding the use of Comic Sans for signage and its Lonely Planet declared infamy as the worst cultural experience in the city ´Oliver´s Travels´ was an agreeable watering hole. Staffed by a Brummie named Kass we managed to find our way there on each of the 8 days we spent in the capital. It certainly merited several more visits than a nearby curry house who, close to closing time and after the promise of a sizeable tip, served us some of the most unpleasant Indian cuisine I have ever tasted. Convinced the bill we were given included the aforementioned tip we calculated our debt sans an unworthy tribute and made a hasty exit. Two waiters dashing out into the street after us insisted that was not the case and we reluctantly coughed up the money (I would have happily coughed up the food). Our efforts to watch England in the Six Nations had been on a downward curve of success since the first game. From live in Bogota to stuttering streaming in Popayan, a few hours after the fact in Huanchaco to this. Days had elapsed since we had played France and, having studiously avoided the result, footage of a quality that would be unacceptable to Mongolian pirate TV was now downloading. Through blocky frames and amidst bemused waiters who indulged our need for power and wifi amiably we observed a fine if belated victory. Comforted by the fact the Oliver´s had the final game live a few days hence we chose to forget the fact that the plane tickets to Thailand we had just booked left us only 7 weeks to cover the rest of South America and that tarrying was obviously inadvisable. The time was used by repeatedly failing to get yellow fever shots, watching terrible films and eating cardiac-arresting amounts of fried chicken. Oh and booking tickets for a tour in the Amazon Rainforest. A fierce physical challenge lay ahead. Our flight to a little town on a tributary of the world´s greatest river left at 8AM the next morning. The final day of the world´s greatest rugby competition began at 8AM 24 hours previous to it. The date - 17th March, St. Patrick´s Day. Oliver´s was holding a ´Plastic Paddy´s Day´ celebration in which all non-Irish people present in the bar would be given a shot every hour, on the hour. This would not aid us in catching our flight.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8614186414227110670","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8614186414227110670/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8614186414227110670","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/30 04:10:30 -0400","original":"2012-10-30T19:10:29.804+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/30 04:10:29 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-68.1561185,-16.5066224],[-68.1363775,-16.5066224],[-68.1363775,-16.4913974],[-68.1561185,-16.4913974],[-68.1561185,-16.5066224]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/cuphut.html","title":"Cuphut","published":{"end_time":"2012/03/08 14:31:00 -0500","original":"2012-03-09T06:30:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/03/08 14:30:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/04/cuphut.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x039ikd","description":"Day 101 - CopacabanaIt may have fallen short of outright murder but manslaughter might have been on the charge sheet if we hadn't released the old man from his duties. An impromptu, rudimentary and seemingly insurmountable roadblock had seen us halted in a little tumbleweed town on the Peruvian-Bolivian border. Around 50 people stood in the road a quarter of a mile ahead of the ever-growing convoy of lorries and minibuses. I strolled under the dry sun to their fleshy barricade. Debate calmly and unhurriedly continued as the reassuring sight of a police car formed in the distance. The crowd calmly and unhurriedly parted as if Moses himself was driving and reformed again behind the unfussed and departing officers. Eventually some maverick among our fellow passengers suggested taking the road around the unfathomable hindrance. And so it was we were deposited next to an wisened old Bolivian a kilometre or so from the border. How bad I felt as he struggled up the hill having had his fare negotiated down to a pittance, his pedal rickshaw slowing as his wheezing grew ever faster. About halfway through the journey we thanked him for his labours, tipped and hopped off. We sat in front of the setting sun on Lake Titicaca eating a second identical burger provided courtesy of the fact that 'dos mas' is, it seems, an ambiguous request that can as well apply to dinner as it can to beer. My travelling companion held court on the simplicity of manning sailboats and insisted we should rent one the very next day. The former Sea Cadet assured me we'd not get lost due to the fact that boats have 'udders' by which one steers (or dictates the direction you want the boat to moove). He seemed less certain of his seaworthiness a couple of days later as we rocked uncertainly across a slender stretch of the lake on our way to the world's highest capital.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5313180914887674952","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/5313180914887674952/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5313180914887674952","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/29 07:47:18 -0400","original":"2012-10-29T22:47:17.562+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/29 07:47:17 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-69.1068628,-16.1839556],[-69.0871218,-16.1839556],[-69.0871218,-16.1687056],[-69.1068628,-16.1687056],[-69.1068628,-16.1839556]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/llamas-and-apaches.html","title":"Llamas and Apaches","published":{"end_time":"2012/03/06 11:22:00 -0500","original":"2012-03-07T03:21:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/03/06 11:21:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/llamas-and-apaches.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wvt0osa","description":"Day 97 - PunoI had to sympathise with the rodent as it stared up at me with a fixed grin. Back home it would have led a cosseted life, fed and kept safe. Here in Peru though the Guinea Pig was splayed across my plate, its bedding fried potatoes rather than sawdust. My sympathies receded as I savoured the pleasant, slightly gamey flavour and, with a little effort, the bones were soon picked clean. I was in a restaurant in Puno which sits on the shores of Lake Titicaca whose claim to be the world's largest high altitude body of water was continually and vigorously disputed by Michael. Our hotel room lacked amenities like natural light and combined with the thin, lethargic air was starting to resemble a coffin after 3 days of near-constant habitation. Time had seemingly ground to a halt in this rainy town. I and, after some cajoling, Mike decided to break the sit in by booking a visit to the ruins of Sillustani. It is known for its pre and post-Inca funerary towers which cluster on a hill overlooking miles of empty landscape patrolled by the occasional alpaca. Our guide was a knowledgeable indigenous chap called Cesar who informed the group of the tower's history by way of an impressively comprehensive infographic scratched into the soil. On the bus journey back to Puno we stopped at the home of a local family and were offered the chance to purchase their wares and pet their llamas, all for a few coins of course. I stayed on the bus while my fellow passengers enjoyed the human zoo. Like Herodotus' dog-headed men tales of people living on islands made of reeds must have astounded reason before mass tourism found them. As we sat aboard the boat awaiting departure to the unique isles my fears were piqued by a fellow who climbed aboard and began knocking out The Beatles on panpipe. Once upon a time the Uros islands in Lake Titicaca would have been places of myth and hearsay, now they are another stop on the traveler's trail, a well rehearsed pantomime of ethnicity, a bazaar of colourful mass-fabricated goods. We drifted past islands replete with public telephones, satellite dishes and one that appeared to function as a petrol station. Drifted in a craft dubbed the 'Mercedes-Benz' of the islander's vessels, a ludicrously unwieldy construction of reeds fronted by two grimacing dragon heads. Why are these people here? Has no-one told them that the tribes that persecuted and drove them to this aquatic isolation are long gone? They don't seem to be here to live the lifestyle of their forbears, tourism and the modern world have tainted that. No, they are here to carve an existence by the best means they can and if that is by bluffing an empty hand then who can begrudge them. Why was I here? A harder question.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2260836082744133821","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2260836082744133821/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2260836082744133821","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/29 07:46:16 -0400","original":"2012-10-29T22:46:15.931+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/29 07:46:15 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-70.0148468,-15.8572469],[-70.0099118,-15.8572469],[-70.0099118,-15.8534279],[-70.0148468,-15.8534279],[-70.0148468,-15.8572469]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/dream-within-dream.html","title":"A dream within a dream","published":{"end_time":"2012/03/03 16:47:00 -0500","original":"2012-03-04T08:46:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/03/03 16:46:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/dream-within-dream.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wukgzdd","description":"Day 95 - Machu PicchuTo look at Machu Picchu is to see a dream. I cannot say for sure it was the dream of those who built it, no-one can. But to me it is a dream of isolation, of insulation, even of inoculation from the cruelties of the wider world. At the absolute least it is my dream of a simple life not crazed by the fever of progress. Not a life where all too often my actions seem to lack purpose, all too often are wracked by doubt and despair. I want to eat, to sleep, to love without the unremitting analysis. A dream of switching off whatever part of my twisted consciousness floated up all those years ago to hover above me like some departing soul in a hospital ward. I used to disdain stasis feeling those who lacked ambition, had not the desire to drive themselves onwards and upwards were unworthy of my time or my employ. But perhaps they saw, even unconsciously, what I did not. That all we truly need in this life is something to do, something to love and something to hope for. Demand nothing more and perhaps happiness can be yours. I don't think happiness lies on top of a mountain but maybe the conditions for it do. Yet even as I feel these things in my heart my head cannot permit the naive yearning to fully take over. Every person casts a shadow and in that shadow lies the seeds of someone's undoing, theirs or other peoples. What we create we destroy, an ancient and endless cycle. So, while I dream of lying on my back in a meadow bespeckled by a hundred colours of wildflower as a warm breeze caresses the tall grass and I gaze up at a perfect blue sky broken only by a few fluffy clouds of a pristine porcelain, I can feel the heat of the raging fire tearing across the field consuming all in its rampant desire to exist and proliferate.I dream of a simple house with creaky wooden floors and a vast fireplace scented with woodsmoke. Where the windows open wide in summers that aren't too hot and close tightly in winters not too bitter. Where vegetables grow in the garden and ripe fruit burdens the trees. A place where every person's needs are few but satisfied, where intolerance is not tolerated and all live by the mantra of 'do no harm'. If I ever find such a place I shall have to set it ablaze. Because it will be a dream.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4591912235080250452","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/4591912235080250452/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4591912235080250452","updated":{"end_time":"2012/12/23 03:51:02 -0500","original":"2012-12-23T19:51:01.887+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/12/23 03:51:01 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-72.585475,-13.1948797],[-72.506511,-13.1948797],[-72.506511,-13.1330337],[-72.585475,-13.1330337],[-72.585475,-13.1948797]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/rising-damp.html","title":"Rising damp","published":{"end_time":"2012/03/01 09:49:00 -0500","original":"2012-03-02T01:48:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/03/01 09:48:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/rising-damp.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wwvkp3t","description":"Day 92 - CuzcoAfter a dinner of chicken, rice and marmalade, a night's sleep made possible by barbiturates, a breakfast of dry crackers and 25 hours of solid bus travel we had arrived in the Inca heartland. If there are two things that Cuzco has in abundance it is tourists and rain. They pour into and onto the city daily, though given that it was low season there was fewer of the former and rather more of the latter. Ankle-deep torrents ran down the cobbled streets and cars drove great bow-waves over pedestrians and open shopfronts alike. Despite that and the heavy foreign presence,  of which we were hardly in a position to complain about, the place was a pretty, pleasant place to spend a couple of days. I declined the chance to have my picture taken with an alpaca (similar to a llama) for 5 Peruvian soles and instead elected to pay an extra 5 to have one slapped between a couple of pieces of bread with fries on the side, tasty.  We also enjoyed some admirably authentic fish and chips and took in an Irish pub which, at 3300 metres, claims to be the world's highest.But neither food not drink had drawn us to Cuzco, instead its proximity to one of the wonders of this planet gave the place its magnetic pull. We were aiming higher still.<a>Truly</a> the bus journey of the trip so far. The road wound up and between snow-capped peaks, moss crawled over rocks and waterfalls gushed from every crevice. Fir trees punctuated slopes dominated by short, hardy grasses. If I could compare it to anything it would be the Scottish Highlands, it was scenery you could not tear your eyes away from.  Patchwork fields in the foothills had given way to this wet, inhospitable land shivering in the clouds. And yet still humans had pushed roads through steep mountain sides, still basic dwellings scattered the altitudinous plains. I have never before seen water gush with such angry ferocity as it carved its way to the ocean far away. Heavy with silt the rivers bucked and spat over their stony beds. Frugality drove us along this circuitous route through valley and over sharp promontory, via bus, car and train to a little town called Agua Calientes sat in the shadow of a human endeavour that puts the aforementioned modern engineering to shame.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2220641354468255856","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2220641354468255856/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2220641354468255856","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:35:00 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:34:59.932+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:34:59 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-72.0511862,-13.5867535],[-71.8932582,-13.5867535],[-71.8932582,-13.4632465],[-72.0511862,-13.4632465],[-72.0511862,-13.5867535]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/sun-sea-sand.html","title":"Sun, sea &amp; sand","published":{"end_time":"2012/02/26 18:18:00 -0500","original":"2012-02-27T10:17:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/02/26 18:17:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/03/sun-sea-sand.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x3rtov6","description":"Day 89 - HuanchacoThe sun turned a searing red as it began to dip below the horizon. Only a solitary tarmac strip disturbed the sandy expanses that lay to my left and to my right. The bus tracked Peru's Pacific coast until we reached the seaside town. Huanchaco was a small village home to fishermen and little else until surfers discovered its breaks. We too sought a break, though one from the vast distances we had to cover through South America's third largest country. The day after our arrival brought an undeserved defeat in the rugby, the day after that an undeserved victory in the football. At this point we broke our week-long alcohol fast. Michael's was done under medical advice, mine self-imposed after 3 months of daily imbibing. We stayed in a hostel called 'Chillout' which was run by a Scots fellow called Will who supplied fine Pisco Sours while decrying the state of the motherland. Back into the desert we plunged, passing hills of silicated sterility and beaches of splendid inaccessibility. The landscape was slightly more diverting than the onboard entertainment which consisted of 3 films, back to back, on the subject of football (a most unfilmworthy subject in general). We were headed for Francisco Pizarro's 'City of Kings', home to 8 million people and with a name a bit like a green citrus fruit. One in three people in Peru call Lima their home so it couldn't be without its appeals, pollution-choked and carhorn-soundtracked though they were. The relative strength of the country's economy and partial immunity to worldly financial woes have rendered it a surprisingly costly country to travel through, no dollar beers here. Shopping for a replacement camera turned up some eye-watering prices you'd baulk at back home. It took 1 mall, 3 stores, 12 stalls and (roughly) 7 hours to find one at an acceptable price. We toasted the success with (to Michael's ecstasy) pints of cider in an English pub we found in the Miraflores area of the capital. Miraflores - mark that name. \"Um, shouldn't we have turned off back there?\" \"Or there?\" \"Or here perhaps?\" The taxi driver and I were speeding along Lima's main thoroughfare but even my, admittedly wonky, sense of direction was telling me something was amiss. 3 hours previously...\"So you'll be back at the bus station at 3:15 won't you?\" I sensed that even an emphatic answer of \"yes\" would not allay Michael's palpable apprehensions. So I replied \"probably\" and trotted off to survey Lima's historical sites. I toured the cool chapels of the cathedral containing the founder's tomb and photographed the baroque stylings of the Monasterio de San Francisco. I saw General San Martin astride his horse in the plaza bearing his name and chuckled at the statue of Madre Patria who, owing to a linguistic mixup due to the fact that the Spanish word for 'flame' is 'llama', rather than a burning crown placed atop her head wore instead...well you can probably guess. As I was about to make my way back a pleasant chap called Pedro engaged me in conversation. The formalities of names over with he announced that he was gay and would like to go for a drink. Alas, I replied, I have to be at Flores Bus Station in 20 minutes and so must take a raincheck. Disappointed though he must have been Pedro kindly hailed me a cab and gave the driver my intended destination.15 minutes later...\"No Señor, Miraflores es thisa way.\" He was driving me to the opposite side of Lima. With my destination clarified I implored in broken Spanish \"Flores!, rapido! rapido!\" I must credit the dangerous tenacity with which he got me to the station in time and felt obliged to tip, though the amusement he got from the confusion was perhaps compensation enough.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5466731364406722012","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/5466731364406722012/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5466731364406722012","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:34:11 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:34:10.590+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:34:10 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-79.1597598,-8.1128309],[-79.0807958,-8.1128309],[-79.0807958,-8.0499469],[-79.1597598,-8.0499469],[-79.1597598,-8.1128309]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/beyond-pail.html","title":"Beyond the pail","published":{"end_time":"2012/02/19 12:30:00 -0500","original":"2012-02-20T04:29:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/02/19 12:29:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/beyond-pail.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x3ge5my","description":"Day 82 - CuencaIs it evolution that has given us the ability to internalise actions? That allows our conscious mind to leave the basic physics of any act to unconscious reflex while it wanders elsewhere? That sees the complexities of something like driving a car as nothing more than learned response? The subconscious takes over the familiar and rules routine. So it can be with travel. An autopilot takes control and the 'why?' of it slips almost as far back in the mind as the 'how?' Vision narrows and sees only the road. A whole country could be passed in this way and all memory will recount is \"I was there\". How quickly I forget the drudge of the past, how quickly our scale of what makes us happy and what makes us sad adapts to new realities. But then I believe there is no happiness without sadness, we need light as we need shade, we can detect only contrast. Sometimes life assumes the beauty of a symphony with its four movements of birth, youth, adulthood and death. Sometimes the notes strike a jarring clash, sometimes they transcend the mechanics of quaver and line and combine in resonating beauty, utter purity of being. Sometimes life is more and sometimes it is less than the sum of its parts. Sometimes life is beauty and sometimes it is grime. But for all that I tell myself now that senses must be shaken, look again at where you are and appreciate anew. Do not see only through the lens of a camera and do not feel only through the pages of a thesaurus. No moment ever comes twice be it fair or foul, open your eyes.  We were about to begin a week's abstinence from alcohol, Michael's enforced, mine voluntary, and the bar could serve no booze. Sunday prohibition was far from ideal so we retreated to the hotel with a few cartons of wine served through a hole in the wall to toast our last night of insobriety. If Cuenca was a dry city on Sunday it was a wet city on Monday. Their version of Carnaval was less pageant and parade, more giant water fight. A fight we resoundingly lost, two ambling tourists were fodder indeed. You encountered people with water pistols (if you were lucky), people with water bombs (if you were unlucky) and people with buckets (if it really wasn't your day). It wasn't my day. The threat was everywhere, passersby, balconies above and drive-by soakings from the back of pickup trucks. It went a long way to explaining the unusually heavy police presence for such a sleepy town that we had noticed the night before. They certainly weren't there for the protection of unwitting foreigners though. I got hit again and again and how I burned inside at the feeling of victimisation. Oh how the curmudgeon grows within me! Michael's dry sympathy helped, or at least it would have done had there been any. We spent a night in Macará on Ecuador's southern border, a place with all the utilitarian charm we had come to expect from these towns. The morning would see us cross into Peru, land of bizarre desert shapes and cities in the sky.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4290737731477944426","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/4290737731477944426/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4290737731477944426","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:33:02 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:33:01.900+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:33:01 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-80.2467608,-3.9148865],[-77.7199058,-3.9148865],[-77.7199058,-1.8851135],[-80.2467608,-1.8851135],[-80.2467608,-3.9148865]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/somethings-lost-something-found.html","title":"Somethings lost","published":{"end_time":"2012/02/13 17:00:00 -0500","original":"2012-02-14T08:00:00.000+11:00","granularity":"hour","time":"2012/02/13 16:00:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/somethings-lost-something-found.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x23x3uf","description":"Day 76 - QuitoAs an dance track from my youth had it \"Ecuador!\" After a day spent in Otavalo and its renowned market, where I picked up a Panama hat for a song, we had hit the capital. Long days of travelling had left tempers frayed but a couple of days of rest and an over-the-counter culture had restored moods to normal working order. Quito is a slender city pushed to elongate by surrounding mountains. It seems the planning policy employed by the Spaniards who founded these places was \"is the site near a mountain, if so build. Better yet find a volcano.\" You know you're at altitude when a short flight of stairs leaves you bereft of breath and at nearly 10,000 feet above sea level Quito certainly had altitude. I hadn't realised that on stepping off the bus I was planting my foot for the first time on Southern hemisphere soil. There were no markers on the road to Quito still less a giant band ringing the earth's waist so my straddling-both-hemispheres photo will have to wait for now. Ah churches, what European city break would be compete without visiting at least 17 of them? A chore as a child, an attraction as an adult whichever side of the divine divide you fall on. Their architecture, their history and their symbolism all appeal to me but then I have read The da Vinci Code so maybe my imagination has something to answer for too. From the South American staple 'San Francisco' to the gilded excess of La Compania de Jesus, Quito is replete. We played an amusing game of cat and mouse (or priest and choirboy) in La Compania due to a rule banning photography, a rule we ignored religiously. The opposing team were quite good at 'catch the click' which resulted in several admonishments. Alas, another red mark on my heaven vs hell balance sheet. God is vengeful so I'm told and I fear he may have exacted his retribution as you shall later read. The old part of the capital in which we stayed, while busy with religious buildings, was not the epicentre of nightlife. We did find an attractive little cobbled alley dotted with bars and restaurants and reminiscent of Prague but it wound down at far too early an hour. The alternative, we discovered, was the livelier new town and some quite horrendous drinks prices,  $50 wouldn't have even given a wobble.  Nonetheless we salvaged some fun playing 'spot-the-men-getting-no-sex-tonight' at the fried chicken joint where we ate dinner,  it was Valentine's day. After a couple of lazy days attending to the admin of travel it was time to leave a city for whom a certain amount of affection had grown. An affection only a little diminished by a bitter aftertaste. Guayaquil is Ecuador's largest city and would be our next stop for no particular reason other than the fact we needed a next stop. It must have been a popular day to go to Guayaquil as the buses were booked up until 3pm so we had several hours to kill. And so it was that we found ourselves in that international stalwart, McDonalds. And so it was I found myself looking down ay the space on the floor that my courier bag once occupied. Amused confusion swiftly became knotted consternation and then desperate anguish as the reality of the situation made itself felt. The Security Guard couldn't have been more ineffective if he'd been dressed as Ronald McDonald and had a water pistol strapped to his belt rather than a revolver. He calmly waved away my pleas for help with pure indifference. Why the place chooses to employ him and not security cameras defies reason. The police took a report though it was largely typed up by a helpful lady who happened to be at the station with a stolen credit card issue and whose Spanish was better than mine and whose English was better than the officer's. It was all a formality in any case, I don't expect to see any of those possessions again. One must be pragmatic and acknowledge that although travel has taken things from me I'll never get back it has also given me things I'll never lose. Hope you got your pictures God.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3649882590774626013","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3649882590774626013/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3649882590774626013","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:31:17 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:31:16.524+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:31:16 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-78.6706055,-0.3501795],[-78.3547485,-0.3501795],[-78.3547485,-0.0961225],[-78.6706055,-0.0961225],[-78.6706055,-0.3501795]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/28-buses-later.html","title":"28 buses later","published":{"end_time":"2012/02/08 14:53:00 -0500","original":"2012-02-09T06:52:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/02/08 14:52:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/28-buses-later.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wrfl32e","description":"Day 71 - San AgustínIt was late on the 70th day that we arrived at this little town in the hills. Our first of five buses that day had an electronic speedometer fitted in view of and presumably for the benefit of the passengers. The fact that it only had space for two digits when the driver could easily have put three to good use was concerning indeed. We tempered our fear as we careered along jinking roads with the knowledge that at least we were making good time. If there are any maxims of foreign travel then 'don't sit at the back of a minibus' should be one. It was a rule we had repeatedly failed to abide and again we rued while bring thrown violently over bumps and down potholes with nary a dab on the brakes. To distract from the spine realigning ride Michael quizzed me on my Spanish. Nouns, adjectives and the linguistic lesions that are irregular verbs until my brain could contort itself no longer. \"¿Hola?\", \"¿Hola?\" our greetings met no reply. There was eery quiet but for distant music and the sound of our taxi driving back to the town below. The place was not so much a hotel as a collection of cabins perched high above the Rio Magdalena but if it was a ship it would be the Mary Celeste. Michael bravely volunteered to mind the bags while I ventured down dark, foliage covered pathways armed only with a fading torch. I emerged into a rain-sodden clearing and with the wet earth squelching underneath my feet I walked toward the two storey structure sat squarely in the centre. \"¿Hola?\", \"¿Hola? music blared from above and my cries were drowned. I walked on past and toward a wooden fence and building beyond it. Soft, loamy soil enveloped my feet to the ankles and helped to persuade that this was not the way. I tried another forbidding path. \"¿Hola?\", \"¡Hola!\",  at last a survivor of whatever horrible tragedy had befallen this place, of whatever virulent disease had swept through its inhabitants. She disappeared off only to return with the owners who were very much alive and well.  Clemenza was of a delightfully hippyish inclination and gave us a tour of the grounds while her husband busied himself with a joint. We smelt the Jasmine next to the open air shower, drank lemongrass tea and looked across the valley at distant volcanoes, all before we'd even checked in. <a>Two</a> horses stood patiently awaiting their riders while a third carried a portly Colombian wearing a white cowboy hat. Michael's off-stated desire to mount a horse on this trip was finally being satisfied as we were introduced to our steeds and trotted off down the road. We both jockeyed (see what I did there?) To lead the posse each urging his horse into as fast a canter as his nerve would stand. Slowing to allow our horses to regain breath we passed plantations thick with sugarcane and fields of coffee bush dotted with red berries. The products of both might soon be in your morning cup on the other side of the world. I like horses, they are rather majestic animals. They might be costlier to run than a car but they have more personality and are a good excuse to wear a hat. We were disappointed not to be supplied with Stetsons but were at least unencumbered by helmets though Michael still hankered for chaps. Apart from the occasional nuisance of having to look at archaeological sites it was a most enjoyable morning in the hills. Colombia makes England look as if an iron had been taken to it. You need only look from the window of an intercity bus to see its tectonic shifts. The landscape doesn't just catch the eye, it engulfs it, steepling ridges rear like giant jaws trying to swallow the sky. However the broken bus curse had struck again and I stood in the sun in some nowhere town, sticky from the lime juice Clemenza had prescribed to treat my insect bites. At last our inevitably smaller, predictably less comfortable replacement bus turned up and we were back on the road again through trees clinging to sheer slopes and shrouded in mist. We alighted at Popayan, a town in the colonial style (bit of a favourite round here) whose sights include a clock on the main plaza manufactured in Croydon and...did I mention the clock? At least there was the distraction of England's game against Italy which, via a bit of jiggery-pokery, I managed to stream via iPlayer and the Atlantic Ocean. The audience for this game increased by 50% with the addition of a Welshman, though one suspects he was an honorary Italian that day. The evening was spent at a funfair on rides whose maintenance records we couldn't help but question. As we looped the loop Michael emitted noises that I had never before heard. Colombia was nearly done but it had not left the indelible mark on me that I somehow expected. Whose shortcoming was that? Time may tell.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8197417037455591569","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8197417037455591569/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8197417037455591569","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:30:21 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:30:20.597+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:30:20 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-76.9150473,1.392169],[-75.6516193,1.392169],[-75.6516193,2.407831],[-76.9150473,2.407831],[-76.9150473,1.392169]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/warning-contains-goats.html","title":"Warning: contains goats","published":{"end_time":"2012/02/06 14:06:00 -0500","original":"2012-02-07T06:05:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/02/06 14:05:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/warning-contains-goats.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x6m69mg","description":"Day 69 - Desierto de la TatacoaThe road forked. One way lay the city of Cali, population: 2.5 million. The other way lay the Tatacoa Desert, population: goats. Which way to go? The town of Villa Vieja lay on the fringes of the desert's sparse expanse. It is a town were nothing much happens and nobody seems to have anything much to do or at least not with any urgency, mañana indeed. A chicken bus replete with actual chickens dropped us in the main plaza. Shaded from the beating sun, old men ruminated in small groups while schoolgirls giggled in green gingham. A 'mototaxi', something akin to a cage welded to a moped, would take us the rest of the way. The first sign of our desiccated destination was a cactus sat incongruously among the trees. Trees that gradually turned to stunted shrubs above grass that straggled and yellowed. The landscape opened up before us as rocky dunes took the place of flat pasture. Life seemed absent save for wandering cows and the ubiquitous goats. Estadero de Los Hoyos would be our oasis in the wilderness. We wandered lonely as the white clouds above, away from its squat concrete structures and down a dirt track winding further into the desert's interior. Unmolested by human presence save our own everything was silent and still. It was a place where a man could lose himself in solitude, could allow the din of life to quietly subside, could find a kind of peace. The sky seemed bigger and bluer out there, a deity to the two tiny dots that walked beneath it. We returned for a lunch interrupted by the voracious antics of a goat whose inquisitive hunger so typified his species. He enthusiastically supped beer from Michael's proffered cup and though my offer of hot sauce induced a sneezing fit I doubt it will curb his culinary adventures in the future. For his finale he abandoned all social decorum and surmounted the table itself in search of what lunch scraps he could find. As night fell over the Tatacoa and the horizon streaked purple and orange we set off again, this time in search of a restaurant for dinner. After 45 minutes of fruitless stumbling and having admitted to ourselves we had little (read: no) idea of the distance to our destination the inevitable retreat began. Our return was rewarded with a sumptuous dinner of rice and spaghetti flavoured with small chunks of what we feared was our four-legged friend from earlier. With little in the way of passing traffic the desert was never going to be the easiest pace to hail a cab. Come the morning and feeling like a latter-day Livingstone and Stanley, Hillary and Norgay, Scott and Oates we resolved to escape the desert on foot. The two of us plodded a metronomic pace through undulating sandstone watched by distant peaks. A carpet of green began to spread across the land and the sky closed in to hug our perspective. Butterflies danced in the verges - black, white, red-dotted and swallow-tailed. Life returned as birds warbled to each other in the now proud trees. Everything in Villa Vieja was just as we'd left it as though time had stood still, time for another bus, time for another place.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8700941064140253086","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8700941064140253086/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8700941064140253086","updated":{"end_time":"2012/12/23 03:47:30 -0500","original":"2012-12-23T19:47:29.525+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/12/23 03:47:29 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-75.3240685,3.106763],[-75.0082115,3.106763],[-75.0082115,3.360417],[-75.3240685,3.360417],[-75.3240685,3.106763]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/guerrillas-in-mist.html","title":"Guerrillas in the mist","published":{"end_time":"2012/01/29 13:30:00 -0500","original":"2012-01-30T05:29:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/01/29 13:29:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/guerrillas-in-mist.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wz12gfm","description":"Day 61 - Cartagena Time passed slowly as the two travelers sat in an office squirrelled away in Tocumen International Airport. How slowly I cannot tell you for even the digital clock mounted on the plain white wall had stopped. Flight departure time was 30 minutes away but the battle to leave Panama still raged. Eventually our gratefull hands clutched a sheet of incomprehensible words and numbers meant to speed us to the next continent. Our reluctant hands abandoned our luggage to an airport worker whose assurances that they would meet us in Colombia were not entirely reassuring. Cartagena, famed haunt of pirates and privateers and redolent of the age of sail, lay before us. Despite several centuries some things haven't changed, it remains a busy port, services still exist for sailors long at sea. The latter point was illustrated most vividly as we stepped into, and i'll abandon euphemism here, a brothel. However unequivocal we might have thought our request of 'discoteque' was to the taxi driver clearly something was lost in translation. That or western males have acquired a louche reputation and penchant for the aforementioned euphemism. We drank one awkward beer and made our excuses. The next place was different, different in that it was at least ostensibly a bar albeit one heavily populated by women of an identical occupation. I debated with one over who had more right to the cubicle in the men's toilet before joining a couple of Colombians for a little innocent window shopping. The following evening we spent in the genteel environs of Downton Abbey, somewhat contrasting our brush with ill-repute.Bogota, the name has become shorthand for South American violence of the drug-indiced kind. But it is a reputation the city is eschewing with the Uribe government's crackdown on the cartels. Still, as a newspaper headline once had it \"War on drugs - drugs win\". Tell an impoverished coca farmer that the eradication of his crop is for the benefit of an affluent soceity far from his and one has to wonder how much worse legal control could be? Nonetheless living standards in the capital would seem to be 'en la ariba' with the, admittedly fine, surroundings of the Bogota Beer Company parting us from $5 for every cerveza. Even the backpacker area in which we stayed had little of the scruffy value that we must seek. Perhaps Bogota isn't suited to parsimonious pass-throughs and rewards those with a longer stay and deeper pockets. Perhaps we didn't look hard enough. If we missed anything in Bogota at least it wasn't the start of the Six Nations. Colombia isn't overpopulated with rugby fans given that myself and Michael formed roughly 100% of the audience in the Irish bar. Still it's nice (if not unexpected) to beat the Scots whatever the location. Leaving soggy Bogota swathed in rain was an appropriate contrast to the place where we had next set our sights.

Cruel fortune had us standing in the queue for the only Panamanian border officer who had read and decided to adhere to the rules. \"Return ticket?\" bugger.  His steely, uncompassionate gaze was unmoved by our desperate explanations of our travel 'plans'. Bribery also failed to move him to endorse our entry so our bus driver, with infinite generosity, offered to relieve us of another $36 to write up a return ticket to San José that we would never use. This finally satisfied the entry requirements and the stamp thumped down. The country is divided by a synonymous strip of water down which floats a not insignificant quantity of the world's goods. Though our initial plan was to dive the canal, renovations kiboshed that idea and we had to settle for the traditional topside view.  On initial viewing the city itself seems built on the wealth its transoceanic connection brings.  Buildings soared to heights unknown since we left New York nearly 2 months ago, the skyline that of a modern metropolis.  The skyscrapers loom across the bay from the colonial ramshackle of the old town.  Though much of it lies in ruins due to several foreign incursions it retains that familiar charm of the old new world. Would that Birmingham had half the aesthetic of these places. I strolled its cobbled alleys alone, an absence of directional sense meaning every direction was the right one. Time passed and I found myself on a wooded hill to the north watching small deer frolic and a preoccupied armadillo snuffle though the leaf litter, silence soothed my ears and calmed my thoughts. It is an abused and ill-appreciated commodity these days. A short walk took me past the port with its Lego brick mountains of shipping containers and into a residential area populated almost entirely by men clad head to foot in white looking like they'd just stepped off the set of 'An Officer and a Gentleman'. As I headed back toward the old town I passed into an area best described by a resident that accosted me as a 'red zone'. It wasn't the best kept part of the city admittedly but his warnings of impending robbery and doom seemed a touch melodramatic.  I thanked him courteously for his advice and walked on. A policeman I encountered ten minutes later was more assertive with his advice and near threw me in a taxi. There ended my walk. Pre-trip research had failed to throw up the alarming fact that Central and South America are entirely unconnected by road. Between them lies a vast forested area called The Darien. Home to deadly snakes, exotic diseases, guerrillas and drug traffickers it isn't exactly prime hiking territory either. If we thought getting into Panama was tricky it was as nothing to the saga of our departure. In our attempts to avoid an expensive and unbackpackery (it's a word, Mike told me) international flight I plotted a convoluted series of hops down Panama's Atlantic coast and over the water into Colombia. Involving a (cheap) plane, some boats, a bus or two and (probably) a donkey.  Alas the crucial flying portion of the jaunt was booked up for a week so we were back to square one. Square too were my eyes after hours straight at the laptop.  After near enough a day it was apparent the only way we were getting out of this country was via some pricey plane tickets.  Having negotiated Avianca Airlines labyrinthine purchasing process at perhaps the tenth attempt, I clicked the button marked 'buy'. Card blocked. An eye-wateringly expensive call to Natwest put me through to a guy whose security check was comprehensive and, I suspect not a little arbitrary. I should have asked if he moonlighted as a border control officer.  Card cleared I returned to the fray. The transaction went through, this time tomorrow we would be in Colombia! I checked my emails, confirmation was there.  I quickly checked the details of the long awaited document:Panama City to Cartagena <b>check</b>Sunday 30th January <b>check</b>Passenger(s)1, Mr Benjamin Welsher <b>check</b>2, Mr Benjamin Welsher <b>expletive</b>Now of course such an elementary detail cannot be changed just like that. No sir, you'll need to rebook the tickets. Again I started a process as familiar to me now as breathing. This time, this was the time, all details double checked, all security checks hurdled but one, the little blue loading icon turns its interminable circles. \"This website cannot be accessed.\"At this point I shot myself in the head.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7681949283730398409","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/7681949283730398409/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7681949283730398409","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:26:34 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:26:33.869+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:26:33 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-79.6767205,8.8688014],[-79.3608635,8.8688014],[-79.3608635,9.1197364],[-79.6767205,9.1197364],[-79.6767205,8.8688014]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/lmfao.html","title":"LMFAO","published":{"end_time":"2012/01/16 21:41:00 -0500","original":"2012-01-17T13:40:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/01/16 21:40:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/02/lmfao.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x1wy7dr","description":"Day 48 - San JoséThree cold people stood on the streets of the Costa Rican capital wondering why the temperature dropped the further south they travelled. We needed housing and chose our hostel based solely on the fact it had a stripper pole. Before that could be put to embarrassingly enthusiastic use we had some people to meet. Our group doubled in size with the addition of Chris, Cass and Thierry, Tania's friends from the icy wastes of home. The only drinking establishment we had experienced in SJ thus far was one where the owner kept a pistol in the till and served turtle eggs as bar snacks, I kid you not. I was confident we could do better and how I willed these weary Canadians toward drink and dance. Alas 'twas not to be that night but I would get these people into a discotheque by hook or by crook, I think they sell hooks at the market... Softening the blow they did bring gifts of cider and Frank's hot sauce - truly the greatest condiment fashioned by the hand of man, not a food conceived it doesn't improve. Another day, another volcano. This one, towering over the little town of Fortuna, we would not be climbing owing to the fact it is the country's most active and people have made a habit of dying on its slopes. We didn't drag our battered corps north for nothing though, other attractions were aboot. After a fruitless search for frugality we conceded to paying (for) a visit to a waterfall. Either I am too used to swimming in the sea or a skinful of alcohol the night before makes you negatively buoyant. Keeping my head above its cold, plunging waters was no easy task. Something a little tamer perhaps? Our next stop was definitely more therapeutic. Water gushes warm from springs heated by the volcanoe's molten brood. Hours passed as we luxuriated in the temperate stream letting the powerful flow knead our every worn muscle, hard business perpetual leisure. I heard it said recently that if you are struggling to make a decision flip a coin and as it is in the air you'll know which side you want it to come down on. So as the faded gold colone turned end over end, tails we dive/heads we head, did myself and Michael know our desired result? I suspect so, we just wanted to blame the coin for spending all our money. So chance had decided we were Pacific-bound.I turned back and peered through the murk to see no-one behind me, ahead fins disappeared into gloom, now I was alone in the water. Somewhere in the channel our group had broken apart, were the others lost or was I? Coalescing again and despite the poor visibility lobster, eels, starfish and seahorses were spotted. Stingray and pufferfish were seen too and, at the very end and to my delight, I saw my first turtle. Back on the surface Devil Rays leapt above the waves and my logbook hit double figures. Crystal Utila it wasn't but to novices every dive is worthy experience and how fine to dive with new friends. Soon we would have to part ways but an open invitation to Montreal was proffered and is one I should very much like to take up. I'd better practise my shuffle eh?","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6924949190125057511","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/6924949190125057511/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6924949190125057511","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:25:35 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:25:34.390+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:25:34 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-84.1622973,9.8707708],[-84.0043693,9.8707708],[-84.0043693,9.9958958],[-84.1622973,9.9958958],[-84.1622973,9.8707708]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/day-46-isla-omotepethe-island-is-formed.html","title":"Welcome to the jungle","published":{"end_time":"2012/01/14 19:53:00 -0500","original":"2012-01-15T11:52:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/01/14 19:52:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/day-46-isla-omotepethe-island-is-formed.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x0qg6zw","description":"Day 46 - Isla Omotepe The island is formed by two volcanoes (one still active). Surrounded by a lake whose limits spill over the horizon in all directions. A worthy lair for a scheming Bond villain bent on world domination. The highlight of the first evening was a somewhat basic discotequa you could drive your motorcycle into, whose menu  consisted of beer, whose gent's consisted of a wall. All good fun, all rather tame. In the spirit of the trip thus far the next day was spent quad biking around the island. The danger came from the roads whose condition could only only have been worsened by the addition of landmines. Like the gents we are Tania was lumbered with the fully manual beast while myself and Michael scooted along with clutchless ease. Well, until Michael decided to detour into a nearby set of bushes, terrible driver. Surfaces improved markedly near towns and oh how the locals must have loved us bombing up and down with scant regard for the speed limit, bloody gringos. Tania and I swam in rejuvenating volcanic springs before leaving Omotepe though no amount of relaxation would be enough to soothe the ten hour overnight boatride ahead. I must learn to scale my expectations because sitting out on an exposed deck, sleepless, shivered by cold and whipped by wind and spray did not meet them. Though we were trailed by gulls and topped by stars we had vastly miscalculated the amount of rum necessary to make this journey pleasant. I stood next to an engine vent spewing lord knows what noxious gases before the induced headache got too much and I had to sacrifice the warmth provided for the sake of my health. Not for the first time this trip it's an experience I'll look back on with fond amusement and absolutely no desire to repeat. Our next boat trip mere hours later was of a wholly different character.The long, slender boat meandered slowly up the murky river. Thick jungle swamped the banks, an impenetrable thicket of choking vine and soaring palm. Fecund life in all its verdant glory. The brown water gave no clue of what lay below the gently stirring surface, logs broke through bringing imaginings of reptiles. The vessel's occupants snapped their heads left and right as primitive howls cut through the foliage, a warning? Black shapes moved high in the branches, dark eyes surveying the intruders. Birds of all colours skimmed the water's surface while turtles sunned themselves on the sun-baked shore. It seemed strange to conceive that nature could be so busy in man's absence, our homo-centric view as strong as ever. The old question of the silently falling tree sprung to the traveler's mind. This was how we entered Costa Rica, in a Conradian Heart-of-Darkness style (with a little license). But the country was no Congo, indeed its developed urbanity would quite exceed that we had seen before.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5063530795811032337","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/5063530795811032337/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5063530795811032337","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:24:13 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:24:12.088+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:24:12 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-85.6622973,11.4377605],[-85.5043693,11.4377605],[-85.5043693,11.5622395],[-85.6622973,11.5622395],[-85.6622973,11.4377605]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/but-its-shaped-like-pyramid.html","title":"But it's shaped like a pyramid!!","published":{"end_time":"2012/01/05 19:34:00 -0500","original":"2012-01-06T11:33:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/01/05 19:33:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/but-its-shaped-like-pyramid.html#comment-form","id":"abf03wsx77vl","description":"Day 37 - Managua The sun was barely up but there is never a better time to leave the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa than that very instant. Short on sights, long on vice and violence, myself, Michael and, Tony had become Tania (ah, travel's unpredictability!) barely strayed from our hotel the previous night. The bus deposited us at the border from where the crossing had to be made by bicycle rickshaw, a strange and amusing experience. Queerer still Nicaraguan immigration refused to accept its own currency in payment of the entry fee. I suspect there is an ongoing competition between the border control agencies of Central Americans countries to devise the most convoluted and quirky entry procedure they can. Nicaragua is leading on points by my scorecard. We stayed a night in the Managuan metropolis and sampled the city's delights such as people smashing each other over the head with motorcycle helmets outside karaoke bars. I tried in vain to induce my fellows into a discotequa shaped like a Mayan Pyramid but Michael was having one of his (worryingly frequent) off nights and couldn't be cajoled. I drowned my sorrows with the help of our new friend Rony Fresca.Another day, another bus, This one departed the sprawl of the capital for the crumbling colonial charm of Granada. Its time-worn stone edifices were a reminder of Antigua's pretty pastel perpendicularity. I don't generally care for cities set to a grid pattern. The brutal logic of line and and square lacks life and has none of the organic meander that connects it to its inhabitants. Somehow the coldly efficient layout seems to amplify the meaningless swarming of humanity. These Spanish time capsules retain a faded elegance though, the ambience of a world half a millenia past. Broad streets and broader ambitions, high ceilings and high-minded ideals. Are these places the ugly stamp of imperial imposition or valuable architectural reminders of our inexhaustible folly? Perhaps they are brick and stone. \"No hablo español\" was becoming a worn phrase and the decision was made that a week's intensive Spanish at a Granadan language school was just the ticket, surely fluency would follow? Tania's impeccable linguistic skills had also made us lazy and rather than pointing at the things we wanted we had simply taken to pointing at her. But she would be flying to the Corn Islands in search of Hammerhead Sharks so somehow we had to cope without our Canadian crutch. Michael bid farewell in his inimitable style by belting out Bryan Adams in Cindy's Karaoke Bar. It assuaged his promise to dance on a table (if only temporarily). Our classes began at 8AM each day which rather curtailed our exploration of the city's nightlife. Or rather it should have. It fairness after one post-session-lesson we swiftly realised that multitudinous beers (in my case) and several strawberry daiquiris (in Michael's) did not aid our learning. A week in Granada also allowed time to fit in my traditional visit to the medical services. A very black, suspiciously thick hair had begun to protrude from the bottom of my leg. Dr.Welsher's own attempts at extraction yielded nothing but a discomforting amount of pain (I doubted his qualifications). Its tenacious grip confirming that it was a remnant stitch. I don't think I've had an operation yet where one wasn't left behind by the surgeon,as if for luck. So, laid out in a doctor's office again he closely mirrored my technique with the important difference that he pulled until I was silently howling and until the damnable thing finally snapped.Tania, having had her own (predictably unique) limb issues was back after sadly little diving (she got her shark though) and with our lessons finished and Spanish slightly less non-existent than before, travel beckoned.  Next stop - 2 volcanoes and a bloody big lake.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/322779602662157683","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/322779602662157683/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/322779602662157683","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:07:15 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:07:14.328+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:07:14 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-86.5672459,11.8880099],[-85.9355319,11.8880099],[-85.9355319,12.3847679],[-86.5672459,12.3847679],[-86.5672459,11.8880099]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/rapid-improvement-required.html","title":"Rapid improvement required","published":{"end_time":"2012/01/03 18:54:00 -0500","original":"2012-01-04T10:53:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/01/03 18:53:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/rapid-improvement-required.html#comment-form","id":"abf03x9hbljf","description":"Day 35 - El Naranjo So, the odds defied, we were back on the mainland and having clearly discovered a penchant for activities not covered by our insurance policy we meant to try our hand next at White Water Rafting. In hindsight I felt a little mis-sold by the accumulated images in my head. Lots of people grinning with excitement as they coast tearing class 5 rapids and rather fewer images of upturned inflatables and rafters swept downstream bobbing in the froth. You may be able to guess by this point which of the aforementioned scenarios more closely matches my experience. Michael had ostensibly (sensibly?) bowed out due to the fact it was raining. That left me and Tony in the raft with our Canadian instructor whose irritation with our poor technique at times bested his laid back demeanor. Alan the Irishman was our safety net in a kayak on point. The brown river surged like some Wonka-esque creation, swelled by precipitation and testing the banks. The rain pummeled down as we rehearsed rhythmic paddle strokes in a calm pool next to the Rio Cangregal (River of Crabs). Once we had gone through a range of called instructions which basically boiled down to either 'row!' or 'throw yourself into the raft!' we paddled out into the insistent flow. I was the first to go. A slightly angled entry into a series of rapids bounced the inflatable up and me out. The consequences of not paddling together were soddenly obvious. Pulled in an instant 10 metres downstream I swam against a tidal treadmill whose pace increased as my limbs quickly tired. All in a day's work for Alan and Canadian guy though. Hauled back I was instantly set to work while my lungs still burned, the river waited for no man. The next set of rapids was negotiated with luck and silent prayers. Getting to the other side still perched precariously on the unforgiving craft we were shot through with adrenalin....and relief. Our fortune was not to last however. The final stretch of furious river approached and with hearts in mouths and paddles in hand we fought the white waters and our own sorry synchronisation.  The raft bounced, yawed, pitched and....flipped. Its three occupants were unceremoniously deposited into muddy mayhem. Encumbered by paddle and a now familiar resignation I swam again for the boat. Scuba diving was mere child's play compared to this fearsome task. Reflecting afterwards on our miserable performance that ensured it was more white water swimming than white water rafting the adrenalin still coursing through my veins was no less intoxicating. Would I do it again?Yes, in a chest-splitting, lung-bursting second.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5408278366434363345","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/5408278366434363345/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5408278366434363345","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:06:26 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:06:25.747+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:06:25 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-86.7892453720703,15.6250971437027],[-86.6313173720703,15.6250971437027],[-86.6313173720703,15.7473931437027],[-86.7892453720703,15.7473931437027],[-86.7892453720703,15.6250971437027]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/day-34-utilathe-three-lies-of-utila.html","title":"A week in the life of a diver","published":{"end_time":"2012/01/02 18:09:00 -0500","original":"2012-01-03T10:08:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2012/01/02 18:08:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/day-34-utilathe-three-lies-of-utila.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xi45kcz","description":"Day 34 - UtilaThe three lies of Utila are: 1, I'm not drinking tonight 2, I love you 3, I'm leaving tomorrow The last had proved especially apposite as we stood atop a water tower on a hill overlooking a more than familiar island where a 2 day jaunt had become a residency.

Diving in the morning, night swimming at...er...night, water bookended our days and filled our thoughts. Tania attempted an escape from this amenable Alcatraz post New Year, her trip to nearby Roatan Island lasting a few hours and costing more than a few dollars. As she strode back into Alton's warmly knowing smiles greeted her. Our own planned departure early on the 3rd was thwarted by lashing storms and dangerous tides. Perhaps Poseidon himself held dominion over the place? Deciding it was now or never the two of us and Tony chartered a plane so small you could fit it into a Kinder Egg. The airport was nothing more than a concrete strip and as our little craft heaved up uncertainly into the buffeting winds I wondered if the price of escape would be our lives. Rain coated the windows and leaked through the door as our rattling rescuer fought the turbulence and skirted the foreboding clouds. The pilot affected a demeanor no more perturbed than that of a taxi driver which I chose to take as reassurance. As the three escapees walked across the tarmac and out through the airport excitement at what lay ahead was tinged with sadness at what we had left behind, at a chapter in this story that had come to an end. A chapter filled with new, otherworldly experiences that will be etched into my memory for all time. I feel the 10 days on Utila were worthy of greater poetry than hath sprung from this pen, as if only an opus could do them justice. But it was a time more than a place I was describing and time is a most ethereal thing to capture in words. We shared a first kiss that island and I.

Time we filled with large amounts of nothing, only the metronomic swing of the hammock marked its steady progress. Après-scuba indeed. Faces became familiar, familiarity became friendship. Nicola and Tania monitored our diving progress with enthusiasm, each success toasted with the clink of glass. We became part of a little community where, even if everyone did not know your name, they certainly knew your aim and common ground was reclaimed from treacherous waves. Life outside the island was fond but faded remembrance, what did we lack but the means to exist here in perpetuity? How long could a person spend in this permissive utopia where not a policeman walked the streets and resplendent stars lulled you to sleep under a haze of slumbering cloud. All writing ceased and it is only now nearly a month since arriving that I relay these experiences to paper. I feel it a disservice to those times to omit anything at all from the account and a disservice to the reader to disregard eloquent concision. Hopefully I strike a middle ground between brevity and indulgent boredom. But we were not divers yet, we had a foot in the door, a toe in the water, certification was pending however. The sea's ancient threat stood between us and our unexpected ambition. Okay so perhaps the only way you can fail the course is to drown but the six of us weren't home and dry at this point. The rigs were assembled, equipment checked and rechecked, the boat bounced by the dock like a dog eager for a walk. Our little launch's only possible water entry method was the classic backward roll. I pitched headfirst into unsighted unknown and after a somersault in the water found the surface. We spun into our rigs with increased ease and prepared to meet a bottom more than feet from our fins. Descent brought discomfort, each metre down a fresh pain to the ears. They squeaked and squabbled with the unyielding pressure outside, while I swallowed and pinched and wiggled and writhed. Eventually I dropped to 6 and 12 and the full 18 metres (54 feet for you pre-decimaliens) permitted by my basic training. The surface was near and yet unnervingly far, the sun's beams struggling through the liquid. Languorous kicks propelled us through the water, silver saucers of carbon dioxide floated upwards trailing bubbles in their wake. We swam along sheer walls teeming with life, a tangled bank of Darwin's wildest imaginings. Eagle rays flapped close over cow and drumfish. Little tetra of a blazing orange and sultry purple mixed with parrotfish of pastel while barracuda leered from dingy caves. Breathing returned to unconscious pace, a slight inhale lifting while an exhale dropped. Deeper! my adventure urged, but that is not for now. All was in control in this most improbable of places, fear's business lay elsewhere. The twists and turns of travel had thrown up no greater surprise than this. Eighteen metres of water atop our heads meant we were certainly not in our element but those to whom it did belong shared it with tranquility. We shared beer and elation on our return, all had passed, all were scuba divers. Collective spirits were soaring, our certification all the sweeter for having achieved it together. The drink slipped down like iced nectar, the sea was our oyster, our fish and our crab. Talking of a dive afterwards, the things you all saw, the things that some missed! was almost as good as the dive itself. Truly we are social animals, our pleasures shared are pleasures magnified. The girls teased us with predictions of Dive Mastery before the year's end. A little fantastical perhaps,  but only a little. I filled my logbook with every detail I could gather - air pressure, water temperatures and conditions, depths and times, sites and sights. The satisfying thud of the Dive Master's stamp an approval of our exponential progress and indisputable status. The best left turn I ever made.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8066349033316056611","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8066349033316056611/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8066349033316056611","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:05:17 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:05:16.268+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:05:16 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-86.911999,16.082944],[-86.872517,16.082944],[-86.872517,16.113456],[-86.911999,16.113456],[-86.911999,16.082944]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/surface-tension.html","title":"Surface tension","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/26 11:54:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-27T03:53:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/26 11:53:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/surface-tension.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xa1efhs","description":"Day 26 - UtilaTanks were parked along the dock, we were about to invade a land that was not ours. A crash course in theory left disjointed terms floating around our head - regulators, pressure groups, equalisation, first stage, second stage, beans, rice, fish. The aquatic life below, I imagine, surveyed these nervous, rubberised humans with weary familiarity. We were being thrown in at the shallow end but fears were nonetheless for it. Certainly strapping on 14 pounds of iron before swimming would seem counterintuitive at the least. Fins on feet I staggered to the edge like a drunken clown. Below, the sea, above, the sky, the thin sliver in between where we live our lives. Perhaps I dramatise but, with the intonation 'continuous breathing so your lungs don't explode' ringing in my soon-to-be squeezed ears, mistakes would be costly. At least there is a slight affinity with the water in my person, my amigo had no such love. From anti-aqua to nascent snorkeler and now wannabe scuba diver in only a matter of weeks is certainly not taking (water) baby steps. His would be the most challenging of journeys, goading those most compelling of fears - the ones we cannot entirely rationalise. As the cool liquid enveloped, a kick brought me to the surface and, tapping my head to signal 'ok' I congratulated myself on mastering the first skill of falling into the water. Jim bobbed to my left, Tony to my right and ahead Team Japan, a pair of affable orientals whose names I, shamefully, never got. This was our first confined water, the deep blue sea lay beyond the dock end but for now we were limited to what and where we could stand. The first task en agua was strapping into our buoyancy control device and air cylinder, easy on land, like wrestling a beach ball off it. Sinking to the bottom, we knelt muted each person no doubt wanting to scream and shout, enthuse and decry this wholly new experience. Only our eyes and the simplest of gestures could communicate our wonder and wariness. Barely time to acclimatise to our underwater existence did pass before Arjen, our instructor, had us removing masks and spitting out breathing apparatus, necessary exposure of sense-shocking rudeness. We rose and fell in the water like apples at Halloween, our buoyancy control in its primordacy. Weightlessness in water was replaced by leaden struggle as we hauled ourselves out. It had been a first step into the clear, blue unknown and while feelings were mixed there was unanimous agreement that the beer never tasted better. Indeed, as we discovered, drinking and diving are inextricably linked, at least we were plenty experienced in one of the two. The sociability of the diving world is widely noted and nobody looked upon these newbies with anything but encouragement and perhaps fond remembrance of their own certification tens or even hundreds of dives ago. Hierarchy existed, Dive Masters afforded a far greater status than open water novices but all was informal and egos did not widely abound. Persuading someone of the joy of it all, wanting them to see as you have, feel as you do may not be altruism but it's an honest service to the welfare of others. Would that we could all gasp in wonder at a world inverted.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2242299194528241783","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2242299194528241783/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2242299194528241783","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:59:30 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:59:29.689+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:59:29 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.0639038417969,15.9791643701599],[-86.7480468417969,15.9791643701599],[-86.7480468417969,16.2233093701599],[-87.0639038417969,16.2233093701599],[-87.0639038417969,15.9791643701599]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/feliz-navidad.html","title":"¡Feliz navidad!","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/23 18:02:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-24T10:01:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/23 18:01:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/feliz-navidad.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xftw8ic","description":"Day 23 - UtilaRain lashed our island paradise, the waves tossed the boat nauseatingly from left to right. Passengers doubled over the side and we questioned our judgement. It wasn't like this in the brochure so lasciviously flicked through in my head. A sodden golf cart whisked us through the weather to a striking white wooden structure jutting out into the Caribbean sea. The verbose landlady (perhaps a better term should be invented for an island hotelier) delivered a filibuster of a welcome talk while previous recipients looked on with amusement. A piece of advice she did give was to acquire supplies lest Santa enforce a shutdown the following day. In need of personal hygiene but finding deodorant priced the same as a bottle of wine it was clear that that night would be spent stinking drunk (I already have my coat on). Walking back along the main street we dodged children on quad bikes and spied building after building flying the red and white flag of scuba. On Utila a driver's license would appear optional, a diver's license compulsory. All about people lounged in hammocks trading anecdotes of underwater fauna. On an island of natural curving lines I felt like such a square. This pair of part time snorkelers had little cache in a 'dive culture' that was more than surface deep.And so it came to pass on the night before Christmas these people who lived far below the waves did entice, bribe and cajole us into their antithetical existence. Embolded by Nicaraguan rum even Michael showed little resistance to their stories of sea horses and tales of turtles. Promised life-changing experiences we promised a life-changing decision. The fact that this all took place in the strangest and most surreal place I have ever been in only added to the acquiescent euphoria. The bar gave little clue of the Carollean wonderland that lay beyond when we first ascended the stairs. After ordering a drink we were advised by the barmaid to explore out the back, adding 'don't mind the spiders, they're harmless'. I don't know precisely why I thought she was talking about some kind of joke plastic models but this view only lasted until I walked face first into a thick, glutinous web. As my eyes acclimatised to the dark surround and Michael fired up his torch, hundreds of multi legged shapes were picked out in the night. Thousands of beady little eyes stared unblinkingly back, motionless save for the lightest of breeze. The cardinal points had them to both sides and above our heads, surrounded but for a waspish trail of planks. We edged along this bridge into hell, crouched and cowed as though the Styx itself did flow beneath. The webs coalesced into one giant silken structure metres across, what chance a bug in this forest of death? Highly evolved and rational as we are a cool terror was maintained while we walked through our nightmares. The reward was a fairy tale land of rainbow spanning colour and visceral texture. Angular and smooth, swooping and straight, the senses engorged by its psychedelic beauty. We had stepped into the wardrobe, the looking glass was through. The human imagination is glorious indeed. The rest of the night passed in a sweet fog of dancing and dive talk as our new acquaintances whirled us here and there in a hedonistic rush. Morning found us be-hammocked already, watching the sun rise over the glossy sheen of our watery destiny. There would be ample opportunity for doubts later but for now it was bedtime. The time had come for us to leave the island that you never leave, to push east through Honduras to countries distant and foreign. We packed our bags for the umpteenth time and set our stride to the main street in the direction of the dock. Not ten metres had been walked before we reached the crossroads. To the left lay Alton's dive centre, straight ahead the ferry. Do we walk on to the uncertain certainty of the road or take a turn to the left and a giant stride off a short pier?","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/693673985226591460","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/693673985226591460/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/693673985226591460","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 07:02:53 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T22:02:52.618+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 07:02:52 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.239685125,15.8573088701599],[-86.607971125,15.8573088701599],[-86.607971125,16.3451648701599],[-87.239685125,16.3451648701599],[-87.239685125,15.8573088701599]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/42.html","title":"42","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/22 18:16:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-23T10:15:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/22 18:15:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/42.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xch1nwk","description":"Day 23 - San Pedro SulaChristmas was two days away and, being enamoured by the idea of spending it on the beach with lobster for dinner, we turned in the direction of the Bay Islands off the coast of northern Honduras. Figuring it was worth the extra money to guarantee our dream we dropped $50 on a 'King Quality' bus, not a chicken in sight. It should, all being well, leave us within spitting distance of the islands by nightfall. The lesson that in Central American bus travel all is never well had obviously not been learned. $50 would appear to be no guarantor of punctuality nor indeed, ironically, of quality. We were late leaving due to a faulty aircon, the fact that the bus' gear changes sounded like an elephant being hit in the face with a cricket bat indicated that the problems ran deeper. Death was pronounced at 14:02, a couple of minutes past our scheduled arrival time and still a full five hours from destination. Even the loosest of itineraries with the most generous float time can be wracked and ruined by these tardy logistics. A man in a bar once asked me 'why go?', 'why travel?'. It seemed both self-evident and yet unanswerable. I respected him for asking and gave him a reply that went something along the lines of '...finding my place in the world...', plausible yet somehow unsatisfying. Maybe I don't have the words yet to express what I already know. Maybe like in that book I already have the answer and its simply the question I am searching for. Travel can provide a great bounty of life enhancing experiences but can it fundamentally change us? Will I find a better me on the other side of the world? I suppose in a basic sense this trip is freeing me from the shackles of 'normal' life. Rousseau said 'everywhere man is in chains' but he may not have been referring to this precise situation. My father would see this as a wilful denial of reality, a vain and perhaps immature attempt to break rules as immutable as those of physics. He may well be right but he has also given me this license, both directly and indirectly, to try. The chains of the mundane are far easier to break than those of the mind however, should I succeed in the latter it would be the magnum opus of a thus far undistinguished life. If I don't, well I guess I'll have to learn to live with myself!Meanwhile, our unscheduled pitstop had caused us to have to transfer to a battered old bus that happened to be passing, a further step down in quality. Gulliver sprawled over the back seats while I calculated our ever decreasing odds of making the coast in this suffering rust bucket. As I stared out of the darkening window while we struggled up a hill a beautiful blue butterfly fluttered past. Shading, smoking, rudimentary next to such elegant simplicity was a striking juxtaposition. We eventually arrived in San Pedro Sula, Honduras' industrial capital (with all the aesthetics that implies). Our connection to the coast was long gone and the next necessitated a 4am start.  The bus terminal was also devoid of any nearby hotels which meant a 4km trip into town and additional pre-dawn complexities. Travel, you gotta love it!","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/9023012250603366429","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/9023012250603366429/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/9023012250603366429","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:56:43 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:56:42.279+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:56:42 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-88.1856685,15.379262],[-87.8698115,15.379262],[-87.8698115,15.624078],[-88.1856685,15.624078],[-88.1856685,15.379262]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/bordering-on-madness.html","title":"Bordering on madness","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/20 18:16:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-21T10:15:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/20 18:15:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/bordering-on-madness.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xkg0fss","description":"Day 21 - San SalvadorFor the sake of completeness El Salvador required a visit. It is, I am told, Central America's most densely populated country, its largest economy and yet is largely ignored by tourists. Hidden charms or a worthy swerve? We would find out. My enjoyment might be tempered by an unpleasant bout of traveler's flu though. The cough was ceaselessly unproductive while my nose streamed. My eyes stung to be open, stung to be closed. I bore it all stoically though and resisted the notion of gender-specific ailment. Our bus from Antigua was going along just fine until a large, solid bang consistent with an impact struck us. I suspect if we had actually run down an unfortunate Guatemalan pedestrian the delay would have been less than the burst tyre that actually transpired. We sweated in the dry heat as a herd of cows lumbered past in the opposite lane and the driver got to work on the wheelnuts with a blowtorch. Judging by the looks and mutterings of the locals this was not a common touristico stop-off. Soon the most cherished of sounds to a traveler, that of a bus engine spluttering life greeted our burning ears and we were back Salvador-bound. The small matter of a border crossing now lay before us and it provided perhaps the most indelible memory of this particular hop, certainly the craziest crossing of my travels. Disembarking on the Guatemalan side we were swarmed by people helpfully pointing out an office round a nearby corner where we 'needed' to get our exit stamp. My passport was half out of my hand before I realised the lunacy of following these men of ill-intent Having negotiated that chaos we climbed back aboard the bus only to be followed by, in order, a legless guy (drunk), a blind man, several money changers, innumerable food and drink vendors and a legless guy (no legs). They filled the aisle in a jostling conga of chorizo, cambio and charity requests. San Salvador was our first capital city on this trip and exemplified many in this party of the world by being big, noisy, dirty and not a little bit dangerous. Frankly its nothing to write home about.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3963059857115806496","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3963059857115806496/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3963059857115806496","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:54:42 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:54:41.168+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:54:41 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-89.3479285,13.56658],[-89.0320715,13.56658],[-89.0320715,13.81342],[-89.3479285,13.81342],[-89.3479285,13.56658]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/la-luna-negra.html","title":"La luna negra","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/16 18:23:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-17T10:22:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/16 18:22:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2012/01/la-luna-negra.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xg5u3vm","description":"Day 17 - Antigua The retrospective nature of these writings means there is a good chance you already know we made it but create an artificial suspense now if you like. Antigua was the colonial capital of all Central America until leveled by an earthquake in 1773. Siting the town between three volcanoes would seem to invite such destruction I would say. It still retains a handsome charm and, given its tourist draw, would be an ideal place to spend a few days and let the accumulated miles ease themselves from our sweaty, dirty bodies. The Danes pointed us in the direction of a hotel but rooms were hard to come by. After fruitless wanderings we took Michael's detested and feared option of a dorm. The fact that no-one shared it with us for more than one night can only be a coincidence. Antigua, in common with much of Guatemala (and I suspect, Central America), has issues with crime. Over here Security Guard is a job for life. From the guys at the bank with the sub-machine guns to the one outside the dollar store with a pump-action shotgun (certainly the weapon of choice here) there is no shortage of heat on the street. A little spot up on a nearby hill affords a fine view over the city. The book advises the company of a tourist policeman when walking to it so we didn't take one. Perhaps the robbers were on siesta, we were unmolested. The experience might also have given us a rather hubristic view of our climbing ability but more of that later. We took dinner in a delightful restaurant whose food sat temptingly in big clay pots. All along the lines of stew I struggled to follow the explanations of ingredients and simply plumped for the most appealing looking pot. One bite revealed the catastrophe of my choice. Liver. Just writing the world brings watery unease to my mouth and here I am chewing the ghastly organ. My appetite disappeared to be replaced by queasy discontent. It got so serious my taste for beer was even diminished. A memorable eating experience and probably the most expensive mouthful of food I have ever had. I think Michael has also decided he is not the unqualified fan of tongue that he professed to be, another indigestible choice. Happening on a raucous Irish pub full of Guatemalans dancing on tables was an improved course. A gringo trying the same thing took a bruising tumble off the bar. We had to return to Reilly's the following night due to the irresistible lure of a pub quiz. Our team swiftly expanded to 5 with Dale, Jessie and Justin too. And what a team it was sweeping all before it to win by a clear four and a half points. Our winning quetzals bought tequila shots for the losing teams with enough left for the victors to get throughly tired and emotional. Since my amigo usually handles the finances and had departed early the matter of an open tab rather slipped my mind before I too left. We would not be back for a third night.  Breathing hard and impatient, lungs pulling at thin air. Feet slipping and hands bleeding. Down was far, up was further. Step by torturous step we climbed the volcano. Stunning views gave no comfort to our draining labour. I am not fit, my limbs have certainly seen better days and yet I was blasé about a challenge such as this. The foothills gave no warning of the desperate exhaustion that lay ahead, thousands of feet of it. But the summit grew no nearer, only steeper, and I felt I had no more to give. Pause, breathe. One more step. Dig in with your toes. Push up. One more step. The ground slipped beneath, magnifying the effort and slowing us to a figurative (and literal) crawl. I think a level of intoxication from the previous night sustained me through the first hour but the second one was Satan's playtime. Of course I'll say it was worth it with a rose tint even brighter than that of my cheeks but looking down into the brooding maw of a volcano is a worthy sight. No lava alas but hot, sulphuric fumes emanated from the rocks warning at what lay below. A passing cloud temporarily enveloped us as we sat panting with satisfaction and relief. The climb down is best described as like skiing without snow or, indeed, skis. The scorched, barren landscape gave a sobering reminder that the last eruption was only a year ago. Truly the most physically demanding thing i have ever done. Our last night in Antigua was a quietly pleasant one. We ate at a restaurant accessed behind the counter of a tiny convenience store, whose menu comprised just two items. Thankfully the Pepian de Pollo (chicken stew) was excellent and I ate heartily for the first time in days. We rounded off the evening in a venue where the barmaid committed the error of letting me make music requests. We'd probably still be there now if we didn't have an early bus to El Salvador.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8504668265767961293","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8504668265767961293/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8504668265767961293","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:53:02 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:53:01.303+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:53:01 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-90.753041,14.5512315],[-90.713559,14.5512315],[-90.713559,14.5819685],[-90.753041,14.5819685],[-90.753041,14.5512315]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/la-luna-negra.html","title":"Tuk-tik","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/12 20:25:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-13T12:24:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/12 20:24:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/la-luna-negra.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xd9s3yq","description":"Day 13 - FloresA not insignificant amount is charged when you leave Belize, payment on entry would surely be a more reasonable system. We'd stopped in San Ignacio on the border the night before and received Guatemala pointers from a charming French girl named Lila. As soon as we'd walked across the border we were beset by Taxi Drivers and Bus Drovers bellowing \"Flores!\" and \"Tikal!\". Going alphabetically we chose the former. A familiar buzzing noise greeted our arrival into the town, the hairs on my travelling partners neck stood up. Tuk-tuks. His deep seated and impassioned loathing for the machines (or more accurately their operators) was salved by a few jars with some chickens. The Mayan ruins at Tikal were widely touted (and not just by the aforementioned) so a tour was booked for the following day.We waited on pre-dawn streets silent but for the shrieks of bats diving in and out of the eaves. Our transport was exactly on (Guatemalan) time and we were soon heading north to a city reclaimed by the jungle. A hummingbird buzzed beside me as we loitered at the entrance while Occelated Turkeys strutted the dewy grass. Step pyramids rose through the mist their angular forms piercing the soft white vapour. We climbed one of the ancient ziggurats and looked over fogged canopy and distant (very distant) toucans. It takes a leap of imagination to see these ruins as a functioning, teeming city-state, the plazas thronged with people hundreds of years ago. What I'd give to step back just briefly to the golden age of Meso-American civilisation.Next on the skimpy itinerary was a place in the mountains called Semuc Champey. Crystal clear water cascades down over turquoise pools. I swam a gentle stroke while looking up at steeply rising jungle all around. Already wet from a torrential downpour the cool waters washed the dirt of travel from my weary body. Our lodgings were perched above the river and once the electricity went off at 10pm a pitch blackness descended among with a present feeling of isolation. Danes lulled us to sleep with The Beatles greatest hits. The sun wasn't long up and we were bouncing down the mountains in the back of a goods van with the aforementioned Scandinavian songsmiths. Rocky roads threw us up and down, left and right until my senses were almost entirely loosened from me. Still, it beat for comfort the minivan from the other day packed to twice it's capacity, 30 people in a space designed for 15. We changed in the village of Lanquin to a more luxurious form of transport - one that had seats. Picking up a couple of South Africans the van sped off towards Antigua. Up into the clouded hills again we ascended, the roads a sticky mush from recent rains. Our driver decided speed would be our ally through these muddy passes even when the vehicle was fishtailing alarmingly from side to side. Near sideways and skidding towards the precipitous edge, I think collective hearts skipped a beat. Will we make it to Antigua or be a mess of expensively repatriated bodies on the valley floor? Stay tuned for the next thrilling installment!","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5662616390570632354","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/5662616390570632354/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/5662616390570632354","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:51:21 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:51:20.823+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:51:20 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-89.9013805097656,16.9222063801589],[-89.8816395097656,16.9222063801589],[-89.8816395097656,16.9373973801589],[-89.9013805097656,16.9373973801589],[-89.9013805097656,16.9222063801589]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/swimming-with-sharks.html","title":"Swimming with sharks","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/08 18:40:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-09T10:39:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/08 18:39:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/swimming-with-sharks.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xcjd8o2","description":"Day 9  - Belize CityNight was not Belize City's best side, black was not its colour. We fell in a parabolic curve down through Mexico, gravitating towards the little country sitting below the peninsula. The book helpfully outlined the places not to walk at night in Belize City - just about everywhere. We caught a cab with a German called Benton or Fenton or something and made for the Smokin' Balam Guesthouse. Our landlady also instructed us to 'be careful' and with nervous glances all around we walked to the main street in search of sustenance. We collared a copper to ask about gringo-friendly venues and though his suggestion of a bar down a dark alley was not taken seriously his advice to 'stay safe' certainly was, despite the fact that he should surely have a hand in that. Carmita's by the famous swing bridge was relatively friendly and a couple of buckets of Belikin (Belize's #1 beer, sorry, 1 beer) softened our angst. We had Lyndon's (after Johnson) undivided attention the bar being, as it was, bereft of other custom. We ended up having a pleasant evening perched out on the front step of Carmita's with the former president, the owner Alex and a guy called Jeff, they even invited us to a party the next day and 'party' beats 'high-murder-rate' in rock-paper-scissors. We did pluck up the reckless courage to visit the bar down the alley - the next day, in daylight. But not before a brief walking tour to Bird's Island, a tranquil spot where the city's literati chill. The island looked largely unchanged in the 50 years since Hurricane Hattie came through here and blew the capital 50 miles inland. As far as wildlife went - the birds, well I guess they went. There were two dogs angry at our transgression who made a barking beeline for us only halting their charge at the last minute. We left Bird's Island. Friendlier company was found at the aforementioned bar. JC was an imposing man who ran the security there and it seemed impolitic to complain when he helped himself to one of our beers. His right-hand man and girlfriend (one suspects she would be anyones girlfriend for a little US) also joined our libations but I was distracted from complaint by the large bag of weed JC had just placed into my hand. They were the Belizean Laurel &amp; Hardy if Laurel &amp; Hardy offered you drugs and prostitutes instead of slapstick comedy. As for the police? Don't worry about them amigo, they're all corrupt. We looked on from our hostel as a Christmas parade wended its way through the city in the distance. It must have wended its way through some neighboring countries too given the time it took to reach the spot on the main road where we had subsequently positioned ourselves. Joining us at Carmita's party afterwards was a tall rake of a rasta called Eldon who had come over from a nearby Caye (island, pronounced key) to feed tourists riddles, information on his sexual prowess and an endless supply of bullshit. The decision was made that if Eldon was here the island could only be the better for it and a visit was required forthwith. <a>The</a> Cayes are an hour and a world away from the city's simmering menace. As we bisected the mangrove forests our boat carved a great cross in the wake with a frothing geyser at its centre. The hankerchief that my fellow traveller had brought with him indicated a fundamental misunderstanding of the island's renowned watersports but I wasn't missing out on snorkeling the world's second largest barrier reef. We floated like weightless clouds above clear skies and sylvan fields of vivid, living rock while leopard rays flew slowly below. Bulbous spheres of Brain Coral with twisting mazes carved in their surface lay next to elegant fans caressed gently by the wind of current. Giant Grouper eyed us warily while shoals of smaller fish moved across the horizon like swooping flocks of birds. My breathing was slow and steady, my vision clear, I felt as if part of the ocean. Mountain ranges rose to my left and right, the valley floor seemed miles below but gravity held no sway. We circumnavigated the channel and drifted over undulating, brittle coral beds watching fish of a perfect purple dart in and out. Wrasse and beaked Clowns scoured the reef with sudden, jerking thrusts. We returned to our airy domain to explore further down the reef in search of its more.....emotive inhabitants. I dropped again into the temperate ocean with a note of anxiety quite absent before. Dark shapes swarmed the boat in a morass of fin and frenzy. Their slicing form evoked ingrained childhood fear, a two-note terror. But all they sought was food thrown from above, competing with Rays and greedy Petrels for the scraps of fish. Don't pull their tails or put your hand in their mouths and no harm will come, fair. Once the bucket was emptied and the fish had dispersed we clambered aboard our bobbing launch. It was exhilaration that took me as soon as I removed the mask from my face, a pure lightness of being. A wonderful experience only improved by the recounting. We leave behind an odd cultural melange of Menonites, Rastafarians and dear old Queenie staring up from every note. Belize, interesting.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3724338751552957418","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3724338751552957418/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3724338751552957418","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:48:23 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:48:22.532+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:48:22 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-88.265618,17.437137],[-88.10769,17.437137],[-88.10769,17.558289],[-88.265618,17.558289],[-88.265618,17.437137]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/into-west.html","title":"Into the West","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/06 22:00:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-07T13:00:00.000+11:00","granularity":"hour","time":"2011/12/06 21:00:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/into-west.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xio7w0l","description":"Day 7 - MeridaWe bid farewell to Hostel Rio Playa regretting that we didn't have time to bathe in their foot-deep 'swimming' pool even though, as notified by sign, diving was prohibited. Our early bus was of the plush (no really) ADO variety, I sense our standards of carriage can only decline as the trip progresses. We set our compass to Merida, the cultural capital of the Yucatan. First stop was Valladolid though for a brief excursion to the Mayan ruins at Ek Balam (Balam meaning Jaguar, Ek as in 'ooh ek'). A collectivo taxi with two Mexicans heading that way provided an economical connection. The Mayans put up some pretty impressive structures without the use of metal tools or draft animals and though most had crumbled the 29m pyramid still stood resplendent amongst the trees. The ascent was jagged and unforgiving and a slip could be painfully, bone-breakingly fatal. The view from the top, however, engorged the eyes with its vast verdancy. The climb down was more harrowing yet with our momentum towards a steep, staccato death. Visions of mine being another head bouncing down the stone steps were not easily put from the mind. But I leapt from the bottom step once I reached the bottom with a profound joy at still being alive. Cenotes dot the peninsula and are large cylindrical sinkholes filled with water, created by both natural forces and the hand of man. The complete lack of rivers or lakes in this part of Mexico made them life giving resources and a fixture on the tourist trail. The  tour of Ek Balam's cenote we took was informative, interesting, entirely in Spanish. There is only so much nodding a person can do before it becomes apparent thye have no idea what you are on about. When our linguistic ineptitude dawned on our guide she....ploughed on with her script regardless. A colectivo with a couple of Czechs set us back on our way to the West. We were entertained on the bus by one of the Terminator films which, it should be noted, lose very little in their dubbing to Spanish. A hostel on the Grande Plaza gave us shelter from the storm (light drizzle). We took beers and endless tortillas outside a restaurant staffed by a waiter whose slow, deliberate delivery redolent of a sloth earned him the original sobriquet of 'Speedy Gonzales'. Above the pleasant woodwind of the house band he did manage to alert us to an evening of music in the nearby plaza which would be taking place the following day, Merida would have us for another night it seemed. The house band was certainly an improvement on the one in the previous bar whose oeuvre was limited to limitless variations on the same song. A Mexican Scouting for Girls if you will. They were supported by a wildly gyrating patron who, having abandoned attempts to be served another beer, took instead to flinging his arms and legs around in a blind, orgasmic salsa, a Mexican Bez if you also will. We took an open-topped bus tour (forshame!) around the city the next day. The commentary was, again, entirely Espanyol but the sites would only have been dangerous distraction from the very real hazard of low tree branches and power lines. Still, an enjoyable couple of hours was spent throwing ourselves beneath the safety of the seats. We wandered the market in the afternoon past stalls whose merchandise was nigh on indistinguishable save for one selling pets (or the freshest of meat if you incline towards racial stereotyping which, of course, I do not). Michael needed some persuading as to the impracticalities of bringing a puppy along for the trip. His dislike for bottles, finite taste for beer and disdain for lime was starting to limit his drinking ability (that and the humidity of course) so maybe the time had come to head South. The musical event was a bust by the way, we turned up in time to hear copious tributes to the benefactors and very little of what sounded like a decent chamber orchestra. Next stop Belize.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6929068916674229501","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/6929068916674229501/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6929068916674229501","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:37:36 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:37:35.927+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:37:35 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-89.7779285,20.851385],[-89.4620715,20.851385],[-89.4620715,21.088615],[-89.7779285,21.088615],[-89.7779285,20.851385]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/sodom-on-sea.html","title":"Sodom-on-Sea","published":{"end_time":"2011/12/03 18:39:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-04T10:38:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/12/03 18:38:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/sodom-on-sea.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xhnjlog","description":"Day 4 - Cancún I fervently hope that a runway is approaching us with the rapidity that we are approaching the tree-carpeted ground. Black waters have become turquoise and grey skies an endless blue. I've never seen so much jungle and I've been to the New Forest ferchristsakes. Summer had arrived in December. We had touched down in Cancún in the Yucatán Peninsula. A town infamous for being a magnet to alcohol deprived American teenagers in spring and all the exported debauchery that suggests. Our hostel was sited in a disused shopping mall, the escalators had halted long ago but the place did the trick and it was in short order that we were sipping our first ice-cold Corona. The trip proper had started now, 'journey' if you're of a more literary bent. I had been fighting a rather fatalistic state of mind for the past two days, a mind of dark and doomy imaginings. Now every edge was a precipice, every drain cover a trapdoor, the cracks were everywhere. It drives one to distraction, it will pass I hope. What I do know is that somewhere in the back of my head I am ticking off each day that passes without serious mishap, each one a success. We only spent one $15 all-you-can-drink night in Cancún lest its visceral temptations corrupt our mortal souls and ensure our places beside Beelzebub himself. I tend to feel, if not guilt, then a kind of dismay when i'm in these places. Not through a moral objection or anything so high-minded, certainly I revel in their honesty. Moreso a wondering why the Western world need seek foreign shores to indulge its more basic (and sometimes base) desires. Should we inflict our vomiting, screwing, screaming on our poorer neighbours who can't turn away such regular business as our privilege provides. What does that make them think of us? Is this what they aspire to? Next morning after a night near spent on grass we jumped (carefully alighted) the bus South to Playa del Calmer, sorry Carmen. It is a cheaper, quieter version of its brash Northern neighbour. Lonely Planet evidently hasn't stopped by in a while given that its first two recommended hostels were, respectively, a souvenir shop and a building site. We did find success on our third attempt however. The trip has gone with an ease sharply contrasting that we experienced in the subcontinent. Places are, by and large, where they are meant to be and the language sticks, muy bueno. I am glad to be here, India can wait. It seems though, as is our perennial habit, we have landed outside of tourist season. We found some fellow gringos in a swinger's bar but the streets were empty of human traffic by midnight. Perhaps excitement lies to the West...","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2680825915013213045","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/2680825915013213045/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/2680825915013213045","updated":{"end_time":"2012/10/26 06:36:19 -0400","original":"2012-10-26T21:36:18.882+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/10/26 06:36:18 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.0038655,21.040499],[-86.6880085,21.040499],[-86.6880085,21.277429],[-87.0038655,21.277429],[-87.0038655,21.040499]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/dont-step-on-cracks.html","title":"Don't step on the cracks","published":{"end_time":"2011/11/30 20:06:00 -0500","original":"2011-12-01T12:05:00.000+11:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/11/30 20:05:00 -0500"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/12/dont-step-on-cracks.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xc4d3va","description":"Day 1 - New York The cold, dark New York air hits our faces as we rise from the petroleum-scented depths of the subway. In a life of bright, hopeful beginnings and dim, crestfallen endings here is another of the former that asks for a wordy substantiation, a placement in the order of things and, perhaps like none before, a worthwhile reckoning. Or maybe I just squeeze my eyes shut and fuse the disjointed, the dismembered ends of this violent year into one seamless, happy whole. As we walk across the Brooklyn Bridge it provides as apposite a metaphor as any of the dreaming spires and brilliant lights that lie ahead.<a>Our</a> curious cattle shed of a hostel (can someone please investigate the previous life of the Bowery Whitehouse and let me know?) grounds us and in the finest of tourist traditions we are shortly ensconced in an Irish pub called McSorley's supping God's love (B. Franklin, 1779). Sarah, Sarah, Simon &amp; Matt ably straddle the dividing line of a common language regaling us with tales of their own travels while I treasonably decry our blessed Saxe-Coburg-Gothas. 36 beers stagger us but not as much as the $90 bill and less yet, eventually, than the jet lag.The High Line Park and swirling mysteries of the Guggenheim occupy us the following day, the suspended emphemera of the latter fueling our conversations on the definition of art and the efficiencies of ice cube varieties, whilst in an Irish pub. My fabled injuries feel everyone of the hundreds of blocks they traversed but surely don't feel pain as keenly as the drunken Yank's head as it cracks off our tiled lobby floor. The culture continued on our last day (keeps us out of the bars) with another immodestly sized New York institution. The Metropolitan Museum uses the word 'art' in its most liberal sense to encompass its near-kleptomaniacal collection of everything from Picassos to copious amounts of cabinets. Surely if my mother ran a museum this would be it. The Num Pang Sandwich Shop restored us after a day (literally) in the Met while simultaneously redefining the Earl's greatest invention.

I look back at highs and lows,  the 'emotional ECG'<a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-_k10_uN_QNY/TfYxvIsE7_I/AAAAAAAANik/uPyzMF68A20/s1600-h/images3.jpg\"><img title=\"images\" height=\"23\" alt=\"images\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-cZY3rfHiiNE/TfYxwIYZnBI/AAAAAAAANio/_Euj_p7Rkw0/images_thumb1.jpg?imgmax=800\" width=\"78\"></a> of it and find cause to treat any sensation or mood with a wary eye so mindful am I now of their fleeting conviction. One day joy, the next gloom, was either emotion worth the heartstring it was written on? It’s as if there if there is no definable identity, you are one of a myriad of personalities created only by a given state of mind. The subconscious and its teeming processes are hidden from our analysis but every second of every day they are creating and destroying you like a miniature Shiva inside us all. But there is solace in such vibrant variation and the furious energy it seems to grant, home is such a comfortable coma where I could close my eyes and sleep for a thousand years. How I miss travel, there was a certainty in the uncertain, a joy in having bearings but no mooring. The possibilities<a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-oSfdMcGF5YU/TfYxw15hVcI/AAAAAAAANis/lN8QdcSz8lc/s1600-h/CRW_9475%25255B6%25255D.png\"><img title=\"CRW_9475\" height=\"138\" alt=\"CRW_9475\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-hOYFp4O3Dcg/TfYxxqsU2MI/AAAAAAAANiw/kvJN_DdHmY4/CRW_9475_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"240\"></a> of the next few months are terrifying to me, might dreams be dashed on the rocks of practicality? (that’s enough maritime metaphors I think). But there are reasons to be grateful too and I am certainly not the only one indisposed. What unwavering friendship I have received these weeks. What infinite patience with an insolent patient! ‘Thanks’ doesn’t really seem to do it justice, how can one find the words? The progenitors too fly ten thousand miles and now house me once again, how many more times? As many as it takes I suspect. So there is the silver lining to this monsoon cloud, the reaffirmation that when I do fall there is somebody to pick me up (even if it is from the side of a railway track).  Lucky? Me? Damn right.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8174658997428143552","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8174658997428143552/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8174658997428143552","updated":{"end_time":"2011/06/13 11:53:20 -0400","original":"2011-06-14T01:53:19.870+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/06/13 11:53:19 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.76073229999997,52.4313774]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/06/pills-pills-pills.html","title":"Pills, pills, pills","published":{"end_time":"2011/06/04 03:09:01 -0400","original":"2011-06-04T17:09:00.001+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/06/04 03:09:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/06/pills-pills-pills.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xcy8qai","description":"As I reach the end of my course of medication I look back at the variety of pharmaceuticals I swallowed, usually in complete ignorance of their purpose.

At 3 my consultant bade us au revoir and we were free but for the small matter of a large bill. A bill that in it's compilation took longer than The Domesday Book. First it was a two hour wait (incredulity) then another hour (incensement), wars have lasted less time. Indian efficiency and mindless, box-ticking beadledom was set to 11 and suddenly an extra hour on top of the 700ish already spent in the Apollo Hospital, Delhi seemed intolerable. We threatened (and nearly effected) a walkout which, credit to Indian resolve, speeded the process not one bit. I feel in hindsight and looking at the 37 page document that eventually arrived that the problem lay partially with the communication of the complexities of the task. How on earth the hospital accounted for 955 individual items on that bill I shall never know. From the syringe (7.7 rupees) and it's needle (3.1 rupees) to it's contents and the gloves the Doctor wore to do the injection, everything was here. It might have been easier to charge me for bandages by the mile. This gargantuan compendium could have been readied for the discharge time and the staff's intonations of \"protocol, protocol\" merely served to goad us further. But I am glad I can flick through it now with faint curiosity rather than mounting horror as I read the final page and it's total of 1,112,017.00 rupees (or about 15 grand in Britisher monies). I have also been issued with reams of documentation and X-rays (a hypochondriac's dream) done during my stay. Illuminating reading that reminded me of the (minor) brain haemorrhage I suffered during the fall and apprised me of the fact I have Spina Bifida in my S1 vertebrate, ho hum.Suddenly I found myself sitting in a hotel bar wearing normal clothes and drinking a cold beer. My great, white swaddled leg allowed no fancy that the past month had all been a dream but certainly my world had altered once again. It was all taken in one's initial stride though and it is only later, now, at this ungodly hour of the morning that I contemplate my....unsettledness. No sleep has been had, the air con is too cold, too noisy, the pillows too soft, too different. Everything is too different and I am trying not to loathe it. One month in a hospital and I am institutionalised, oh dear. Suddenly I feel more invalided than I ever did at the hospital and am playing quite the mewling infant it appears. The outside world seems to leak in through every gap in the door and every chink in the curtains. Only now when everything sleeps do I feel buffeted by it and unprotected from it's uncaring bustle. I need rest really, my thoughts are piqued and contorted. These sleep-deprived entries never want for hyperbole though they do, I fear, for lucidity. Yes rest perhaps before I start screaming 'put me back!'","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/710070503440412232","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/710070503440412232/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/710070503440412232","updated":{"end_time":"2012/05/03 09:35:05 -0400","original":"2012-05-03T23:35:04.284+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/05/03 09:35:04 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[77.2501856407227,28.5511741416109],[77.2892546407227,28.5511741416109],[77.2892546407227,28.5728551416109],[77.2501856407227,28.5728551416109],[77.2501856407227,28.5511741416109]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/white-paper-on-healthcare-reform.html","title":"A white paper on healthcare reform","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/24 14:26:01 -0400","original":"2011-05-25T04:26:00.001+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/05/24 14:26:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/white-paper-on-healthcare-reform.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xhz7uyu","description":"Day T-2 - DelhiI've no love for private healthcare. For all its myriad imperfections the NHS can stand proudly (if not literally) next to the Great Pyramid as one of humankind's greatest wonders and most transcendent creations. Having been in the Indian health industry's life pricing clutches for the best part of a month i'm left faintly disappointed. For all intents and purposes and since I have insurance (thanks ma!) this experience differs very little from the one I would have had if I had thrown myself from a train back in the UK (or a less impossible but equally deleterious deed). Surely they're missing a trick here? My treatment won't be cheap but it has been standard, where are my choices? Wheres the menu Doc?I guess i'm getting the best the hospital offers but how can I be sure unless there are clearly deliniated tiers of care? Health tourism is growing massively not least in the Subcontinent but apart from competitive prices whats the USP? The array of Doctors i've seen have done sterling work on my flayed leg and mutilated foot and my physical health has been most excellently attended to. The neglect lies with my mental health. Recovery is dull, long, unvarying, an unnecessary imposition on a person's receding idea of normality. The answer(s)? Keep reading.Any person upon inflicting a heinous wound upon themselves (or possibly having said wound inflicted upon them, I only speak from personal experience) would surely dream of closing their eyes and on waking finding themselves fully restored, or at least restored to the extent that modern medicine permits. Induced comas must be the answer! My last month could have been passed in blissful ignorance of gaping, vacuumed heels, extensive skin grafts and modesty shredding ablutions. So theres our top notch offering right there \"your family are weeping but you're sleeping!\" (n.b this line needs work). The next option down the list might involve consciousness but a consciousness greatly enhanced. My last month was relatively pain free but barring a couple of pre general anaesthetic sedatives failed to be really mood lifting. For all the painkillers they've shovelled down my neck none have cheered my drearier days, none have expanded my mind. I thought I saw a familiar friend in the little vials of Tramadol amongst my cornucopia of chemical adulterants. Alas it seems a poor cousin to the stuff the NHS bunged me after a broken knee - back then I gently floated in seas of tranquility with the soft ripples of time trickling between my toes and caressing my outstretched fingertips. Imagine such relaxation combined with the occasional bed bath and you've practically got a spa. Perhaps spas could be the pioneers in this development of the industry? They already have the cucumber slices, get some doctors on the books, a job lot of morphine, a.....do you need a license to practise medicine over here?....i'm gonna say no, and you're set.The next tier of treatment would be the one that I am currently receiving. The physical repairs are competant, the equal of those on 'Gold' and 'Silver' services (aforementioned) but you make your own entertainment here, you might be staring at the sky but there ain't no diamonds and its Lucy's day off. I'm afraid your recovery will be in what we call 'realtime'. A little like prison you'll have to serve every second of your sentence (n.b don't use ANY of this in the advertising materials). There will be drugs, painkillers you shall have but only enough to, well, kill the pain. Euphoria is off. Our Doctors will aim to maintain a status quo with regard to your pain, angst or suffering, you should experience no more than you would on an average (injury free) day. Bronze service might be long, it might be tedious beyond reason, it might result in some sort of psychological breakdown (which we can treat, for a fee) but you are saving the rupees.The final tier is 'Lead' (might need to think of a non-toxic metal to represent this service) and is our most 'interactive' level of care. You're familiar with how everyone becomes an amateur Doctor when you have an ailment? Well silence their baseless and ill-informed pronouncements with some real hands on medical experience of your own, physician heal thyself! The Lead service keeps costs to a minimum by allowing the patient to take charge of their own wellbeing. As a patient you've seen your bandages changed a hundred times, \"I could do that myself!\" you say to yourself. With this tier of service you will be doing it yourself! No longer will you be a helpless bystander to your own recovery you'll be in the thick of the action 'getting your hands dirty' (latex gloves will be provided at extra cost). Doctors and Nurses can be hired by the hour (discounted rates for operations &gt;3 hours) so you can keep in control of your costs and customise a healing programme to suit your needs. Do you need minor surgery? Can you assist? Then dispense with the support staff! The only limit to the money that can be saved is you (and your ability to stay conscious). There will likely be numerous legal waivers required with Lead tier and possibly some basic medical accreditation but I can see it revolutionising the medical industry. If you can sew a ripped seam you can suture a gashed leg.I am convinced the future of consumer medicine has just been conceived. There are options to suit all budgets and tastes. Wanna sit the whole thing out? Go Gold and dream it all away. Wanna soar above it all? Go Silver and recline on fluffy clouds. Wanna read a lot of books and eat bad food? Go Bronze and count the hours. Got no money and nothing to lose (except your life)? Go Lead and pick up a scalpel. ","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/805908506724993891","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/805908506724993891/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/805908506724993891","updated":{"end_time":"2011/05/24 14:37:01 -0400","original":"2011-05-25T04:37:00.809+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/05/24 14:37:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/included-with-this-post-voucher-for.html","title":"Included with this post a voucher for reclaiming 2 minutes of your life (5 if you`re a slow reader)","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/22 15:47:00 -0400","original":"2011-05-23T05:46:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/05/22 15:46:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/included-with-this-post-voucher-for.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xi9wwzd","description":"Day T-6 - DelhiThere seems to be a lot of shouting coming from outside my window. Either there is maintenance going on or the hospital has realised how grossly underutilised the roof space is and has created a new ward out there populated by the most vocal patients. The hands of the clock draw slowly around its face, 40 hours on the same piece of furniture, surely a new personal record. My new(er) wheelchair (freshly pilfered from the 3rd floor, kudos Attendant) stands forlorn and empty. All pleas for early release on the grounds of good behaviour have been flatly denied. It might be just me but the less you can do for yourself the less of a person you actually feel. I sit up, I lie down, 90 degrees of movement, 6 degrees of separation  from the person you were. All high melodrama really but also an injection of sensation into a vacuum of stimuli.Anyway the doctors came and unwrapped my leg after 46 hours, a slow roast if ever there were one. For those of you more concerned with my physical health than the tiresome verbosity of my mental wellbeing they were pleased with what they saw (though,and to paraphrase, only a physician could love that leg). So...another milestone, back to a healthy quantity of holes in my body (9). I try not to look too far down the road of recovery because it seems awfully long and doesn't appear to be bending in a direction entirely favourable to my wilder ambitions. But somehow, in some part of my head, and I can't really explain this, i'm already standing at the end of that road, about to take a fearless and unhindered step. It' already happened because it will happen and each second that passes will be forgotten,will cease to be a meaningful unit of time or at best will be compressed and packaged up into a tidy memory of 'The time I fell off a train'.

I have therefore resorted to using possible days until discharge. Any stay beyond a few days in these places sees the familiar structure of your normal life break down or, more aptly, decay. The only constants would seem to be the times at which drugs are administered. Sleep is fitful and disjointed but is infinitely better than if I were on a ward with its perpetual twilight, its dimmed quiet. I like the isolation of this room, when the doors are closed it is my kingdom and I order it as I fancy. Of course there are limits to my power imposed by a pantheon of higher beings beyond the door. But they check my actions for my own good, benevolent gods if you will. I feel an odd contentedness this morning but I'm loathe to trust a feeling of positivity without knowing from whence it sprung. Has my favourite nurse flashed me her restorative smile? No sign of her. Have housekeeping replaced my aged wheelchair with a jetpack and turned the balcony into a launchpad? No, it's against hospital policy to open the balcony doors. Perhaps I've simply derived pleasure from the simple? From the completion of my morning tasks? Waking, taking my pills, wrapping a fresh dhoti around my waist. Nothing dramatic. Eating my breakfast, reading the paper, attending to my 'donor' (as opposed to doner) leg and its scorched skin (see below). Even something as insignificant as a bit of tidying, ordering the items on my bedside table gives a feeling of control in a wider situation in which I have little. Curious adaptation that, do we all grasp for a sliver of control even when we are largely powerless? Does it help us to reassure ourselves that we still exist, that we are still relevant? I tidy, therefore I am? It brings to mind my last extended sojourn in a medical facility. I recall reveling in the wonderful simplicity of my life for that period. All around was fervour and impotent anguish but I basked in the uncomplicated imperative of survival. It is different this time, 6 years ago the world beyond those disinfected walls seemingly offered little to me, I felt ensconced and protected from it's cruel vicissitudes. Nowadays these walls restrain me, hold me back from the world's wondrous possibilities. It's the same view out of the window as it was back then but now it's a different person looking.<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nIORMz-nqCg/TdDk4SHUYVI/AAAAAAAANJE/-vxtHEuGcMk/s1600/CRW_9435.jpg\"><img height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nIORMz-nqCg/TdDk4SHUYVI/AAAAAAAANJE/-vxtHEuGcMk/s320/CRW_9435.jpg\" width=\"213\"></a>","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7676004384317661219","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/7676004384317661219/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/7676004384317661219","updated":{"end_time":"2011/05/19 04:57:48 -0400","original":"2011-05-19T18:57:47.545+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/05/19 04:57:47 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[77.2811269999999,28.539746],[77.2853849999999,28.539746],[77.2853849999999,28.543832],[77.2811269999999,28.543832],[77.2811269999999,28.539746]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/knock-knock.html","title":"Knock knock","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/11 04:02:01 -0400","original":"2011-05-11T18:02:00.001+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/05/11 04:02:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/knock-knock.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xidv048","description":"Further to my previous post you may be wondering how all those people find sufficient activities to fill their time.

To aid in their visual differentiation they usually wear different coloured uniforms. I have described the types below according to my experience of them.<b>Blue Shirts</b> - Generally unpossessed of English or alternatively forbidden from talking to patients. Quite lowly, frequent surly look may indicate dissatisfaction and possibly plans of uprising against superiors. Known wheelchair thieves, always be sat in yours or have hidden it in toilet when a Blue Shirt is around.<b>Red Shirts - </b>Housekeeping. English also tends to be limited but is given freer rein than that of the Blue Shirts. If something must be picked up from the floor then these people <u>must</u> be called, no-one else is qualified. Sometimes employed as limb support during bandage changes with varying degrees of efficacy.<b>Yellow Shirts</b> - Rarer than Red Shirts, possibly a sub species as have similar habits/habitats. Have not been observed in the wild often enough to form any firm conclusions, research ongoing.<b>Beige Shirts </b>- Security. Main habitat is entrances/exits of hospital though a population also exists in the car park areas. Occasionally heavily armed but usually courteous, if you hold your hand to your head in a salute they will often mimic you.<b>Blue Tunics - </b> I believe these to be female Beige Shirts though  none carry visible weapons which suggests advanced martial arts skills or ability with spells/magic. Do not salute.<b>Green Aprons - </b> Catering. A very clear subdivision exists within the species, those who bring standard food and those who bring 'menu' food. Each will <u>not</u> clear the other's dirty dishes should they encounter them. Standard food consists of 3 meals a day although some days you may receive 2 breakfasts, 1 lunch and no dinner that is still 3 meals, consider hoarding. Tea is brought at 6AM whether you want it or not, whether you are conscious or not, probably whether you lived through the night or not (conjecture). <b>Green Aprons (menu) </b>- Bring food that is too spicy/flavoursome for ailing patients, strictly attendants (visitors) only. Should you tire of standard food the above rule can be circumvented by the following method. <b>1</b>, Order desired menu food over the phone, no disguise of voice required. <b>2a</b>, On food arrival if attendant is present no further subterfuge is required, wait for Green Apron to leave, consume. <b>2b, </b>On food arrival if attendant is not present first explain their curious absence to Green Apron by pointing to the toilet* or indicating that they are smoking. Then with a wave of the hand (aim for nonchalance) direct the food to be placed somewhere in the room not close to you, this <u>not</u> your food and therefore you have no<b> </b>interest in it's whereabouts. Wait for Green Apron to leave, retrieve food, consume. *Green Apron may misconstrue and attempt to leave the food somewhere in the toilet, possibly in sink, try to prevent this. <b>3, </b>On collection of dirty dishes make no attempt to disguise the fact that it was you that ate it. Do not attempt to explain continued curious absence of attendant, you will not be challenged. Wait for Green Apron to leave, delight in your cunning.<b>Pink Tunics - </b> Nurses. Always young, always female (though one is called 'Alan'), always from Kerala. The Doctors (see below) will refer to them as 'sister', they are <u>not</u> related. It is your choice whether you also choose to do this, having Afro-Caribbean ancestry may influence your decision. Main duty is replenishing the vast quantities of drugs and bandages you will require during your stay.<u>Will</u> offer bed baths, will <u>not</u> offer happy finish, <u>don't</u> inquire.<b>White Tunics</b> - As above but &lt;1 months training.<b>Doctors - </b>No definable uniform though some wear shirt and tie combinations reminiscent of the magic eye pictures popular in the 1990s. You will likely have a doctor for each part of your body but the frequency of their visits will depend on your particular ailment, my belly button Doctor has been notable by his absence recently. Their main task is communicating via mobile phone (often delegated to Pink Tunics though) however they can combine this with other minor roles like surgery. Long hours have been known to make them lonely.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6308973500822440945","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/6308973500822440945/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6308973500822440945","updated":{"end_time":"2011/05/19 08:58:23 -0400","original":"2011-05-19T22:58:22.785+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/05/19 08:58:22 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[77.2811269999999,28.539746],[77.2853849999999,28.539746],[77.2853849999999,28.543832],[77.2811269999999,28.543832],[77.2811269999999,28.539746]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/doors.html","title":"The Doors","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/09 08:32:01 -0400","original":"2011-05-09T22:32:00.001+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2011/05/09 08:32:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/05/doors.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xhg07cv","description":"A day - DelhiI sit behind glass doors that won't be opened looking over a city that can't be explored. A famous philosopher once said that he'd rather be living in a cave looking at the Taj Mahal than living in the Taj looking at a cave, an interesting perspective. At least my confinement allows me to conjure fanciful notions of the world outside or, more accurately, my position within it. I am become detached from its ebb and flow, its bustle, its spin. My presence in that world is just that of an avatar, given life only by my imagination. All that I have ever done or ever might do seems superimposed when I look through the window at a planet that will not stop turning, where time will not stop ticking. Did I expect it to? Surely not! Such self-inflicted interludes have been my lot before. Perhaps never before though have I been so eager to to get on with the life that I have paused. But then of course I need only the briefest respite from daily reality to conceive the most fantastical ideas of how things shall be. Not a fault in itself, the lack of will to bring these things to pass (or even attempt to) a most desperate failing. A tearing, ripping, rending, soul-shredding bloodied mess of a failing. A silver bullet to the heart of undying expectation. I fear I am ever gasping for that extra gulp of air that no person gets.

It has endlessly fascinated me since I first visited, indeed it may well be the impetus for this particular journey. I have endeavored to understand the people, the culture, the esprit du corps. I have thus far failed but wholly enjoyed the toil. The dubious British gift of bureaucracy lingers and we had come together as a small band of travelers in the Kandy visa office to collectively curse, pray and wonder at the process by which we'd earn our entry sticker. After what seemed like, and was, hours we had the approval we needed, a paltry three months but surely sufficient baring any mishaps. An Aussie named Patrick joined us on the evening bus back to Colombo and regaled us with his adventures around South America, mental itineraries subtly shifted eastwards. We bade farewell to Sri Lanka, our first stop, after an uncomfortable night at the airport. It's a country I should like to see again in a decade or so and I will be interested to see if the people have hardened along with the concrete of the highways and flyovers.Though there was never any notion of a schedule I hate to feel i'm falling behind with this writing. Minor details slip from memory and it seems like such a chore to start up again and so retrogressively recount. But then again there was intended to be a more abstract theme to this than previous scribblings (abstraction is always a crowd pleaser....). Perhaps better that the pure literal is lost and what remains is the amorphous taste of experience. We shall see perhaps.From our landing point of Trivandrum (not its official name but that is beyond the scope of this article) we caught the train up through Kerala to Kochi (one of, I believe, four alternative spellings). It's a tropical, palm-fringed part of the country with extensive backwaters and an agreeable calm. The European influence is evident in the Fort area as successive waves of Portuguese, Dutch and English assumed control. It's also hard not to notice the hammer &amp; sickle icon plastering walls and structures and though denoting (or promoting) a democratically elected and seemingly well run communist government it brought to mind the many swastikas I saw in Sri Lanka and reinforced the power of symbolism on us as humans.As I write now, looking out over Delhi and its sunrise it is clear how any linearity of travel or writing has been abandoned. With a tube putting fluid into my left arm and another tube drawing it from my right leg things, one could safely say, have taken an unexpected turn. Such turnings make me feel like a naive, hubristic fool. Ever championing life's wonderful, unpredictable danger and arguing against those people who resist it. Did I feel such a pioneer laying on my back in the rail ballast, the train's emergency brakes screeching in my ear, my right leg ripped asunder? I couldn't tell you, the actual memory of the event sits in some inaccessible part of my brain or is lost forever perhaps precipitated by the twin gashes on the back of my head. Certain though is the fact that the first couple of days afterwards followed the familiar pattern of cheery, self-consciously stoic denial of consequence. OK so I fell from a train (rarer event in India than one might suppose) but it wasn't far from the ground and the thing was slowing for a station, what real harm? A lower right leg near stripped of skin and a butchered heel that wasn't just going to snap back together. Such hospitalisations have been far too common over the last ten years, to screw up one leg is unfortunate, to screw up two looks like carelessness. I detest the tag 'accident prone' yet I cannot help applying it to myself as my body collects ever more scars and impediments from misadventure. This can't continue, this fleshy form, which I treat with no particular daily reverence anyway, will not recover from every injurious dare I put it to. In short I shall end up a broken, bittered fool. My days may be much like this, resting in my wheeled seat while a nurse affectionately pats me on the head and brings me another tea. I haven't walked in a week, I've rarely missed anything so much as I've missed my mobility. Having to call someone to complete the most basic tasks for you is a terrible vision of elderly decrepitude. Still, the wheelchair was heaven sent, the first few days limited to the 3' x 7' space occupied by the bed in my room sent me to the very edge of my sanity. It wasn't long before hot, wet tears of frustration doused my face in an uncontrollable flurry that, I think, was reality making its firm grip known. My throat lumps now to think of the emotional nadir. But a certain balance has been reached between actuality and aspiration and I feel better for it. Perhaps that is why I feel able to open up to my leather bound counsellor. I'm wary of epiphanies and resist the presumption I'll ever be anything but a wanton knave but....I feel improved. So I can't tell you much of India, I can tell you of drip stands and drug cocktails, of bed baths and bed pans? Not delectable reading I suspect and likely to smack of more self pity than any of us could stomach. So maybe I shall leave it here, still looking out of my Delhi hospital window as the sun chases the morning shadows and the chorus of hoots starts up again. Stay safe.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8680914547215821627","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8680914547215821627/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8680914547215821627","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 07:36:24 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T21:36:23.588+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 07:36:23 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[77.2811269999999,28.539746],[77.2853849999999,28.539746],[77.2853849999999,28.543832],[77.2811269999999,28.543832],[77.2811269999999,28.539746]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/never-mine-never-mind.html","title":"Never mine, never mind","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/18 05:23:00 -0400","original":"2011-04-18T19:22:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/04/18 05:22:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/never-mine-never-mind.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xf9l81e","description":"Day 13 - Nuwara EliyaIt happened. Somewhere on the train between Peredeniya and Nanu Oya a romantic, idealistic, sure-to-be-disappointed dream of travel was made flesh. The butterflies in my stomach fluttered through valleys and hills blanketed with tea plantations. The land was verdant green and cool and there was an affinity with it I'd never before known. The trees turned straight and tall, their russet foliage contrasting with the lime of the shrubbery. The grass was no longer wide and indolent but prim and upright much as if the British had imported their own all those years ago. I talked about the country around with a Nederlander whose mediation related injuries suggested it was not always the calming experience it purported to be. Later, sitting in the door of the train I slipped into a whirlpool of feeling from which I would barely escape. All seemed possible even that which was not. Next to my beastly filth sat dark intrigue that intoxicated with tales of the world. I thanked chance and fortune as the realities of our nomadic existence began to dim. All these thoughts and fatal aspirations would whir ferociously around my head at the end of the world but for now the fairytale was still being written.Gazing at the stars from our balcony the evening was a happy blur of Lion (beer) and laughter. The kaleidoscope of possibility had been turned and its pattern was most pleasing to the eye but so wretched to the heart. This was love spelled with a U, an S and a T but it drowned reason and choked reserve. And when the moment came I.....retreated. The fairytale could not be unwritten, my hands could not fashion what my wild imagination had conceived. I plunged from the precipice, rising fog obscuring the impact below. No half measures would tarnish the purity of my desire. Who chooses discomfort and deafening silence over warm embrace? That person, dear readers (optimistically pluralised) was me and I shall ever wonder at its logic. I suppose, in the final analysis, my questions were better left unanswered and my wants unfulfilled. It is a long life and it would be foolishly detrimental to allow myself to dwell in Nuwara Eliya, all things must pass you see. I could only reflect back on the length of my grasp and the shortness of my reach as we departed the place. The thickened air cleared my head and somewhat restored my appetite. Most profound apologies for the alluding and fawning but this is the truest account I could give of an unexpected time. We were again 2 as the tea receded into the distance, the colours around seemed a little less vibrant, but only a little.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6051954898758415925","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/6051954898758415925/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6051954898758415925","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 07:32:25 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T21:32:24.984+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 07:32:24 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[80.6176757480469,6.83304015438602],[80.9335327480469,6.83304015438602],[80.9335327480469,7.08524815438602],[80.6176757480469,7.08524815438602],[80.6176757480469,6.83304015438602]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/trunk-road-sorry.html","title":"Trunk road (sorry)","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/18 04:51:00 -0400","original":"2011-04-18T18:50:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/04/18 04:50:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/trunk-road-sorry.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xkogdeq","description":"Day 11 - KandyWe bussed it back down to Kandy yesterday and for once arrived in a place at a reasonable hour to find accommodation. Leaning against a building next to Trinity College we decided to search again for the place where a bed for the night costs less than a bottle of Coke. Up into the hills again we went, a young Buddhist monk reoriented us and sent us back to the very building we had been leaning again. Finally we observed the small lettering of the 'Burmese Rest'. An exuberant puppy greeted us and managed to draw blood on my hand, he didn't look rabid so I should be alright.We were welcomed at 'The Pub' with the familiarity of regulars which by flighty tourist standards I suppose we were. A beautifully cool pint of Lion on the roof terrace atop a nearby hotel ended the evening. Today (Friday) we struck out for the Elephant Orphanage. Intrepid ideas of connecting buses were forgotten with the chartering of a private taxi. We descended the hills at a decent lick, waylaid only by a political rally. There's a lot of money to be had in politics said our driver and I felt like a dreadful old colonial (natives? in government? good god!) for assuming that corruption was implied in his statement. The orphanage rescues abused or exploited elephants and....well...exploits them. At least they get something out of this deal and with a seemingly good standard of care I would guess that the former permits the latter. We arrived in time to see them bathing in the river after which they are driven up a street like some Sri Lankan Pamplona with the tat-wallahs hastily moving their goods. How can one ascertain the contentment of a Pachyderm? Certainly I would venture that their sad, wet eyes give no clue. They would seem to be afforded a reasonable degree of liberty with only a few chained for reasons unknown. I generally came out in favour of the place while still feeling that at times an animatronic herd would have sufficed given the contrivance of the photo opportunities. It's a manipulated encounter firmly on our terms rather than theirs but it does more good than it does harm.

They are rattling old beasts but, judging by the crush of people aboard, the most popular way to travel. In this compressed way we passed the next few hours, the monotony only broken when my pack fell from the overhead rack onto a fellow passenger. He took this assault from above most amiably and offered me pineapple. I've found most Sri Lankans to be of this cheery disposition and how pleasant to be offered a warm smile for looking different rather than the traditional fear and suspicion. Our landlady rather bucked the trend with her repeated attempts to extract money from us and indignation that we should choose to spend it elsewhere. She did tempt us into having our sweat-sodden clothes cleaned though the headband of my hat, stained betel juice red is surely beyond hope. I admire Sri Lankan's industry and constant efforts to earn a living wage. The sharp practice and deceit sometimes employed though leaves a more bitter taste. 'Caveat emptor' is a universal mantra but never more so here.We stood atop the Lion's Rock looking out over all of Sigiriya and reflected on a worthwhile but draining 1202 steps in the April sun. A curious amount of blind people were being led up to the summit, quite what they got from the experience one cannot help but wonder. Certainly they would have missed out on the frescoes of the...pneumatic women on the climb. The Dambulla cave complex presented less of a climb but less of an experience with 5 shallow caves packed with a multitude of Buddhas, sitting, standing, reclining. Rinse (feet) and repeat.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6851935923678472479","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/6851935923678472479/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6851935923678472479","updated":{"end_time":"2012/03/08 12:41:30 -0500","original":"2012-03-09T04:41:29.705+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/03/08 12:41:29 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[80.9273531386719,7.89365019915229],[81.0852811386719,7.89365019915229],[81.0852811386719,8.01946419915229],[80.9273531386719,8.01946419915229],[80.9273531386719,7.89365019915229]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/gran-tourismo.html","title":"Gran tourismo","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/18 04:10:00 -0400","original":"2011-04-18T18:09:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/04/18 04:09:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/gran-tourismo.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xbzoels","description":"Day 7 - Anuradhapura I hopeWe tried our hand at hairdressing this morning, or barbary in Michael's case, my Nicky Clarke to his Sweeney Todd. Uncontent with a freshly shaved head he also removed a fair portion of his eyebrows. I am trying not to laugh too hard, I am failing. The staff at the Indian visa office didn't seem to notice the discrepancy between his picture and his actual appearance so no harm was done, except to his ability to look normal. The applications filed we were instructed to return to Kandy to collect in two weeks once the bureaucratic machine had spun its interminable wheels. That may not be time enugh given that the train on which we are travelling north has been broken for two hours...tbcEngines came, engines went, the train spluttered forward, the train stopped. Heads were scratched. The mercantile vein ploughed its ceaseless circuit with all manner of foodstuffs from apples and nuts to, based on the seller's cry, 'showaddywaddy'. We reached Polgahawela with our connecting service long gone. I'm not sure if it was the welcoming committee of blacks crows squawking their sinister way, the Kafka-esque station building or our short foray into the town itself that made me most solemnly pray for another train that night. There wasn't an unthankful bone in my body that such a service existed and as the sun set over the passing rice paddies and we spied the occasional peacock in the fields I acknowledged that such disruptions must be the travellers lot. I passed the time by trading stories of our families with a food-wallah named Kumara. The next day we obtained push bikes replete with baskets (but no streamers or spokey-dokeys alas) and pedalled off for the assorted ruins of once mighty Anuradhapura. Cool we weren't but the bikes were remarkably efficient at getting us around the disparate remains of temples, palaces and, of course, gatehouses. One of the two collossal stupas onsite was undergoing maintenance and  with no internal staircase (what is inside these things? Answers on a postcard) a unfathomably scary means of ascent had been built up the outside of the curving dome. Much as I rail against overbearing health and safety back home a smidgen more in this particular would not be excessive. Considering they form part of the 'Cultural Triangle' in Sri Lanka the ruins themselves have a ramshackle organisation with minimal signage or direction unless you want to pay a tuk-tuk to take you around. Hopefully as tourism ever increases following the the end of the civil war more money can be found to invest in such places. We enjoyed the coldest beers of our trip thus far at a rest house, drunk beneath a canopy bespeckled with little geckos.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/1071944538662491350","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/1071944538662491350/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/1071944538662491350","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 07:27:29 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T21:27:28.124+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 07:27:28 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[80.3224184462891,8.29066287621372],[80.4803464462891,8.29066287621372],[80.4803464462891,8.41634187621372],[80.3224184462891,8.41634187621372],[80.3224184462891,8.29066287621372]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/kandy-man.html","title":"Kandy, man!","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/12 06:26:00 -0400","original":"2011-04-12T20:25:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/04/12 06:25:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/kandy-man.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xfe26xa","description":"Day 5 – KandyLike it or loathe it, whatever your view of Kandy it can flip in a heartbeat. An 8 hour train from Galle (2 less than the journey that got us to Sri Lanka) does sensitise a person to the tribulations inevitable to unplanned travel but nonetheless our first evening in the spiritual capital was one of extraordinary frustration and rare anger. We searched first for the £3.50 a night guesthouse run by Burmese monks. Alas no trace could be found on its supposed road or in people’s local knowledge. We entered into the familiar tug of war with a tuk-tuk driver over where we wanted to go and where he wanted to take us. We checked into a mosquito-ridden guesthouse where the beer had run out by the ‘charming’ ethnic music being played in the garden most certainly had not. I don’t know if it was a man or a woman that ran the place but I do know he/she had a mightily impressive afro. Over a bottle of Coke we began talking to a well travelled Serb whose interest s clearly lay in the seedier side of South East Asian countries. After giving enthusiastically non-committal responses to his request to travel with us we retired to our malarial shoebox, sorry, room.The morning brought a triumvirate of challenges, those being finding new lodgings, obtaining Indian visas and locating a bar to watch the cricket. Fruitless searches in the hills for a YMCA that existed only on a map left us desperate enough to ask a tuk-tuk driver for his recommendations. His drive back into the hills from which we had just descended was brought to a halt by already brittle tempers snapping in the back seat. His English deserted him just as ours reached full pitch. He stopped to pick up a friend ostensibly for advice, in reality probably for protection. The new guy secured us a ‘good deal’ (Sri Lankan for ‘bad deal’) in otherwise pleasant accommodation next to Kandy lake. The priciest place so far but it did boast paper in the toilet and a monkey in the garden. The staff at the Indian visa office had been given a day’s holiday due to the aforementioned country’s presence in the cricket world cup final but a sign on the closed door advised us of the preliminary paperwork we needed to complete. The forms being online there began a  hunt for access. We completed the laborious details required for entry to India (Father’s favourite colour?) quickly and accurately with my addition of ‘Afghanistan’ as Mrs. Hartles’ second nationality being the only black mark.Forms done, passport photos taken, the world cup final was about to start. The Sri Lankans made a good total (imagine this in Richie Benaud’s voice) but studied Indian hitting overcame them to the despair of our fellow patrons in ‘The Pub’.  Our own beer total was no less impressive and we did nothing to dispel the English stereotype of inveterate drunkards, sorry England. Still, we were in better nick than most of the natives who ere clearly lacking our match practise. Sunday brought sights. The Temple of the Tooth contains the aforementioned item retrieved from the Buddha’s funeral pyre and smuggled into Sri Lanka many moons ago. Or at least it is reputed to ‘cause ain’t nobody allowed to see it. An underwhelming experience shoulder to shoulder with visitors all to see a venerated box. Afterwards, I questioned the worth of visiting these famous places. What exactly am I getting from these experiences? An identical picture and a tick off a mental checklist, resolved to think harder about this in the future. A trek to the top of a hill overlooking Kandy provided a more rewarding experience despite the sun beating down on our already pinkened brows. We stood next to the giant Buddha and surveyed the teeming city as once Hilary surveyed the Himalaya (I may overstate slightly).After tucking into our most authentic (menu in Sinhala or Tamil, your choice!) and extensive meal to date at the bottom of the hill we tukked it to the Peredeniya Gardens with little else to do. But what a highlight! Green and serene and a perfect tonic. Palm-lined avenues and orchid houses were a blessed break from the dusts and the car horns that we left at the gate. A massively broad tree shrieked with the sound of bird call. That is what we though until a jagged outline of leather cut through the sky above and the hanging brown leaves at the top began to writhe. Bats were suddenly all about, swooping this way and that in their hundreds. With the thre3at of rain in the air we returned to Kandy town heartened by nature’s uplifting touch.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3160127154838846927","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3160127154838846927/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3160127154838846927","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 07:20:05 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T21:20:04.047+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 07:20:04 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[80.558495,7.221457],[80.716423,7.221457],[80.716423,7.347461],[80.558495,7.347461],[80.558495,7.221457]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/great-expectorations.html","title":"Great Expectorations","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/12 06:24:00 -0400","original":"2011-04-12T20:23:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2011/04/12 06:23:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/great-expectorations.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xf9bo9d","description":"Day 3 – GalleColombo’s inexpensive but inextensive (don’t check your dictionaries) charms receded into the distance as we pulled out of Fort Station. We traded urban bustle for serene blue sea and as our train hugged the south coast nothing lay beyond the horizon but water and ice. I sat in the door of the train to watch the altered world pass by. Shacks lined the track and dotted the beach, a meagre existence for sure but one soothed perhaps by the constant crash of waves. We passed a sign ‘navel gazing ahead’. Do they look beyond the horizon the people within? Or can any of us not? Aren’t we all born of a planet where a journey can only end in a practical or emotional sense rather than a geographical one? There is a need to push our imaginary boundaries even when the desert ahead seems endless. Perhaps it is courage to stay or perhaps it is courage to resist that urge to stray. I should think that our lives are long enough to do both. Galle swelters on the Southern tip of the island and no sea breeze can challenge the sun’s overpowering glare. The headland is ringed by an old Dutch fort, we did the tourist thing and walked its walls. A few miles down the coast they drive poles into the sand beneath the surf for the purposes of fishing atop them. It’s an oft photographed act and in reality charging tourists for pictures has easily surpassed the income to be earned from the actual fishing itself. I couldn’t see the point in paying a man to climb a pole and pretend to fish so my shots have crashing waves, dusky sky and unadorned sticks. I did find myself in my first conversation with a member of the Sri Lankan armed forces who, it appears, employ half of the island’s population. (the other half being, of course, tuk-tuk drivers). Mrs. Wijeneke’s guesthouse was to be our abode, my head still bears the scars of her low doorways.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8610071862142182152","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8610071862142182152/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8610071862142182152","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 07:17:55 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T21:17:54.584+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 07:17:54 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[80.178902,6.0018194],[80.257866,6.0018194],[80.257866,6.0649824],[80.178902,6.0649824],[80.178902,6.0018194]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2011/04/now-this-is-not-end-it-is-not-even.html","title":"Now this is not the end.

The steaming heat had already settled on Colombo and the first drop of perspiration trickled down my brow. The Sri Lankans have embraced the Ryanair concept of airport naming and 'Colombo' airport is a full two hours taxi ride from the city proper, still at £12 for the fare our complaints were few. Glossy billboards extolling our Western mores marked our path, the abnormally whitened faces in contrast to the populace about. But here we were, drunken concept made real and many miles of (malaria) pills 'n' thrills and bellyaches lay ahead. I confess the long demanded excitement was quickly subsumed by practicality and the as yet, planning being what it was, unfulfilled need for accommodation. If only there were a place where we could have-a-good-time, possibly with a Native American, a Policeman, a cowboy and that other one? There was and at £3.50 a night represented a very good deal.Colombo has a smattering of sights but nothing, that I can observe, to hold a tourist (ick) indefinitely. It wouldn't be long before we were on our way but we were immersed, we were removed from familiar stricture and structure, rule and regulation, in short the world was ours. This was a big society alright, it's sights and ear-splitting sounds shake the senses forcibly. It's seeming chaos but enviable unfussiness a much needed antidote to the place from which we came.

We had heard tell of a maiden by the name of Juliet in fair Verona so off we went to cop a feel.

Suddenly after two weeks it was no longer de rigueur to leave our accommodation in clothes more creased than Nelson Mandela's face. By the skillful location and application of a travel iron my shirt was made smooth (apparently I could also have straightened my hair with it, had I any). My travelling companion had turned Chief Bridesmaid© and my friends had turned wed. The ceremony was short and.........moving, an odd sensation for someone who usually experiences emotional movement of the most glacial sort. I confess that I cast my doubts on marriage; I opine on its sustainability, its compromise, its purpose. And yet, and yet, I sat and envied and awed and smiled broadly and warmly and sincerely. I saw loveliness and rightness and a warm blanket of feeling wrapped my heart. The happiness was palpable and I was grateful to be there to experience it. I have likely used my ration of gushing sentiment now so I shall cease, only remaining to say congratulations R&amp;R, it was a little bit perfect. In Italia wedding ceremonies last 10 minutes and wedding receptions last 10 courses. We thought we were successfully cracking on with the first of these only to be told it was simply an intro buffet and did not have full dinner course status, I quietly removed the canape from my mouth. Our épicurien odyssey began with.........well I can't remember, it was food and it was most pleasing to the palate and the rest of the dinner is lost in a hazy whirl of ever revolving china. Suffice to say it was was savoured and if Old MacDonald had had a farm I believe this banquet sampled most of its hooved and web-footed inhabitants. It put our staples of the past fortnight - bread, meat and cheese firmly into their place. After an inventive raffle to send the Bride &amp; Groom on their honeymoon with a few extra pesos, we began a couple of traditional Italian party games. The first 'groping me, groping you' comprises a line of male or female party guests and the bride or groom secreted amongst them. The other, unsecreted half of the marital couple must then identify their new spouse only by the feel of their now exposed calves. Needless to say Ricky &amp; Rachel should devote a little time on honeymoon acquainting themselves with each other's lower legs. The second game involved a deformed pantomime horse and some whipped cream, more I cannot add.After an expected (to the participants at least) duet from bride and Chief Bridesmaid© the dancefloor was thrown open.............to me. Word of my creative choreography and frenetic jigging had crossed the continent and there was an Italian clamour for a rendition of 'la canzone del telephono' or in other words the thing they call 'The Telephone Song'. My own recollection of the encircled solo performance is patchy (due not to alcohol but trauma). Thank the stars then that the 'eh, eh, ehs' and akimboed legs were committed to celluloid for posterity and repeated public viewings. The rest of the evening passed in an ensconced blur of vino rosso (e? i? e? i? o?) and inappropriate advances on young Italian men (Mrs. Hartles, not me. I think). Thankfully, enough people retained their strength and senses to wrestle the microphone from Susan Boyle...sorry.......Michael Hartles at the end of the night.

But Monfalcano <i>is</i> Italy. Our next hire car resided in Trieste which was but a short train ride from the aforementioned location we blearily found ourselves in as the sun came up. Good news after a long night of balkanology, even greater fortune was that the train was complementary, as are all modes of transport when you choose not to buy a ticket. We sat listlessly outside Trieste Train Station watching the town and its denizens slowly come to life as light seeped over the horizon. Eventually, in a side street aromatised with the spicy tang of urine, we were given our automobile and barring police intervention we would be in Vicenza and our final destination within the two hour. The Autogrill must be an utterly, unfathomably foreign place to the tourist, they must reel at the baffle and the bustle. We citizens of the world, we single, bilingual, peripatetic beings negotiated the disorder with what 'posh twats' call aplomb. And so, expressed we returned to the autoslumber.....sorry Autostrada. &lt;Insert driving&gt;.The journey was at its end and we had our first recurrent abode since Istanbul and what seemed like both yesterday and an aeon ago. Relief and surprise probably came in equal measure when we arrived in the Vicenzan suburb of Sovizzo but the warm welcome was gratifying. Alas, alack, our time on the road was not ended though as some batty old Aunt and a Whoopi Goldberg impersonator needed an escort from Bergamo. I tried manfully to break the tedium of the drive by extracting conversation from such diverse subjects as clouds and tarmac but cannot conclude it was entirely successful. The Carabinieri must have been dozing as we made it back to Vicenza with our semi-precious cargo unfettered. A quiet gathering of 30 or so in the excellent local pizzeria ensured a clear head for the impending wedding. For all those that didn't drink every glass of wine and every shot of grappa available to them before being stopped by the bride to be. The big day toward which we had strove and...er...drove was nearly upon us and so, after a short bout of the kind of neighbourly behaviour that Birmingham had so missed, we retired.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3351734993582911615","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3351734993582911615/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3351734993582911615","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 07:02:40 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T21:02:39.242+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 07:02:39 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[11.4270879,45.5171782],[11.4665699,45.5171782],[11.4665699,45.5394262],[11.4270879,45.5394262],[11.4270879,45.5171782]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/09/no-sleep-till-monfalcano.html","title":"No sleep till Monfalcano","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/04 09:25:01 -0400","original":"2010-09-04T23:25:00.002+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2010/09/04 09:25:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/09/no-sleep-till-monfalcano.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xcrutdh","description":"Zagreb/Somewhere in Slovenia - 02/01/2010The 5:30 bus had ceased to be an option so our only way of reaching Italy was now the late train, really late. We had purloined a map of Zagreb with walking tours but Budget Rent-a-Car were kind enough to give us a driving tour of the city during the dropping off of their car. After returning the vehicle in more or less the same condition as we received it (missed calls suggest they may have discovered the wheel), time was our most voluable friend. And so we walked. We took in scaffolded cathedrals (and came out the richer, thanks God) and colourfully tiled churches. We promenaded endless, repeating, boatless waterfront and still the hour of departure did not come. We enlarged Zagreb's 'free tram' zone to cover the greater part of the city and still our time here was not done. The theory of relativity states that a being's perception of time is relative to the list of available activities in the city in which they are stuck. All that being said the only city I can think of that begins with a Z proved to be an attractive if unnavigable place, fortunately spared from the worst of the Balkan ravages in the 90's.We counted down the final few hours drinking Macedonian red wine on a bench in the park in the finest hobo style. Our train was not a sleeper, in every sense. Wedged into a six seater room with a morose and teary English couple, a silent Slovene and an amiable Bosnian Serb we relayed the stories of our adventures to a rapt audience of one. Jovanna (the Bosnian) in turn told us of the Eastern European countries she likes (at last count none) and the difficulties of free movement imposed by suspicion of her country of origin. This was duly borne out by the intense scrutiny given to her passport by the border police. The pleasant discourse went someway to mask the debilitating effect the day had had on our bodies and our final country lay ahead of us over the pitch black Slovenian horizon.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8488684263107444378","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8488684263107444378/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8488684263107444378","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 06:57:04 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T20:57:03.810+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 06:57:03 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[15.8000585,45.684279],[16.1159155,45.684279],[16.1159155,45.861483],[15.8000585,45.861483],[15.8000585,45.684279]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-way-not-another.html","title":"One way, not another","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/02 13:55:01 -0400","original":"2010-09-03T03:55:00.002+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2010/09/02 13:55:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-way-not-another.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xbwmltq","description":"Plivice/Zagreb - 01/09/2010No swimming, no fishing, no straying from trails, no wrestling the bears. Simply shuffle round in tightly packed column taking the same pictures as those that went before you, leave. The Plitvice Parks are an eden but a tightly managed one. I cannot decide if this is the only way they could remain as they are or have had their natural beauty somewhat diminished by the railings of man's modern impositions. One cannot deny the sumptuous visual banquet they present though. The lakes are aquamarine at depth to clear, crystalline purity in the shallows. If a person were permitted to plunge into the deep blue they would surely hesitate lest it all be the flat, paint-daubed canvas of a master artist. The fish, their fins tinged with cornflower blue, bathe in the sunshine in perfect awareness of their protection. The flora and fauna seem oddly monocultural, is this a place of preservation or presentation? What primordial force draws us to water, causes us to wonder at waterfalls? Two hydrogen, one oxygen and the genesis of life I suppose.The force of time drew us back to the car and our tarmaced trail, Zagreb lay ahead. Another city, another hostel, quite the pensioners we are. Hoping to get ahead of our curve through Eastern Europe for the first time since leaving Istanbul we needed to ditch the wheels (in a non literal sense, again). Zagreb's road system is a crisscrossing morass of one-way roads bespeckled by trams and bemused foreigners. There are no straight lines in this city, not between a person and their destination, left turns are banned. We were thwarted in our attempts to return the vehicle and there would be no absquatulation on the early bus out for us, time to tarry. Our last meal had been eaten too many hours ago on the roof of a car in a layby so we decided a dinner involving chairs, a table, cutlery and plates would be something we could stomach.

After collecting the chaos the road called once more. A short drive brought us to Split and the Roman Emperor Diocletian's retirement home. His palace has been built on, in and around over the centuries and makes for a curious, amalgamated piece of architecture. We ate breakfast (byrek) and stumbled upon a giant man with a well worn toe. Gregory of Nin was a man who had some affiliation with a place called Nin, er...that's all I know. I do know that his big toe is reputed to bring luck to the rubber. After the calamities of the previous day a simple stroke of a digit was a superstition worth indulging.The day had brought precisely zero auto incidents thus far. But that is not how we roll so Mike smacked the car into a kerb upon entering a tunnel and we were only saved from a head on collision by his excellent driving (note, part of this statement is b*llocks). We came to the conclusion that his remaining behind the wheel endangered our lives, those of the road users around us and our rental car deposit, plus we didn't have another spare tire. Therefore I should give it a bash. It turns out that I am an excellent driver cruelly deprived of a license by one way street facists. My time in the driver's seat was the safest on a road all holiday and Mike agreed. There is a roadside memorial roughly every 30 centimetres in Croatia, obviously not all have been gifted with my skill. We pulled into Plitvice in the early evening, located a campsite and cracked open a bottle of dreadful red wine. By faint, flickering candlelight I gave a masterclass in the game of blackjack, Mike you owe me £50.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6794890611224896464","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/6794890611224896464/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6794890611224896464","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 06:48:43 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T20:48:42.869+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 06:48:42 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[15.2745363,44.678672],[15.9062503,44.678672],[15.9062503,45.03885],[15.2745363,45.03885],[15.2745363,44.678672]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/09/back-in-hrvatska-or-comedy-of-errors.html","title":"Back in Hrvat(ska) or a comedy of errors","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/01 12:50:01 -0400","original":"2010-09-02T02:50:00.001+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2010/09/01 12:50:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/09/back-in-hrvatska-or-comedy-of-errors.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xjuz19n","description":"Sarajevo/Mostar/Split - 30/08/2010In parts of Sarajevo you could be forgiven for thinking you were in some quaint Bavarian town such are the pockets of picturesque to be found there. Its sights are few and pockmarked with bullet holes and even having seen them there is a sense you are missing something of the place. The real gem lay to the south. Constructed by the Turks in the 1500s, blown up by the Serbs in the 90's, it stands over the Neretva river fully restored and fully worthy of a visit. Solid towers suspend a high, arcing bridge 21 metres up. Locals will cheerfully throw themselves off it after a whip round has produced sufficient Kuna (I think they accept euros too, no cards.    Heading again for the border and the rest of our Croatia leg a couple of nice gentlemen with 'Polizi' on their uniform flagged us down, \"Documents\". Speeding apparently. Michael 'James Bond' Hartles was diplomatic and admonishment delivered we were let go without a fine, fortune smiled on us (or so we thought). The Croatian police proved more intractable. A seemingly safe overtaking move fell foul of their road markings and once again we had the long arm of the law beckoning us to stop. No amount of innocent tourist charm could persuade these guys to let us off and a 500 kuna fine was duly levied. Nearing Split we pulled over outside a campsite. Deciding that this would be our home for the night a minor misjudging of kerb location induced a scraping, grinding halt. And one flat tyre. As Mike got handy with his jack (once I had established the correct orientation) I supervised and mused on what other tricks fate's cruel hand might play. The spare tyre needed air and the campsite owner directed us to a garage a curiously long way up the coast. I got started with tent erection while Mike sought air. As the rain really started coming down he returned having inflated the tyre and had (from the directions) also located our nearest compressed gas distribution centre. Quite why the camp owner thought we wanted to buy gas canisters wholesale is a mystery I will never solve. We sheltered from the rain under a sun shade savouring our dinner of red wine and peanuts. Once sufficient quantities of the vino been imbibed the lure of the sea was too much. Swimming out to the nearest anchored boat we laboured to climb aboard and, bobbing gently in the Adriatic, could only smile at our day of mishap. To complete the circle on returning to shore it appeared our clothes had been half-inched from under our noses. Extensive and frantic searching revealed that someone had left them by the tent, likely us. Still, on the bright side my bag is now lighter given that I threw my shoes into the sea.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6261641853676122010","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/6261641853676122010/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/6261641853676122010","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 06:38:16 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T20:38:15.765+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 06:38:15 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[16.3612295,43.4620668],[16.5191575,43.4620668],[16.5191575,43.5541978],[16.3612295,43.5541978],[16.3612295,43.4620668]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/sobe-or-not-sobe.html","title":"Sobe or not sobe","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/31 07:37:01 -0400","original":"2010-08-31T21:37:00.002+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2010/08/31 07:37:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/sobe-or-not-sobe.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xl3h2qu","description":"Dubrovnik/Sarajevo - 29/08/2010Michelle had taken her throat singing to the patio and the cute French girl (we'll call her Laetitia) was staring at me lustily, an excellent start to the day. The old town of Dubrovnik is undeniably beautiful, a fact not lost on the world's population. It is unrealistic and unreasonable to expect such a place to remain unexploited, preserved for the select few that undertake to make the pilgrimage. Those days are gone in the shrunken world of today. I know not when they actually were but I cannot help but cast my mind back to when it was equally aesthetic but less ruthlessly commercial. It the cruellest of double-edged swords, the money that tourism brings rebuilds, renews and sustains these sights and, to cite the scientific maxim, 'whatever is observed is by definition changed'. What makes, breaks.Enough cynicism and hypocrisy though, we've places to be and one hell of a coastline to cover. We had hired a car through Croatia as it was (nearly) contiguous and would give miles of scenic emergency stops along the Dalmatian coast. But there was one sight that drew us over the border into Bosnia i Herzegovina (though that is for tomorrow). As we entered Sarajevo the sun removed its hat and declared its day done. A judicious (fortuitous) turn led us down a tight, Turkic street and linguistic recollection found us a pension. The quarter we had stopped in was near dry, the people caffeinated rather than inebriated. Still me hearties, pirates always like a drink so a themed bar provided a sure bet of an earned beer. Byrek is fast becoming our staple meal and so it thus proved in Bosnia's war scarred capital (the bullet holes were resplendent on many buildings).The Neretva river valley to the tune of Kalman FM and plinky plonky Eine Kleine Nacktmüsik was a wholly awe inspiring foray.

Our exit from Albania wasn't as rapid as I had originally envisioned though I am glad of it. We have found it to be a country quite unlike that imagined. Far from the gloomy, rubbled remains of a country where there was the iron fist of socialism sans velvet glove, it comes across a poor but honest place that will hopefully see an increase in tourism and prosperity in years to come (without losing its character). A cold shower whilst balancing over a toilet (the hazards of hosteling) was a bracing start to the day and once I had got over the minor trauma of waking with a tongue as black as coal it was time to bid farewell. We zigzagged up the coast between mountain to our right and sea our left. The first bus took us over the border to Ulcinj in Montenegro, our 4th country. Swift, unremarkable connections to Budva and then Herceg Novi followed and then the final leap into Croatia.The queue at the border was a great glinting snake of metal. Over two miles of vehicle cooked in the afternoon sun. Our driver saw no reason why we should have to wait like anyone else and created his own bus lane through the oncoming traffic. Other drivers seemed unaware of this new designation so our progress was much aided by the acquisition of a police escort, someone had clearly heard we had a wedding to get to. We cut a savage line across the stacked traffic at the checkpoint and were into country number 5. The 'Welcome to Croatia' board was followed by a warning sign of landmines and then another indicating that this was wine making country, dangerous business being a vintner in this part of the world. The bus circumnavigated the stunning Kotor Bay where far below giant cruise ships and tiny yachts dotted the azure plain. The end of the line at Dubrovnik precipitated the most exhaustive and exhausting search for lodgings yet. Travelers seeking a campsite here should be advised that there is only one, Camp Solitudo (ironic name given its gargantuan size). Declining to pay their monopolistic prices we pounded the peninsular's streets like pack mules in search of a hostel. At this point surrounded by tourists who were outnumbered only by the plentiful hotels and their ubiquitous 'sobe', I longed for Tirana. The sweat poured through our pores but could not quench the fires raging on the soles of our feet.Over a couple of beers a helpful Croat set us on the right track which was good news, behind me Manchester Utd. scored another goal, which was not. Saving ourselves a worthwhile minus 5 Euros over the campsite, the hostel took our money and bunked us with 3 girls and a boy. We ate dinner and drank our Albanian wine under the stars as the Adriatic crashed against the rocks we sat atop. Every stretch of coastline in Dubrovnik seems to be privately owned, to my great sadness. Without a public beach to hand we had to resort to one in a resort. This necessitated lying prone and motionless on sighting hotel staff, our ninja stealth ensured we escaped detection. The last treat of the evening was the earth-shaking snoring from the bunk across the room, a smothering would have been too kind a punishment.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8128672629630142758","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8128672629630142758/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8128672629630142758","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 06:32:56 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T20:32:55.889+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 06:32:55 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[18.0154592,42.6039502],[18.1733872,42.6039502],[18.1733872,42.6973802],[18.0154592,42.6973802],[18.0154592,42.6039502]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/whats-for-byrekfast_29.html","title":"What's for byrekfast?","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/29 04:53:01 -0400","original":"2010-08-29T18:53:00.002+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2010/08/29 04:53:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/whats-for-byrekfast_29.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xn4am4a","description":"Tirana/Schkodra - 27/08/2010A word of advice here, should an earplug dislodge itself during the night, do not pop it into your mouth and chew it like a tasty treat, it most certainly is not. Our bus north did not depart until the afternoon so with a few hours to waste we ate a leisurely breakfast of the local speciality byrek (a cheese filled triangular pastry) outside the mosque while the Muezzin warmed up. The Museum of National History provided a comprehensive if at times scattered record of Albania's past and its hero Skanderbeg's defiance of the Ottomans. Our green, German-engineered steed stood behind the train station in readiness for the journey to Schkodra. Whilst what sounded like one of Hitler's Nuremberg orations blared out of the buse's speakers we sped through Tirana's suburbs. One of the contrasts in these countries (imho) is that the people seem unburdened by strictured regulation. Onerous rules are not devised, unnecessary laws are not obeyed. They do not attempt to corall the vagaries of life nor control the essentially uncontrollable. I'm beginning to enjoy the sweat of travel on my back, the labour of momentum. It feels earnest and uncluttered. A simple goal but not straightforward means make for an intoxicating combination. I can even ignore the wrath travel has inflicted on my nails. All these thoughts swirl in my mind as I close my eyes and let every muscle go. Great waves of air break over my face from the open window and I am in a feather-light harmony.The bus pulls into Schkodra bus station (again, a bit of road) too late to make our next connection. We sit at the foot of a tree eating kebabs and devising the next move. No campsite is closer than an hour it seems but there is a hostel round the corner. A most welcoming proprieter finds our passports both linguistically challenging and rather amusing. She has added Birmingham and Bristol to London and Manchester on the list of Inglese cities she knows. As the stuffed eagle with its wings outstretched watches us warily from the corner of the room, myself and Michelle are signed in and led to our room. Rudimentary would be an adequate and wholly accurate description but anything else would be a trip into debauched luxury and unnecessary expense. A few beers are had on Schkodra version of Broad Street and then bed, it's Montenegro in the morn.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/1553755076251776441","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/1553755076251776441/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/1553755076251776441","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 06:22:56 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T20:22:55.348+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 06:22:55 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[19.448696,42.0271535],[19.606624,42.0271535],[19.606624,42.1214445],[19.448696,42.1214445],[19.448696,42.0271535]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/i-lek-it-here.html","title":"I lekk it here","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/29 03:13:01 -0400","original":"2010-08-29T17:13:00.006+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2010/08/29 03:13:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/i-lek-it-here.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xhtdk2q","description":"Tirana - 26/08/2010We wended, we wove, we did not wake. That is because we did not sleep. My informative partner gave up his seat for a man whose hand had been mangled in an industrial accident, possibly with a lathe (this is all conjecture on my part). We eventually reached the end of the line and the end of our plan at 6AM in downtown Tirana. Freddy took us in but the room would not be ready for a few hours thus the city's delights were ours for the observing. We found Skanderbeg atop his horse in the centre of what disappointingly is no longer the most chaotic roundabout in the world. Multitudinous Mercedes still hared around it but it no longer has the life threatening qualities that so recommended its witnessing. No-one could in conscience call Tirana a beautiful city (though its female populace is of the highest quality) but it has a certain earthy charm. The traffic of its river is chiefly comprised of the detritus of human living but it has a most aesthetic (if unused) lake. The mosque and clock tower also please the eye with attractively secular wallpaper (n.b. prob not wallpaper). The people, though visibly surprised at the presence of tourists, were found to be a most friendly and helpful bunch. The place is also astoundingly cheap, a beer is often less than a pound in many bars. The first evening redefined parsimony however. Happening upon a lively venue the waiter struggled to get us to understand that all drinks were free owing to the occasion of the bar's opening. Cautiously we ordered two beers. What arrived were two beers, a platter of meats and cheeses and...no bill. Some more beers and then we tried our luck with a bottle of wine, success. When two whiskeys did not arrive we decided that we'd taken full advantage and went on our way, a recommended venue if you are ever in Tirana. Buoyed by our chance discovery (and a not insignificant quantity of free booze) we celebrated by attempting an ascent of the city's pyramid (sorry Mum). In reality (and next day's reflection) we didn't get that high but felt mightily brave anyway. We secured an Albanian flag that was handily suspended from a lamppost and trotted home to Freddy.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3372040563818407082","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/3372040563818407082/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/3372040563818407082","updated":{"end_time":"2012/09/24 06:17:52 -0400","original":"2012-09-24T20:17:51.020+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2012/09/24 06:17:51 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[19.6738715,41.236264],[19.9897285,41.236264],[19.9897285,41.427036],[19.6738715,41.427036],[19.6738715,41.236264]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/boom-da-da-boom-da-da.html","title":"Boom da da boom da da","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/26 13:19:01 -0400","original":"2010-08-27T03:19:00.001+10:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2010/08/26 13:19:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/boom-da-da-boom-da-da.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xasosxe","description":"Thessaloniki - 25/08/2010Despite being roused from sleep by (what seemed like) hourly passport checks, an otherwise decent night's rest was had. We woke to golden Elysium fields of wheat blanketing the land. We passed through them knowing that the only noise left behind us would be the gentle swish and rattle as the wind passed through the swaying stalks. A sparse, sun-baked landscape provided such a stark contrast to an Istanbul so profuse with water. We have picked up some extra carriages overnight, they have slowed us and made us behind schedule. Two hours late into Thessaloniki in northern Greece meant an extra urgency in seeing the sites, thankfully as we discovered, these are few. We first happened upon some fine orthodox churches with well kept icons and impressive iconostasis, pictures were taken. We each lit a devotional candle to Hermes, the god of travel and implored him to bless our journey and keep us safe. A seafront that Milton Keynes would be proud of in its concrete-slabbed desolation drew us along the coast calling a halt at a gold-domed church.The Aegean sparkled in the sunlight but the city`s tourist set-up did not, curious for the country`s second largest. We found our way back to Athonos Square in search of some sign of life. Lunch was taken, however, at a pleasant little place in the market. The ancient characters forming the language in the menu were near indecipherable but what arrived via the infatuated waitress largely resembled what we thought we ordered. Anything not consumed went straight into the bags in the name of all that is good and frugal. The mandolin strumming and old boys wailing along increased authentic experience levels by 56%.A stick or twist decision presented itself, Thessalonian campsite or Albanian bus north? The dearth of the former persuaded us as to the virtue of the latter. Mike, it must here be noted, did sterling work in the location of the ticket office. With some time on our hands we were able to make a kiosk owner very happy with our repeat business of refreshments, and assuage our doubts that the backstreet before us was in fact the bus station. Once the doors had been loaded onto the bus and live chickens had not we were free to divest ourselves of our bags. The relative calm and organisation ceased at this point and all became wonderfully haphazard and in the case of the bus driver, fighty. Mike's seating partner flat out refused to sit next to him and so the bus became a sliding tile puzzle of seat swaps until calm was restored. Seating capacity is an indeterminate and loose concept on Albanian buses, there is always room for more plastic stools in the aisle.Cross-dressing is Albania's national sport (current national no.1 - G. Harwood) or so their television shows would suggest, their dubious quality invaded sleep. We reached the border at Kaphticë sometime around 11PM, a welcome opportunity to use the facilities (by facilities I mean bushes, but better than the high street alcove employed in Veria) since the onboard toilet was doubling as a storage locker. We were joined in this by a fellow passenger whose English was limited (limited by its non-existence) but seemed nonetheless happy to have our acquaintance, verbal though it wasn't. Thankful I therefore was for the seasoned traveller seated next to me who had made this journey more than once. By his mastery (and, un petit, mine) of the international language of gestures he regularly conveyed to me the progress of the bus and conveyed to the driver his dismay at the lack of progress of the bus.The hours had taken their toll on the passengers and no-one was any longer in the mood for a standup argument by the time we reached the Albanian border. I had even grown to accept the toddler 4 rows back breaking into nerve-shredding histrionics with disappointing regularity and the passenger seated across the aisle from me playing Pussycat Dolls at indecent volume. The border crossing was eventually breaching despite the best efforts of Eastern European efficiency and we slalomed up Albanian hills and onward into the night...","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/835910879611967678","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/835910879611967678/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/835910879611967678","updated":{"end_time":"2013/01/11 21:00:05 -0500","original":"2013-01-12T13:00:04.049+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2013/01/11 21:00:04 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[22.8656424,40.5911535],[23.0235704,40.5911535],[23.0235704,40.6875455],[22.8656424,40.6875455],[22.8656424,40.5911535]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/hamam-hunting-season.html","title":"Hamam hunting season","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/25 08:26:00 -0400","original":"2010-08-25T22:25:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2010/08/25 08:25:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/hamam-hunting-season.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xcmnbfg","description":"Istanbul - 24/08/2010A bazaar of another kind today, its raison d'etre being spices. Again my rather romantic visions of hessian sacks festooned with great pyramids of pungent spice were disappointed. A rainbow of scarlet saffron and sandy turmeric was replaced by well ordered plastic containers complete with handy scoops. Must stop thinking I live in the 19th century. Despite the help of an Italian from Brighton and a Turk from Turkey in double act, a sought church on the Golden Horn never materialised. But at least we were on the spot for more balik ekmete. My hat nearly became a casualty in the extensive list of things I have tried to lose this holiday (the bath plugs were the first to fall, how we miss them). The way back took in the pigeon mosque, a scene of utter terror for Mike. His protestations of the unappreciated danger of these seemingly innocuous avians bordered on the lunatic. A most seemly way to round off one's hot, dirty, perspiring day is in the muggy cloisters of a hamam. Having balked at 40 lira for the experience, some shopping around had delivered steadily more expensive prices to the point where the original seemed a snip. Monosyllabic, extensive of belly, not someone you'd leave a loved one with, Mike felt in good company with the masseurs. Sweat, swill, scrub, soap, squeeze, swill, sweat, swill, sit, sip.The streets are as if of air, my skin has been exorcised of its dirt, my soul of its lethargy. The most lovely lightness of being overcomes one's senses. Shoulders weary of bags were restored, legs worn by miles were as new. As we sat outside the football pub supping its precious gift of the wifis, the hourglass in Istanbul was nearly drained. Slightly laissez-faire timekeeping necessitated something of a route march to the hotel for checkout and an encumbered haste back to Sirkeci Station. We made it in good time and despite a near fatal slip on some steps, in good health (once Mike had stopped sweating like &lt;insert preferred analogy here&gt;). Our train was waiting, our cabin small but perfectly formed, our horizon filled with Thessaly. The lack of a bottle opener for the wine was no barrier to these intrepid men of the road. We bodged the cork inside, fashioned two glasses from plastic bottles and saluted our efforts with a chinkless chink. A few hands of cards over a simple but tasty picnic brought the evening to a close.","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4895790684232016838","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/4895790684232016838/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/4895790684232016838","updated":{"end_time":"2013/01/11 20:49:01 -0500","original":"2013-01-12T12:49:00.876+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2013/01/11 20:49:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[28.345246,40.6218295],[29.608674,40.6218295],[29.608674,41.3887105],[28.345246,41.3887105],[28.345246,40.6218295]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/ahmets-city-tours.html","title":"Ahmet's city tours","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/25 07:59:00 -0400","original":"2010-08-25T21:58:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2010/08/25 07:58:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/ahmets-city-tours.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xnzqigw","description":"Istanbul - 23/08/2010Today Topkapi (apologies to Zuhal for pronunciation), tomorrow the world! Well Greece anyway. Good progress was being made so we took the decision to leave a day early buying us a extra 24 hours along the way. Thus tickets for the Thessaloniki Express are booked for the evening of the following day. The next POI was the aforementioned palace though. Taking the circuitous route along the coastal road afforded the opportunity to scramble (with the surefootedness of a mountain goat) up onto its extensive walls. This done, a little exploration revealed bandits had already claimed this section and fearing robbery and flaying we retreated back down. The Topkapi is a sprawling palace complex with many and varied buildings and isn't without that palace essential - the circumcision room. The live demonstrations prompted a hasty exit. The Grand Bazaar is epic in extent, an industrious warren of sellers, shoppers and multitudinous wares. Each little nook that houses an outlet is rather sadly derivative of its neighbour two shops down. Furtive eyes had located a suitable bar in which to watch the Liverpool game that evening. The 'match' was pony, but it did grant us an introduction to the owner, who gave an informative lecture on his city, and to a chap called Ahmet. How much of what the latter told about his estranged family owning half the city was true is debatable but there was no doubting his inebriation or, egged on by raki, our willingness to follow him on a pub crawl. Stopping in each bar only long enough for our NBF to buy us a drink, press the flesh and offer himself to any ladies present the money eventually had to run out. And run out it did, after Ahmet kindly offered to buy a large group of English a round. Desperate pleas for cash went unanswered, his iPhone (at a mere 10 lira, does anyone need one?) went unsold. We showed a modicum of pity and fished out some money and walked erratically home.

Driver, who even if never uttered a singular word to you could not help but be supposed a curmudgeon, was grumpy as is his habit. Gatwick looms, we check in and wait for the plane. I note with interest that Easyjet's 'Speedy Queue' optional extra seems to have been created primarily by slowing down the normal queue. Having said that there must have been something vaguely efficient about boarding as the captain felt able to spare 10 minutes to deliver an impromptu standup routine at the front of the plane. He was, it must be said, a refreshing change from the dour sobriety that is the modus operandi of the airline community normally. Having closed my eyes (yet not slept) I somehow missed the take off and landing completely. The middle bit was as interesting as (and did include) an airsteward's safety brief, thus we find ourselves in Istanbul. A shuttle bus to the western limit of Asia Minor and ferry across the Bosphorus facilitated our entry into the queen of cities. Soaring minarets pierced the skyline as our taxi driver pierced backstreet after backstreet in forlorn search of the Rose Hotel. We drew on the advice of the greater proportion of the residents of Istanbul in its finding. But find it we did and its location was of the primest kind (cheap price too, especially if you think it's in lira) in Sultanahmet and we were but a local's hocked gob from the magnificence of The Blue Mosque and the twin splendour of Ayia Sofia, the latter which we entered. For 1000 years the largest enclosed space in the world (nb, this may not be right, do check) it makes its rival brooding at it from across the hippodrome seem almost contemporary by comparison. The interior is as awing as the time-worn facade and extensive work goes on to restore the original Byzantine iconography so cruelly defaced by its new Ottoman landlords after 1453. The Galata Bridge houses a teeming mass of shops and restaurants many serving balik ekmete (fish sandwiches); dirt cheap, damn good, recommended try. There's quite a fishing scene off the bridge too, although by far the largest thing we observed being hooked was a 150 pound tourist. Sunset over old Constantinople's dreaming spires was taken from the Galata Tower just over the Golden Horn, though a haphazard system for delivering people to the top meant the best light had gone. A day which began 48 hours ago in Birmingham drew to a close with us taking relaxing puffs on a hubble bubble pipe (or Nargile, Hookah or Sheesha if you prefer) in the well furnished environs of Ozlër's bar and haberdashery. Surrounded by cushions, inundated with cats (if they do have 9 lives them surely this must be a city of a billion souls) travel seems elementary and elemental (this, I pray, will not change...)","link:self (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8352720866568369064","link:replies (application/atom+xml)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/feeds/8352720866568369064/comments/default","link:edit (application/atom+xml)":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7126499055151854072/posts/default/8352720866568369064","updated":{"end_time":"2013/01/11 20:36:21 -0500","original":"2013-01-12T12:36:20.343+11:00","granularity":"usec","time":"2013/01/11 20:36:20 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[28.345246,40.6218295],[29.608674,40.6218295],[29.608674,41.3887105],[28.345246,41.3887105],[28.345246,40.6218295]]]}},{"properties":{"link:alternate (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/dissonant.html","title":"Dissonant","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/21 22:19:00 -0400","original":"2010-08-22T12:18:00.000+10:00","granularity":"min","time":"2010/08/21 22:18:00 -0400"},"link:replies (text/html)":"http://bwelsher.blogspot.com/2010/08/dissonant.html#comment-form","id":"abf03xmaieut","description":"London - 21/08/2010The concrete strip bisects the grand old capital and moves us closer to Turkey by the second. Suspended as we are above the minutiae of life on either side we could be 10 or 100 feet from the ground, the endless towers offer no clue. The heat of our destination is as nothing to the fug of our 6 wheeled locale, a thoughtful aid to acclimatisation by National Express. But only the metronomically audible consumption of crisps introduces a sliver of black rage into my otherwise calm disposition. Looking out of the window at the burgeoning city I can't help but slip into a London-centric mindset for a second as it seems no idea was ever had that was not conceived here first. And yet somehow I already feel in a foreign country, doubtful the people around would understand if I were to speak. Time has ceased to be a point of reference, location is my barometer.
