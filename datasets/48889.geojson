In this camp, thousands of Jews, and others deemed \"useless\", were killed here. The prisoners were sent to this camp, 80 people to a cattle car for as long as 3 days. Auschwitz was created by the Nazis, a group of people created by Hitler. They believed Jews were the causes of problems. Here, Jews and other \"useless\" people would work day and night, sometimes digging their own grave. They had meager meals of bread and watered-down soup. Sleeping conditions were harsh, and diseases spread, killing more people each day. The most affective way of killing was mass murder in the gas chambers. The Nazi soldiers would tell the Jews to take a shower, and the \\'water\\' would be toxic gas, killing them in minutes. This place reminds the world of what happens when an evil man becomes a dictator and kills people like Jews. The camp was liberated in late 1944 and early 1955.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez6yt1ui7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.35,50.066667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Christ the Redeemer (Statue)","description":"Posted by Mochalatte103192<img src=\"http://www.student.chula.ac.th/~49370213/brazil_rio_de_janeiro_corcovado_hill_statue_of_jesus_christ_redeemer.jpg\"><img src=\"http://z.about.com/d/architecture/1/7/N/i/Christ_the_Redeemer-lge2.jpg\">     This is the Christ the Redeemer statue located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The idea for the statue began with using finances of Princess Isabel in the 1850\\'s, but she was not interested, and the project was forgotten.\r\n     The statue was sculpted by  Paul Landowski, and is made out of reinforced concrete and soapstone. The project cost 50,000. Most of the costs for the statue were payed by the Brazilian Catholics. In July 2007, it was named in one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Also, on February 10, 2008, the statue was struck by lightning, but was not harmed at all.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez73ujgmr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-43.2108056545,-22.9513790553]}},{"properties":{"name":"Great Wall of China","description":"Posted by Mochalatte103192<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/DSCF0469.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/DSCF0456.JPG\">ChinaThe Great Wall of China was built as a protection against enemies in other surrounding countries. The building of the wall began in the 5th century BC. As many as three-million people died in the making of the Great Wall. It has been very successful in protecting China from enemies over the centuries. Soldiers would keep guard on all parts of the wall day and night in order to defend themselves. The Wall was made before the use of bricks and cement. Therefore, the Chinese used stones and wood. \r\n     The Great Wall has been named one of the seven wonders of the world, because of how old and sturdy it is, and because of its massive length and size. The wall stretches out 4,160 miles overall. Since it is so old, parts of it are wearing down due to natural causes. The Chinese are always busy maintaing the Wall so that more tourists can come visit every year.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez73i1eqe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Kilimanjaro","description":"Posted by Mochalatte103192<img src=\"http://www.junglephotos.com/africa/afscenery/mountains/kilimanjaro.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.curtmyersclimbsmountains.com/Mount%20Kilimanjaro%20web_files/image042.jpg\">Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Northern Tanzania, near Kenya. It is an inactive volcano, but also the tallest free-standing mountain rise at 15,100 feet. Also, the highest peak, Uhuru Peak on Kibo, is 19,340 feet. Mount Kilimanjaro is not just one mount, but a group of volcanoes spread out. There is plenty of snow and ice on the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, making it one of the colder places in Africa. Theories say that the name, Kilimanjaro, comes from the Swahili language, one of the translations  meaning \"white little mountain.\" There are fumaroles in Kilimanjaro that emit gas into the air. Many have climbed this inactive volcano, however, there have been a few rockslides in the past. The first person to ascend Mount Kilimanjaro was Hans Meyer in 1889.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez7cwc0mw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.3466491699,-3.05961051074]}},{"properties":{"name":"Olympia, Greece","description":"Posted by Mochalatte103192<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/CIMG3063.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/CIMG3060.JPG\">Olympia is located in southern Greece. The first olympic games were created, and held here around 776 BC. The games were made so the winner could have control over the area until the next games. The games were held every four years. Greeks wanted to win so they could earn prestigous and politcal advantages. There were many games the Greeks participated in, such as running and chariot racing. Women could not participate in the games except for the Equestrian events. Only men who spoke Greek were allowed to participate in the Olympics. The winner would receive an crown of olive leaves.\r\n    The Olympic Games still continue today, but now, every athelete, from any country can participate. The winers receive medals and trophies to honor their country. Many people around the world watch this event every four years.

There are three smaller pyramids for his three wives. The Great Pyramid took about 10 years to build. The stones weighed about 1.5 tons each. The pyramids are said to date back from around 2500 BC, under the rule of 4 pharaohs, but not all at once. The base of the Great Pyramid covers thirteen acres! Erosion over many years has caused the height of the pyramids to decrease about 10 meters, making it 138.8 meters high.\r\nThe pyramids were used as a tomb for great pharaohs and their wives, burried in the bottom center of the pyramid. The pharaohs would be surrounded by lavish gold possessions because they believed they would be with them for eternity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez757joog"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.1332798004,29.9783196815]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Augustine","description":"Posted by Mochalatte103192<img src=\"http://cruisediva.net/castillo_sanmarcos1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.claramack.com/images/StAugustine121.jpg\">     This city has historical importance because it is the United States\\' oldest city. In this city, you can find many old Spanish monuments that date back to the 1600\\'s. The Spaniards built Castillo de San Marcos as a defense fort to others in the New World in 1672, and was completed in 1695. Less than one-hundred years later, in 1740, the Spaniards built Fort Matanzas. This helped them clearly see enemy ships coming in from the Matanza River.\r\n     More recently, this city is known for attracting tourists who come to see the old monuments. Flagler College can also be found here, and is located where Henry Flagler\\'s first hotel, called Ponce de Leon, was located. This city is very historical, and is preserved as a reminder to the Spaniards who came before us in discovery of the New World.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bez77wvnqg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.3190841675,29.9003354495]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sydney Opera House","description":"Posted by Mochalatte103192<img src=\"http://clarkvision.com/photoinfo/night.and.low.light.photography/sydney.opera.house.c04.05.2005.JZ3F8871-b-700.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1d/92/15/sydney-opera-house.jpg\">sydney, australiaThe Sydney Opera House is where you can find the most entertaining, beautiful opera in the world. It has a modern design that looks like \\'shells\\', and covers 4.5 acres of land. The idea of having an opera house came from Eugene Goossens in the late 1940\\'s. He wanted to create a larger venue for music in Sydney. Before the Opera House, opera was performed at the Sydney Town Hall, but Goossens considered it too small. Joseph Cahill was responsible for designing the Opera House. In 1955, he had received over 200 entries for designs. The winning design was from Jørn Utzon, a Danish architect. It had a grand opening on October 20, 1973 by the Queen of Australia, Elizabeth II. Millions of people came to watch this grand opening.

Two major tourist attractions in this national park are El Capitan and Half Dome. Both of these are granite cliffs. People have access to rock climbing in these areas. There are many wildlife creatures out in this area such as wolves, bears, bobcats, and deer. \r\n     John Muir discovered these areas back in the 1800\\'s. Muir had a passion for discovery and nature, so he thought he would just go and walk around all of Yosemite and discover what the new land had to offer. He even brought President Theodore Roosevelt along with him. He died in 1914.
