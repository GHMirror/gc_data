Beggars approached us at every crossing… poverty is on the increase in Pakistan and this giant 15 million city has a lot of it, side by side with all the wealth and luxury.\"   Up to 40 percent of Karachi's inhabitants live in squatter settlements, many homes being of a semi-permanent or temporary nature. A third of all workers earn income below the poverty line. The reliability of Karachi's power supply is poor and its traffic chronically congested – the city currently lacks any mass transit system – with most Karachiites still going to the riverside each day to have their laundry washed.  The lagoon of the Indus Delta appears to the east. Two rivers flow through the city itself, with the River Malir flowing from the northeast to the centre and on the east side, the River Liyari flowing north to south. Clifton beach, the curved stretch of coastline east of the port district, is one of the longest city beaches in the world.  Being one of the most rapidly growing cities in the world, Karachi faces problems that are central to many developing metropolises including overpopulation, overcrowding, traffic, terrorism and crime.  Karachi faces a very severe problem of excessive traffic. The number of cars far outstrips the roads that they need to ply on. This makes driving considerably dangerous and causes loss of time due to traffic congestion. Currently, President Musharraf has launched the Tameer-e-Karachi (Build Karachi) program that included construction of a lot of bridges, flyovers, and bypasses, as well as other major projects to correct the city's infrastructure problems.  Karachi is a city with a cool breeze because of its location close to the  (A northwestern arm of the Indian Ocean between India and Arabia) Arabian Sea, which is why the pollution levels in the city are not very high.  <img src=\"http://www.suedasien.net/images/news/jun2002/Karachi.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.worldisround.com/articles/41632/\">Photos in and around Karachi</a> Another excellent collection of photos <a href=\"http://www.historickarachi.netfirms.com/index.htm\">here</a> <img src=\"http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2200/karachi7kh.jpg\">","id":"aal9afn9zk84"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[67.010002778,24.86]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delhi India","description":"Delhi India Don't let your first impressions of Delhi stick like a sacred cow in a traffic jam: get behind the madcap facade and discover the inner peace of a city rich with culture, architecture and human diversity, deep with history and totally addictive to epicureans.  Both Old and New Delhi exert a beguiling charm on visitors.

Essentially unchanged for thousands of years, the Wuhan production process starts with an ancient and carefully guarded metal formula. Then skilled craftsmen shape and tune every cymbal by hand. As a result, the Wuhan brand has become legendary for unique special-effects cymbals and gongs. Drummers from all musical genres especially prize the famous Wuhan \"Lion\" China-type cymbal. In terms of pure authenticity and unique sound, it is the standard by which all other \"China\" cymbals are measured.       Owing to their unique method of manufacture, Wuhan cymbals have a distinct and unmistakable character.  Generally thinner than corresponding models from other manufacturers, Wuhan splashes, crashes, and hi-hats produce a breathy wash of overtones, creating a comfortable cushion of sound.  Ride cymbals offer intensely complex musical tones and generous projection.
