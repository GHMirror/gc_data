He is solely known for his constitution, rivalled only by that of Rasputin. It is said that 30 attempts were made to murder him, all unsuccessful but the last.\n\nThe events that lead to Malloy\\'s celebrity began in January 1933. He was at the time an alcoholic, and a bum. Five men who were acquainted with him, Tony Marino, Joseph Murphy, Francis Pasqua, Hershey Green, and Daniel Kriesburg (later dubbed \"the Murder Trust\" by the headlines), plotted to take out three life insurance policies on Malloy, and then get him to drink himself to death. The first part of the plot was successful, and (probably with the aid of a corrupt insurance agent) they stood to gain over ,500 if Malloy died an accidental death.\n\nMarino owned a speakeasy, and gave Malloy unlimited credit, thinking it would soon put an end to him. It didn\\'t; Malloy was in danger of drinking the bar into bankruptcy. Antifreeze, a deadly poison, was substituted for liquor, but still Malloy would drink until he passed out, wake up, and come back for more. Antifreeze was substituted with turpentine, followed by horse liniment, and finally mixed in rat poison. Still Malloy flourished. The gang began to get creative, thinking raw oysters soaked in wood alcohol would do the trick (this idea apparently came from Pasqua, who saw a man die after eating oysters with whiskey, which was probably an anomaly). Then came a sandwich of soiled sardines, carpet tacks, and metal shavings (none of which would likely lead to death in any case).\n\nRealizing it was unlikely that anything Malloy ingested was likely to kill him, the Murder Trust decided to freeze him to death. On a night when temperatures reached -14 degrees Fahrenheit, Malloy drank until he passed out, was carried to a park, dumped in the snow, and had five gallons of water poured on his bare chest. (The gang had used a similar method on their first victim the previous year.) Nevertheless, Malloy reappeared the following day for his drink. The next attempt on his life came when they hit him with Green\\'s taxi, moving at 45 miles per hour. This put Malloy in the hospital for three weeks. The gang presumed he was dead, but were unable to collect the policy on him. When he again appeared at the bar, they finally decided to take a more direct approach. On February 22, after he passed out for the night, they took him to Murphy\\'s room, put a hose in his mouth that was connected to the gas jet, and turned it on. This finally killed Michael Malloy.\n\nHe was pronounced dead of pneumonia, and quickly buried. However, the members of the Murder Trust proved to be their own worst enemies — they talked too much and squabbled among themselves. Eventually police heard the rumors of what they did, and upon learning that a Michael Malloy had died that night, they had the body exhumed. When they discovered the actual cause of death, the five men were put on trial for murder. Green went to prison and the other four members were executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ju4xr4unj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.997512,40.709987]}},{"properties":{"name":"On-Air Suicide","description":"Posted by Bianca2000sarasota, FloridaAccording to her co-workers working the day of her suicide, Christine Chubbuck took the unusual step of excusing herself to write her script for the newscast. She normally opened her show with an interview and conducted an informal half hour and she never once opened her show with a newscast. She also placed under her desk a bag of puppets that she had occasionally used during a broadcast. Hidden in the bag was the revolver. Before her newscast she told the producer that she wanted them to get ready a film of a shooting that happened the weekend before and then she took her seat. After three pieces of news, she led into the shooting piece but without the film because it wouldn\\'t run correctly. It was here that she delivered her last words:\n\n    \"In keeping with Channel 40\\'s policy of bringing you the latest in blood and guts in living color, we bring you another first, an attempted suicide.\"\n\nShe then shot herself. It is rumored that the technical director of the broadcast reacted quickly enough to cut the video to black a split-second before she pulled the trigger. However, there is evidence to the contrary. A Washington Post journalist viewed the footage just days after the incident. The shooting had not been cut. The article can be found in the Washington Post archives.\n\nThe \"script\" she had written was actually the story of her own suicide attempt, detailing how she\\'d be taken to the hospital and declared to be in critical condition. She was the first person to ever commit suicide on live television.\n\nThree weeks before her suicide she had asked the station\\'s news director if she could do a news piece on suicide. After getting her pitch approved she called the local police department to discuss with an officer methods of suicide. In the interview he told her that one of the most efficient ways was to use a .38 caliber revolver and with hollow point bullets, which would disintegrate on impact. A week before her suicide she told a co-worker that she bought a gun and joked about killing herself on air. Her mother, in an interview granted the day of the suicide, said Christine was very depressed and had few friends or romantic interests.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ju4tmh7xr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.530833,27.336111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pinkerton Bit His Tongue","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://scotlandvacations.com/images/Pinkerton.jpg\">Chicago, IllinoisAllan Pinkerton, detective, died in Chicago, Illinois on July 1, 1884 as a result of gangrene infection after biting his tongue when he slipped on a sidewalk. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ju4yechh0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.670941,41.855818]}},{"properties":{"name":"Student Invited to Dinner is Eaten","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/serialkillers/sagawafridge.jpg\">paris France1981: A 25-year-old Dutch woman studying in Paris, Renée Hartevelt, was killed and eaten by a classmate, Issei Sagawa, when he invited her to dinner for a literary conversation.

Witnesses stated that Trotsky let out a blood-curdling cry and began struggling fiercely with Mercader.
