The great bread is from a local bakery whose identity is her \"best-kept secret,\" says owner Brenda Lucas. The curried chicken salad with a touch of apricot preserves is a standout and is Lucas\\'s own favorite piled on a croissant with lettuce and mozzarella. The tuna salad is made only with Albacore and the nice addition of capers. Meats are lean and very thinly sliced, complemented beautifully by condiments like house-made cranberry-orange-pecan compote and sage cream cheese on the Pilgrim turkey sandwich (.25) and Cajun mayo and pepper jack cheese to spice up your roast beef (.25). The personal touch carries through in the form of three chocolate kisses that come with each sandwich. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ghekf6tnsl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.10821,44.44616]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cobblestone Deli, 152 Battery St. Burlington","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a>The red brick storefront with green and red-striped awnings of Cobblestone Deli (152 Battery St., Burlington, 865-3354) has been a sandwich lover\\'s destination for many years, including the last four under owner Jaimie Kramer. He knew enough not to change, but just to add to a list of sandwiches that have become classics, like the Purdy, an inspired combination of smoked turkey, bacon, smoked gouda, and red onion with veggies on your choice of Klinger\\'s bread (.43). The BLT and G, one of my favorite sandwich combos, comes with another of my favorites, guacamole, slathered all over it (.40). It\\'s only a slight stretch to call it, as Kramer does, \"pretty much a life-changing sandwich.\" Cobblestone\\'s surprise strong seller is the Donald DuPont, (named after the owner of the roofing company previously in the space): liverwurst served on Jewish rye, which Kramer says, is ordered largely by \"old men and attractive women.\" Go figure.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ghek4exezi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.21847,44.47569]}},{"properties":{"name":"Four Corners of the Earth. 310 Pine St. Burlington","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a> Tucked into the red stone-walled cellar of the historic Kilburn and Gates building, Four Corners of the Earth (310 Pine St., Burlington, 657-3869) has a very distinct personality with its quirky decor, music selection, and menu. Owner Ladislav Pancisin was pressing his sandwiches into warm submission before panini grills became as common as Quiznos around here. The menu is globally inspired and includes some uniquely tasty offerings, which do come with a wait at peak times. Highlights include the Cuban pork sandwich (.30) with roast pork tenderloin, tomato, pickles, and Swiss cheese and the Japanese tuna, unlike all other tuna salad and made with coarsely chopped, freshly grilled tuna, onions, pickles, and cheddar (.75). Vegetarians among others love the Jamaican avocado, which layers the buttery green slices with fresh basil and a hit of cayenne pepper (.50). Another favorite is the Iraqi Turkey, with turkey, pickles, onions, cheddar, and a sprinkle of curry powder and \"hot spice\" (.75). <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ghek4gkvy5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.21509,44.46956]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harrington's of Vermont, 5597 Shelburne Rd.

The sandwich menu is simple: their own very good thinly sliced smoked ham or turkey or imported Canadian smoked beef layered with veggies and a choice of sharp cheddar or Swiss cheese. The turkey is particularly good with their cranberry-orange relish and they also offer a BLT made with their own bacon (all .95). The focus here is the meat in the middle, as one might expect, but I recommend the Klinger\\'s bread options, not the soft, squishy alternatives they also offer. I also appreciate the nice dill pickle wedge that comes with the sandwiches.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ghekaop05h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.22911,44.37657]}},{"properties":{"name":"Marco's Pizzeria, 1301 Williston Rd.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a>A recent lunchtime crowd at Marco\\'s Pizzeria\\'s (4109 Shelburne Road, Shelburne, 985-9895 and 1301 Williston Road, 658-5858) on Shelburne Road was ordering slices by the dozen, but I\\'ll stick with their very good sandwiches, which distinguish themselves through the fresh ciabatta bread they bake every morning.

Recently added sandwich ingredients include pesto, fresh mozzarella, and roasted red peppers, Martone says. \"We just keep adding more and more items. We must have at least 30 different types of sandwiches.\" Rolls are soft, but sturdy enough to handle the hefty fillings and, be forewarned, the sandwiches are really big. You can\\'t go wrong with a traditional Italian piled high with salami, capicola, and mortadella (.15/7.35) or the Vermonter with maple ham, maple turkey, and cheddar (.15/7.35). Martone himself is partial to a veggie option (pick any or all, from pickles to radishes to sprouts to hot peppers) with smoked gouda. \"I don\\'t get quite as groggy in the afternoon,\" he says. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ghek62g6ay"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.1095,44.49138]}},{"properties":{"name":"Radio Deli. 77 Pearl St. Burlington","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a>The original era of the Radio Deli (77 Pearl St., Burlington, 865-2288) is soon to be history as former local radio personalities and co-owners Louie Manno and Jim Condon finalize sale of the deli to neighbors Michael Neiderer and his business partner Pam Scanlon.

This is not to distract from the equally good, locally raised, grass-fed roast beef sandwich with green peppercorn mayonnaise, but the citrus-marinated slice of tofu marries so perfectly with the house-made pesto, dried cranberries, provolone, and soft but nutty Red Hen whole grain bread.

Starting with their famous bread baked fresh on premises every day (or baguettes and rolls from Red Hen), followed by turkey and roast beef roasted in-house, you just know that your sandwich will be good. The classic Red Onion with turkey, bacon, thinly sliced apples, red onion, smoked gruyere, and sundried tomato mayonnaise (.95) is justly adored by many, as are various daily specials including the Fall Classic (which made an unseasonable visit recently on a chilly day) with roast turkey, cheddar cheese, cranberry mayo, and homemade from-scratch stuffing using yesterday\\'s wheat bread (.95). \"It\\'s just like at your mother\\'s Thanksgiving table,\" says co-owner Paul Poss. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ghekexercf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.21243,44.47631]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Village Cup, Jericho","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\" href=\"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com\">Mjpowers</a>At The Village Cup (30 Route 15, Jericho, 899-1730), the chicken and tuna salad give a hint of the creativity up the sleeves of co-owners Kim Evans and her husband, Stephen Diffenderfer: the chicken salad has a touch of soy and capers, while the tuna salad is spiked with apple. You can create your own deli sandwich on Klinger\\'s bread or the bakery\\'s own baguettes, ciabatta, or focaccia, or you can pick from among their good standards like a grilled panini of roast beef and cheddar with horseradish mayonnaise (.95) or Justin\\'s Turkey Club (.95).
