A stately crystal chandelier hangs above the bar, imparting a sense of Old World elegance, while a suite of deconstructionist-chic chandeliers hangs nearby as a perfect counterbalance—clear Plexiglas and polished nickel glowing red on the inside. Designed by Italian maestro Bruno Rainaldi for the Florence-based design house Terzani, these ultra-cool chandeliers meld postmodern rigor with pure romantic whimsy. District’s designer, Bryce Amato, says: “The lighting is the whole inspiration for the space…. Combining old elements with new things adds character and brings up questions about memories and nostalgia.” If you want one of these Plexi beaut’s for your own lounge, Amato sells them for a ,250 a pop at <a href=\"http://amatojohnsondesign.com\">Amato Johnson Design.</a>)\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pt58tpdg4l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.683195,45.524608]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dots Cafe","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.wweek.com\" href=\"http://www.wweek.com\">Willametteweek</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/08/2/11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> 2521 SE Clinton St, PORTLAND, OR, 97202-1238Sure, the black velvet paintings, multicolored pendant lights, and to-die-for Grilled Cheese Deluxe get most of the ink when we write about this quintessentially Portland bar-restaurant, but don’t forget about the wallpaper.

The origins of this sculpture are obscure, but its contours are hard to miss: a 15-foot forearm and hand, its fingers raised in the Vitarka Mudra position of Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Made out of fiberglass, the giant hand is simultaneously quaint and monumental—in a Burning Man kind of way. As you drive by during the middle of a stressful day, it seems to say: “Stop! Breathe!

Architect Marvin Witt, 81, has been building commercial and industrial spaces in Portland since 1958, and he’s still working. Of the building’s signature steel gate, Witt says: “We were looking for something that would give the building a kind of recognition, and an entryway is important. How do you make an entry that says, ‘Come in, come through, right this way’? So we were looking for something decorative and interesting in that arched shape, and it just sort of happened.”\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pt58w0h1ip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.676892,45.49203]}},{"properties":{"name":"M Financial Plaza","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.wweek.com\" href=\"http://www.wweek.com\">Willametteweek</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/08/2/02.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Now this is corporate cool: Barcelona chairs and sofas by Mies van der Rohe set a sophisticated tone in the soaring lobby of mega-money firm M Financial Group HQ, just east of P.F.

Yes, the Episcopal Church has a tradition of red doorways (the color symbolizes the blood of Christ and is meant to protect parishioners from evil), but there’s something about the deep red hue and
