Beer selection leaves a bit to be desired, but it is a comedy club and they do go beyond just your standard macro selections so I can't complain. They also have the same drink service once you're inside the theater area as well.\n\nThe acts that ACME pulls in can vary pretty significantly and some nights will be better than others, but I've never come close to feeling I haven't gotten my money's worth. Speaking of getting your money's worth - join their Insider list for two free tickets a month or find an unsuspecting friend that has a birthday each month (as well as 4 other friends) and you can get in free. Also, for you college folks (or those still pretending to be in college), put down the beer bong or skip the toga party, grab your college ID, head to ACME and you get in for $5 almost all nights (I think there is an exception for one show on Friday and not valid Saturday) - it'll be an enjoyable night you'll actually remember.\n\nThe rotation usually goes as follows: ACME emcee/opening act (hit or miss), featured act (usually a seasoned local comedy vet) followed by the headliner (check their website - usually rope in a couple of good national acts each month).\n\nHecklers and bachelorette parties should head to Drink, Spin, Barfly or somewhere else where your annoying behavior is more likely to be tolerated.","id":"a7fwyeqsu9qp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2750269999401,44.9897169997464]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bryant-Lake Bowl","description":"Bryant-Lake Bowl\n810 West Lake St Minneapolis\nhttp://www.bryantlakebowl.com/\n$15\n\nFrom Jasmine L. on Yelp.com:\nI like most things about BLB.  Restaurant, bar, bowling, theater, umm, awesome combination.\n\nI like most of the food, although a little pricey, but remember that they use sustainable/quality ingredients, which is going to cost more.  Actually feel okay about eating meat here!  The burgers are delicious but don't expect fries, which drives me nuts - they have chips, no fries.  They also compost.  \n\nGood drink selection, a nice cheap date night on Monday nights (don't come starving though, portions aren't hefty for this meal when I've had it), and $2 tallboys if you ride your bike (bring in your helmet!).  \n\nI like the atmosphere inside here but not the outdoor seating, I dunno something about sitting in a line facing the street doesn't appeal to me.\n\nThe theater is especially great.  Go see Lili's Burlesque Review for a really great time!  I loved their show we saw.  They have an \"Underpants Show\" every month.  Also, a wide variety of other shows.    \n\nService is fine, they are usually pretty busy so it's not a get chatty with your server kind of place, which is fine with me.\n\nOh and obviously, bowling = sweet!\n\nIf BLB had fries and somewhat better service, they'd get a 5 all the way from me.","id":"a7fwyeh3qukq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2901650001822,44.948500999993]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chameleon Theater Circle","description":"Chameleon Theater Circle\n12600 Nicollet Avenue, Burnsville\nhttp://chameleontheatre.org/\n$15\n\nFrom the Chameleon Theater Cirlce's website:\nIncorporated January 9, 1998, A Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream was the first production for The Chameleon Theatre Circle.\n\nOur group stems from what we felt was a need for South of the River residents, both as participants and audience members, to be included in the same theatre scene as Downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul residents. Some of our productions may be unique in that until recently, we have had to go across the river to see.\n\nNow in our Thirteenth Season, 1940s Radio Hour is Chameleon's 73rd production! Chameleon has performed at the Minnesota Association of Community Theatres' MACT*Fest five times, performed at the Regional Level (AACT) four times (placing second in 2007), and at the National Level twice, placing third in the Nation in our first appearance! We have received 29 awards at State, Regional and National levels. Our production of Hair was featured on PBS. Eight New Play Contests have been held, which have provided Chameleon the opportunity to perform original works such as Are We There Yet? and Snowflake's Story. Variety Shows have been put on each fall, complete with entertainment, dining and a silent auction. A Playwright's In Residence program was started, which have brought us New and Nobler Life, Helena Handbasket and Paper Dolls from Timothy Braatz, and Love's Shadow on Snow from Rick Raasch. Company written plays, Death Penalty Puppetry and Monsters in America: Puppets of Mass Distraction, have been performed in the 2004 and 2006 Minnesota Fringe Festivals.\n\nOur goal from the beginning has been to offer quality and affordable theatre, and we've accomplished that on a remarkable scale. The Mission of The Chameleon Theatre Circle is to provide an engaging and complete experience to its audience through growth and development of all participants in a nurturing and unified environment. The Chameleon Theatre Circle is a 501(c)(3) company.","id":"a7fwyekivwct"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.279501556976,44.7739991052701]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hardcover Theater","description":"Hardcover Theater\n810 W Lake St, Minneapolis\nPerforms in the Bryant-Lake Theater\nhttp://www.hardcovertheater.org/main.php\n$14-18 (pay what you can)\n\nFrom Hardcover's website:\nHardcover Theater's mission is to create entertaining, thought-provoking, and stylistically original adaptations of literature for the stage.

It's a very old building and the bathrooms were a bit creepy to me.  I believe you turned on the light with a string??  And there were bugs crawling around on the walls.  As far as the theater itself, it was very small and I guess it didn't matter where you sat because you can see everything.  It's for a low budget production and I can't even remember the name of the show...so you know how memorable that was.

There is nothing really prestigious or fancy about it, but the local shows are fantastic.  I usually go there for Balls Cabernet, Minneapolis's longest held Cabernet show held every Saturday at Midnight. Local artists sing, dance, act, juggle, read poetry... the only rule is you have to be sober to preform.

It's a fully corporatized entertainment center; one that also hosts art shows. I'm surprised it's not called the 3M-Medtronic-Target Art Center.
