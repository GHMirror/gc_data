NOx includes nitrogen dioxide, which is a toxic gas, as well as creates ground-level ozone, the key ingredient of smog.  Usually, cars and trucks and coal-fired power plants are the largest sources of NOx pollution.  However, the coal mines in the Powder River Basin release huge amounts of NOx; nearly 19,000 tons annually, to be exact, and that's on the low end.  That's about five times as much as a medium-sized coal-fired power plant, making coal mines one of the largest source of NOx in Wyoming.\nBelow are the NOx emissions, in tons per year, from the mines, based on both low and high production scenarios.  The data comes from the BLM.
