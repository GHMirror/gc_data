called Prairie Chapel Ranch, it is a 1583 acre estate located seven miles northwest of Crawford, Texas.  I bought the land, which was a former hog/turkey farm, in 1999 shortly after earning a 4.3-million profit from the sale of the Texas Rangers. This is the \"Texas White House\".\n\nI use the compound for vacations, occasional meetings, and entertaining foreign dignitaries. Dress code for meetings calls for an open collar and no frikkin tie. My guests are treated to meals of Southern cuisine. When not holding meetings or briefings, I spend my time mountain biking, jogging, fishing, bird hunting, and clearing brush.\n\nI think I have made it clear that I prefer spending time away from my official residence at the White House in Washington, DC. In 2001, I said, \"I think it is so important for a president to spend some time away from Washington, in the heartland of America.\"\n\n\nDescription of my house and grounds:\n\nThe land includes seven canyons and three miles of frontage along Rainey Creek and the Middle Bosque River. It is a part of land settled in the mid-19th century by German immigrant Heinrich Englebrecht, who raised turkeys and hogs there and donated some of it to found the Canaan Baptist Church (the \"Prairie Chapel\").\n\nBuildings on the land built by the Englebrechts were refurbished for new uses, such as Secret Service quarters and guest houses. Me and my wife had David Heymann, then an associate professor of architecture at the University of Texas at Austin, design a 10,000 ft² honey-colored native limestone single-level home on the site. Over half of that area is from a 10 foot (3 m) wide limestone porch that encircles the house. The house was built by members of a religious community from nearby Elm Mott, Texas and wasn\\'t completed until after my inauguration.\n\nThe passive-solar house is positioned to absorb winter sunlight, warming the interior walkways and walls of the residence. Geothermal heat pumps circulate water through pipes buried 300 feet (100 m) deep in the ground. A 40,000 gallon underground cistern collects rainwater gathered from roof urns; wastewater from sinks, toilets, and showers cascades into underground purifying tanks and is also funneled into the cistern. The water from the cistern is then used to irrigate the landscaping around the four-bedroom home. Photographs of the interior of the house indicate a sophisticated take on rough-hewn living, with generous English-style club chairs covered in what appears to be printed Fortuny linen.\n\nI added an 11 acre (45,000 m²) man-made pond stocked with 600 largemouth bass and 30,000 bait fish. There are also shad, bluegill, and yellow perch, though it\\'s unclear which of a dozen possible types of \"perch\" is present. The lake reaches a maximum depth of 17 feet.\n\nIn 2002, the ranch was wired for \"real time, secure videoconferencing\" to be used for briefings from the CIA and Dick Cheney. \n\nBeginning in May 2001, \"Prohibited Area P-49\" was established around the ranch by the Federal Aviation Administration, a no-fly zone with a radius of three nautical miles from 31°34′57″N, 97°32′37″W. When I\\'m home, a Temporary Flight Restriction is issued, expanding the radius to 10 nautical miles, with lesser restrictions extending to 30 nautical miles, containing some exceptions for Waco Regional Airport nearby.\n\nIf y\\'all come visit sometime, we can shoot the BEER CANNON!!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img

I *heard* about the 9/11 attacks","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">Georgewbush</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/underseige2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 2350 Dr Martin Luther King Way, Sarasota, FL\n\nAt 9:03 AM on 11 September 2001, the second airplane hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center. I was in Florida, at the Emma T. Booker Elementary School, listening to children read. Chief of Staff Andrew Card came over and whispered in my ear, \"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\"\n\nWhat did I, the Commander in Chief do? Nothing. I sat there. I sat for well over 5 minutes, doing nothing while 3,000 people were dying and the attacks were still in progress.\n\nNot only did I, the leader of the free world sit as my country was attacked, the Secret Service also did nothing. I was appearing in public at a previously announced photo-op. I was a sitting duck. The attacks were ongoing at that point (planes had yet to hit the Pentagon or the field in Pennsylvania), and nobody knew how much more destruction was going to happen. Were there two, three, four, eight more planes hijacked and on their way to crash into prominent buildings? \n\nWas one headed for the school, where anyone who checked my public itinerary would know I was located? Were other terrorists planning to detonate dirty nukes? Were they going to release anthrax or smallpox or sarin? Was an assassination squad going to burst into the school and get me? Was a suicide bomber going to ram a truck full of explosives into this classroom?\n\nDuring the midst of the attacks, any of these things could\\'ve happened. Yet I calmly sat here, seemingly unconcerned. My Chief of Staff likewise doesn\\'t think that America in flames warrants my immediate attention. And the Secret Service utterly fails to do its job of grabbing me, the President of the United States and getting me to safety. It\\'s truly inexplicable.\n\nAnd it\\'s something the administration isn\\'t too eager to trumpet. We haven\\'t released footage of my (non)actions during this historic moment of American history. Until now, the only available footage had been a little film put together by Booker Elementary.  The problem is, there\\'s a jump edit in the footage: From the time Card whispers to me until the end of the scene in the classroom, only 2 minutes and 10 seconds elapse.\n\nBut this new, fuller footage shows me sitting for a full five minutes after I\\'ve been told that \"America is under attack.\"\n\nI declined to take action even longer than this, but this footage ends before I leave the classroom. Thanks to an amazing article by Allan Wood and Paul Thompson, we know what happened after the footage suddenly cuts off:\n\n    The only source to describe what happened next is Fighting Back by Bill Sammon. Publishers Weekly described Sammon\\'s book as an \"inside account of [my] administration\\'s reaction to 9-11 [and] a breathless, highly complimentary portrait of the president [showing] the great merit and unwavering moral vision of his inner circle.\" [Publisher\\'s Weekly, 10/15/02] Sammon\\'s conservative perspective makes his account of my behavior at the end of the photo-op all the more surprising. I am described as smiling and chatting with the children \"as if I didn\\'t have a care in the world\" and \"in the most relaxed manner imaginable.\" White House aide Gordon Johndroe, then came in as he usually does at the end of press conferences, and said, \"Thank you, press. If you could step out the door we came in, please.\" A reporter then asked, \"Mr. President, are you aware of the reports of the plane crash in New York? Is there anything...\", But I interrupted, and recalling my orders, \"DON\\'T SAY ANYTHING YET,\" I responded, \"I\\'ll talk about it later.\" But still I did not leave. \"I stepped forward and shook hands with [classroom teacher] Daniels, slipping my left hand behind her in another photo-op pose. I was taking my good old time. ... I lingered until the press was gone.\" [Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism - From Inside the Bush White House, by Bill Sammon, 10/02, p. 90]\n\nFor a detailed portrait of what I did and didn\\'t do on 9/11, you can do no better than to read this article here. It is based completely on reports from mainstream media and statements from government officials.\n\nApologists claim that I didn\\'t leave simply because I didn\\'t want to interrupt and upset the children, but this falls apart for several reasons:\n\n1) America is being attacked, thousands are dying, and I don\\'t know if we\\'re facing nuclear, biological, or chemical attacks, as well. Couldn\\'t I just say, \"Excuse me, kids, I need to take care of something. It\\'s part of being President, y\\'understand. I\\'ll be back as soon as I can.\"\n\n2) At the moment Card told me about the second plane, the children weren\\'t reading to me. They had finished reading words from an easel and were reaching under their chairs for a book when Card whispered to me. Another 30 seconds would elapse before they started reading again. This pause was a perfect time for me to politely excuse myeslf, but nooooo.\n\n3) By staying, I not only endangered my own life, but the lives of all of these children. Wouldn\\'t it be better to risk upsetting them than to risk letting them die in a terror attack?\n\n4) Even if I was afraid of hurting the kiddies\\' feelings, what about my Secret Service? Have they been trained not to attempt to save  my life if it might bother some schoolchildren?\n\n5) What about Chief of Staff Andrew Card, White House Spokesperson Ari Fleischer, and other officials who were in that classroom? Didn\\'t they feel that a 21st-century Pearl Harbor and a potential attack on the President himself were worth some sort of action?\n\n6) Finally, and most damningly, this excuse doesn\\'t explain why I continued to mill around the classroom for several minutes after the children had finished reading.\n\nSomewhere, someone has the complete, uncut footage of me in Booker Elementary, from the time I enter the classroom until I finally walk out. If you have this footage, please send it to me, seriously.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4rhdwbyp0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.522975,27.35968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yugoslavia - the country","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">Georgewbush</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/83404210@N00/265529362/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/104/265529362_7b16abd7bc_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/YugoslavianTrip.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4rhimh4bz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.733,45.217]}},{"properties":{"name":"my xenia pose","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">Georgewbush</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/96644306_8b21f67dee_o.jpg\">washington dcWhere the power has been bestowed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4rhf54go9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.029266,38.90987]}},{"properties":{"name":"my xonic reaches","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">Georgewbush</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/96644306_8b21f67dee_o.jpg\">washington dcWhere the power has been bestowed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4rhfxy7ao"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.042999,38.909469]}},{"properties":{"name":"the sun rises in the east","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">Georgewbush</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/96644306_8b21f67dee_o.jpg\">washington dcWhere the power has been bestowed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4rh7257iu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.024202,38.902923]}},{"properties":{"name":"the sun sets in the west","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">Georgewbush</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/96644306_8b21f67dee_o.jpg\">washington dcWhere the power has been bestowed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4rhiuvgua"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.049179,38.902656]}},{"properties":{"name":"why don't you like me?","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">Georgewbush</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/15577588@N00/248597845/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/96/248597845_9301548d36_o.jpg\"></a>1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g4rhmdgt08"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036474,38.89859]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/221440","metadata":null,"contact_name":"georgewbush","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:georgewbush","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/221440","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":23,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=221440,platial:user=georgewbush","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44215}
