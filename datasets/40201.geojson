Beat the eggs with 1 1/2 teaspoons water in another small shallow pan or dish. Spread the bread crumbs in another narrow pan. Season both sides of the fillets with salt and pepper and dredge them in the flour, dusting off the excess. Dip the fillets one at a time into the eggs, coating both sides, then place on the bread crumbs and toss some of the crumbs over the fish; turn and press lightly so that the crumbs adhere. Place on a large baking rack or pan.\n\nHeat a large heavy saute pan over medium-high heat, then add the oil and butter. Once it is very hot, add the flounder skin-side down. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until golden, about 4 minutes (do not turn too soon). Turn and cook until just opaque throughout, 3 to 5 minutes, depending upon the thickness; do not overcook. Transfer to a pan lined with paper towels, then transfer to a warm platter. Garnish with lemon wedges and pass a sauce gribiche or tartar. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k8moayd7mq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.796097,33.500509]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gough Street","description":"Posted by Mefestus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 2222 Gough St, Baltimore, MDChip lived here while he went to graduate school at Johns Hopkins.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k8mo6gj5g9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.585313,39.288104]}},{"properties":{"name":"Heathermoor Drive","description":"Posted by Mefestus2624 Heathermoor Dr., Birmingham, AL 35213This is where Elizabeth lived from 3rd grade through high school.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k8mo5o185m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.768684,33.483582]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nashville, TN","description":"Posted by Mefestus2201 West End Avenue, Nashville, TNChip went to college at Vanderbilt University.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k8mnvfl69b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.803517,36.149183]}},{"properties":{"name":"Point Reyes Cheese CO","description":"Posted by Jschwaber14700 State Route 1 North, Point Reyes Station, CA, 94956Point Reyes Cheese CO 415-663-8880<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k8mnxzsksp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.810469,38.063921]}},{"properties":{"name":"Prosser Avenue","description":"Posted by Mefestus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1831 Prosser Avenue, Los Angeles, CAChip lived here for the first couple of years in Los Angeles.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k8mo6ldaz9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.42912,34.053111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Roanoke, VA","description":"Posted by Mefestus24020Elizabeth went to college at Hollins University.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6k8mo77f6ry"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.942222,37.355278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rogue Creamery","description":"Posted by Alyss05<img src=\"http://www.roguecreamery.com/images/products/Medium%20-%20Oregon%20Blue%20Vein.jpg\">311 N Front Street, Central Point, ORCheese from Oregon, what could be better.
