The track line(s) are not a forecast product, however, and because there are an infinite number of ways to connect a set of forecast points, the lines should not be interpreted as representing a specific forecast for the location of a tropical cyclone in between official forecast points.  It is also important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, and that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the center.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"STORMNUM":{"max":8.0,"mean":8.0,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":8.0,"median":8.0},"FCSTPRD":{"max":120.0,"mean":96.0,"variance":1152.0,"stdev":33.9411254969543,"min":72.0,"median":120.0},"ADVISNUM":{"max":null,"min":null,"median":null}},"features":[{"properties":{"STORMNUM":8.0,"STORMNAME":"HANNA","STORMTYPE":"HU","BASIN":"al","TIMEZONE":"UTC","ADVDATE":"080901/1730","FCSTPRD":72.0,"id":"a6201akqy9lh","ADVISNUM":"19","ISSSTATUS":"O"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-72.5999984741211,22.3999996185303],[-73.3000030517578,22.3999996185303],[-73.6999969482422,22.5],[-74.1999969482422,22.7999992370605],[-74.9000015258789,23.7000007629395],[-77.5,26.5]]}},{"properties":{"STORMNUM":8.0,"STORMNAME":"HANNA","STORMTYPE":"HU","BASIN":"al","TIMEZONE":"UTC","ADVDATE":"080901/1730","FCSTPRD":120.0,"id":"a6201aghhu56","ADVISNUM":"19","ISSSTATUS":"O"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-72.5999984741211,22.3999996185303],[-73.3000030517578,22.3999996185303],[-73.6999969482422,22.5],[-74.1999969482422,22.7999992370605],[-74.9000015258789,23.7000007629395],[-77.5,26.5],[-80.5,30.5],[-82.0,36.5]]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgisprods.shtml","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"National Weather Service - National Hurricane Center","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgisprods.shtml","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":2,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"hannah,hurrican,noaa,storm","published":"2008-09-01T12:00:00Z","id":4271}
