In addition to our 10,000 square foot game room, lots of attendees set up games in their rooms and invite others inside.\nPerhaps most importantly, MAGFest has a huge focus on game music -- multiple concerts' worth -- filled with video game music tributes, some even with the original composers! On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, multiple bands will perform on our main stage, and our JamSpace room is open 24 hours for collaborative music and special treats alike.\nWant to pre-register? <a href=\"http://magfest.org/prereg\">http://magfest.org/prereg</a>\nWant to staff?  <a href=\"http://magfest.org/volunteer\">http://magfest.org/volunteer</a>\nReserve a room: <a href=\"http://magfest.org/getaroom\">http://magfest.org/getaroom</a>\nWant to use a phone thingy?

Witherspoon's resume spans over four decades and his performances in blockbuster movies, hit-television shows, and top-rated music videos have left an impression on legions of fans who instantly recognize his signature catchphrases like \"Bang!Bang!Bang!Bang!\" \"You gotta co-ordinate!\" and \"Don't nobody go in the bathroom...\"\nAccording to the Orange County Register, John's expressive talent puts him in a class of his own. \"Witherspoon is one of those performers who doesn't need a funny line to be funny. Just standing there in a truculent posture with a suspicious look, he is funny and enlivens every scene he's in.\" The Detroit-bred comic has proven that he is a Hollywood mainstay and continues to land coveted spots in some of America's favorite movies and television shows. Witherspoon continues to tour around the country with his wildly popular stand-up show, plus he's recently launched The John Witherspoon Collection, a complete line of humorous greeting cards called Spoon Cards.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8139175/DC/Washington-DC/John-Witherspoon-from-quotThe-Boondocksquot-quotHouse-Partyquot-and-the-quotFridayquot-trilogy/DC-Improv-Comedy-Club/","id":"a62dvqyvwoa4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.041,38.9051]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8082666/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Wicked, the Broadway Musical at Kennedy Center Opera House","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/16 18:26:09 -0400","original":"2011-05-16T15:26:08-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/16 18:26:08 -0400"},"description":"Find all dates and times for this exciting broadway musical being held June 16 through Aug. 21.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8082666/DC/Washington/Wicked-the-Broadway-Musical/Kennedy-Center-Opera-House/","id":"a62dvr0fqoms"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0549,38.8973]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7710478/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Down to the Bone at Birchmere","published":{"end_time":"2011/02/02 13:48:08 -0500","original":"2011-02-02T11:48:07-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/02/02 13:48:07 -0500"},"description":"","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7710478/DC/Alexandria-VA/Down-to-the-Bone/Birchmere/","id":"a62dvr4pzi5w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0622,38.8392]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8155948/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Chicago Cubs at Washington Nationals at Nationals Park","published":{"end_time":"2011/06/22 19:21:04 -0400","original":"2011-06-22T16:21:03-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/06/22 19:21:03 -0400"},"description":"The Washington Nationals take on the Chicago Cubs in this MLB matchup.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8155948/DC/Washington/Chicago-Cubs-at-Washington-Nationals/Nationals-Park/","id":"a62dvqsfq6by"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9866,38.8777]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8087415/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Washington Nationals vs. Chicago Cubs at Nationals Park","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/18 00:59:23 -0400","original":"2011-05-17T21:59:22-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/18 00:59:22 -0400"},"description":"Event: Washington Nationals vs. Chicago CubsVenue: Nationals ParkStart: 7/7/2011 7:05:00 PMCategory: SPORTS BASEBALL","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8087415/DC/Washington-DC/Washington-Nationals-vs-Chicago-Cubs/Nationals-Park/","id":"a62dvr40r79e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0087,38.8719]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7937210/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Bela Fleck and the Flecktones With Abigail Washburn at Pier Six Concert Pavilion","published":{"end_time":"2011/03/27 16:03:36 -0400","original":"2011-03-27T13:03:35-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/03/27 16:03:35 -0400"},"description":"","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7937210/MD/Baltimore/Bela-Fleck-and-the-Flecktones-With-Abigail-Washburn/Pier-Six-Concert-Pavilion/","id":"a62dvr2vzjez"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.6044,39.285]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8000015/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Jammin Java’s Mid-Atlantic Band Battle 5 at Jammin Java","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/22 20:31:17 -0400","original":"2011-04-22T17:31:16-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/22 20:31:16 -0400"},"description":"Jammin Java presents The FIFTH Mid-Atlantic Band Battle.
