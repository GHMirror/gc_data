I went into the hole in the wall Mexican food place that was there at the truckstop and had nachos that really hit the spot. After talking to a few truckers, as I was trying to catch a ride out of there, I ended up calling it a night, and found a place to crash out.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eqi649yrf2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.333925247,36.153469467]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day Four: Broken and Restored","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\" href=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\">Joshuaratliff</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> After having missed the voice of the Spirit, walking an extra two miles in the heat, having to carry Yasha back because she was too tired, and finally realizing what had just taken place, I was humbled, I repented, and was filled with joy. He wrapped His arms around me and made me to know that I just needed to trust Him, to wait on Him. He would lead me if I would just be patient and allow Him to. My excuse had been that I was tired, I found that this is maybe an even more important time to listen as I had to walk a whole lot farther because of not listening. I waited about an hour before Nathan stopped to pick me up on his way home from work.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eqi6ciovp2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.36326313,38.3757958093]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day Four: Final Resting Place","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\" href=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\">Joshuaratliff</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> When day four was over I crashed hard. I ended up sleeping in a model shed in a Lowes parking lot. I don\\'t know how illegal it was, but I felt like that was where I was supposed to stay, so... whatever. Day four was long and hard, and I learned my hardest and maybe most crucial lesson yet. Pretty awesome! Yahuah is so good.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eqi65kdrq6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.883598328,37.5238862196]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day Four: Realizing I Had Missed It","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\" href=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\">Joshuaratliff</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Yasha and I had walked all day, and we were so incredibly tired. At the on ramp before I felt like I was supposed to stand there and wait, but because of my impatience didn\\'t wait for very long and ended up walking an extra couple of miles. It was only another mile before we took a nap on the side of the road. When we woke up, I realized that I still couldn\\'t get on the Highway (pedestrians prohibited), and the only other options were backwards or dead ends. Let me say I was quite distraught. I called by dad and we prayed for direction. After hanging up the phone I felt it was time to turn back, and go to the same place that I felt that I was supposed to wait before. On the walk back I was pretty broken before the Lord. I repented and asked for forgiveness for having not listened and not waiting on Him. I don\\'t think that my disobedience had any real impact on anyone other than myself, because I think that this was factored into the trip. Yahuah used this to reveal that I still had some preconceived ideas and expectations as to how things would go. Praise God for hard lessons.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eqi6a2llqo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.351032257,38.3634643307]}},{"properties":{"name":"Day Three: Final Resting Place","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\" href=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\">Joshuaratliff</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\">  This is where day three ended as I curled up with Yasha behind a new unoccupied structure near the Starbucks that Shawn and I had walked to. Shawn was a guy that I had met during the day, and we talked for about four hours or so.

I only had to carry Yasha half of the time today... her foot was way better (thanks everybody for the pray). I was sitting at Mcdonalds uploading yesterday\\'s update, when this guy commented on my laptop, and then asked what I was using it for. I began talking to him, gave him a card and a pack of Speakables, and then I let him have it. I don\\'t usually get to talk to people like that, but he drew it out of me. It was so awesome to meet a brother with an amazing testimony, and craves for more.

The main pad on her front right foot was really swollen after walking so far on day one. We got picked up by a guy named Joseph after eating lunch at subway. The ride was greatly appreciated...

Actually I slept under the board walk just a few feet from the water. Not such a bad place to sleep, would\\'ve been better if it was flat, but hey, I\\'m not complaining. I met a guy, Harry, who claimed not to be homeless and just traveling around, anyways, he seemed nice enough. I gave him a pack of Speakables, the rest of a bag of jerky, and a couple of granola bars. We talked about a bunch of stuff, but he was a little to drunk to go into the gospel too much. \n\nOverall, it was a great day filled with walking, talking, frustration, and the peace and comfort of Eyahuah.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eqi66dv9fh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.505881548,38.5844467214]}},{"properties":{"name":"Drop off day one","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\" href=\"http://crazychristcraver.com\">Joshuaratliff</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/08/0/grandma%5C's_pics_004.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is the actual starting point of my trip on 8/2/09.

It was such a blessing to have a nice comfy bed to sleep in and to get cleaned up (both me and my clothes... nice not to be so stinky lol). I got to talk and share a little with John, and hearing what he\\'s been through broke me.
