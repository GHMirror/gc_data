It\\'s such a great, human-scale town. Nice people, nice atmosphere, great food. Sergio\\'s is an example of what I mean. It\\'s exactly like the Italian stores my mother took us to as kids. Her favorite was the Italian Food Center on Grand Street in NYC and I think Sergio can go toe to toe with that place any day. They have great home made Mozzarella. They have wonderful bread. The cold cuts are the premium brands and their salads are fresh and made in house. They have daily specials that are put up on a chalk board - just like you would if you owned a place like this. My favorite dish is a regular sandwich made with either grilled or breaded and fried chicken, mozzarella, peppers on a semolina roll (I think it\\'s a number 7). My wife and i split one for lunch on Saturdays - dousing it with balsamic vinegar and washing it down with San Pelligrino. Try it, you\\'ll like it.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6yqg6f82umh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.477455,40.892193]}},{"properties":{"name":"St Joseph's Preparatory School","description":"Posted by Dougherj<img src=\"http://www.sjprep.org/FileUploads/stjoeprep_083.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\">  1735 Girard Ave, Philadelphia, PAMy, my son, my father &amp; brother\\'s Prep school<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6yqg6org9rv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.164837,39.97231]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. John Gourmet","description":"Posted by Dougherj210 St. John St., HdG 21078210 St. John St., HdG 21078\r\n410-939-3663\r\nwebsite: www.stjohngourmet.com\r\nChef owned and operated gourmet deli.
