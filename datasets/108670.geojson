GEBCO operates under the\njoint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic\nCommission (IOC) of UNESCO. See our web site for more information about GEBCO www.gebco.net.\nThe GEBCO_08 Grid is a global grid of elevation data at 30 arc-second intervals. This data set is available\nas a Web Map Service (WMS) for use as imagery in your applications. The bathymetric portion of the grid\nwas largely generated from a database of ship-track soundings with interpolation between soundings guided by\nsatellite-derived gravity data. However, in areas where they improve on the existing GEBCO_08 Grid, data\nsets generated by other methods have been included. Further information can be found in the documentation that\naccompanies the data set and is available from www.gebco.net.\nWithin the GEBCO_08 grid land elevation data is taken from the 30 arc-second version of the Shuttle Radar Topography\nMission data set (SRTM30). The imagery for land areas in this WMS, north of 60 degrees south, is largely taken from\nthe NASA Blue Marble: Next Generation data set, produced by Reto Stockli, NASA Earth Observatory, the NASA Goddard\nSpace Flight Center (http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble). For land areas south of 60 degrees south,\ncoastline and ice shelf information is taken from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Antarctic\nDigital Database coastline dataset (http://www.add.scar.org:8080/add/).\nInformation on how to download the GEBCO_08 can be found at www.gebco.net.\nPlease note that the GEBCO_08 Grid is mainly a deeper water data set and does not contain detailed bathymetry in\nshallower water areas.\nThis WMS has been developed by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) on behalf of the GEBCO community.","is_temporal":false,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"limit":1000000,"total":0},"author":{"metadata":"","contact_name":"Pauline Weatherall","url":"","contact_address":"        postal\n        Joseph Proudman Building\n        Liverpool\n        Merseyside\n        L3 5DA\n        UK\n     Email: enquiries@bodc.ac.uk","contact_phone":"+44 (0)151 795 4800","source":"British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC)"},"source":"","process_notes":"EPSG:4326,,EPSG:3395","data_type":"WMS","url_type":"wms","permissions":[{"group_id":"everyone","permissions":{"download":true,"view":true}}],"classification":null,"tags":"","id":108670,"contributor":{"name":"jnpoussart","url":"http://geocommons.com/users/10188"}}
