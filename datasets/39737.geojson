This great Norman stronghold and bridgehead into Wales was the first castle with a stone keep to be built in Britain by the conquering Normans in 1070. \"Knight\\'s Fee\" manors and castles like Penhow were established to protect the outlying farmlands and give advance warning of any Welsh uprising. The area that is now known as Gwent was settled by families that had come over from France with or in the wake of William the Conqueror, and we know that Sir Roger de St Maur was at Penhow by 1129, for he witnessed the charter that founded the priory of Monmouth in that year. In return for the task of keeping down the Welsh, providing a quota of men for guard duty at Chepstow every month, and for supplying one man mounted on a horse in times of War, Sir Roger was permitted to usurp the Manor of Penhow from its native Welsh prince, and gain a toehold on the feudal ladder. Sir Roger\\'s home was a cold stone Pele tower that stood alone on its rocky knoll, and directly overlooked the conquered natives in their \\'Welshry\\' at Talgarth. It was the first home in Britain of a family destined to become one of the greatest in the land. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a625hiyi0lkr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.833743,51.614179]}},{"properties":{"name":"Prince Edward Theatre","description":"Posted by Jfitts<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/princeet_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Prince Edward Theatre, LondonMary Poppins Musical<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a625himdzplu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.130865,51.513477]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sherwood Forest","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://moblog.co.uk/blogs/1703/moblog_a89c981dcdf97.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/81593455@N00/250739866/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/109/250739866_315236c68c_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/81593455@N00/250739191/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/98/250739191_7edb62b565_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The place of legend.
