We got to the place before the sunrise and the baboons just woke up, in the mean time when I waited for a better light and for the baboons to wake up I saw the sunrise and I took this picture. Later I took really good pictures of the baboons and it was amazing because they were every where around climbing, jumping, checking who is the strange people and after 40 minutes they just left us.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shaharbar/5693948014/","id":"a67wljzt3tc3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.826797,-17.925577]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5561885843","title":"Sunset over the Chobe River","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/29 17:52:16 -0400","original":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 14:52:15 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/29 17:52:15 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/26384082@N04/\">David &amp; Cheryl M</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/26384082@N04/5561885843/\" title=\"Sunset over the Chobe River\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5561885843_ddcef084b2_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"161\" alt=\"Sunset over the Chobe River\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/26384082@N04/5561885843/","id":"a67wlk34z79l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.150108,-17.79789]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5648487906","title":"9J-YCB_Livingstone_6786","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/23 23:40:40 -0400","original":"Sat, 23 Apr 2011 20:40:39 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/23 23:40:39 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/zk-ngj/\">ZK-NGJ</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/zk-ngj/5648487906/\" title=\"9J-YCB_Livingstone_6786\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5648487906_696036fba4_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"9J-YCB_Livingstone_6786\"></a>\n\n9J-YCB 15 September 2010 - flying over the Zambezi River","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/zk-ngj/5648487906/","id":"a67wlk1tba2l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.855064,-17.855795]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5615739056","title":"Baby River Turtle","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/13 02:55:35 -0400","original":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 23:55:34 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/13 02:55:34 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/philips_images/\">philip158</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/philips_images/5615739056/\" title=\"Baby River Turtle\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5067/5615739056_91494449dd_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"176\" alt=\"Baby River Turtle\"></a>\n\nThis little fellow was still really small about 5-7cm in length, must have been vary dangerous for him in the big Zambezi River where I took this photograph.
