Thus, most of the country's fresh water resources were inter-connected into the National Water Carrier, commissioned in 1964. The National Water Carrier supplies a blend of surface and groundwater. Water not required by consumers is recharged into the aquifer through spreading basins and dual-purpose wells. Recharging of aquifers helps to prevent evaporation losses and, in the coastal area, intrusion of seawater. The National Water Carrier supplies a total of 1,000 major consumers, including 18 municipalities and 80 local authorities.\n\n        With the completion of the National Water Carrier project in 1964, some 80 percent of its water was allocated for agriculture, and 20 percent for drinking water. However, as time passed, an increasing percentage was consumed as drinking water, so that by the early 1990’s the Carrier was supplying half of the drinking water in Israel. According to forecasts, by the year 2010 some 80 percent of the Carrier water will be used for drinking purposes. The reasons for the forecast growth in the share of the total Carrier water consumed as drinking water are:\n        - Population growth in Israel, primarily in the center of the country.\n        - Increased domestic water use, due to a rising standard of living.\n\n        Diverted 320 Mm3/year from the Upper Jordan","begin time":null,"id":"9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.56667,32.63333]}},{"properties":{"end time":null,"timestamp":{"end_time":"1951/01/02 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1951-01-01","granularity":"day","time":"1951/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"name":"Jordan announced a plan to divert water from the Yarmuk River","description":"In 1951, Jordan announced a plan to divert water from the Yarmuk River in order to irrigate the East Ghor of the Jordan Valley.
