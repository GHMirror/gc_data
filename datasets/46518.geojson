The idea is to use this map as a way to share this information with others who find it necessary to adhere to a GF diet. If you deem this a useful endeavor, please consider adding places to this map or creating your own map for another city. Eventually, I think it'd be nice to have these maps available for all major cities, to be used by current residents looking for new places to eat, and by visitors, to make it easier to find GF foods while traveling.\n\nNote: The foods listed here are those that I've tested by eating myself.
