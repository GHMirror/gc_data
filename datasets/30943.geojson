First planned as a commuter suburb, The City of Takoma Park was founded in 1883 by Benjamin Franklin Gilbert along the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.\n\nThe City was incorporated in 1890 and is governed by the City Council, with a Mayor and six Councilmembers employing the Council/Manager form of government.\n\nThe City of Takoma Park has 17,229 residents, as of the 2000 census. These citizens are unusually diverse in age, ethnicity, language, economic condition, and length of residence. We are also the home of many writers, musicians, and artists.\n\t\nTakoma Park\n\nThe residents of Takoma Park have joined together in many churches, neighborhood associations, civic groups, and arts organizations. We have concerts, exhibits, political crusades, dances, neighborhood parties, quilting bees, and volunteer action projects.\n\nOver seven hundred businesses and non-profit organizations are located in Takoma Park, most of them small.\n\nTakoma Park is a sanctuary city, an official \"Tree City, USA\", and is also widely known as Azalea City. It is a nuclear free zone, has an award-winning recycling program, and supports the work of historic preservation groups. Residents who are not yet U.S. citizens may vote in local elections and hold local elective office. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698ncxz22va"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0114994049,38.9854330883]}},{"properties":{"name":"Clarice Smith Center for the Performing Arts UMD","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698nd5rkl5w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9466543198,38.9935387037]}},{"properties":{"name":"Columbia Union College","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/3/GatewayCUC.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> very college or university has a distinctive atmosphere.\n\n\nA unique vision shapes the character of an institution and makes it particularly appealing to students.\n\nColumbia Union Colleges is a small private college near the nation’s capital with deeply-felt Christian roots. As a result, the college displays excellence in terms of its own distinctiveness, with an emphasis on classes that are smaller and taught by professors who bring not only the kind of technical capability you would expect at a college at the nation’s capital, but also a strong sense of mission. This translates into a more personal style of teaching, where students are not lost in the shuffle, as is possible in larger institutions.\n\nAlso, because we are located at the nation’s capital, our classes take on a distinctive excitement due to the resources available. For example, where in another part of the country a class might talk about a Supreme Court decision, our students can visit the Court and listen to the testimony and watch history being made. Where in another part of the country a class might study about a foreign culture, our students can actually hop on the Metro and go down and visit the embassy.\n\nThe fact that we’re a Christian college with a distinctive emphasis on service (our motto is \"Gateway to Service\") means that students also have opportunities, here, to explore their own spiritual journey in ways that are wholly supportive. We believe this adds value to the college experience that is transformational in its nature.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698nd7m67wj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0011997223,38.9871677014]}},{"properties":{"name":"Comcast Center at UMD","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698ndapiy9k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9418478012,38.9944726244]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fort Totten Square (proposed) 2012","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698nd7y6p35"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0023584366,38.9581740691]}},{"properties":{"name":"Giant Food at PG Metro","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/1/Giant_at_PG_Metro.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> The Washington Post\n\nRetail Near Metro in Hyattsville\n\nBy Dana Hedgpeth\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, October 31, 2005; \n\nThere are more than a dozen Metro stations in Prince George\\'s County, but unlike at stops in Fairfax and Montgomery counties, there is no private development near the stations on land owned by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\n\nThat\\'s about to change. Prince George\\'s County officials and developers held a groundbreaking ceremony last week to mark what will be the first private mixed-use development of office, residential and retail on about 20 acres owned by WMATA at the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station near East West Highway and Belcrest Road in Hyattsville.\n\t\n\nThe 60 million project will be developed in phases over the next three years. It will include a 300,000-square-foot office building and 260 luxury apartments, which will rent for ,500 to ,700 a month. It also will have about 130,000 square feet of retail, including a Staples, Bally\\'s Total Fitness and Circuit City, according to the lead developer of the project, Taylor Development and Land Co. of Miami. The developer also plans restaurants and other small shops for the center.\n\nThe project comes as the area\\'s retail offerings are starting to improve, with the multimillion-dollar renovation of the Mall at Prince George\\'s and the addition of movie theaters and a grocery store at the nearby University Town Center project.\n\nConstruction on the retail part of the new complex will start in the first quarter of next year and be completed in the second quarter of 2007. Residential construction will start in the next month and be done in 2 1/2 years, according to MCF Investment Co. of Silver Spring, which is doing that part of the project.\n\nWork on the large office building will begin in the first quarter of 2007, and Taylor Development officials said they are seeking a federal government agency as a lead tenant for that building. The developers will lease the land from WMATA for 99 years.\n\n\"We\\'re excited we\\'re at a point where we can get moving on our project and get it built,\" said Jennifer Rademacher, a vice president at Taylor Development.\n\nIn the same way that many Prince George\\'s residents express chagrin that their county lacks high-end and fashionable retailers, county officials and local developers have shown frustration that their county has not seen the intense development that has grown up around such Metro stations as Ballston in Arlington and Grosvenor in Montgomery County.\n\nSome say the uncertainty of the market in Prince George\\'s made developers leery of doing deals. Others privately blame WMATA for being bureaucratic and cumbersome in how it does its land deals, although they said they are nervous about criticizing the agency publicly because they want to land future deals with it.\n\n\"For market reasons, developers headed to other parts of the region,\" said Rosalyn Doggett, a senior development staffer at WMATA.\n\nAt least five other projects are planned on WMATA-owned land in Prince George\\'s, according to WMATA officials. There are 15 Metro stations in the county.\n\n\"Developers realize we have sizeable sites in Prince George\\'s County,\" Doggett said. \"There\\'s greater interest in transit-oriented developments because people don\\'t want to drive so far anymore.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698ndcfp0vr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9586277008,38.9659908398]}},{"properties":{"name":"Green Hill Overseer’s\tHouse","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 6606 22nd Place.

Later, Green Hill \nwas the country house of George Washington Riggs, \nfounder of Riggs National Bank, and since 1960 has \nbeen headquarters for the Pallottine Seminary. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698nd3lyiy9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.977165,38.972381]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pierre L'Enfant, planner of Washington, DC,  died here in 1825","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/2/150px_L%5C'Enfant_plan.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/2/L_enfant.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> L’Enfant was not paid for his work and fell into disgrace, spending much of the rest of his life trying to persuade Congress to pay what he felt he was owed.

But ideas are still in the early stages.\n\nAbout two years ago, the city of Hyattsville got the ball rolling. The City Council voted to establish a marketing task force, which last year released a new logo and slogan -- A World Within Walking Distance -- for the city.\n\nHyattsville, once known for its collection of car dealerships along Route 1, is also commonly misidentified as a large \"Hyattsville area\" -- sometimes identified with crime, Mr. Gardiner said. In reality, it\\'s a three-square-mile city with 18,000 residents.\n\n\"We need to toot our horn a little bit and make sure people understand there is a small, incorporated community -- the city of Hyattsville, which has a lot to offer in terms of the diverse housing stock, people from around the world and walkable communities,\" Mr. Gardiner said. \"Not to take away from the other areas around us, but we want to try to make sure people know the incorporated community of Hyattsville has its own identity.\"\n\nThe developers clearly have an incentive to help the city refine its image, too.\n\nThe city \"would really like to see a branding of that area [on East-West Highway]. We would, too; it helps the whole area,\" said Jennifer Rademacher, chief operating officer at Taylor Development and Land Co., which is building Belcrest Center, a 22-acre mixed-use project at the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station.\n\nShe wants them to make East-West Highway into a destination, similar to town centers in Herndon, Reston or Bethesda.\n\n\"I think you\\'re going to attract people from outside the area that way,\" she said. \"We have the Metro station, that\\'s great. But we want to bring in more people, more money, more everything into this area.\"\n\nThat\\'s starting to happen.\n\nUniversity Town Center\\'s student housing building, Towers, has been open for one academic year. Restaurants such as Old Dominion Brew House, Southern-themed Carolina Kitchen and Three Brothers Italian Restaurant are scheduled to open in August.\n\n\"There\\'s a real revitalization of this area ... that\\'s really catching on now. It\\'s tremendous,\" said Tim Taylor, vice president of leasing at Prince George\\'s Metro Center, which is developing University Town Center.\n\nThe Royale 14 Cinemas -- the first in Hyattsville in more than 30 years, according to Mr. Gardiner -- will anchor an entertainment destination at the center.\n\n\"Hyattsville specifically seems to have been underserved in terms of a true movie-going experience,\" said Rhonda Cook, director of real estate for Consolidated Theatres.\n\nCircuit City, the first tenant at Belcrest Center\\'s retail component, Metropolitan Shops, is scheduled to open later this month. Also at Belcrest, 260 apartments are slated to open late this year and construction is scheduled to start in September on 300,000 square feet of office space. The development has a letter of intent from Marriott International Inc. to build a Marriott Courtyard hotel on the site.\n\nIn 2004, the Mall at Prince George\\'s completed a renovation that increased the square footage to 1.1 million. Last year, Marshalls and Ross Dress for Less opened in the mall. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698nd6w6fwt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9573402405,38.9676174873]}},{"properties":{"name":"The University of Maryland","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698ncxejm73"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.951546669,38.9873678463]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trinity Baptist Church of Lewisdale","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_worship_verD.gif\"> 1900 Beechwood Road, Hyattsville, MD 20783<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698ncxcoiar"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.97825,38.975745]}},{"properties":{"name":"University Town Center","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698nd4rii4f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9514393806,38.9677175875]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/532337","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rufusl","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rufusl","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/532337","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":37,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=532337,platial:user=rufusl","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":30943}
