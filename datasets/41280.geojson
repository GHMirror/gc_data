I missed my opprtunity to get in with Erik and Birgit and Sam, and took Vigo for a long walk down to the beach at the Brooklyn Bridge Park. The pool was closed due to infant feces (gross) but we had a nice time hanging out on the sand. When we came back, the show was still going on so we listened outside for a while and then went to get some sushi and wait for the rest of our gang.\n\nI think Vigo would have enjoyed the show and I\\'m disappointed that I missed it.\n\n*********************\n\nCelebrating their 20th anniversary, the legendary Japanese avant-garde rock band the Boredoms will debut 77 DRUM on 07/07/07 on the lawn of the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park section of Brooklyn Bridge Park.

We could have stayed at the State Park instead. \n\nDragon made some friends at the campground. Making friends being his top skill. For weeks before even coming to Boston, he had been talking about wanting to swim in the Atlantic Ocean, and Maine was his chance. We went to the beach, where the water temperature was a chilly 57 degrees Farenheit (Brrrr), but he and Erik really swam and dodged the waves. They made it look so fun, that they inspired a bunch of other people to brave the cold and get in there, too.\n\nHere\\'s the video of Dargon\\'s first dip in the Atlantic:\n\n.\n\nVigo also had a great time on the beach\n\n\n\nWe had a better swimming experience at the lake, and Dragon got sick of me filming and photographing him.\n\n\n\nLast video is Vigo with some ducks\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65hkdao6fpk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-68.204444,44.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"✓ Dragon's Visit.
