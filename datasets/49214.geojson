That is a fact. Over the next few years, people can expect to see gradual changes in the way the town develops, beginning with how it looks. The longer time goes on, the more changes will be made, and the more the town will alter.\r\n\r\nAll these changes won’t be made simply for the sake of it. They have to happen if Barnsley is to have a future. “Rethinking Barnsley” was simply the beginning: the catalyst for a better town and a better way of life. The goal is to make the town a desirable place to live and work, to shop and visit. Architect Will Alsop says: “Barnsley can rewrite the rules about post-industrial economies and communities in Britain and worldwide. The vision, and the supporting groundwork, is in place for a fantastic development.”\r\n\r\nThe vision that he presented isn’t his alone. It was as a result of talks that began with the Rethinking Barnsley weekend and continued at later Town Team meetings. They are the combined ideas from the people of Barnsley – from children to the elderly – and professional architects, town planners, consultants, developers and the Council itself.\r\n\r\nThe eventual aim is to create the ideal 21st Century Market Town – a modern community that provides employment, culture, the arts, accommodation, leisure, retail and a place to relax, all focused in its town centre.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
