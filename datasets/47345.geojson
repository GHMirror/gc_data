Lawrence Ave. Chicago, ILThe Aragon Ballroom 11/14/04 \n\n-- The show was excellent. Don\\'t get me wrong, but with the crappy sound in the Aragon Ballroom and the way they blew through the set, I couldn\\'t help but think if I would have just invited about 372 people to my studio apartment to stand on top of each other, sweat, and listen to The Pixies Live at the BBC CD on shuffle, well, the experience might have been pretty much the same. Only I would have made a bundle off of charging  for six ounces of water.\n\n---There was not much of The Joy in my fellow audience members and hey, those people don\\'t owe me anything, but if you took a second to look around the area in which I was standing, BEHOLD! A lot of non-smilin thirty-somethings dressed in black, all meekly bopping the their heads to the likes of Where Is My Mind, and, oh every. Single. Fucking. Song. Granted, I realize the Pixies aren\\'t ever going to land a spot on a Totally Dance Hits! MTV compilation or anything. Oh, their music is deep, dark, meaningful blah blah blah, but damnit people, most of you have waited years (and then months after buying tickets!) for this. The Tool Cool for the Rock Show thing? Really? You\\'re still keeping that posture up after your 23rd birthday? Umm, okay. \n\n---Did I mention the show was really excellent and I should not be so negative? It was. Really. But the big pay-off for me came when Kim Deal sang the In Heaven (The Lady in the Radiator) song. Afterwards she got the biggest applause of the night, which clearly pissed off Black Francis/Frank Black. After she was finished, there was some banter between them (the only unrehearsed thing of the night really) and even though I could not hear it (thank you shitty sound!), witnessing a legendary honest to goodness Frank Black Control-Freak Freak Out (as small as it was in comparison to what he usually puts out, I am sure) was extremely satisfying.\n\n---Finally, if I were to make a Top Ten list of say, SIGNS YOU ARE AN AGING ROCK SHOW ENTHUSIAST, number one on my list would go something like this:\n\nUpon entering the venue, the first thing you are interested in checking out BEFORE the bar:  FIRE EXITS!\n\nI will not be shamed! \n\nIn my aging, I may think about personal safety a little more than usual, but at least I\\'ll crack a smile and dance a little (little bit) when I get to see a favorite live. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a0y135n662"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.657715,41.969193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Angry Make-Out Breaks Out @ the pAper chAse Show","description":"Posted by Kelly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/paper_chase.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 2100 W.

Lots of whacked-out samples and tons of crazy singing about paranoia and fucked-up heart break by the lead singer who, with his bleached hair, looked like a little like Eminem but maybe on a little more meth.

While they were still totally making-out.\n\nThey didn’t even unlock lips for like, one second on their way out the door.\n\nLet’s hear it for angry, paranoid love! Err, lust.

There was a festival selling food on a stick and Urge Overkill was playing.  How could we not go? \n\nUO is Chicago-based band that was moderately successful back in the early 90s. A band I liked a lot back then.  They released an album called \"Saturation\" that would have done a lot better and maybe made a lot more famous back in 1993 had a lady named Liz Phair not released another little album called \"Exile in Guyville\" that very same summer. \n\nAnd I don\\'t begrudge either band/artist their success only, that summer everyone in Chicago kind of expected UO to blow up. Then came Liz singing about getting wet between her legs and f*ck and run and such and so everyone kind of forgot about Urge Overkill.\n\nSo, Liz stole all their thunder that year, but Urge Overkill managed to keep the moxie up, taking photos while driving around in vintage convertibles, posing in Mod furniture, singing about Erica Kane and keeping their hip-than-thou attitude up in general.\n\nI liked \\'em anyway. Still do.\n\nSo they played this little festival over the 4th of July weekend, and they were great, and really not-rock-starry at all. Lead singer Nash Kato - who was known for being a little bratty back in the day - was a very nice Rock Star in the present as he played for the sparse suburban crowd and even though the sound was not so great, they all played their hearts out. \n\nWhich was funny in another way, because if Nash Kato and Urge Overkill thought Liz Phair was a problem back in 1993, forgetabout it.  This weekend they were up against The Nuge. That is to say, at the very same time UO was on, they were up against Ted Nugent and his Cat-Scratch-Fever-Legacy on the festival\\'s Main Stage. \n\nSo in the end, UO played balls-out in spite The Nuge and everything else. Which was nice.\n\nIt was a good time, but in the end it wound up being weirdly nostalgic and all which really freaked me out because at one point I was thinking, \"Whoa, isn\\'t this how your parents are supposed to feel when they see, like, The Beach Boys playing Summer Fest or something?\"\n\nBut what was worse, the crowd was so small I managed to find a place right up front and the sound was really, really loud and I left with my ears ringing and hissing with tinnitus and I tell ya after all the rock shows I have seen in my life-- if my hearing went down after attending suburban festival--I was going to be flat-out-pissed-off.\n\nAfter UO was done, The Nuge was just finishing up his night\\'s set, and we could hear the big finale heating up. Concert-going-friend Jen had made a pit stop at the Port O John on our way out and she nearly tipped the thing over trying to escape so she could bust out and yell, \"Oh my god, Cat Scratch Fever!\"\n\nSo see, we really didn\\'t miss a thing.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a0y1cy34ui"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.154769,41.764702]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hipster Breaks Out the Sweat Bands @ The Hopefuls Show","description":"Posted by Kelly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/d5dd5eb1f4d42c2c63a59d31cc1ad7ac.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago, IL, 606223/11/06 The Double Door -- They wear matching track suits!

That is, there was dancing.\n\nMore specifically, there was a Designated Dancing Guy.  DDG jumped on stage sportin\\' a suit and a funky dance style that kept everyone asking \"umm, so like, is he WITH the band or what?\" for the first few songs.\n\nAfter DDG took off his tie and busted out his hidden prop sweat bands (hint: they were in the drum kit!) all questions were answered and DDD led the crowd in a raucous dance to The Hopefuls\\' hit single \"Let\\'s Go!\"* and a good time was had by all.\n\nThat is until my car was illegally towed by the City of Chicago and I had to spend the next morning at the impound lot trying to get her out of hock.

Everywhere! \r\nAnd not a drop of water anywhere.  I mean, save for the tears streaming down my face, streaking my mascara while tourists took pictures as they wandered by saying helpful things like, “man, hope you have insurance.”\r\nBastards.\r\nThe firemen were cute though. And they were nice enough to shut down that entire busy little intersection just for me and my little old car fire while they took an axe to bust through the hood.\r\nAnd the policeman who filled out the report was kind enough to let me and my case of beer hitch a ride with him to my birthday party (your tax dollars hard at work Cook County!) \r\nI am happy to report I was still on time.\r\nYou bet I left the burned-up remains of the car in that questionably legal parking spot on Halsted and headed out for the night.
