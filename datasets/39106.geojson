I have that list in a database. It starts in 1989, but doesn\\'t really get going until 1997. \n\nIn December of 2001 the Airport Police, who have a substation on the drive behind the lake, decided that no one was allowed on the lake or the dam. They required me to obtain written permission from the airport administrative authority, the people who run the airport. I tried for quite a while and only got the run around or was told that the Airport Police do not have the authority to keep me from the lake so no permission is necessary. The police disagreed. The practical result is that I wrote a book about my experience called \"Catch 22\" - you might have heard about it? So my birding stopped for all practical purposes on 03-December-2001.\n\nOn 13-Feb-2001 I counted 334 Canada Geese on the lake and the surrounding grassy areas; on 06-Aug-2001 I saw only 1 Canada Goose.\n\nDon\\'t worry, I won\\'t bore you with a complete list of the 971 entries I have for Dulles Airport Lake: what birds are found when, and in what quantity, though any researcher is welcome to my data by including their email address in a comment to this link.\n\nBut, here is a complete list of the birds I have seen on the lake and in the woods around the lake, or in the swampy area below the dam: American Black Duck, American Coot, American Crow, American Goldfinch, American Robin, Barn Swallow, Belted Kingfisher, Black-crowned Night-Heron, Blue Jay, Bonaparte\\'s Gull, Brown Thrasher, Brown-headed Cowbird, Bufflehead, Canada Goose, Canvasback (only one, the entire time), Carolina Chickadee, Caroline Wren, Cedar Waxwing, Chimney Swift, Chipping Sparrow, Common Grackle, Common Loon (again, only one, ever), Common Moorhen, Common Yellowthroat, Cooper\\'s Hawk, Dark-eyed Junco, Double-crested Cormorant, Downy Woodpecker, Eastern Wood-Peewee, European Starling, Field Sparrow, Fish Crow, Gray Catbird, Great Blue Heron (probably the most consistently seen bird on the lake), Great Egret, Hairy Woodpecker, Herring Gull, Hooded Merganser, Horned Grebe, House Finch, House Sparrow, House Wren, Kentucky Warbler, Killdeer, Lesser Yellowlegs, Mallard, Mourning Dove, Northern Cardianl, Northern Flicker, Northern Mockingbird, Northern Rough-winged Swallow, Orchard Oriole, Palm Warbler, Pied-billed Grebe, Red-breasted Merganser, Red-tailed Hawk, Red-winged Blackbird, Ring-billed Gull, Ring-necked Duck, Rock Dove, Ruddy Duck (just mobs of them through the winter), Song Sparrow, Spotted Sandpiper, Striated Heron, Tree Swallow, Trumpter Swan, Tufted titmouse, Turkey Vulture, White-throated Sparrow, Wood Duck, Yellow Wagtail, Yellow Warbler, Yellow-rumped Warbler<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463vatvgx6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.445717,38.961144]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fletcher's Boat Landing","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://arnica.csustan.edu/photos/animals/wood_duck.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Fletcher\\'s Boat Landing is a great little spot. Nice large parking area, though it\\'s not a big deal if you slip in over lunch. Most birding can be done from the shore in front of the parking lot - at least for water fowl. \n\nIf you head up-river (if you are totally oblivious to your surroundings, then you need to head toward your right. and if you are hopelessly oblivious that means head toward where a passenger would sit in your car if you were the driver. Um, that doesn\\'t mean cringing on floor of the back seat.) there is a little trail that heads along the stream, which gives you some forest type habitat, or you can head out along the river for other types of water fowl.\n\nYou can also head back to the canal for a nice walk, or some flat water birds. \n\nSo here\\'s my list here: American Crow, Belted Kingfisher, Canada Goose, Carolina Chickadee, Dark-eyed Junco, European Starling, Forster\\'s Tern, Great Black-backed Gull, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Greater Scaup, Greater Yellowlegs, Green-winged Teal, Herring Gull, Mallard, Red-shouldered Hawk, Ring-billed Gull, Ruddy Duck, Song Sparrow, Striated Heron, Tufted titmouse, Turkey Vulture, White-throated Sparrow, Wood Duck\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v1xmmdp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.102008,38.918785]}},{"properties":{"name":"Georgetown Reservoir","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/framlst/photo/h1460pi.jpg\">An interesting place. \n\nGeorgetown Reservoir consists of 3 large impoundements - as you can see on the map. I usually park on Reservoir Road, northbound side, cross the street and gaze longingly through the chainlink fence at the birds covering the water. Or hiding out in the lee of the levees.\n\nYou are, obviously, looking west, toward the Canal, Potomac River and Virginia. The enbankment on the opposite side of the reservoir backs up against the Canal, and one day I saw a red fox hop up on top of the levee and head north. It is always surprising what kinds of wildlife one can find in DC.\n\nAnd from here, it is just a quick slip down the hill to Fletcher\\'s Boat Landing. \n\nBut we\\'re interested in the birds, so here\\'s my list: American Coot, American Crow, American Wigeon, Black Vulture (pooping in my drinking water?! Thank goodness for water treatment plants!), Canada Goose, Canvasback, Double-crested Cormorant, Great Black-backed Gull, Great Blue Heron, Herring Gull, Laughing Gull, Mallard, Mourning Dove, Pied-billed Grebe, Redhead, Ring-billed Gull, Ring-necked Duck, Rock Dove, Ruddy Duck, Wood Duck (Take that, Larry!)\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v7vkt1w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.092609,38.913342]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hunting Creek","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/streeter/2003report/Birds/wilson%5C's%20phalarope.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Well, this is obviously NOT the creek, but it is a nice park area that borders on the creek. And on the Potomac. I think Hunting Creek is actually farther north past the country club - the blue line that comes in just south of the Beltway. (That would be I-95 for the uninitiated, foreigners, aliens and others of the non-Capitol variety of huminoid.)\n\nThe bay - the area from the boat landing (the hook just to the south) and the spit of green there by the bridge (well, it kinda HAS to be a bridge, now doesn\\'t it?) is fairly shallow and full of seaweed. You can often find Great Blue Heron wading most of the way across this area, though there seems to be a channel from the Potomac  up the creek. There are also Osprey here, and I once saw an Osprey and GBHeron arguing over a fish the GBHeron had. It won.\n\nA geographical curiosity, a bit of useless trivia: You can see on the map above the point, very near the Virginia shore, where a line comes in from the northeast and joins a line coming in from the north, and that junction is just below the bridge? That is the only point on the beltway that is inside DC\\'s boundaries. But, felons, speeders and others involved in illegal pursuits, don\\'t let that fool you: DC has confired on MD the rights to police that section of DC, so you cannot claim that the DC section is out of the jurisdiction of the MD cop who is about to nail your sorry butt to his ticket pad. \n\nAnd just in case you are running from the VA cops, MD &amp; VA have reciprocity agreements on the Wilson Bridge (that\\'s the one on the map above that involves all three jurisdictions), so they can chase you all the way across the bridge and catch you, and you then belong to them. And if you get past them, the MD cops will be waiting for you, and then you belong to them. And when they are done with you they will transfer you back to VA so the VA courts get their turn.\n\nWhew! I sound like I\\'ve been there. Haven\\'t, but read the Washington Post, even though that info is not on the funny pages.\n\nBut back to birding. This is a great place to picnic with the family and pets, and then they can play and read while you bird, and everyone\\'s happy for a change.\n\nThis is also where The Osprey\\'s Nest (DC area birding bulletin board, pre-internet days) would get together annually to meet and see the faces on the other side of the handles in the forum.\n\nAnd before I\\'m done, on down the road you stay by the river down at least until Mount Vernon. There are, or were, and since the population is growing I assume are more than before, Bald Eagles. I believe I counted 20 one fine winter Saturday afternoon.\n\nAnd finally what you\\'ve been waiting for - the birdlist: American Black Duck, American Coot, American Goldfinch, American Wigeon, Belted Kingfisher, Black-crowned Night-Heron, Blue-winged Teal, Canada Goose, Caspian Tern, Chimney Swift, Double-crested Cormorant, Forster\\'s Tern, Great Black-backed Gull, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Greater Yellowlegs, Green-winged Teal, Herring Gull, House Finch, Killdeer, Lesser Yellowlegs, Mallard, Northern Pintail, Northern Shoveler, Osprey, Pectoral Sandpiper, Peregrine Falcon, Pied-billed Grebe, Red-necked Grebe, Ring-billed, Gull, Ring-necked Duck, Ruddy Duck, Short-billed Dowitcher, Snowy Egret, Wilson\\'s Phalarope, Wood Duck, Yellow-billed Cuckoo\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463vd627pj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.050552,38.778912]}},{"properties":{"name":"Huntley Meadows Park","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.ownbyphotography.com/Scarlet-Tanager.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is a great place for a summer afternoon of birding.\n\nOr spring afternoon of birding.\n\nOr fall afternoon of birding.\n\nOr all day birding.\n\nFrom the visitor\\'s center, at the end of the entrance road, about where the marker is staked in the map above, a trail winds about 3/8ths of a mile through the forest to the edge of a large tract of wetlands. And not \"wetlands\" as under the Bush revised definition, but \"wetlands\" as in \"land wet from being under water\".\n\nBut I wax editorial.\n\nAt the point where the trail nears the edge of the swamp a boardwalk begins. It wanders out through the swamp, splitting and reconnecting, going around a beaver\\'s dam, reaching a lookout tower, and splitting again into two boardwalks. \n\nThese two boardwalks shortly reach the edge of the swamp and again turn into trails that circle east and north back around the swamp, rejoining the original trail about 50 yards before the boardwalk began. Along this circling back part of the trail I was fortunate enough to look up one spring and see a Scarlet Tananger. Now THAT\\'S red!\n\nAnother time I was out on the trail of some rails that had been reported on the Voice of the Naturalist, the DC area\\'s birding hotline &amp; weekly bird report sponsored by the Audubon Naturalist Society, the \"other\" Audubon Society. I was on the spur southwest of the lookout tower clicking in the side of my cheek to call the stupid thing in. (If it was intelligent it would have given us all a 2 minute look, satisfied our curiosities, and been on its way, but NOOOOO, it had to play hard-to-get, showing us a flirtacious eye here, a bit of leg there, some neck from behind that bush, and, well, you get the picture.) The boardwalk was crowded - and by that I mean someone every 10 or 15 yards or so - with people looking for the rail or out for an afternoon stroll. \n\nThere was one intense young (college age) guy bound and determined to add that rail to his list. He came bustling over asking where the rail was. I pointed to an clump of bushes and reeds about 20 yards away. He said no, the rail was right here by the boardwalk. I said no, it was over there and wouldn\\'t come any closer in the 20 minutes I had been there calling it in. He said he had heard it and began furiously looking behind every bush bordering that stretch of boardwalk. (Well, it was water so he couldn\\'t actually get behind the bushes, just trying different angles to see behind them.) Since he was busy, and knew better than I, I went back to watching the rail, or glimpses of the rail, 30 yards away. It started coming closer so I began clicking again, whereupon Mr. Intensity gave me a startled look, stopped looking behind bushes and hurried away. RISLAD! (There was no floor, so that means \"Roll In the Swamp Laughing And Drown!) \n\nIt was worth the trip just for his expression and reaction.\n\nAnd I did get a good look at the stupid thing.\n\nBirdlist: American Bittern (3\\' from the boardwalk!), American Coot, American Crow, American Goldfinch, Barn Swallow, Belted Kingfisher, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Brown Creeper, Canada Goose, Carolina Chickadee, Carolina Wren, Chimney Swift, Common Moorhen, Common Yellowthroat, Downy Woodpecker, Eastern Bluebird, Eastern Kingbird, Fish Crow, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Grey Catbird, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Green Heron, Hairy Woodpecker, Hooded Warbler, King Rail Mallard, Northern Cardinal, Northern Flicker, Pied-billed Grebe, Purple Martin, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Red-eyed Vireo, Red-headed Woodpecker, Red-shouldered Hawk, Red-tailed Hawk, Red-winged Blackbird, Ring-necked Duck, Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Scarlet Tanager, Song Sparrow, Sora, Spotted Sandpiper, Striated heron, Swamp Sparrow, Tree Swallow, Tufted Titmouse, White-breasted Nuthatch, White-throated Sparrow, Winter Wren, Wood Duck, Wood Thrush, Yellow-rumped Warbler\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v04hepm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.098532,38.757999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lucketts, VA","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/htmsl/h4060pi.jpg\">The middle of nowhere!\n\nDefinitely out of the DC metropolitan area sprawl, though I\\'m sure a lot of people who live here work in and around DC.

And you think of bills as being rigid, yet the tip of oystercatcher bills are flexible, almost like a finger. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463vdzlve6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.087647,38.336674]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ocean City - 76th Street","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.graviton.demon.co.uk/Birds/Common%20Tern%203767.jpg\">I don\\'t think there is anything particuarly special about 76th Street, except that (1) we could park there for a while, and (2) it had a good view of the marshy area.\n\nBirders are nothing if not opportunistic.\n\nBirdlist: Black Skimmer, Common Grackle, Common Tern, Great Egret, Osprey, Snowy Egret.\n\nJust for fun, go to the bird site and compare some other terns to the Common Tern.

You go to the end of the boardwalk and hang over the railing looking to see what might be in sight. Not a great place to bird, but better than those swirly rides.\n\nAnd the food is good! Really, what\\'s better than salt air, boardwalk pizza, fresh squeezed lemonade and Thrasher\\'s French Fries? (Thrasher\\'s was around LONG BEFORE there were boardwalk fries. I guess copying is the sincerest form of flattery.)\n\nAnd don\\'t get pizza sauce on your binocular lenses!\n\nStill, there might be something interesting on the rocks edging the inlet channel.\n\nBirds here: Brown Pelican, Great Black-backed Gull, Herring Gull, Laughing Gull, Royal Tern, Ruddy Turnstone, Sanderling.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v6pvj7s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.087647,38.325026]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ocean City, NJ","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.nj-oceancity.com/Ocean%20City%20NJ/slides/Ocean%20City%20-%20Boardwalk.jpg\">I\\'ve marked about where we were most of the time when we\\'d visit by great aunt, Aunt Louise. \n\nUncle Gus was Greek, Aunt Louise was Norman by way of Wales and Indiana. (Don\\'t ask, it\\'s a very long story going back to 1066.) Uncle Gus was the only Greek I had ever been around, so when the movie \"My Great Big Fat Greek Wedding\" came out I realized that a lot about Uncle Gus was not that he was some eccentric character, but that he was Greek. I really learned a lot about my family from that movie. Unfortunately both were dead, so I never had a chance to talk with them about it.\n\nThe other thing about Ocean City is that it provided the defining component of what I understand as PIZZA. I\\'m sure the salt air had a major influence on the process, but THE PIZZA by which I judge all other pizzas is made just south of the Music Pier at \"Mack and Manco\\'s\". \n\nLikewise, the apex of \"shoreness\" is a combination of salt air and suntan lotion (which, surprisingly, has not changed aroma much over the past, um, few years), with a touch of cigar or pipe smoke. \n\nI\\'ve been to lots of other beaches on both coasts, but they can\\'t compare to the shore. I don\\'t know that I\\'ve ever smelled pipe/cigar smoke at those beaches: there have certainly been both salt air and suntan lotion.\n\nBirdlist, which includes bayside and the north end of the island where the road heads to the mainland: Double-crested Cormorant, Great Black-backed Gull, Great Egret, Herring Gull, Laughing Gull, Mourning Dove, Purple Sandpiper, Ring-billed Gull, Ruddy Turnstone, Sanderling.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v5pj7bf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.595966,39.261367]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parking","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~petelat1/photos/sora-1.jpg\">Ok, so this isn\\'t about parking, though parking in the DC area can be difficult. \n\nOr about THAT kind of parking! *hmmmm*\n\nThis is about where the parking lot is for going out onto the drive between inpoundments, and on to the fields and tree margins at one of the premier birding spots in the DC area. At least it\\'s my favorite.\n\nSpring migration is always a marvel. I wish I lived close enough to enjoy going there again. But given the diversity of habitats one can enjoy raptors, high tree canopy woodland birds, medium story woodland birds, woodland floor birds, field birds, wood margin birds, ducks and rails.\n\nFor some bizzarre reason **something to do with Murphy, perhaps?** my best birding was when it was raining. Always lots going on. Stupid birds didn\\'t have enough sense to get in out of the rain. Something to do with spring hormones perhaps? Or maybe they were there to watch the stupid birders who didn\\'t have enough sense to get in out of the rain?\n\nWhatever!\n\nBird I have seen at Hughes Hollow: American Bittern, American Black Duck, American Coot, American Crow, Americna Goldfinch, American Wigeon, Barred Owl (caught on film!), Belted Kingfisher, Black Vulture, Blue Jay, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Blue-winged Teal, Broad-winged Hawk, Brown Creeper, Brown Thrasher, Brown-headed Cowbird, Canada Goose, Carolina Chickadee, Cattle Egret, Cedar Waxwing, Common Loon, Dark-eyed Junco, Double-crested Cormorant, Downy Woodpecker, Eastern Bluebird, European Starling, Field Sparrow, Forster\\'s Tern, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Gretter Yellowlegs, Green Heron, Hooded Merganser, House Finch, House Wren, Laughing Gull, Lesser Yellowlegs, Mallard, Mourning Dove, Mute Swan, Northern Bobwhite, Northern Cardinal, Northern Flicker, Nothern Harrier, Northern Mockingbird, Northern Parula, Northern Saw-whet Owl, Northern Shoveler, Osprey, Peregrine Falcon, Pied-billed Grebe, Prothonotary Warbler, Purple Finch, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Redhead, Red-winged Blackbird, Ring-billed Gull, Ring-necked Duck, Sandhill Crane, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Snow Goose, Snowy Egret, Song Sparrow, Sora (it was drizzly all month!), Swamp Sparrow, Tree Swallow, Tufted Titmouse, Turkey Vulture, White-breasted Nuthatch, White-throated Sparrow, Wild Turkey, Wood Duck, Yellow-breasted Chat, Yellow-rumped Warbler<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v9mdq12"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.40705,39.083689]}},{"properties":{"name":"Potomac Palisades","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://mywebpages.comcast.net/tmstuart/Nature/Birds/BlueWingedWarbler01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Not really its name, that I know of anyway, but it reminds me of Pacific Palisades, except there\\'s no ocean, or salt air, or earthquakes, so I called it Potomac Palisades. \n\nThis is a nice, quiet community of nice homes - not fancy, or big, or special, just a nice, neighborhood with 40\\'s and 50\\'s style homes, well manicured lawns, lawn services that use Honda mowers because they\\'re quite.  \n\nSo, I don\\'t usually stay long, and stay pretty close to my car. Never had any problems or too many weird looks, but why ruffle feathers if you don\\'t need to?\n\nSo, in the spirity of unobtrusiveness this neighborhood inspires, here is my list of birds seen along this street: American Crow, American Goldfinch, American Robin, Blue Jay, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Blue-winged Warbler (a lifer, and in the rain, natrually), Broad-winged Hawk, Canada Goose, Carolina Chickadee, Carolina Wren, Cedar Waxwing, Chestnut-sided Warbler, Common Grackle, Eastern Kingbird, European Starling, Gray Catbird, Hairy Woodpecker, House Finch, Mallard, Mourning dove, Northern Cardinal, Northern Mockingbird, Northern Rough-winged Swallow, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Tufted titmouse, Turkey Vulture, White-breasted Nuthatch, White-throated Sparrow, Yellow-rumped Warbler\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v5wsc6b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.111406,38.931238]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shenandoah River (North Fork)","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> If you notice, this is on the east side of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River where the river widens. At just about the spot indicated is a single, tall sycamore. Recently, in this sycamore, I saw a pair of (or, at least, two) large black birds as I was driving towards the river on the road on the west bank. \n\nAs it was morning, and we have an abundance of TVs (Turkey Vultures for the noobs out there), I figured they were sitting in the sun waiting to warm up so they could take off. However, as it turned the corner to head up the Valley*, I caught a glimpse of light.\n\nI stopped. I backed up. (Actually, I pulled off on the other side of the road where there is a turn out. Being the aware and extremely safe driver that I am I would never back around such a sharp corner, on \"my\" side of the road, startling some other driver and making them forget to hit the brake, thereby endangering us both. Besides, I have a nice care and would not want it to be trashed.) I looked back at the tree and confirmed my suspicions: there were TWO BALD EAGLES SITTING IN THAT SYCAMORE OVERLOOKING THE CARP POND!!! \n\nCool! Eagles are nesting (making an assumption here as I\\'ve see two eagles at the cemetery just up the road) on the Shenandoah around New Market!!!\n\n\n*My grandparents lived here, and I spent a lot of summers here, so am as close to being a local as one can be when they have not actually grown up here. And to the locals \"up the Valley\" means South. Because \"up the Valley\" is equivelent to \"up the River\", which means South. Because \"down the River\" is North, to where the North Fork of the Shenandoah meets the South Fork of the Shenandoah just outside Front Royal, which is about 35 miles north, and from there the mighty Shenandoah continues north to Harpers Ferry where it joins the Potomac. So \"up\" is \"south\" and \"down\" is \"north\". And when one drives from DC to the Shenandoah Valley, one is truely going up - from an elevation of sea level on the Potomac to about 975\\' above sea level.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463uzxwe7s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.684254,38.660448]}},{"properties":{"name":"Somerset Park","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.naturesound.com/birds/hires/yellwrb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is just a little community park off River Road, accessable also from Willard Avenue. Trees, stream, wild undergrowth, bamboo. And, of course, birds. But the main thing is that it was a place where I could get away from work for a lunch hour and rejuvenate my feeble mental circuits.\n\nA brief interlude. The bamboo arrived in this local when one of the local families went to Florida on vacation back in the 50\\'s. One of the kids got a little pot of bamboo. They brought it back and it hung around for a while, barely surviving. Finally mom threw the pot out, and that was that. \n\nWell, almost. The pot of bamboo decided that it wasn\\'t quite dead, put down roots, and took off, filling the stream banks with shoots. And thus was the story as told to me by the son of the bamboo importer.\n\nOK, enough local lore.\n\nOne is struck by the levelness of the park, the unlikely smoothness of the grade as one goes along the stream. The reason is that this was once a part of some local rail line. There is a marker in the park with more information if you are really interested. \n\nBut what we\\'re really interested in is - birds. So here\\'s my birdlist: American Crow, American Goldfinch, American Redstart, American Robin, Blackpoll Warbler, Blue Jay, Carolina Chickadee, Carolina Wren, Cedar waxwing, Chimney Swift, Common Grackle, Cooper\\'s Hawk, Dark-eyed Junco, Downy Woodpecker, Eastern Kingbird, Eastern Wood-Peewee, European Starling, Gray Catbird, Hairy Woodpecker, House Finch, House Sparrow, House Wren, Killdeer, Magnolia Warbler, Mallard, Mourning Dove, Northern Cardinal, Northern Flicker, Northern Mockingbird, Northern Parula, Pileated Woodpecker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Red-winged Blackbird, Ring-billed Gull, Rock Dove, Song Sparrow, Tufted Titmouse, Veery, White-breasted Nuthatch, White-throated Sparrow, Yellow Warbler, Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, Yellow-rumped Warbler\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v7249j2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.096386,38.962479]}},{"properties":{"name":"Somewhere south of the James River","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://www.ksbirds.org/gallery/Snowy%20Owl%20in%20Flight2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> I don\\'t remember just where - I\\'d have to check my records for a more accurate place, but it was a on the edges of an industrial area.

But it wasn\\'t concrete because it moved, watching us, looking around, enjoying the sun. \n\nMaybe it was getting a tan.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v2ockai"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.915627,37.168251]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tom's Cove","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://mywebpages.comcast.net/kontonicolas/images/Black-SkimmerC4571.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The road runs behind a high (30\\' or more) sand barrier. Parking and climbing over the stairs takes one to the beach, or, one could stay on the stairs and have a better view out to sea. One year we saw porpose swimming south.\n\nAnother time I crossed the road (the parking lot is on the east side of the road) and waded out into the marshy area of Tom\\'s Cove. The tide was out so I moved from hummock to hummock staying faily dry. But being eaten alive by no-see-ums. However, I had great views of Black Skimmers slurping across the cove. \n\nI also chased several rails around, but could not make a positive identification on them. Sneaky little twerps! I understand why shotguns were popular with birders back at the turn of the previous century.\n\nI also saw Brown Pelican here and/or looking out to sea.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463v2i8ns8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.343895,37.887115]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zirkle Cemetery","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> This is the site of the Zirkle family cemetery. \n\nAbout which you care not a wit, unless your are a Neff, and are thus related to the Zirkles.\n\nBut, the spring before I saw the Bald Eagles (two) in a sycamore tree above a carp pond just east of here, I saw one eagle chasing another. They circled and circled, with one flapping to catch up, and cutting the circle short, until he (I assume it was a HE defending his territory from some interloper trying to cut in on his nesting area and mate) was so close the other broke out of the circle and headed WSW with all available speed. Chased closely by the HE.\n\nSo, since I have see TWO EAGLES TWO SPRINGS in a row, I assume that eagles are nesting in the New Market area.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6463vbcx682"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.694038,38.661051]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/3056","metadata":null,"contact_name":"woodduck","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:woodduck","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/3056","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":24,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=3056,platial:user=woodduck","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":39106}
