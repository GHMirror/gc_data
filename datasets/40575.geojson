After an hour and a half of buses, I discovered that the listing in the newspaper was wrong, it\\'d been yesterday and Friday.  After that, I planned on taking it easy for the evening.

It\\'s all in the name.  You\\'re singing karaoke on the stage of the club, next to the pole, reading the lyrics off a TV screen or the projector behind you, surrounded by mirrors -- while a stripper rubs up against you, gyrates around, and occasionally flips upside-down on the pole and spreads her legs for the audience.\n\nThere were some damn good songs.  One guy got on stage, and told us about how one method of torture the U.S. uses against detainees is to play The Eagles loudly, for a long time.  Then he sang \"The Eagles Must Die.\"  Another guy announced, \"This song is from George Bush to Osama bin Laden,\" and sang \"Never There\" by Cake.  \"When I need you, baby?  You\\'re never there!\"\n\nThe Minnesotan sang \"Mustang Sally,\" and the Aussie sang \"Mack The Knife\" despite the computer glitching.  Myself, I chose \"Kiss Off\" by The Violent Femmes over the Dynamite Hack version of \"Boyz in da Hood\" and \"Mambo #5.\"  This wasn\\'t the wisest choice, because as soon as the music started I realized I\\'m only familiar with live recordings off it and the cover Matt Hopper plays, yet I don\\'t think I did that bad in the end.\n\nBut maybe next Sunday it\\'ll be time for \"Boyz in da Hood,\" \"Mambo #5\" and perhaps even \"You Can\\'t Hurry Love\" by The Supremes.
