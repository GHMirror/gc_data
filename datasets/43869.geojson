JIm might beat me to it, though. This place reminded me of Latin America--lush forests on one side and views of rocky cliffs and peaks on the other. Sites are very private, some have better views than others. #32 is very private, #15 has good views, and there are probably many more great spots. We were in #5, and originally thought the proximity to the bathroom might be less than desirable, but it was actually perfect. There are many small bathrooms spread out, so there was only one other couple at site 15 using the bathroom--which, by the way, is the nicest toilet I\\'ve seen while camping--smelled like flowers, had a picture on the wall, and a light that turned on upon entry. not too bad!!  Patrick the Nice Ranger Man let us park an extra car than normally allowed (Welcome, Cory!!) and was super friendly. 5 stars indeed!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67libhsjr3m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.662453651,38.021928628]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bear Creek National Recreational Trail","description":"Posted by Mapaddict<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0755.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0754.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0749.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0756.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Safety Girl says this hike was no fun at all. I have hiked multiple 14ers, I used to lead rock climbing trips, and I have even mountaineered and self-arrested on the side of a sunny glacier. That said, I HATED This hike. There was too much exposure for me, given that we had neither ropes nor rescue equipment. After a few gnarly switchbacks that made me dread the return trip, I decided to go back. Marc, of course, offered to come with (even though he was loving it--what happened to his fear of heights??!!). Jim and Rene continued, and came back safely, but agreed I made a good choice. When Marc and I got back to the car and read the topo map I had (as oppposed to Jim\\'s hiking book), this hike said in red, bold letter: \"Not recommended for children or the faint of heart.\" Well there you go. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67libepvwzt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.656230927,38.001303067]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bike Ride #2 Start","description":"Posted by Mapaddict<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0732.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0733.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0727.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0725.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0731.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0734.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0729.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/DSCN0730.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> We drove from the campsite on Mineral Road to the parking lot of the visitor center (we wanted to avoid riding on the gravel road from the campground and also wanted to extend the ride as much as possible). Free &amp; easy parking &amp; bathrooms! \n\nOur ride this day was the best of the 2. We rode to the top of Red Mountain Pass from downtown Silverton. We contemplated descending towards Ouray, but we were less sure of the conditions on that side of the pass. Great ride--nice long climb, beautiful views. Some exposure on Red Mountain pass, but not as much as the Molas Pass Ride (really, just a short section). Descent was on the inside (enclosed) side. Drivers both days were extremely respectful; there was only one vehicle, an RV, that felt like it came too close. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67libea0775"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.67002821,37.8051303064]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bike Start Day 1","description":"Posted by Mapaddict<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/2/DSCN0717.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/2/DSCN0718.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> On our first day, we started at the top of Molas Pass (elevation 10,910) and rode to the top of Coal Bank Pass (10,640) and back up Molas. No surprise that I really liked the climbing and could have done without the descending. Good shoulders, and much of the road back up Molas Pass is 2 lanes, which makes for safer passing. Next time, we would probably extend the ride by going all the way into Silverton. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67libgf0lhu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.698330879,37.7397702956]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dalls Divide Ride","description":"Posted by Mapaddict<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> We didn\\'t do this ride, but wished we had.

From Silverton, turn right onto a dirt road. You can loop around to see multiple sites. This is also a day-use area, and has a bathroom (locked when we were here). I imagine it gets busy on summer weekends but was empty but for one other group when we were here.

There are multiple sites along this road. We stuck to the first section of free sites, but I believe there are more paid sites as you go further down the road. Once again, it was quiet and empty. There were 3 other groups, but the area is spread out so we had privacy. It\\'s right near the river--nice in June, but could be buggy later on in the summer.

Magical. We concluded our week with a day at the Bluegrass Festival. Highlights included seeing a bear from the gondola, playing scrabble with our new 2-year-old friend Jeremiah, eating Greek food, scoring a new round a sparkling clean port-o-potties (really!), and of course, the music. David Byrne was phenomenal. He is crazy and weird and him  made for a spectacular end to the week. \n\n(logistical info: free parking @ Mtn.

We stumbled upon a gorgeous route that I highly recommend. The trail is entirely uphill, and after the first part that is lush and forested, consists of a series of switchbacks. The views of nearby Mt. Sneffels and surrounding Uncompahgres  are stunning. Best of all? There is a waterfall at the end! And not just a view of a pretty little trickling waterfall, but the trail actually goes over (but not in a scary way) Cascade Falls, which are visible from downtown Ouray. The Chief Ouray mine is just beyond the falls. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67libivx4rr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.662024498,38.0231794999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wiesbaden Hot Springs","description":"Posted by Mapaddict<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 625 5th St, Ouray, CO‎We didn\\'t end up soaking in these hot springs, but it seems like a great place.
