Progressively becomes difficult with low tree canopies and multiple stream crossings via stepping stones and large branches traversing the water. Be prepared, also, to climb over roots and large rocks.\n\nCaution: The canyon is a thriving habitat that includes mountain lions, snakes and patches of poison oak. Long pants are suggested.\n\nTrailhead: At the end of Trabuco Creek Road, 4.7 miles east of Live Oak Canyon Road in Trabuco Canyon.\n\n Adventurer’s Pass for parking available at the trailhead.\n\nNote: Trabuco Creek Road is a very rough dirt path resembling uncharted moon territory more than a road. Large rocks, potholes and washboard-like dips are common.\n\nWhy we like it: Short hike with a moderate grade through a lush canyon to Holy Jim Falls, a secluded, 17-foot waterfall.\n\nDetails:  The adventure begins as you turn off Live Oak Canyon Road onto Trabuco Creek Road, which doesn’t receive much maintenance. The 4.7 miles to the trailhead may be the longest and bumpiest drive you’ve experienced.\n\nThe road is barely driveable in a small car or other low-lying vehicles; you’ll have to drive very slow. I recommend using a lunar rover for this stretch of road, but an off-road truck or SUV will suffice.\n\nThe 4-wheel adventure ends at a parking lot on your left. Park here and obtain an Adventurer’s Pass at the kiosk.\n\nProceed north on foot up a small hill and into the canyon, where small cabins appear. These cabins sprouted in the late 1800s when beekeepers made a living here.\n\nOne of the beekeepers was James T. Smith, who had a nasty swearing habit. He earned the name \"Cussin’ Jim\" until government cartographers renamed him \"Holy Jim\" – the name of the canyon today.\n\nYou’ll come to a steel gate after .5 miles. The vegetation quickly thickens as you trek deeper into the canyon.\n\nThere are seven stream crossings in the next mile; some are very easy to traverse while others are difficult thanks to large boulders, overhanging tree limbs or loose stepping stones.\n\nNatural canopies create tunnels along the way and the steep canyon walls and trees provide shade.\n\nFollow the sign toward the falls when you meet the Holy Jim Trail after the last stream crossing. The falls await you about 400 yards away.\n\nThis is probably the trickiest part of the hike: trekking very close to the creek bed in the canyon, which is now significantly narrower.\n\nYou can hear Holy Jim Falls just ahead, with water falling into the small pond below. It’s no Niagara Falls, but the tranquility of this hideaway with its riparian habitat enclosed by towering canyon walls is certainly special.\n\nEat a sandwich or take a quick dunk in the chilly pond before heading back.\n\nAlso consider a car wash after driving out of the canyon. Your vehicle will be filthy! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qu2w196udr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.585125,33.659389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Homan Falls","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a>39.998333, -91.405278<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qu2w1bstv7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.405278,39.998333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lauterbrunnen Valley","description":"Posted by Chill888<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/1/Grindelwald_2004_068.jpg\">One of the most beautiful valleys in the world.

If you walk in \"Rustic Canyon\" on the fire road casale turns into, and take a left down the first set of wood stairs you see, just before the yelllow gate, when you get down to the creek take a left and follow any trail south to the waterfall. It is a man made dam that has overgrown with fern and other water plants.
