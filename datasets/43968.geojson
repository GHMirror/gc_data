Walking around along Sumner St last night, around 11 or 12, listening to a podcast. I hear such a loud screaming sound that I take off my headphones and am standing directly in front of the tree pictured here. Some kind of feral brutality was going down.  One growling, snorting, snarling, deep, nightmarishly terrifying beast could be heard high up in the tree shaking around a terrified, squealing, shrieking, screaming animal for a duration of no less than 2 minutes.  Neighborhood dogs started barking at the noise, but no humans came to investigate. Then what had previously only been auditory exposure, changed. I saw the branches at the very top of this tree bend out, and the treetop began to shake violently. At first I thought the aggressor must be a raccoon, but the size of the disruption was more along the lines of what you\\'d expect from something almost human in scale. It was huge, it was wild.  \n\nThen the screaming stopped.\n\nThen I heard the monster descending very rapidly within the branches of this very tall tree, and started to consider what would happen if a bloody predator, of any size, came barging over the fence and towards me.\n\nThe dogs were still barking. I noticed there were a lot of dogs, behind a lot of tall fences.  In fact every house on the block was actively protecting itself from the threat of invasion.  Could this monster be a known phenomena? Known yet suppressed? After all, not a single person came to see what the noise was, what all the noise was about.  Had they learned their lesson the hard way? Should this beast be ignored?  Should I not have stopped? <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vuh2bkqi9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.644825,45.560325]}},{"properties":{"name":"Overgrown Truck","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/43029145a9bbb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/IMG_04382.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vugwd2j3e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.676003,45.541302]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Corn Palace","description":"Posted by Oleander<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13456343@N00/34165865/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/21/34165865_a2ab3d5217_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/49503074211@N01/34016945/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/23/34016945_1b2db11c47_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/49503074211@N01/34016963/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/22/34016963_38980bb995_o.jpg\"></a>601 N.

Within the Mystery Spot you will be baffled as the laws of physics and gravity cease to exist.\n\nDiscovered in 1939 and opened to the public in 1940, the Mystery Spot has amazed and perplexed hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world. Many return again to experience the puzzling variations in gravity, perspective, height and more.\n\nTheories: Flying saucer fans speculate that cones of metal were secretly brought here and buried in our earth as guidance systems for their spacecraft.

John McLoughin \"The Father of Oregon\" - Van-cruiser. \r\n3-6-0 nucka\r\n\r\nOregon Trail has two endings. If you go over the land route you end in Oregon City if you shoot the cascades you end in Fort Vancouver. Both endings have the same pic of Mt. Hood! \r\n\r\nVancouver Wa. would have to be the capitol of Cascadia for many different reasons. \r\n\r\na) we would have to establish a new graffic standard in architecture. We require vast open spaces that are accessable to the populace. This new spectacle should have some sort of historic barometer to bolster the foundation of the Cascadian icon. Vancouver is by no doubt the center of metropolitan growth from Yeurba Buena (San Fransisco/Oakland) to Vancouver Island. \r\n\r\nb) We have to acknowledge the power of the Columbia. It is the source of our economic fortitude. Deep ports, Hydroelectricity and nature conservation would all be priority issues and should be give the respect that only Vancouver is able to exemplify. \r\n\r\nc)Vancouver is a symbolic military post. Marshall and Roosevelt drafted the Pacific Theatre of Operations from Vancouver. Some argue that the Army AirForce was sharpened as a tactical weapon at Peirson Airport. When the Russians came west on the first transpolar flight they landed in Vancouver. The Kaiser Liberty ships were built on this side of the river. \r\n\r\nd) even the beer industry was started by the Nor\\'Westers and Hudson\\'s Bay employees (Vancouver) \r\n\r\ne) We got the Ross Complex and the rest of the BPA infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTrojan is in Oregon. \r\n\r\nThe capitol is not as interesting as taking all the fissionable and radioactive material in the region and loading it onto freight trains. Drive it up past the continental divide and unhook the box cars.\r\n\r\nThey moved the reactor but the spent fuel rods are on your side of the River. \r\n\r\nCascadia would portion resources for the construction of monoliths and architectural nuevo. Avante garde physical environments and organic preservation that is considerably more harmonious than the current thread of thought. Ban GMO\\'s, redesign hydroelectric harvesting, upgrade and prolong the life span of infrastructure, build a high speed train from Alaska to San Fransisco, erect skyscrapers that lay down into draw bridges, suspend domes over neighborhoods. Sponsor safe, efficient and profitable space tourism. Build swimming pools with four story water slides in everyones backyard.\r\n\r\nFrostitute and I were both born in Portland and our roots are Oregon in origin. We both grew up in the \\'couv and King county. I can\\'t say Washington is better, we have our problems. Oregon is wild and less dense. Washington has higher altitudes and a greater propensity for volcanic eradication. \r\n\r\nOregon has- \r\nFull liqour, full nudity, and gambling in the same room. \r\nThe right to die. \r\nSk8 Parks (the best in the world) \r\n\r\nWashington has- \r\nPuget Sound \r\nKiller Whales \r\nD.B.

Due to road construction, Mill Ends Park (24 inches across and located at the intersection of downtown Portland\\'s Southwest Taylor Street and Naito Parkway) will be moved 80 feet from its current location. The park will reside in the plaza area of Portland\\'s World Trade Center complex for approximately six months.\n\nAccording to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation officials, a move was necessary to protect the tiny green space from the threat posed by the much larger construction equipment. (What Portlanders won\\'t do to protect the environment.)\n\nWhen the Naito Parkway roadway improvements are completed in six or seven months, the park will be moved back to a new location on Naito Parkway, 7.5 feet east of its current home. The big - or little - move takes place on Tuesday, Feb. 7. Some sort of \"mobile platform,\" perhaps an all-terrain vehicle, will be used to move the park in its entirety. Mill Ends Park, which was dedicated as an official city park in 1976, is one of 200 parks managed by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Note: At this time, the city has no plans to move Portland\\'s 5,000-acre Forest Park. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vuha6lkxm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.673286,45.516136]}},{"properties":{"name":"sidewalk fossils of fallen leaves","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/19/111570950_e7cb3f3a49.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/55/111570874_0c3f605f55.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/52/111571002_44d66708a4.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> nw 23rd near marshall st, portland, orapparently laid in the autumn, this sidewalk patch is decorated with an amazing plethora of nearly pristine oak and maple leaf fossils.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vugz1vaum"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698478,45.530177]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/1425","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jason","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jason","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/1425","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":14,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=1425,platial:user=jason","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":43968}
