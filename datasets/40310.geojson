From late September to early December, you can fish right off of the shore and catch as many as you can handle. Use a corky and yarn and try to floss them as they get concentrated at the mouth of the stream. To get there, take the Austin drive exit and turn east. Follow it all the way to the end (about 2 miles), and you\\'ll see plenty of cars parked on the road. Dont forget to get a permission slip from the owner. He is a nice gentleman, and hands out over 200 each year.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a77djd1i2hsw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.705440521,47.6030669597]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gorst Creek","description":"Posted by Devonbaxter<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> Great King Salmon fishing from shore. I think now with the park there, you have to park at the gas station, or have someone drop you off maybe, and walk up the stairs and along the sidewalk on the overpass. You could probably also get permission from one of the local business along the water to park out of their way. There are several open parking lot spaces that they never use. I think this run starts in July. If you fish at low tide, I think you can walk out onto the mudflats to follow the tide line and floss these fish where the water is shallow. Bring some rubber boots.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a77djcwoxqoq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.695140839,47.5281553875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Horseshoe Lake","description":"Posted by Devonbaxter<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> The lake has pretty good bass and trout fishing.  For bass, without a boat, you can walk along a trail to the left side (when facing the water) of the county park.  There are several \"holes\" along the short trail. Fishing near the downed tree is good, there is a little deep spot that is good, and then at the end of the trail there is a point that sticks out into the water. Fishing directly off the point, casting straight towards the center of the lake with a black and grey 4-6 inch rapalla has granted me over 20 bass, all around 1-2 pounds, in a couple of weekends.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a77djcyf4h6s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.665379047,47.406932562]}},{"properties":{"name":"Iverson Spit","description":"Posted by Devonbaxter<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> I\\'ve heard there\\'s some fantastic Sturgeon fishing up here at the public beach.

I hear they actually have some tournaments on the lake. While working on a house near the lake several years ago, I met an older gentleman who was out walking, said he lived on the lake since there were only 2 houses there 50 years ago.  He had recently caught (probably in like 2004) a 16 pounder on the lake, had it mounted on his wall. That\\'s a big bass. Anyway, take a boat around the edges of the lake and look for cover or structure. Maybe to the left side of the park if you are fishing from land.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a77djcr51xyd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.587637901,47.4941826042]}},{"properties":{"name":"Long Lake Boat Launch and Fishing Area","description":"Posted by Devonbaxter<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> Right from the boat launch I have personally caught several 1-2 pound bass.  casting directly in the middle of the launch, straight out, with a shallow water rapalla.

There are tons of bass and trout in this lake. If you have a boat (no gas motors), you can troll, and a resident on the lake (1 of only 2) said that when he trolls for trout, if he is going to fast, the bass will start hitting his line like crazy.  I would fish with rubber worms, using a weedless setup if fishing from the park itself.  My friend caught a 6 pound bass doing just that.  If you walk down the trail, there are almost no lily pads, just be careful of a bee hive on one of the beaver huts.  Crayfish imitation bates might do really well for bass, for trout, any spinners really, maybe night crawlers, but cast and reel, no sense in bobber fishing. :) This lake is not well known at all.
