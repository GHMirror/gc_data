You will learn how to use diagnostic equipment such as the blower door and the combustion analyzer to ensure systems are functioning together correctly to maximize home performance, comfort, energy efficiency, safety and durability.  An energy auditor with BPI certification gives homeowners peace of mind knowing the professional meets the national standards of the Building Performance Institute having passed both a written and a hands-on field exam. Energy Audit Training - Why take the BPI Building Analyst Training CourseBPI Standards have been crafted with one important fact in mind: The house is a system and everything is connected. The relationship between all interconnected systems of the house is the key to its overall performance, efficiency, and durability. Moreover, home performance is essential to the health, safety, and comfort of occupants. Certified BPI professionals are trained to quickly target, diagnose, and solve household performance problems such as mold, mildew, ice dams, drafts, and high utility bills to name a few.Energy Audit Training - Who Should Attend?HERS RatersHome InspectorsHVAC ProfessionalsInsulation ProfessionalsGeneral ContractorsHome BuildersEngineersArchitectsEnergy Audit Training - Associated JobsThe following are possible career paths that can result from energy audit training.

Featured are twenty-three works of art: blue-and-white porcelain objects from the Peacock Room; eight wash drawings of Kangxi porcelain that Whistler produced for a collector's catalogue; and paintings, pastels, and etchings inspired by the artist's interest in porcelain.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6884926/DC/Washington/Chinamania/Freer-Gallery-of-Art/","id":"a644e3zfbf1l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0283,38.8886]}},{"properties":{"title":"Jul  7, 2011: Written in Bone: Forensic Files of the 17th Century Chesapeake at National Museum of Natural History","guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6893273/","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/15 22:37:13 -0400","original":"2010-09-15T19:37:12-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/15 22:37:12 -0400"},"description":"Human anatomy and forensic investigation provide intriguing information on people and events of America's past.

Then comes a two-in-one deal with Audio Files, a combination of WIT’s show’s The Source and WIRT. First, WIRT uses only their voices to adventure back to the time of detective radio shows. Then The Source shifts to modern times, hijacking an audience member’s iPod to create a score to their improvised scene.\nTickets for Audio Files, iToonsical and the many other Fringe shows will go on sale June 20th.

You might have also heard him as the voice of Robert \"Granddad\" Freeman on the hit animated series \"The Boondocks.\" No matter how familiar you are with John, once you see him perform live you completely understand why he's has earned his reputation as one of the funniest dads in America.\nJohn's scene-stealing roles in \"Boomerang,\" \"Little Nicky,\" \"House Party,\" \"Vampire in Brooklyn,\" and \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,\" has established him as a Hollywood mainstay. Witherspoon's resume spans over four decades and his performances in blockbuster movies, hit-television shows, and top-rated music videos have left an impression on legions of fans who instantly recognize his signature catchphrases like \"Bang!Bang!Bang!Bang!\" \"You gotta co-ordinate!\" and \"Don't nobody go in the bathroom...\"\nAccording to the Orange County Register, John's expressive talent puts him in a class of his own. \"Witherspoon is one of those performers who doesn't need a funny line to be funny. Just standing there in a truculent posture with a suspicious look, he is funny and enlivens every scene he's in.\" The Detroit-bred comic has proven that he is a Hollywood mainstay and continues to land coveted spots in some of America's favorite movies and television shows. Witherspoon continues to tour around the country with his wildly popular stand-up show, plus he's recently launched The John Witherspoon Collection, a complete line of humorous greeting cards called Spoon Cards.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8139175/DC/Washington-DC/John-Witherspoon-from-quotThe-Boondocksquot-quotHouse-Partyquot-and-the-quotFridayquot-trilogy/DC-Improv-Comedy-Club/","id":"a644e4c14gzq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.041,38.9051]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7710478/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Down to the Bone at Birchmere","published":{"end_time":"2011/02/02 13:48:08 -0500","original":"2011-02-02T11:48:07-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/02/02 13:48:07 -0500"},"description":"","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7710478/DC/Alexandria-VA/Down-to-the-Bone/Birchmere/","id":"a644e4bn48aa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0622,38.8392]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8155948/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Chicago Cubs at Washington Nationals at Nationals Park","published":{"end_time":"2011/06/22 19:21:04 -0400","original":"2011-06-22T16:21:03-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/06/22 19:21:03 -0400"},"description":"The Washington Nationals take on the Chicago Cubs in this MLB matchup.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8155948/DC/Washington/Chicago-Cubs-at-Washington-Nationals/Nationals-Park/","id":"a644e48rgy5t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9866,38.8777]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8087415/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Washington Nationals vs. Chicago Cubs at Nationals Park","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/18 00:59:23 -0400","original":"2011-05-17T21:59:22-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/18 00:59:22 -0400"},"description":"Event: Washington Nationals vs. Chicago CubsVenue: Nationals ParkStart: 7/7/2011 7:05:00 PMCategory: SPORTS BASEBALL","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8087415/DC/Washington-DC/Washington-Nationals-vs-Chicago-Cubs/Nationals-Park/","id":"a644e4bknl56"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0087,38.8719]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8000015/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Jammin Java’s Mid-Atlantic Band Battle 5 at Jammin Java","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/22 20:31:17 -0400","original":"2011-04-22T17:31:16-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/22 20:31:16 -0400"},"description":"Jammin Java presents The FIFTH Mid-Atlantic Band Battle.
