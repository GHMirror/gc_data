The line stretches out the door of the little house practically from the minute they open until the pies are all gone. And let this be a warning: sometimes the pies are gone before closing. Get there before 5 p.m. if you want to take something home.\nOn the off-season, pies are made with Washington apples. During the fall harvest, all available local apples go into the pies too.\n\nThere are several tables inside the restaurant and a few outside, and all are in high demand. With your warm slice, ask for vanilla or cinnamon ice cream, cheddar cheese or whipped cream. There is also good coffee and hot chocolate for sale - just the thing ward off that seasonal nip in the air. - SignOn San Diego<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f13dr91zr8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.602748,33.078652]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Brea Bakery Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/labrea_bakery_cafejpg.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1556 S Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, CA 92802Only the second location to be opened by the owners of La Brea Bakery in Los Angeles, the SoCal eatery adds aromas of fresh-baked goodness to Downtown Disney.
