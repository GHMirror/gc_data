Following the introduction of district PB in 1993, a further Housing Participatory Budgeting (HPB) project was also launched in 1996 to help address an increasing demand for housing in the city. In both the district and housing PB processes, a series of assemblies are held enabling citizens to allocate budgetary resources and scrutinise public spending.Every two years, the city administration and community leaders invite citizens to the official opening of the PB and to the district rounds in each of the city’s nine districts.During this first round, the administration distributes a form to neighbourhood representatives to be filled in with citizens’ requests for public works. The representatives in turn call community meetings to establish what the priority public work is for their area. The feasibility of each demand is then technically assessed by the administration.The administration presents the budget available to each sub-district, which is proportional to a sub-district’s population size and inversely proportional to its quality of life index. The sub-district forums pre-select a maximum of 25 public works for each district, and tours are organised during which the sub-district delegates visit the sites of these works to gain a better understanding of them.The District Forum is the last deliberative stage of the PB, where the city administration indicates the estimated costs of each of the 25 pre-selected works. Based on these indications and on what the sub-district delegates consider to be priorities, they choose a maximum of 14 works. During this forum the sub-district delegates also elect the district delegates that will follow-up and oversee the execution of the public works. The final stage is the Municipal Meeting of Budgetary Priorities, where the elected delegates present to the mayor the public works selected by the PB to be executed by the administration.In 2006, alongside the regular PB process explained above, the city administration launched a system of Digital Participatory Budgeting (e-PB). Independent of the budget of US$43 million allocated for the traditional PB, a fund of US$11 million was allocated to the new initiative.The e-PB consists of a scheme where citizens registered as electors in Belo Horizonte, independent of their place of residency in the city, vote exclusively online for one out of four public works for each of the nine districts of the city. The initiative had three main goals: to modernise the participatory budgeting process through the use of ICTs; to increase citizens’ participation in the process; and to broaden the scope of public works that are submitted to voting.Traditionally, the level of public participation in PB processes had been very low, composed in general of citizens of an advanced age and of lower socio-economic background; in the previous four years only 1.46% of the population participated in the second round of the process. The internet was seen as a way of making it easier for citizens to take part, reducing the time and cost of participation; the traditional PB required citizens to attend meetings at a certain time and place, whereas with the e-PB citizens were free to vote online within a period of 42 days.For the e-PB, four public works per district were subject to online voting with the aim of selecting one work per district. Citizens over 16 years old were able to vote through an e-voting platform on the city’s website.In general, the works selected for online voting were much larger than the public works put forward by the traditional PB process. As an example, in the medium-sized district of Barreiro, four choices were offered to voters: to build a new public sports complex; to build a new library; to renew one of the area’s main streets; or to regenerate the district’s commercial centre. Each project was priced at 1.2 million US Dollars and the sports complex won the vote. This is not a process to be taken lightly, since the other three projects did not go ahead.The e-PB was heavily promoted and the website provided detailed information on the proposed works that were to be selected. Further information could be obtained by email and a designated address was set up to respond to queries. The online platform of the e-PB offered possibilities for multilateral interactivity and, consequently, facilitated deliberative action.Participation was opened to all citizens, with a discussion forum including nine different threads, one for each district. Even though  active participation in the forum was low, reaching a total of 1,210 posts, all posts could be seen without logging in by all of those who accessed the link to the forums, and the number of readers was significantly higher than the number of posts.The total number of votes was 503,266 with a total number of 172,938 voters. The difference between the number of voters and number of votes is accounted for by the fact that voters were allowed to vote nine times as long as they voted for only one work per district. These numbers therefore correspond to a participation level of around 10 per cent of electors, nearly seven times more participants than the traditional participatory budgeting (and using a budget nearly seven times smaller).”2) Analysis of the votesa) Local does seem to matter: As mentioned before, electors were allowed to cast nine votes each (one for each of the 9 districts). Nevertheless, more than half of the voters (52.1%) chose to vote for only one district and nearly two thirds of voters (73.61%) choose to vote for between one and three districts only. Also, qualitative data seems to confirm that citizens preferred to cast for their vote in an informed manner, rather than behaving as free riders that would randomly cast their votes.b) Absence of socio-economic bias: At least at the aggregate level, no socio-economic bias was found. In this respect, there is no evidence that richer neighbourhoods produced higher levels of participation. Nonetheless, due to the absence of individual level data such analysis should be taken into consideration prudently. c) Remote voting was essential: The available data shows that at least 30% of the votes were cast from registered electors in Belo Horizonte that, at the moment their vote was cast, were not physically in the city. In other words, it is probable that nearly 1/3 of the voters would not have participated if it hadn’t been for the possibility of casting their votes through the Internet.  Source: http://theconnectedrepublic.org/posts/187","id":"a6634ftm82wg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-43.951836,-19.817743]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Plata (AR) e-Participatory Budgeting","description":"Text by Tiago Peixoto <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/BertelsmannStiftung#p/u/12/2CffhCRl69Y\"></a>\n\nIn 2009, the administration of La Plata, Argentina, launched a $4.1 million PB initiative with an innovative participatory design which consisted of two main phases. During the first phase, 40 face-to-face deliberative meetings were held across the city, where citizens were permitted to directly allocate up to 30 percent of the total budget, and to present a list of options for the allocation of the remaining 70 percent of the budget.\n\nThe second phase consisted of a larger process of voting among the options previously selected by the deliberative meetings, where a secured system allowed votes to be cast through paper ballots, electronic ballots and text messages (SMS). As a result, during the second phase, a total of 29,578 people  participated, representing over 10 percent of the city’s electors. Particularly noteworthy and elucidating is that the second phase attracted over 9 times more participants than the first, face-to-face phase (3,200).\n\nSuch a design, where deliberation and participation levels are equally taken into account, addresses the apparent incompatibility between deliberation and high levels of participation which is frequently highlighted by experts in the field and identified in practice. Furthermore, incentives are created for a variety of citizens – who are willing to bear diverse costs of participation – to engage in the process. By giving citizens who attend the meetings the opportunity to definitively allocate up to 30 percent of the budget and to select the options for the remaining budget to be submitted to vote in the second phase, an additional incentive for residents to attend the deliberative stage of the process is created. The second phase creates an opportunity for a broader section of the population to participate in the process, by voting among options that are the fruit of a previous deliberative process which is equally open to all citizens.\n\nRead the full text here:  \n\n<a href=\"http://mobileactive.org/participation-made-easy-sms-participatory-budgeting-and-mobile-tech\">http://mobileactive.org/participation-made-easy-sms-participatory-budgeting-and-mobile-tech</a>A video about the process can be found <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/BertelsmannStiftung#p/u/12/2CffhCRl69Y\">here</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://tiny.cc/0a9le\">http://tiny.cc/0a9le</a><a href=\"http://www.laplata.gov.ar/nuevo/gobierno/institucional/presupart/inicio.shtm\">http://www.laplata.gov.ar/nuevo/gobierno/institucional/presupart/inicio.shtm</a> \n","id":"a6634g7bkmy3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-57.954254,-34.921127]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ipatinga (BR) e-Participatory Budgeting","description":"Text by Tiago Peixoto Source:http://theconnectedrepublic.org/posts/194Following this series of posts about Participatory Budgeting (PB), I would like to describe an experiment in the coordination of which I had the pleasure to participate, which took place in the framework of the e-Agora Project (co-financed by the EC) in the city of Ipatinga, Brazil. Prior to 2001, community leaders of the city of Ipatinga collected written proposals for public works from citizens during neighbourhood meetings which were then submitted for deliberation in PB in loco meetings. Since 2001, the city of Ipatinga has pioneered in using the Internet as a supplementary means for citizens to indicate public works that they wish to see submitted to vote at PB (offline) meetings, where the use of the Internet is correlated with an increase in the level of attendance of women and younger citizens at these face-to-face meetings. In 2005, supported by an intense media campaign (e.g. TV, radio, newspapers), the city administration in partnership with ourselves from the e-AGORA project, launched a pioneering experiment in four of its nine districts using telephony in its PB as a supplementary information and consultation tool.  In the participant districts, our experiment consisted of:·       A free phone number was provided which citizens could call in order to specify their preferences regarding the allocation of the local budget·       SMS messages were sent to citizens who registered on the PB website and provided their phone numbers, encouraging them to participate in the process by indicating their preferences and by attending the deliberative PB meetings·       An automated system of phone calls was deployed, with calls to citizens’ landlines with a recorded voice message from the mayor inviting citizens to the PB meetings, followed by an indication of the date and location (specific to each district) of the assembly.In this respect, we sent 2.950 SMS to the citizens living in the districts participating in the experiment. Also, out of 30,817 calls effectuated by the system to the landlines of those residing in the experiment’s districts, 29,811 were fully accepted: that is, 96.8% of citizens who picked up the phone waited until the end of the mayor’s message before hanging up.During this experiment, we counted on an external evaluation led by the Electronic Democracy Center. Below I present the main findings of the evaluation.·       Compared to the previous year, in the districts where the experiment did not take place, a decline in participation of 16.1% was identified, whereas in the districts where the experiment took place participation increased by 14.7%.·       Nearly half (48.2%) of those who attended the meetings and who had previously indicated public works to be submitted to vote had done so either via the Internet or the free phone number.·       Over 50% of those who attended the meetings declared that the telephone calls they received with a voice message from the mayor were the means of communication that most motivated them to attend the meetings. The case of Ipatinga is interesting not only due to the rather successful results of a multi-channel approach per se, but also because of the complementarities between the online and offline approaches that culminated in a deliberative, face-to-face meeting where the final votes were cast.This online/offline combination is important because, in many cases, one of the aims of implementing PB is to strengthen community ties and to generate a civic event that would be difficult to reproduce in an online environment. For instance, having talked to some PB stakeholders in the UK this seems to be their approach, where they tend to be rather skeptical – and rightly so – about the benefits of fully replacing these face-to-face meetings with virtual online environments. In fact, the e-PB of Belo Horizonte, the boldest experience in the domain so far – which I have mentioned in a previous post – when implementing its fully online PB, did not extinguish its traditional PB (offline), and neither intends to do so in the future.Nonetheless, it would be interesting to research to what extent the use of the Internet, phones, or any other electronic means for indicating proposals, creates an extra incentive for citizens to subsequently participate in a more costly activity – e.g. a face-to-face meeting – in which they would not have participated if they had not previously engaged in an online activity. In other words, it might be that online participation leads to further offline participation.Even if this is not the case at all, more proactive uses of ICTs as a means to increase offline engagement can be proven to be extremely valid, as the case of Ipatinga has shown. The use of ICTs in PB are not limited to providing information, supporting deliberation or e-voting as one might consider at a first glance: ICTs can also be used as a means to coordinate and support mobilization that goes way beyond citizens’ computer screens. The case of Ipatinga might have been just the beginning.

Aiming to support local jobs, stimulate growth and improve community facilities, the program allocates between US$260,000 and US$ 350,000 to each of the 93 NSW electoral districts. Under the program, community groups are eligible to electronically submit applications for funding to support local infrastructure and jobs in the district. Once applicants meet the requirements, MPs prioritize which projects are to receive funding.In the district of Heathcote, MP Paul McLeay has invited the district’s citizens to decide through the Internet on the allocation of the funds that the government has made available. On the MP’s website, the legislator initially used video to explain the context of the initiative and invite citizens to prioritize the eligible proposals formulated by local community organizations.From October 6th, citizens were be able to cast five votes each – with a maximum of 3 votes per project – in order to decide which causes are the most deserving of existing funds. According to a local article on the initiative, a system has been deployed to ensure that only residents of the district vote and to keep the initiative from being defrauded (e.g. multiple voting). In this respect, voting was auditable and were only considered valid by the system if the information provided was accurate and compatible with that contained in the electoral roll.In order to alleviate the effects of the digital divide, the initiative counted on the support of local libraries that have made some of their computers available for citizens to access the initiative’s website. Last, but not least, the website provided tools for organizations and supporters to lead their online canvassing, such as newsletters and website widgets.

Purpose The purpose of the project is to involve citizens in budgetary decisions. The borough council cites the following goals: mutual agreement in policy decisions; effective and fair budgeting; transparency; and educating citizens about financial matters. Most of Lichtenberg's income derives from external sources - nearly 82% of Lichtenberg's income is provided by the city of Berlin, while the rest comes from the Federal Government of Germany, and from internal sources of income, such as construction permit fees, ID card issuing fees, or rental fees. The budget of Lichtenberg consists of two parts: mandatory expenses, which are allocated according to the decision of the Parliament of Berlin or the German federal law, and discretionary expenses, which are directly decided by the borough council of Lichtenberg. The mandatory expenses amount for nearly €520 million. The discretionary expenses are represent a small part of the budget and include the following fields: support of public health; business counseling; planning parks and free space; libraries; general support for children and adolescents; cultural services of public institutions; school of music; voluntary services by senior citizens; care of senior citizens; sports; care of street greenery; care of street trees; care of parks; care of playgrounds; and schools for continuing education. The Participatory Budgeting project allows citizens to discuss and express their preferences with regards to these discretionary fields. The borough yearly allocates the sum of €31 million to implement citizens' preferences and suggestions. For each discretionary field, a brochure, prepared by the borough council, explains which services are provided as part of these fields, by which borough department, who benefits from them (all citizens or only a specific group), and what are the goals of each service. The description of each field is followed by a detailed account of how much money (and what percentage of the field budget) is allocated to each of the borough districts. 2. History The participatory budgeting project was the initiative of the Mayor of Lichtenberg – Ms. Christina Emmrich of the Left Party (the successor of the communist party of the German Democratic Republic), elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. It was first introduced in late 2005 with regards to the budget of FY 2007. The project had been made possible by a new regulation, passed in the Parliament of the city-state of Berlin in July 2005. The regulation requires the boroughs of Berlin to consult with their citizens in all matters concerning the borough. Participatory budgeting was not an explicit part of the regulation, but the existence of a suitable legal framework enabled the Mayor to push her initiative forward and test the pilot version of a participatory budget in 2005. 3. Structure and Participant Selection The borough provides a detailed explanation on the structure of the budget, including precise sums of money and areas in which these sums are to be invested. There are several options for citizen participation. First, an online platform, which operates for several weeks, allows citizens to post online their suggestions and comments and at the end of the discussion period vote for the best ideas. The online platform contains a detailed information section, moderated discussion forum, budget-calculator, proposal wikis, preference polling, newsletter, editor's interviews with politicians, etc. Participation online is open to all and based on self-selection -- no special reach out efforts are made. Second, the borough council conducts thirteen citizen assemblies (one in each of the borough districts). There, citizens can discuss the general budget and the budgetary implications for their specific district with representatives and public officials. All budgetary suggestions are evaluated at the end of the meeting, and each participant can cast a vote. The top five suggestions from each district assembly and the top ten suggestions from the online discussion are then gathered into a single list (a total of up to 75 suggestions). As the online forum and citizens' assemblies are based on unsolicited open participation, they cannot be considered representative. Hence, the borough council carries out a large survey of 25,000 randomly selected residents (nearly 10% of the borough population) to evaluate the best suggestions that were raised online and face-to-face. In 2008, around 2,500 citizens registered to participate online and roughly 600 citizens attended one of the thirteen district assemblies that were held to discuss the budget plan. Participants were mostly young and mid-aged citizens of up to 50 years old, with a level of education higher than in the general population. Additionally, starting in 2009, citizens' feedback has been solicited as to planned construction investments. Planned district projects that still lack a final budget allocation are brought to evaluation by citizens. The borough declared that “on the basis of [citizens'] votes the borough's central assembly will decide which of the projects should be supported”. The borough has invested considerable resources in raising awareness with regards to the participatory budgeting project among residents – municipal representatives distributed posters and leaflets, held information stands at local festivals and events, and publicized the event in the local media. 4. Influence, Outcomes, and Effects The list of the winning citizens' suggestions based on the general borough survey is brought to the city's central assembly of representatives, which is supposed to consider and include the “realizable and fundable” ideas in the budget. A tracking number is allocated to all suggestions – either online and face-to-face – and hence citizens can follow the status of their idea, up to the discussion and decisionmaking at the city's central assembly of representatives. The assembly has to report which proposals have been accepted and provide reasons as to why other suggestions were rejected. Upon the conclusion of the yearly participatory budget, Lichtenberg publishes a detailed brochure which lists the outcomes of the participatory process. The following were the results of the 2008 participatory budget: turning the school for continuing education into handicapped accessible; planting trees in some of the city locations; appointing a coordinator for children and adolescents participation and civic education; transferring most of the city youth recreational facilities to private non-for-profit organizations and hence saving on administrative costs; providing libraries with literature in the Vietnamese language (3,500 of Lichtenberg residents are Vietnamese); and more. The Mayor declared in December 2009 that over the years 90% of citizens' suggestions have been implemented over the years. According to the Mayor, the most common reason to reject a suggestion is a negative previous experience with it (for instance, a suggestion to place in parks dog waste bag dispensers was rejected because it had already been tried in the past and did not work). 5. Criticism The main criticism directed to the participatory budgeting project is that it fails to represent several groups in the population. The fact that participation is based on self selection often excludes the less well-off residents of Lichtenberg. The under-represented groups include immigrants, elderly residents, uneducated residents, etc. Another problem is that citizens are only allowed to make suggestions with regards to a very narrow set of budgetary issues. Citizens' feedback may improve, to some extent, the quality of their lives, but their preferences cannot influence general questions of budgetary priorities and policies. Lastly, the outcomes of the participatory process lack a binding status and largely depend on the willingness of the borough council to adopt them. Moreover, the borough council is not obliged to conduct a participatory budgeting project and another Mayor can change this practice. <u>Summary</u>: Text by Rolf Luehrs (PEP-NET) The first to mention is a borough (Bezirk) of the city of Berlin called Lichtenberg. The borough counts more than 250.000 inhabitants. Since 2006, when the first participatory budgeting process has been realised, Lichtenberg invites the citizens each year to discuss the spending tax payers money. Lichtenberg has developed a complete participatory approach, comprising an Internet platform, involvement by writing letters and 13 district assemblies. The citizens are asked to prioritise the different proposals and a list with the top rated proposals is subject to a representative survey. Finally the borough’s central assembly of representatives decides which of the proposals will be realised and which not. All decisions in favour or against the budget proposals are justified in writing. In 2008 almost 2500 citizens registered to participate in the Internet, 1800 of which were eligible to vote. However only 218 citizens participated in the final voting. Round about 600 people attended in one the 13 district assemblies. Concrete examples of realised outcomes of the participatory budgeting process are: - The school for continuing education got an elevator and is handicapped accessible. - 21 trees have been planted in several streets of Lichtenberg in spring 2008. - The coordinator for participation of children and adolescents has been appointed on January 1st 2008. - Books and DVDs in Vietnamese can now be borrowed from the Anna-Seghers-Library in Lindencenter Source: http://pep-net.eu/blog/2009/10/20/e-participatory-budgeting-in-germany/ <u>Additional sources:</u> \n \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/3/38983242.pdf","id":"a6634ftygkuc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.499451,52.517891]}},{"properties":{"name":"Leipzig (DE) e-Participatory Budgeting","description":"Text by Rolf Luehrs (PEP-NET)Leipzig is located in the east of Germany and counts almost half a\nmillion inhabitants.

In addition, the aspect of gender budgeting was introduced to address gender-specific issues connected to the city’s budget.Citizens registering for the online platform and participating actively in the online discourse and the budget planner numbered 1861. Participants wrote 757 articles in the discussion forums, created 1291 individual budgets for Freiburg and complied 22 wikis discussing specific issues to be addressed by Freiburg’s public administration.The quantitative results produced by the budget planner had two very promising traits. Firstly there were no radical changes to the budgets even though the participants had the possibility to change every budget in a range from -100% to +100%. The strongest budget change was -23%. This means that the collective results of such a process were very reasonable. Secondly the results of the online budget planner were very similar to those produced by the representative survey mentioned earlier.Most of the participants of both, the ePB and the survey wished that spending increases should mainly be directed at schools, education, and social programs. According to an unpublished report of the Canadian consultancy nGernera, “the government was very open to heeding to these demands. In one instance, 400,000 Euros were reallocated for spending on child care projects, due in large part to their widespread support throughout the consultations.21 Upon its completion, the Citizen’s Budget had a “huge influence” on the writing of the actual municipal budget”.Source: http://pep-net.eu/blog/2009/10/20/e-participatory-budgeting-in-germany/Additional sources: http://www.epractice.eu/en/cases/epbfreiburg","id":"a6634g6dvyj9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[7.866211,48.04871]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hamburg (DE) e-Participatory Budgeting","description":"Text by Rolf Luehrs (PEP-NET) The city of Hamburg’s e-participatory budgeting has been realised twice in 2006 and 2009. In 2006 the Internet was the exclusive participation channel and in 2009 it has been complemented by paper and pencil interviews of pupils and elderly people.Hamburg has round about 1.7 million inhabitants and as a city state has its own parliament and is one of the 16 federal states (Bundeslaender) in Germany.With regard to the participatory budgeting project this is considered both, a chance and a challenge. Compared to those from middle sized municipalities or boroughs Hamburg’s budget is not only much bigger but also much more complex. Nevertheless Hamburg decided to discuss about the entire budget and not only about selected parts.The focus point of the 2006 ePB, which has been initiated by the parliament, was the City’s difficult financial situation: With more than 10 billion Euros debts, Hamburg had to pay about one billion Euros interests each year. Hence, the main question was how the city could reduce the debts.To display the city’s expenditures a budget planer has been introduced, which split the overall budget into various policy domains like family policy, interior, the environment etc. The planer enabled all participants to design their own budget by reducing or increasing the individual positions with a budget slider. The only limitation was that the overall budget should not exceed the numbers of 2005. As a result additional spending in one domain had to be compensated by decreasing spending in other.It turned out that the almost 3000 participants who registered for the ePB reduced the expenditures in all domains but child care, education and science. Additionally to the budget planer the participants could also take part in a moderated online discussion (DEMOS) and collaboratively develop proposals on how to better use the city’s budget. 35 five comprehensive concepts have been generated during the 4 weeks lasting discussion.The results have been forwarded to Hamburg’s parliament and were discussed in the plenary. Finally three proposals have been selected for implementation. However, the fact that the reasons for this selection have not been published provoked criticism. During the second ePB in 2009 some of the local media questioned the value of the participatory budgeting because of the comparatively few political consequences of the first one. This might be one reason why the number of participants decreased to only 600.Source: http://pep-net.eu/blog/2009/10/20/e-participatory-budgeting-in-germany/","id":"a6634g60tpx0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[9.975586,53.644638]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cologne (DE) e-Participatory Budgeting","description":"In 2007, for its two-year budget, the city of Cologne (population 1 million) implemented an extensive participatory budget online. A debate was organised in the form of blogs (Engel, 2009). All participants were able to add their comments to proposals and prioritise them; this means that Cologne has adopted and further developed Lichtenberg‘s voting method. A total of around 5,000 proposals were received for the three areas ‚greenery‘, ‚roads, paths and squares‘ and ‚sports‘. The council had undertaken before- hand to give a response to the first 100 proposals received for each of the three areas – this was done in a very scrupulous manner. The various proposals together with the comments added were posted on the website, and could also be read in conjunction with the responses published by the council and committees. Website users could also download a report providing an account of how the additional 8.2 million EUR (around 10 million US$) made available for the participatory budget had been spent. Items included the care and maintenance of green areas and playgrounds – all measures that concern citizens directly. The citizens of Cologne have embraced the participatory budget, which has become the talk of the town. International organisations also see the procedure in a highly positive light, and have awarded the city prizes for it.Source: Sintomer, Y., Herzberg, C., Allegretti, G. and Röcke, A., 2010.

More: Text by Rolf Luehrs (PEP-NET)The forth largest city in Germany with almost one million inhabitants selected three policy domains to be discussed with a total budget of 311 million Euros, namely “highways/byways/public spaces”, “green spaces” and “sport”.The consultation process was based on a multi-channel communication strategy comprising  an eParticipation platform, telephone lines (call centre), letter and personal contact.Interestingly the majority of the ca. 11000 citizens who participated used the Internet: 85% of the almost 5000 suggestions and proposals have been submitted during the four-week online discussion from 22.10 to 19.11.2007. 9% of the suggestions have been submitted by traditional mail, 4% via telephone and 2% via E-Mail.Cologne’s city council has decided to implement the best 300 ideas, for which it has approved additional resources  of €8.2m for 2008/2009. The citizens’ budget 2010 is about to start in November 2009 and it is planned to include additional areas like education/training and protection of the environment.Cologne’s citizens’ budget has won several awards, among them the United Nations Public Service Award. It is also one of the nominees for the public prize of the 4th European eGovernment Awards.Source: http://pep-net.eu/blog/2009/10/20/e-participatory-budgeting-in-germany/Additional sources: http://theconnectedrepublic.org/posts/323","id":"a6634fyeivs3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[6.960526,50.938961]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lazio Region (IT) e-Participatory Budgeting","description":"Once accessing the website, citizens must insert their unique fiscal code number.

The financial autonomy afforded to Brazilian municipalities under the 1988 constitution and the ‘spoils system’ meant that the mayor had discretion over a significant and guaranteed resource stream and allowed him to make strategic senior appointments to support the development of participatory governance. The election of the Workers’ Party candidate came at a time when there was significant associational activity in the city in opposition to the culture of corruption and clientelism. \nParticipants  \nPB in Porto Alegre combines large-scale participation in open regional assemblies with elected citizen representation in decision making bodies (see Process). In the late 1990s, as many as 8.4% of the adult population in Porto Alegre (all residents over sixteen can participate in the process) stated that they had participated in budget assemblies at some point in the last five years. In 1999, the number of participants involved in the process reached over 20,000, with a high degree of rotation amongst participants: one estimate puts the figure at forty percent rotation from one year to the next. The striking feature of PB in Porto Alegre is not simply that it engages large numbers of citizens, but that it mobilises significant numbers from amongst the poor of the city; citizens who are typically politically marginalised. It successfully reversed the trends we associate with political participation, engaging a social group for whom the costs of participation (both direct expenses such as transport and opportunity costs) are high. Comparing her sample of participants in the popular regional assemblies in 1995 with the 1991 census on household incomes, Rachel Abers provides strong evidence that ‘socioeconomic inequalities did not reproduce themselves within the budget assemblies. Much to the contrary, the household incomes of budget participants are significantly lower than those of the population as a whole… participants in the regional assemblies were poorer than the population as a whole’. A Harvard University study indicates that in 2002, the lowest 20th percentile of the population accounted for 30 percent of the participants in the popular regional assemblies.  \nProcess  \n1. Popular assemblies \n16 regional popular assemblies cover different geographical areas of the city. These open assemblies attract the highest levels of participation and have three functions: holding the administration to account; voting for neighbourhood and regional priorities for infrastructure investment (e.g. sanitation, paving, health care, etc.); and electing citizens to the 16 regional budget forums and the Council of the Participatory Budget (COP). The number of delegates going forward to the budget forums is related to the number of votes cast (i.e. the higher the turnout from a neighbourhood, the greater the representation); whereas there are only two councillors from each assembly that are elected to the COP (i.e. equal representation for each region of the city).  \n2. Regional budget forums  \nThe function of the regional budget forums is two-fold. First, delegates prioritise the list of demands that come from the popular assemblies, since limited budgetary resources imply hard choices (only around 30 percent of demands can be financed). Second, the forums are responsible for on-going negotiations and monitoring of the implementation of projects by the various city agencies. Forum meetings are open to all citizens to attend, but only the delegates have voting rights  \n3. Council of the participatory budget \nThe COP is a rule applying and formulating body. First, it applies a set of distributional rules to the investments prioritised by the regional budget forums and put forward by the administration. In the 2000/1 budget, for example, the three criteria guiding decision making were ‘the priorities established by the residents; shortcomings in services and basic facilities; and population base’.[7] It then attends to its second function: to review these rules and agree on those that will guide distribution in the following year. In these tasks the Council works closely with officials from the administration. To defend against the abuse of power, councillors can only be elected for two consecutive terms of office and are subject to immediate recall. As with the budget forums, the meetings of the COP are open, although the public only has observer status. The COP presents the budget to the mayor who then is required to seek the approval of the legislature of the city council. 4. Thematic process  \nThere is a less-discussed parallel process of thematic city-wide popular assemblies that were established to deal with issues that are not neighbourhood-specific, such as environment, education, health and social services and transportation. Six thematic assemblies hold the administration to account, generate priorities and elect thematic budget delegates and two COP councillors (plus alternates). These thematic assemblies do not attract the same level of participation as the regional popular assemblies.  \n5. Restructuring of public administration \nThe operation of the participatory budget has required significant administrative restructuring. The first element was the establishment of a centralised planning office, GALPLAN (Gabinete de Planejamento), to coordinate the technical aspects of the budget across the administration’s different departments and to negotiate and support the work of the COP. The second important development was the creation of the Community Relations Department (CRC, Coordinação de Relações com a Communidade) whose employees actively mobilise participants, supporting the development of associations and facilitating regional budget forums. Coordinators are assigned to each budget region. Finally, the administration invested in a computerised project management system that provides information on the status of projects and the budgets of city agencies. This allows citizens to keep abreast of developments and undertake research on the administration’s activities.  \nOutcome and effects \nPB has led to a redistribution of resources away from prestige projects towards investment in basic infrastructure and services that systematically favour poorer neighbourhoods that had often been neglected by previous administrations: ‘The OP has approved hundreds of projects, including street paving, urban improvements in precarious areas, sewage, municipal public education, and health, with a completion rate of nearly 100 percent. These projects have contributed to an increase to almost full coverage in sewage and water, a threefold increase in the number of children in municipal schools, and significant increases in the number of new housing units provided to needy families’.  \nAnalysis \nPB as practised in Porto Alegre has institutionalised an effective incentive structure to promote engagement amongst its poorest citizens. First, there is a clear relationship between numbers mobilised in the assembly and levels of representation on the budget forums in which delegates prioritise the demands of neighbourhoods into a regional list of investments. The more delegates from a neighbourhood the more influence they can have on investment priorities. Second, the rules operated by the COP to guide the distribution of resources among the various regions of the city have always included at least one criterion related to relative poverty and infrastructure and services deficiencies of regions. There is a distributional bias that favours the poor. Third, the administration employs community organisers who have been particularly active in promoting engagement and developing the civic infrastructure in poorer communities with little tradition of civic organisation. And finally, participation has been enhanced by the ‘demonstration effect’.The administration ensured that it delivered on decisions; as such citizens in neighbourhoods that did not participate in the early years of the budgeting process witnessed the impact of investment in infrastructure and services in neighbouring communities that were mobilised. Where the different elements of this complex incentive structure are not embedded – in the thematic bodies – it is the middle classes and professionals that dominate. Poorer citizens see no direct relationship between their participation and outcomes and so are reluctant to engage.  ","id":"a6634g2nuent"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-51.22916,-30.033285]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bradford","description":"\"Bradford is a post-industrial city in West Yorkshire with a population of 474,000. Politics have been unstable in this city, with power repeatedly shifting between coalitions and marginal majorities over the last 15 years. There is no overall control in the current council, but the executive (consisting of six leading councillors) is conservative. The recent history of Bradford has seen a rise of far-right politics, social ten- sion and inter-racial violence between the majority white population and the minority Pakistani communities. The team of neighbourhood renewal (a national programme aiming at the social, economic, and political development of the poorest areas in the UK) within the Bradford Local Strategic Partnership (a structure linking representatives of private business, the community and voluntary sectors) initiated the participatory budgeting process in 2004. This was based on experiments with local community group funding. £700,000 (around 1,035,000 US$) was available for local improvement works destined for the poorest areas of Bradford. Local communities were encouraged to apply for small sums of between £1,000 and £10,000 (between 1,500 and 15,000 US$). Projects could only be selected if they were linked to established local priorities, and if they had been discussed in the locality.Bradford Vision coordinated and facilitated the process during the two ‚PB-days‘, distributing £300,000 (around 450,000 US$) in early 2004 and a further £314,000 (465,000 US$) in November 2004. Each day consisted of two sessions, during which two representatives from each of the 30 pre-selected projects introduced their project. All participants were delegates of local communities, with high attendance from the main immigrant groups. They had to give each project (except their own) a score from 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest.After 10 presentations, the score sheets were collected, transferred to a computer and the final scores displayed on a projection screen. At the end of each scoring session, those projects without funding were given a second chance, as successful participants could return a small part of their funding towards supporting them. This process worked out very successfully, as approximately 60-70% of the successful groups gave some money back (on averagearound £250-£500, 370-740 US$). It has been repeated in the years since.

The participatory budget is worth around 14 million EUR (around 17 million US$), while the budget as a whole – including municipal enterprises – amounts to 862 million EUR (around 1 billion US$.)Like the Porto Alegre model, the procedure applied by the Andalusian capital resembles a pyramid. The base is formed by a division of the city into 15 zones. Here, citizens meet at forums, which are usually held at community centres. At these forums, ideas for projects are developed and pro- posed. Proposals involving a funding amount below 30,000 EUR (around 37,000 US$) are classified as district projects. Projects that surpass this amount are treated as proposals for the entire city. Delegates are elected for both the neighbourhood and city levels, whose task it is to examine the proposals put forward by the citizens‘ forums, and decide on their final order of priority. This prioritisation involves criteria partly based on those of the Porto Alegre model. A distinction is drawn between ‚general criteria‘ that can be objectively measured, and ‚supplementary criteria‘ that are personally assessed by the delegates. For each proposal between 0 and 15 points are then awarded in each category (see table), on the basis of which a prioritised list is drawn up and passed on to the city government and the city council. These criteria are designed to influence the prioritisation of the proposals such that selected groups and areas benefit to a particularly high degree. In Seville, primarily those projects are implemented that promote social, ecological and democratic goals in areas where the existing infrastructure is weak. Alongside these criteria, the role of citizens in Seville should also be highlighted. They are able to help shape and adapt the process themselves. First of all, committed citizens or- ganised into pressure groups are involved in the preparation of participatory budgeting forums in the districts, as well as in the briefing of their moderators. These preparatory meeting are used to discuss e.g. awareness-raising strategies, the structuring of the citizens‘ forum and the distribution of materials. Secondly, citizens are to some extent able to modify the participatory budgeting procedure and adapt the allocation criteria. Yet despite its clear rules and the fact that this procedure helps empower civil society, its social justice effects are not comparable to those in Latin America.

The mayor comes from a centre-right party (PiS ‚Law and Justice‘), as opposed to the left-wing parties which form the majority in the council (‚Democratic Left Alliance‘, ‚Labour Union‘). The participatory budgeting process in Płock takes place in the framework of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and consists of a public-private partnership between the city of Płock (the main initiator of the process), PKN Orlen (Poland‘s largest oil company located in Plock), the Levi Strauss Company and representatives of local NGOs. The process started in 2002, when the so-called ‚Forum of Plock‘ launched the ‚Grant Fund for Płock Project‘. The first ‚official‘ round took place in 2003 (and afterwards in 2004 and 2005). The fund (until now approximately 300,000 US$ every year) is provi- ded by PKN Orlen, the Levi Strauss Company, and the local government. The official aims are sustainable development, the promotion of economic development, the improvement of living conditions, public safety, the improvement of inf- rastructure and the protection of the cultural heritage and the environment.Applications for projects to be financed through the fund an be submitted by NGOs that have their main office re- gistered in Plock. When applying, the organisation has to de- monstrate a good financial standing, transparent fundraising rules and commitment to the development of civil society. There are clear rules for the evaluation of applications, which have to deal with the six areas identified by the partners: education, economy, protection of heritage, environment, high standard of living and urban architecture. A committee including local citizens, experts and representatives of the official project partners take the decisions, each project being eligible for up to 10,000 US$. Projects are implemented through local civil society associations (Elzbieta Plaszczyk, ‚Plock‘, in Sintomer/Herzberg/Röcke, 2005). The number of applications has grown since the beginning of the process, going from 53 in 2003 (34 accepted), to 70 in 2004 (32 ac- cepted) and on to 102 (59 accepted). The example of Płock has already inspired a similar process in the town of Ostrow Wielkopolski (again, PKN Orlen is one of the donors), and others have shown an interest in starting it.

It was introduced in 2001 within the scope of the ‚municipal participatory budget‘ pilot project of the federal state of North-Rhine/Westphalia. The participatory budget is designed first and foremost to make the financial situation of the town and the work of the municipality more transparent to citizens. To this end, a brochure containing the key information is prepared annu- ally. At the centre of the participatory process is a citizens‘ forum, to which inhabitants are invited by random selec- tion. Beyond that, any interested citizen can take part. The forum comprises an evening event at which the mayor and the chamberlain first of all provide an overview of the finan- cial situation of the municipality. During the interactive partof the meetings, citizens can visit information stands to find out more about the activities of the municipality. In 2004 for instance, the work of the fire brigade, the building of- fice, the public order office and the youth programme were presented. Participants can put any questions they may have to the municipal staff members present, and can write down any suggested improvements on the cards provided and leave them in the collection box. The proposals are not prioritised, but each citizen is sent a personal reply indicat- ing whether his or her suggestion will be implemented, and if so when. The proposals implemented are basically minor repair measures to public facilities (buildings, roads etc.), or minor adjustments to services (opening hours, library services etc.).\"Source: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSintomer, Y., Herzberg, C., Allegretti, G. and Röcke, A., 2010.

Unlike in Latin America, in North America and Europe these kinds of activities are relatively new. A number of interest- ing experiments have also been undertaken by the Service Agency Communities in One World/Capacity Building International division (Ködelpeter/Nitschke, 2008). The most comprehensive experiment to date, however, is being conducted in the grammar schools in the French region of Poitou-Charentes. This involves a total of 93 grammar schools (Sintomer/Röcke 2010). In this procedure, participants can decide on a total sum of 10 million EUR (12.3 mil- lion US$) per year; participants can put forward proposals for small-scale projects and investments worth a maximum of 150,000 EUR (184,000 US$) each (the total school budget amounts to 110 million EUR, around 135 million US$). In each school the participatory budget, which involves all members of the high school community, is based on two forums lasting approximately 2 hours each. The first meeting (November/December) begins with an explanation of how the participatory budget works. In a second step working groups are formed to discuss projects designed to improve day-to-day life in the school. Finally, representatives of each group present their respective results in plenary. After the proposals have been reviewed by the regional government, a second meeting is held (January/ February) at which the proposals are prioritised. Each par- ticipant is given ten ballots to distribute across the propos- als as they see fit. The list of priorities produced in such way is then passed on to the regional government. This process was not a participatory budget in the during the first term, because it does not incorporate yet a second level at which representatives of different schools would come together (this step forward will be done in 2011). Nonetheless, the de facto power of decision-making exercised by the school students (and the other members of the school community) over a portion of the budget is impressive.\"Source: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSintomer, Y.,\nHerzberg, C., Allegretti, G. and Röcke, A., 2010.

Bobigny is a new town, which is dominated by modern estates and tower blocks. The majority of the population belongs to the working class, among them many poor immigrants from French overseas territories. In order to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants, the municipality offers a large variety of social and health services. In the second half of the 1990s, the government started several participation processes on the neighbourhood and city level. Participatory budgeting is part but not the core of this development. The mayor discusses problems of everyday life such as parking, housekeeping and safety twice a year in meetings. Projects demanding small investments can be worked out in commissions, which may present their proposals to the community council. A process for strategic planning exists on the city level. Every two years, an assembly on different topics is organised. In 2004, for example, housing, education, health, and citizen participation were discussed. The local government filters suggestions during these meetings and elaborates a list of concrete proposals to be implemented in the following years. An observatory commission composed of interested citizens scrutinises the execution of these projects and prepares a detailed report, documenting every single proposal. The report is then distributed to all households and discussed in the council. The government has tried to apply a participatory budgeting process through workshops explaining the general financial situation and allowing citizens to formulate proposals. Despite initial plans, no feed- back has been given about the results of the discussions (‚accountability‘). Hence, this process cannot be considered a participatory budget as defined in this project. Bobigny, however, intends to launch a new pilot project in the mu- nicipal agency for social housing based on a small grant fund that citizens could distribute for their local projects.\"Source: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSintomer, Y., Herzberg, C., Allegretti, G. and Röcke, A., 2010.

budgeting and gender mainstreaming: the Rosario experiment PB began in this city of 1.2 million people in 2002 following a methodology adapted from Porto Alegre (Roeder, 2010). In 2003, the municipality decided to also develop gender budgeting, and has been supported by the UNIFEM gender budgeting programme since 2006. The idea is to increase women‘s participation in participatory budgeting and more generally in citizen activities, to make civil servants (both men and women) sensitive to and train them on the gender issue, to merge participatory budgeting and gender main- streaming, to develop gender equity and to fight against gender prejudices. Progressively, all districts have been involved in the experiments and a growing number of specific projects have been adopted, most of them training programmes and, to a lesser extent, campaigns in the public sphere. In 2008, nearly 20 projects were developed, for an amount of around 3.17 million pesos (more than 800,000 US$). The most interesting aspect of this action is that its effects should be sustainable because it induces a mental change, a new way of framing public issues, in relation to gender. In order to empower women and foster gender equity, women‘s involvement in PB is an important but not a sufficient condition; the projects must aim to transform relationships between men and women within the process, and training, no less than political will, should be a crucial dimension (UNIFEM/UNV, 2009).\"Source: Sintomer, Y.,\nHerzberg, C., Allegretti, G. and Röcke, A., 2010.

Its 164,000 tenants and 58,500 residential units (6 percent of the local housing stock) make TCH Canada‘s largest so- cial housing provider. It has a budget of 572 million CAD$ (around 558 US$). A large proportion of its expenditure is comprised of fixed costs, including those for its 1,500-strong workforce. Since 2001 TCH has also had a participatory budget for tenants. Due to its pyramid-shaped structure, the procedure at first glance resembles the Porto Alegre model. Spread across its housing stock there are 27 ten- ants‘ councils that receive residents‘ suggestions and pro- posals. Each tenants‘ council then agrees on five projects for its district. A committee comprised of delegates from the tenants‘ councils also agrees on two further projects for the TCH as a whole. This committee‘s task is to appraise the feasibility of the various projects and their concrete funding requirements. The delegates are also mandatedto support the implementation of the projects approved. Through this procedure, decisions are taken on the use of 7 million CAD$ (around 6.8 million US$) every year. This involves mainly ‚proximity‘ measures such as minor repairs to buildings, the maintenance of greenery or the building of children‘s playgrounds. There is, however, a key differ- ence to Porto Alegre. Unlike in the Brazilian flagship mu- nicipality, the funding no longer has to be approved by the municipal council or the TCH. These funds are managed by the tenants directly. Since many of the tenants come from socially disadvantaged groups, the participatory budget benefits these sections of the population in particular. The activities funded by the participatory budget are flanked by measures in the health sector and other social sectors. Further participatory instruments are also used, especially in the domain of planning. Two tenants also sit on the TCH board, which is comprised of 13 members.\"Source: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSintomer, Y.,\nHerzberg, C., Allegretti, G. and Röcke, A., 2010.

During the 1990s, money was obtained from a provincial government programme, and participatory consultations were held with the stakeholder community on how to use it. Positive experience was gained with this approach, which led to the establishment of a coalition of community initiatives that transferred the procedure to other districts. Thematic proposals and territorial projects are first of all proposed by the organisers. These proposals are discussed and prioritised in community forums. The final decision on funding is taken by community assembly delegates. In other words, the citizens concerned actually do manage the money themselves – frequently with the assistance of a mandated community manager. For each project, a quarter of the funding needed must be obtained by the groups or beneficiaries themselves. A total of more than 1,000 people are participating in this process, a large proportion of them from low-income groups (Pinnington/Lerner/Schugurensky, 2009). For them and their children, activities are financed in their districts such as festivals, leisure activities, educational measures, and minor construction works.\"Source: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSintomer, Y.,\nHerzberg, C., Allegretti, G. and Röcke, A., 2010.
