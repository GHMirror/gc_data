It\\'s about 800 feet long and 3 stories high.  It\\'s now apart of the Silver Comet bike/ped/equestrian trail.  On a hot day, riding through this tunnel is a tremendous relief.  Don\\'t ride fast through it though because spring water drips into the entrances to the tunnel and there\\'s always mud.  The first time I rode through here, I rode fast and had the misfortune of wearing a white shirt with beige shorts.

Most people who want to see the Pumpkinvine Trestle and Brushy Mountain Tunnel get on the trail here. Mount Olivet Road Trailhead, which was on the main drag in my community was once popular, especially for riders and hikers that wanted to visit the tunnel, but the DOT came in and tunneled under Mt. Olivet Road and did away with the trailhead in doing so. There was supposed to be a new trailhead with a paved parking lot going in by now, but I haven\\'t noticed any clearing of the site.

When Polk County was carved out of Paulding and Floyd Counties in 1851, Van Wert became apart of the new county.  For Paulding, the county seat was moved to Dallas.  Three years later, in 1854, the Polk County Seat was moved to Cedartown.  \r\n\r\nVan Wert was the first town in the state to have its own water system, which was installed in 1886.  During and immediately after the Civil War, Van Wert was the only town in this vicinity, however, during the post war economic recovery, the railroad was put through the area to extract the vast mineral resources (especially slate) of the area.  Unfortunately, for Van Wert, a wealthy landowner donated a large tract of land for the railroad to build a station just to the northwest of town, and Rockmart was born.  Because of the location of the train station, Rockmart boomed, and Van Wert stagnated and declined.  \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Van Wert lost its charter, but due to its historical significance, it was declared a special historical district, and therefore it cannot be annexed by the City of Rockmart, thereby retaining its unique identity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6id3tlemp27"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.041465,33.983963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wild Horse Creek Park Trailhead","description":"Posted by Mountainmaverick<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Powder Springs, GAThis trailhead serves as the beginning of the Wild Horse Creek Trail, which follows Wild Horse Creek up to Wild Horse Creek Park on Macedonia Road.
