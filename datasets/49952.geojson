John was right in front of me, and all of a sudden I see this 4- or 5-foot geyser come out of the water — it just went whoosh! And then John said, \\'Steph, I\\'ve been bit.\\' \"\n\nJohn Marrack said he felt something grab his foot and tug it.\n\n\"I felt, like, sharp pricks, but it wasn\\'t painful,\" he said. \"Then I looked around underneath and ... I saw this big, silvery animal down there.\"\n\nAlthough he knew he was hurt, his injuries weren\\'t his only concern. He immediately thought about his wife\\'s safety. \"My job was to keep between her and the shark,\" he said.\n\nThe couple began to swim to shore when John Marrack realized the extent of his wounds.\n\n\"I saw a flap of skin floating around,\" he said. \"There was a boat right there, so I asked them for help and they did a great job.\"\n\nAs luck would have it, Victor Lozano, owner of Dolphin Excursions Hawai\\'i, was in the area and hauled Marrack aboard his 33-foot rigid inflatable boat, Naia 1.\n\n\"There was blood all over that boat,\" said Lozano. \"You could see it was a bite and a release. They were good-sized tooth marks — an inch to in excess of an inch. I had to administer first aid and wrap him up to stop all the bleeding.\n\n\"The guy was actually a really a cool customer. ...

Now, she doubts she\\'ll get in the ocean again — at least here in Hawai\\'i.\n\n\"I\\'m kind of in shock right now,\" the 34-year-old amateur triathlete said yesterday — the day after she was attacked by a shark 150 yards from her Ka\\'anapali hotel.\n\nGlance, who received severe injuries to her right shoulder, arm and wrist, said she was happy to be alive during a news conference at Maui Memorial Medical Center.\n\n\"Right now I\\'m very, very happy,\" she said. \"I didn\\'t think I was going to make it. I was afraid he was going to come back again and finish me off.\"\n\nGlance is the mother of two — a 2-year-old and a 5-month-old — and chief executive of Grossmont Schools Federal Credit Union in El Cajon, Calif. She said she went swimming by herself as a workout to help get back in shape following the birth of her youngest child.\n\nThe attack occurred at about 10:30 a.m. Sunday just after she swam 150 yards from the Embassy Suites Hotel and had turned parallel to the shore.\n\nGlance said the water was somewhat cloudy and she didn\\'t see what slammed into her shoulder and then sliced into her arm and bit her on the wrist.\n\nShe said she and the shark turned in different directions, but before it swam a way, she caught a glimpse of its head and tail. It was gray, she said, with a white tip on its tail. She estimated the length at 6 feet. She said she didn\\'t recognize the species, but could probably identify it from pictures.\n\nGlance said she was able to swim halfway to shore with the help of her fins. Luckily, she said, a surfer heard her screams and helped her in the rest of the way.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6349hj1uvax"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-156.693792,20.9313]}},{"properties":{"name":"Koa Paulo Bitten by Shark 05/03","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/Requin_2.JPG\">Kailua-Kona, HIMay 10, 2003\n\nKoa Paulo was swimming between Magic Sands Beach and Kahaluu Beach on the Big Island when he was attacked at about 12:45 p.m. by a gray-colored shark estimated at about 6 feet.
