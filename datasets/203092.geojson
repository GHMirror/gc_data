This enraged the\nAssad forces and his cronies when they saw the residents of Homs respond to\nthe call for the general strike, so they opened fire at the closed stores\nand bombed homes. This time, they aimed at families, and as a result, they\nbombed the home of one family from which the grandmother, a little girl and\na brother, and the father and mother were struck. The little girl, Katrin\nKhabour was killed. Here are some videos showing the family struck by a nail\nbomb in Al-Bayada neighborhood, where the bomb was launched from Al-Zeer\ncheckpoint:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il9PLhLx3kA\n\nChild martyr Katrin Khabour, a gift to Bashar and the Arab League\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRqSMgbl94s\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmhJnccfxMY\n\nA 4 year old boy was also killed, another gift from Bashar to the Arab\nLeague\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lOrMMAm3_s\n\nOver than 10 people other than the above-mentioned family were also injured\nin the same neighborhood, among then two children, one of them has been\nkilled most likely. Conditions in Al-Bayada and Baba Amro are very bad, and\ngunfire still intermittently continues.\n\nHere are some videos from Al-Bayada from today:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn0kq1EXGY4\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhs6eqg12Pk\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyIaj8EzlpQ\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-JgFZSYK1U\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC8yKuDbzyI\n\nVideos from Deir Balba from today:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFGO5n1uo7I\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y90fHpFFvLI\n\nThe neighborhoods of Homs ... who gives them a break?!\nThe rest of the neighborhoods and towns of Homs remain under fire. Baba\nAmro, which everyday gets threatened, surrounded, and hit by all types of\nweapons, witnessed severe panic today and smoke columns rose above the\nneighborhood.

Take away whatever is left of the regime's sanity\nResidents stayed at home, as no students, public employees, or business\nowners worked today. Neighborhoods and towns of Homs responded to the strike\nand stores remained closed today, so the Assad forces destroyed stores in\nplaces like the historic Al-Kaisariyah and Al-Qusayr areas, where security\nforces threatened residents to open their stores using mosque loudspeakers.\nHere are some sample videos from the general strike around Homs:\n\nAl-Dablan:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tim25Q9GQ0\n\nTadmur:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w202fCDDu7A\n\nAl-Karabees:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNk6Fd2xhNU\n\nDeir Balba:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqv2xGVpTZ0\n\nTal Kalakh:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvz6HdEYdYw\n\nAl-Qusayr:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TyO0o_hoJQ\n\nDemonstrations also went out in most neighborhoods that were relatively far\naway from the hateful Assad forces, including for example, Bab Tadmur, Bab\nHoud, Al-Waar, Al-Holeh, and other areas.

Fires were seen in the Baath University near the\nFaculty of medicine, which is close to the area being bombed. In continued\nattempts to mislead media by the Assad regime, two medical student\nresidence halls that overlook Baba Amro, were emptied so none of them could\ncapture what the regime was doing to the innocent people in the\nneighborhood.\n\nIn Deir Balba, a young man, Khaled Hasan Al-Yaseen was stopped at the\ncheckpoint by the Deir Balba-Al-Bayada traffic sign, and after he passed\nthrough and was 50 meters away, they shot him from the back. The bullet\nwent through the car, his body, and the front windshield, and he died.\nThere were also two explosions that shoot Al-Janoubi area of ​​Deir Balba,\nand reportedly, a young man was injured in the shoulder and is in critical\ncondition.\n\nA young man, Mahmoud Al-Nimr was shot and killed by a sniper at Al-Atrash\ncircle\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPRj3U-mns0\n\nIn Jib Al-Jandali, martyr Mulham Al-Shlar, 25 years old, died after he was\nshot by an armored vehicle stationed in the neighborhood. The security\ncheckpoint in the neighborhood arrested 6 young men and took them to an\nunknown location, and to this time there is no information about them.\n\nIn Al-Bayada, 2 armored vehicles passed in Al-Qahera street and started\nfiring heavily, which greatly terrorized residents, who fled home to escape\nthe gunfire, leaving their stores open. Gunfire was shot intermittently\nfrom Al-Zer checkpoint towards homes and an unannounced curfew was imposed.\nMovement completely stopped in Al-Qahera street. Abo Al-Nour, 60 years old,\nwho owns a vegetable carriage, was arrested in Al-Bayada after he was\ninjured by gunfire and his carriage was destroyed, which is his main source\nof income.\n\nAl-Khadr neighborhood was also completely surrounded and Assad forces fired\nrandomly to terrorize the residents. Assad thugs then spread around to\ncarry out inspections and further terrorize the residents. Seeing as there\nwas heavy gunfire, there was no noon prayer in Othman mosque.\n\nSince the morning, Assad forces started raiding some homes in Al-Karama\narea in Bab Al-Sbaa, and surrounding area looking for soldiers who defected\nlast night. The sniper who is located on top of the Citadel targeted young\nman, Mahmoud Atyah with two bullets, one in the head and the other in the\nstomach. A funeral was held for the martyr after the evening prayer.\n\nThe systemic terrorizing practiced by the Assad forces continued, and a new\ncheckpoint was placed at the Baath branch building in Al-Inshaat to\nincrease the siege on the residents and to be able to carry out more\nterrorizing operations.\n\nIn Al-Khaldiyeh, a funeral was held for the two martyr brothers, Abdelbari\nand Abdelmalek Al-Zain, who were killed yesterday by Assad forces bullets\nduring a peaceful demonstration calling for freedom. Here is a video clip\nof the brothers' funeral:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQliA9NoMKs\n\nIn Talbiseh, a 40 year old lady, Fatima Abdo Al-Deekh was killed by a\nbullet to the head from snipers at one of the checkpoints in the area.\nFatima took care of orphans and she was going with two of her grandchildren\nto the barber shop, when the sniper at the athletic club checkpoint\ntargeted her. Here are video clips of martyr Fatima:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EpGkltURU0\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZztR-4dadk\n\nAs if that were not enough for the checkpoint, Assad forces there fired two\nbullets at a pedestrian, one hitting him in the hand, and the other hit him\nin the back and came out of his stomach. Luckily he survived somehow and he\nis in a stable condition. Residents should be warned about this checkpoint\nthat fires randomly, and we warn people from going near an remnants from\nthe Assad forces, as a 12 year old child yesterday in Talbiseh came near an\nexploded bomb and when he touched it, it exploded and he lost three fingers\non his left hand and bad disfigurement to his face, while his eyes are\nstill shut to this moment.\n\nSince early morning, intermittent gunfire from machine guns could be heard\nin Al-Qusayr as a reminder to the residents of the presence of the Assad\nforces.\n\nThere was an explosion in Tadmur from the direction of the airport, and its\nnature is still unknown. Military aircraft was also observed in the area.\n\nA demonstration went out in Joret Al-Shayah after the evening prayer in\nsolidarity with Baba Amro, and in it, the demonstartors called for imposing\na no-fly zone to deter the Assad forces and its cronies.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXQ3Vjac28c\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NTGt5YKE_U\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls5rwhW7mfA\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUzS8AfzSXI\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBmyhygBgio\n\nA store was set on fire in Karm Al-Zeitoun by Assad thugs because of the\nstrike\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuKf4huQ88g\n\nSo far today, there are 9 confirmed martyrs\nNasser Al-Hamwi | Homs | Baba Amro\nMahmoud Jnaid | Homs | Baba Amro\nKhaled Hasan Al-Yaseen | Homs | Deir Balba\nMuhammad Abdel Azziz Al-Taleb | Homs | Deir Balba\nFatima Al-Deekh, 45 | Homs | Talbiseh\nMuhammad Muslmani, 90 | Homs | Baba Amro\nMuhammad Mulham Shnar | Homs | Jib Al-Jandali\nNour El-Deen Al-Attar | Homs | Jib Al-Jandali\nMahmoud Al-Nimr | Homs | Deir Balba","longitude":36.707394},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.707394,34.708414]}},{"properties":{"city":"Hama","timestamp":{"end_time":"2011/10/29 23:05:01 -0400","original":"10/29/2011 23:05:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/10/29 23:05:00 -0400"},"incident":"#N/A","latitude":35.13781,"category":"Aggregate Report (the report of the total), Eyewitness Report (Tgarirchahd visible), Killed (killed)","id":"a620bf8k0aua","description":"#N/A","longitude":36.752449},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.752449,35.13781]}},{"properties":{"city":"Homs","timestamp":{"end_time":"2011/10/30 09:16:01 -0400","original":"10/30/2011 9:16:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/10/30 09:16:00 -0400"},"incident":"#N/A","latitude":34.708414,"category":"#N/A","id":"a620bfjjvs05","description":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFKYZQH1tBE&amp;

many at the hands of the security forces, leading to growing international condemnation of the use of excessive force by President Bashar al-Assad's government to suppress protests.\n\n Syrian residents, the government, human rights organizations and international personalities have all spoken out on the situation. Below are excerpts:\n\n\n Person one talking to IRIN from Syria:\n\n \"Until now, the situation has not calmed down despite all the changes made by the government and the abolition of the emergency law. People are still demonstrating but not in huge numbers. But in general, Syrians are fearful because they cannot predict what will happen.\"\n\n Person two talking to IRIN from Syria:\n\n \"What we see on TV channels is extremely exaggerated. It is only hundreds of people demonstrating here and there. People say some of the footage goes back to incidents that took place in Lebanon in 2008. Syrians are leading a normal life and they are sending their kids to school. Also the country has not witnessed any hike in food prices.\"\n\n President Bashar al-Assad: [ http://www.sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/18/pr-341923.htm ]\n\n 18 April - \"Syria is going through a critical stage... there are different components of this stage. There is the conspiracy. There are the reforms and the needs... the blood which has been spilled in Syria has pained us all. It pained the heart of every Syrian. We are sad for the loss of every Syrian and for all those who have been injured... We consider them all martyrs, whether they were civilians, members of the police or the armed forces... The investigation committee is proceeding with its work in order to know the causes of what happened and to identify those responsible and then bring them to account.\n\n \"The Syrian constitution allows for demonstrations, but we do not have a law which regulates the process of demonstrating. This process is a challenge to the police because they are not prepared for such things... There might be a need for restructuring the police in order to cope with the new reforms. One of the tasks of the police is to protect demonstrators and at the same time protect other individuals and public and private property from any attempt at sabotage or undermining people's security.\"\n\n Government through the Syrian News Agency [ http://www.sana.sy/eng/29/2011/04/27/343515.htm ]:\n\n 24 April - \"A number of foreign media sources continue to spread lies and misdirection about the events in Syria, impersonating people under the guise of so-called eyewitnesses. Ammar Agha, a Syrian surgeon from the town of Jableh, told the Syrian Satellite Channel that one of the callers... impersonated him to tell lies and events that he knows nothing about in Jableh.\"\n\n 27 April - \"Nine policemen of the Internal Security Forces were wounded over the past two days by extremist terrorist groups, raising the number of injuries among the forces' officers since the start of events in Syria to 295.\"\n\n\n Syrian Human Rights Commission: [ http://www.shrc.org/data/aspx/d11/4421.aspx ]\n\n 17 April - \"Protests in Homs and the city of Talbisa north of Homs witnessed today the death of several people by the security forces, popular committees and thugs supporting them. The victims were taking part in a peaceful protest calling for freedom during the funeral of some of the victims in Talbisa.\n\n \"Several injuries have also been reported and several hospitals in the city including the Bab Al-Sibaa' Hospital and the Al-Razi Hospital have pleaded for blood donations, while security forces arrested several citizens who rushed to donate much-needed blood to aid the tens of injured who mostly suffer from direct and serious injuries in the head and chest... both Ridwan Al-Smoody and Tareq Zanbo from Latakia have been killed today as the security forces fired at the peaceful demonstrators.\"\n\n UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay [ http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38181&amp;Cr=syria&amp;Cr1= ]:\n\n 25 April - \"The international community has repeatedly urged the Syrian government to stop killing its own people, but our calls have gone unheeded. Instead, the government's response has been erratic, with paper reforms followed by violent crackdowns on protesters. Just a few days after the announcement of sweeping and important reforms, we are seeing such disregard for human life by Syrian security forces. The killings must stop immediately.\n\n The [OHCHR] has received a list naming 76 people who were killed on Friday [22 April] during evidently peaceful marches, but noted that the number may be much higher. It is also looking into the reported killing of at least 13 others in funeral processions on Saturday [23 April].\"\n\n UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon [ http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38198&amp;Cr=syria&amp;Cr1= ]:\n\n 26 April - \"I condemn, utterly, the continuing violence against peaceful demonstrators, most particularly the use of tanks and live fire that have killed and injured hundreds of people. It goes without saying that Syrian authorities have an obligation to protect civilians and respect international human rights. That includes the right to free expression and peaceful assembly.\"\n\n Catherine Ashton, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy: [ http://europa.eu/press_room/index_en.htm ]\n\n 23 April - \"I condemn the use of brutal force against demonstrators across Syria, which is resulting in high numbers of victims. The Syrian authorities must immediately stop their violent response and fully respect citizens' right to peaceful demonstrations. I deeply regret the death of many protesters on 21 April, and offer my condolences to their families. The killings are appalling and intolerable. All those responsible for these crimes must be brought to justice and held accountable for their actions.\n\n \"I noted President Assad's announcement of three decrees on 20 April, related to the lifting of the state of emergency, abolition of the Higher State Security Court and a right to peaceful protests. However, credible reform can only be measured by real improvements on the ground.\"\n\n Human Rights Watch: [ http://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/1966 ]\n\n 24 April - \"The UN should set up an international inquiry into the fatal shootings by Syria's security forces of peaceful protesters... the inquiry should also examine other human rights violations committed since anti-government protests began in mid-March. The US and European Union should also impose sanctions on Syrian officials who bear responsibility for the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters and the arbitrary detention and torture of hundreds of protesters, as well as request an urgent briefing of the UN Security Council on the spiralling situation in the country.\n\n \"On April 22, Syria's security forces killed at least 76 protesters, and possibly as many as 112, according to lists compiled by local human rights activists. Human Rights Watch interviewed protesters in the towns of Homs, Ezraa, Douma, and Maadamiya, who reported that security forces opened fire on them without warning. On April 23, security forces shot at funeral processions in Barza, Douma, and Ezraa, killing at least 12 additional mourners.\"\n\n Amnesty International:  [ www.amnesty.org ]\n\n 26 April - \"The UN Security Council must refer the situation in Syria to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. The Syrian government is clearly trying to shatter the will of those peacefully expressing dissent by shelling them, firing on them and locking them up.\n\n \"[Amnesty is calling] for the imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo on Syria and an assets freeze on President Bashar al-Assad and others involved in ordering or perpetrating serious human rights abuses... unarmed Syrians gathering to call for greater freedom have routinely been attacked by security forces firing live ammunition directly into crowds of peaceful demonstrators... violence has since spiralled, with at least 120 people killed on [22 April], until then the bloodiest day so far. Amnesty International has received the names of 393 people killed since protests began.\"\n\n The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect: [ http://www.globalr2p.org/ ]\n\n 26 April - \"The situation is deteriorating and the risk of further atrocities is significant. Over 350 individuals have allegedly been killed since the protests began, at least 120 since Friday [22 April] alone. The security forces have shown no restraint, using live fire ammunition against unarmed protesters. In the southern city of Deraa they are relying on tanks and other heavy weaponry to respond to demonstrations.\n\n \"Reports have emerged from [Deraa] of shelling of residential neighbourhoods and the use of snipers targeting those trying to assist the wounded. Foreign reporters have been banned from entering the country and there are reports that the telephone service has been cut in certain cities, making it difficult to get information out and leading to fears about what the government plans to do hidden from the attention of the world.\"","longitude":38.996815},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.996815,34.802075]}},{"properties":{"city":"daraa","timestamp":{"end_time":"2011/04/27 01:09:01
