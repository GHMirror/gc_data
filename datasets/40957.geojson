The two-level room used to be a bakery, and the proprietors have put in sliding industrial doors and hung trendy filament bulbs along the ceiling. Swatches of what appears to be cheesecloth cover the wine rack, and oil lamps line one of the brick walls. A wooden library-card catalogue has been placed by the coat check, and the menus are presented on clipboards and stamped like office order forms. Happily, this oddly forced décor is transcended, for the most part, by the cooking of the American-born, London-trained chef, Brad Farmerie. Australasian cuisine, as he defines it, is an agreeable mishmash of American structure (everything’s arranged in a Portale tower), farm-fresh ingredients, and global (mostly Southeast Asian) spices and tastes. That includes an inventive kangaroo dish (cut in slivers, arranged on crisp falafel cake, and crowned with a spoonful of tangy green-pepper relish) accompanied by a nourishing bowl of parsnip soup flavored, in the Indian style, with cumin and coriander, plus a rogue sprinkling of dried barberries. — Adam Platt \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635r57yf0fm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.994302,40.722301]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spring Lounge","description":"Posted by Toby2bc<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 48 Spring Street, New York NYGood place for laid-back drinks among a mix of locals &amp; tourists.
