Consequently, it is not an exact representation of the wind field.\nThis surface wind field is intended to show the areas potentially being affected\nby sustained winds of tropical storm force (34 knot), 50 knot and and hurricane force\n(64 knot) winds from a tropical cyclone. These data are based on the wind radii contained\nin the associated Forecast/Advisory.  Users are reminded that the Forecast/Advisory wind\nradii represent the maximum possible extent of a given wind speed within particular\nquadrants around the tropical cyclone. As a result, not all locations falling\nwithin the radii will be experiencing the indicated wind speeds.\n\nThese data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level\nand for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales\nappropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed\nby the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the use of these data.\nUploaded as shp, dbf, and shx files.
