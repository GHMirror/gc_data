The event featured many local performance acts and DJs. It was a tough gig - the space was acoustically unworkable and the event was pretty ambitious for the time/money/resources allocated to it. DJ Cyan, who was later to become a good friend, was spinning and I finally took a moment to just relax and sip on my beer and take in the ambiance. She was mixing in \"Easy Lee\", a track by Ricardo Villalobos at that moment. It seemed to illustrate how I felt perfectly, and that track (and the whole \"Alcachofa\" disc) is pretty intimately tied with Montreal in my mind.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64dgxq1hh6v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.556299,45.49785]}},{"properties":{"name":"In the car with my brother","description":"Posted by KasprzakThere were some truly blissful moments, driving along with my brother in his old Toyota (or old Civic - he went through several beaters).

It was a good apartment - nice hardwood floors, lots of light, big kitchen. One time in the kitchen I made a big turkey dinner. This was just before Christmas, and I invited over the students who were at UQAM from France, since they weren\\'t able to go home to France I figured it was a reason to make a turkey dinner. I only had an old ghetto blaster for the kitchen, and I played a lot of Air (particularly the \"Moon Safari\" disc) and Portishead (\"Dummy\") while we prepared the turkey, and then while we ate it.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64dgxpclsdo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.561063,45.521894]}},{"properties":{"name":"My Apartment","description":"Posted by KasprzakI lived here for several years while in Toronto. It was a tiny bachelor in a co-op with a nice garden. I listened to lots of music while in here, mostly on CDs, while these days it is mostly off my iPod or computer. These were pre-iTunes days. Some of the memorable discs that I associate with this apartment are Andrea Parker (\"Kiss My Arp\"), St. Petersburg Chamber Choir (\"Russian Sacred Choral Music\"), Radiohead (various). <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64dgxlqw0ha"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.3821,43.667592]}},{"properties":{"name":"My Work","description":"Posted by KasprzakFor three years I worked at the Canadian Film Centre. I had a wee office that, most importantly, had a door that closed. So I could close my door and listen to music while I worked at one thing or the other, and most memorably I liked listening to Talvin Singh (\"OK\"), and The Streets (\"Original Pirate Material\"). My boss had excellent taste in music, and I\\'ll never forget (for some reason, it was not a particularly memorable moment) but on one of our umpteen cab rides back downtown she was speaking passionately about \"this new band\" The Streets and how great they were. I went out and bought the CD. She was right - they were great.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64dgxpl06r9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.382272,43.741305]}},{"properties":{"name":"Night Out with Boss","description":"Posted by KasprzakI was still doing my undergraduate at Ryerson when I got a job doing 3D animation for a feature film by a famous artist. I was so pleased with this turn of events. My boss was super cool - the CEO of the software company that made the 3D animation package I was using. He suggested we go celebrate and so we went to this club called Roxy Blu. We ate some takeout food, sitting on the floor in the lobby (we were starving), and then had a bunch of drinks and danced while Kruder and Dorfmeister played live. They were amazing, I had just scored this great new job, and I was having a fabulous night out - it stands out as one of the happiest nights of my early twenties.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64dgxr9gikc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.397657,43.645827]}},{"properties":{"name":"Studio","description":"Posted by KasprzakThis was the studio where I spent a lot of time during my Master\\'s studies at UQAM. I shared the studio with a few other students. My best friend Nic and I would hang out in there for hours, smoking Gauloises and listening to music loudly. He\\'d paint and I\\'d pretend to be doing something. Maybe just smoking. We stole a couch to make it more comfortable to hang out in there. I\\'ll always associate the Red Hot Chili Peppers (particularly the Californication disc) and Underworld (particularly the 2 disc \"Greatest Hits\") with my time in the studio with Nic.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64dgxn9jz6m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.56853,45.509415]}},{"properties":{"name":"Suomenlinna","description":"Posted by KasprzakI was doing a residency on the former military fortress of Suomenlinna. The island is quite lonely and spooky, especially at night.  I was in my room one evening and turned on the radio. On the tinny speakers a rather pleasant, though melancholy tune played and filled my strange little room. I looked it up and it was \"Karleken Vantar\" by a Swedish rock group called Kent.

He was fully kitted out with lathes and milling machines and all kinds of stuff for fabrication and electronics. I mostly didn\\'t know what I was doing but didn\\'t lose any fingers so I guess everything worked out all right. This young engineer worked in the studio as well, and played music all the time, constantly challenging my taste and asking me to come up with funny ways to describe the music he would put on (\"Pirate music\" was one memorable descriptor). Anyways, I do remember walking away quite liking Ulver (particularly the disc \"Svidd Neger\") and some other things.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64dgxjpmx22"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.585138,45.54381]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/8183","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kasprzak","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kasprzak","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/8183","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=8183,platial:user=kasprzak","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48762}
