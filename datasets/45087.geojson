Specializing in all things electronic and alternative Rock &amp; Roll we have hosted bands such as The Greenskeepers, Dead Combo, Shy Child, Revlon 9, Silver Rockets and The Glass to name but a few... Our goal is to maintain the Lower East flavor that is dissipating all too quickly by providing a venue that incorporates everything from Dub, Electro, Punk, House and down and dirty rock and roll!
