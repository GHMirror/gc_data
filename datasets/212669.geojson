The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents.  The Census Bureau obtains the boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels for school districts from State officials for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district.  This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to States and school districts.  TIGER/Line Files include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary, and unified school districts.  The 2010 Census school district boundaries are those in effect for the 2009-2010 school year.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","features":[],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":null,"metadata":null,"contact_name":"","contact_address":"4600 Silver Hill Road, Stop 7400, Washington, DC, 20233-7400","source":"U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Geographic Products Branch","contact_phone":"301-763-1128"},"source":null,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":null,"limit":1000000},"state":"errored","tags":"","published":"2011-01-01T05:00:00Z","id":212669}
