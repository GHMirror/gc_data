Tabor, the hill you can see up Hawthorne from the Hostel, is an extinct volcano and a great park for walks, scenic views, and riding your bike or longboard down from the top.\nIn the park you\\'ll find basketball and tennis courts, a playground, a cut-away of the hill showing the volcanic rock it\\'s composed of and the soil on top, as well as three of Portland\\'s reservoirs.  The reservoirs were built between 1894 and 1911, and their battlements and stonework give the area sort of a medieval feel.\nPortland didn\\'t discover that Tabor was a volcano until after they\\'d already turned it into a park, and they used cinders from the volcano to pave the park\\'s roads.  Tabor makes Portland one of only two cities in the continental U.S. to contain an extinct volcano.
