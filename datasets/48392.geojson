Hoey, Governor of North Carolina; and commissioned in New York City on 9 April 1941 with Captain Olaf M. Hustvedt first in command. The first commissioned of the US Navy\\'s new fast, heavily-armed (16 inch gunned) battleships, the North Carolina received so much attention during her fitting out and trials that she won the enduring nickname \"Showboat\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho3xlsicn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9718914032,40.7040338096]}},{"properties":{"name":"10) End of World War II","description":"Posted by Stdrew12<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/03/2/WWIIvjDayLifeMag.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> North Carolina sent both sailors and members of her Marine Detachment ashore for preliminary occupation duty in Japan immediately at the close of the war, and patrolled off the coast until anchoring in Tokyo Bay 5 September to re-embark her men. Carrying passengers from Okinawa, North Carolina sailed for home, reaching the Panama Canal 8 October. She anchored at Boston 17 October, and after overhaul at New York exercised in New England waters and carried United States Naval Academy midshipmen for a summer training cruise in the Caribbean.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho45ba79e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.752960205,35.3800929921]}},{"properties":{"name":"11) At Home in Wilmington","description":"Posted by Stdrew12<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> North Carolina was transferred to the people of North Carolina 6 September 1961. She was purchased from the US Navy for 30,000 raised by North Carolinian school children. In 1961 a fleet of tugboats was used to maneuver the 728-foot (222 m) ship through an area of the river 500 feet (152 m) wide. During this move the ship struck the restaurant \"Fergus\\' Ark,\" near Princess Street. The river-based restaurant was damaged severely and ceased operation. On 29 April 1962, she was dedicated at Wilmington, North Carolina as a memorial to North Carolinians of all services killed in World War II and may be visited to this day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho3xxrpw7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.9525470734,34.2366233906]}},{"properties":{"name":"2) shakedown in the caribbean","description":"Posted by Stdrew12<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/03/1/2_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> North Carolina completed her shakedown in the Caribbean prior to the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Early in 1942, North Carolina was scheduled to head to Pearl Harbor. However, she remained in the Atlantic a few more months so she would be available to take on the German battleship Tirpitz, in the event that ship began to attack Atlantic convoys shipping goods from America to England<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho3xv33ot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.091796875,19.5597901365]}},{"properties":{"name":"3) Panama","description":"Posted by Stdrew12<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/03/1/panama.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> After intensive war exercises, North Carolina departed for the Pacific theater.

North Carolina\\'s arrival at Pearl Harbor on 11 July 1942 was a noteworthy event; North Carolina was the first new battleship to arrive in the Pacific since the beginning of the war. According to sailors at Pearl, the North Carolina was \"the most beautiful thing they had ever seen\", and her arrival in Hawaii greatly increased the morale of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho452flrn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.966575623,21.3159231532]}},{"properties":{"name":"5) Guadalcanal Campaign","description":"Posted by Stdrew12<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/03/1/damage.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> North Carolina and the Navy began the long island-hopping campaign for victory over the Japanese by landing Marines on Guadalcanal and Tulagi 7 August 1942, beginning the Guadalcanal campaign.\r\n\r\nOn 15 September, sailing with Wasp and Hornet, North Carolina took a torpedo portside, 20 feet (6 m) below her waterline, and six of her men were killed.

She rejoined the carriers off Ulithi 7 November as a furious typhoon struck the group. The ships fought through the storm and carried out air strikes against western Leyte, Luzon, and the Visayas to support the struggle for Leyte. During similar strikes later in the month, North Carolina fought off her first kamikaze attack.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho3tnnor5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[127.177734375,6.92642684706]}},{"properties":{"name":"8) Iwo Jima","description":"Posted by Stdrew12<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/03/1/Iwo_Jima.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> With Ulithi now her base, North Carolina screened wide-ranging carrier strikes on Formosa, the coast of Indo-China and China, and the Ryūkyūs in January, and similarly supported strikes on Honshū the next month.[36] Hundreds of enemy aircraft were destroyed which might otherwise have resisted the assault on Iwo Jima, where North Carolina bombarded and provided call fire for the assaulting Marines through 22 February<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho3ykxnd4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[141.306152344,24.8235089803]}},{"properties":{"name":"9) Okinawa Assault","description":"Posted by Stdrew12<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/03/2/015753c.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Strikes on targets in the Japanese home islands laid the ground-work for the Okinawa assault, in which North Carolina played her dual role, of bombardment and carrier screening. Here, on 6 April, she downed three kamikazes, but took a 5-inch hit from a friendly ship during the melee of antiaircraft fire. Three men were killed and 44 wounded. Next day came the last desperate sortie of the Japanese Fleet, as Japanese battleship Yamato, the largest battleship in the world, came south with her attendants. The Yamato, as well as a cruiser and a destroyer, were sunk, three other destroyers were damaged so badly that they were scuttled, and the remaining four destroyers returned to their fleet base.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hho3ycfudu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[128.243408203,26.4656556378]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/619439","metadata":null,"contact_name":"stdrew12","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:stdrew12","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/619439","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=619439,platial:user=stdrew12","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48392}
