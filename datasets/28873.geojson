The Paper Calculator provides users with the U.S. average energy and wood consumption and environmental releases of different paper types across their full lifecycle. For each of thirteen major grades of paper and paperboard, it allows the user to compare the environmental impacts of papers made with different levels of recycled content, and to see how using less paper or changing other specifications can reduce environmental impacts. Finally, the Paper Calculator helps users to measure and communicate the environmental benefits of better paper choices. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zyg5bp1vh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.987511,40.738517]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steam System Tool Suite","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585If you consider potential steam system improvements in your plant, the results could be worthwhile. In fact, in many facilities, steam system improvements can save 10% to 20% in fuel costs. To help you tap into potential savings in your facility, DOE offers a suite of tools for evaluating and identifying steam system improvements.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zygjiusfb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.026109,38.887569]}},{"properties":{"name":"Unitary Air Conditioner Cost Estimator","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>1000 Independence Ave., SW Washington, DC 20585-0121FEMP recommends this tool to determine the cost-effectiveness of an air conditioner (new installation or replacement) project. The Unitary Air Conditioner (UAC) and the Room Air Conditioner (RAC) Cost Estimators compare high-efficiency rooftop and room air conditioners to standard equipment in terms of life cycle cost. These electronic tools provide an alternative to complicated building simulation models, while offering more detail than simplified estimating tools that are commonly available. While simplified tools are typically based on full-load efficiencies and full-load equivalent operating hours, the estimators account for local climate and partial-load, as well as full-load efficiencies. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zygboulr5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.026109,38.887569]}},{"properties":{"name":"WAste Reduction Model (WARM)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68zyg7hyidr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.028143,38.895037]}},{"properties":{"name":"WAste Reduction Model (WARM)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.EPA created WARM to help solid waste planners and organizations track and voluntarily report greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy savings from several different waste management practices.
