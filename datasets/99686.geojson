It's just that I've been submerged in a couple of freelance jobs, job hunting, doing laundry and just needed to take a break! You are going to think I'm weird ( o.k., fine ... y'all already know that I'm weird) ... so ... EVERY TIME I fly; I never fail to think about this wilight Zone episode with William Shatner:  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhk4HcxhZQM\">\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.\"</a>\nWhen the first leg of my flight was nearing Phoenix, I witnessed this most amazing sunset and was quite saddened that I wasn't on the ground to enjoy it. I couldn't quite see the sun no matter how much I craned my neck or flattened my face against the glass; however, the light on the wing was fiery orange and the sky so beautiful over the mountains. \nWhile I was doing that, my thoughts immediately drifted to William Shatner! So here is my silly spin on the episode. Now don't anyone get after me for the 'technical aspects' of this image. I realize the shadow is FAKE and probably not 'in the correct orientation' either; but who cares, right? This is for fun! It made me feel better, and I hope it made you laugh too!!\nAnd if you have the time and really need some more humor, watch Saturday Night Live's spoof on this episode: <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/watch/134734/saturday-night-live-nightmare-at-20000-feet\">\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet on Saturday Night Live\"</a> with Jude Law &amp; Pearl Jam!!\n~\n~<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/toy-in-the-frame_thursday/pool/with/5436438584/\"><b>Happy Toy-in-the-Frame Thursday!</b></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixelmama/5515833874/","id":"2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.075767,33.448261]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5515698432","title":"Beautiful 78 degree day!","published":{"end_time":"2011/03/10 14:37:34 -0500","original":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 11:37:33 -0800","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/03/10 14:37:33 -0500"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/firegroundcom/\">Fireground</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/firegroundcom/5515698432/\" title=\"Beautiful 78 degree day!\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5515698432_b894d3a3e1_m.jpg\" width=\"143\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Beautiful 78 degree day!\"></a>\n\nTaken with <a href=\"http://picplz.com\">picplz</a> at <a href=\"http://picplz.com/pics/phoenix-mountain-preserve-phoenix-arizona/\">Phoenix Mountain Preserve</a> in <a href=\"http://picplz.com/city/phoenix-az/\">Phoenix, AZ</a>.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/firegroundcom/5515698432/","id":"3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.04592,33.568916]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5514585355","title":"MVC-002L","published":{"end_time":"2011/03/10 10:47:46 -0500","original":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 07:47:45 -0800","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/03/10 10:47:45 -0500"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/lotus07/\">lotus_07</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lotus07/5514585355/\" title=\"MVC-002L\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5100/5514585355_9bc0a90460_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"MVC-002L\"></a>\n\nSafety Is Our Business.

I was looking for the trailhead for the Maricopa Trail.  I didn't find it but I found the Desert Outdoor Center.  Reservations are required.  Looks like a very nice venue for a party. \n\"One of the most scenic water recreation areas in the “Valley of the Sun,” this northwest Valley park is a recreationist’s dream. The park offers many activities, such as camping, boating, fishing, swimming, hiking, picnicking, and wildlife viewing. At the Lake Pleasant Visitor Center, guests learn about the history of the area and desert wildlife. Step out onto the balcony surrounding the Visitor Center to get a beautiful view of Lake Pleasant and an up-close look at Waddell Dam. The breathtaking views offer visitors a great place to relax, whether it is from a boat or shoreline picnic site.  <a href=\"http://www.maricopa.gov/parks/lake_pleasant/\">www.maricopa.gov/parks/lake_pleasant/</a>\n\"The cornerstone of the park is the 10,000 acre (40 km² or 15.6 mi²), Lake Pleasant, one of the important artificial reservoirs surrounding the Phoenix metropolitan area. Created by the Waddell (Pleasant) Dam, which was finished in 1927, the lake originally had a surface area of 3,700 acres (15 km² or 5.8 mi²) and served as a private irrigation project. At 76 feet (23 m) high and 2,160 feet (658 m) long, the original Waddell Dam was, at its completion, the largest agricultural dam project in the world. The lake was filled by the Agua Fria River, capturing a large watershed throughout Yavapai County.\nConstruction of the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct, which began in 1973, soon diverted water from the Colorado River to the lake, converting the lake from an agricultural project into a storage reservoir for the project. Completed in 1994, the New Waddell Dam tripled the surface area of the lake, submerging the old dam beneath its waters. Shortly after the completion of the dam, the area experienced a prolonged drought, and while the lake grew considerably it would not reach full capacity until early 2005. Although still fed by the Agua Fria River, the CAP aqueduct is the primary source of water for the reservoir.\nLake Pleasant is used as a major water sports recreation center for the Phoenix metro area, as well as serving as an important storage reservoir for the rapidly growing region. A number of boat docks make the lake a popular destination for water skiing, jet skiing, sailing and other water sports, and the lake is stocked with a number of fish for angling purposes.\nThe park covers a total of over 23,000 acres (93 km²) of mountainous desert landscape, including the lake, and boasts a number of other recreational activities, such as mountain biking, camping, and hiking. The park also has an educational visitors' center that provides information regarding the history of the lake, the construction of the Waddell Dam and the surrounding areas.\nThe presence of the lake has also attracted other recreational activities in the area, such as a dirt racetrack and a large glider school/airport.\" source Wikipedia \nHistorical Trivia - This used to be called Frog Tanks. \nIMG_0585","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanenglish/5910741347/","id":"a655jqyp0izx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.249782,33.86156]}},{"properties":{"title":"Prior to Phoenix haboob","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5915009432","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/08 04:04:14 -0400","original":"Fri, 08 Jul 2011 01:04:13 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/08 04:04:13 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/njakov/\">NMilesic</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/njakov/5915009432/\" title=\"Prior to Phoenix haboob\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6011/5915009432_dc72798519_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" alt=\"Prior to Phoenix haboob\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/njakov/5915009432/","id":"a655jr468ath"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.075767,33.448261]}},{"properties":{"title":"Costa's Hummingbird On Cape Honeysuckle","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5913967191","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 23:42:49 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 20:42:48 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 23:42:48 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/63988075@N02/\">brentbristolsr</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63988075@N02/5913967191/\" title=\"Costa's Hummingbird On Cape Honeysuckle\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/5913967191_7ab46d3380_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Costa's Hummingbird On Cape Honeysuckle\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63988075@N02/5913967191/","id":"a655jr1jhl87"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.059661,33.294875]}},{"properties":{"title":"The Joker 2011 Phoenix Comicon","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912013898","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 07:03:59 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 04:03:58 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 07:03:58 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/grantbrummett/\">gbrummett</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grantbrummett/5912013898/\" title=\"The Joker 2011 Phoenix Comicon\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5319/5912013898_a3599b53b8_m.jpg\" width=\"166\" height=\"240\" alt=\"The Joker 2011 Phoenix Comicon\"></a>\n\nEvery Batman has to have a good enemy, I give you \"The Joker!\"\nThe Joker is the archenemy of Batman, having been directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Batman's life, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon and the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin.
