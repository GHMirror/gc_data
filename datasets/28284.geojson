Though he didn’t make it to Korea himself, he stayed in the military, becoming an officer and a fighter pilot. In 1966, he went to Vietnam as part of a squadron of specially modified two-seat F-105 “Wild Weasel” aircraft that had the job of finding and destroying surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites. On April 19, 1967, Colonel, then Major, Thorsness and his electronic warfare officer, Captain Harold E. Johnson, were on a missile suppression mission over North Vietnam. He and his wingman attacked and silenced a surface-to-air missile site with air-to-ground missiles and then destroyed a second site with bombs. In the attack on the second missile site, Colonel Thorsness’ wingman was shot down by intensive antiaircraft fire and the two crewmembers abandoned their aircraft. Colonel Thorsness circled the descending parachutes to keep the crewmembers in sight and relay their position to the Search and Rescue Center. During this maneuver, a MIG-17 was sighted in the area. Thorsness immediately initiated an attack and destroyed the MIG.\n\nBecause his aircraft was low on fuel, Colonel Thorsness was forced to depart the area in search of a tanker. Upon being advised that two helicopters were orbiting over the downed crew’s position and that there were hostile MIGs in the area posing a serious threat to the helicopters, despite his low fuel condition, Colonel Thorsness decided to return through a hostile environment of surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft defenses to the downed crew’s position. As he approached the area, he spotted four MIG-17 aircraft and immediately initiated an attack, damaging one and driving the others away from the rescue scene.\n\nWhen it became apparent that an aircraft in the area was critically low on fuel and the crew would have to abandon the aircraft unless they could reach a tanker, Thorsness, although critically short on fuel himself, helped avert further possible loss of life and a friendly aircraft by recovering at a forward operating base, thus allowing the aircraft in emergency fuel condition to refuel safely. Just as Thorsness landed, his fuel ran out and the engine shut down.\n\nTwo weeks later, he was shot down over North Vietnam on his ninety-third mission. He bailed out and was captured and wound up as a prisoner of war for a period of six years during which time he suffered torture on a regular basis. He was released in March, 1973 and was presented with his Medal of Honor on October 15, 1973. Ten days later, no longer able to fly fighters due to injuries sustained in captivity, he retired from the Air Force.\n\nDuring his career, Colonel Thorsness earned the Medal of Honor, the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross with five Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Purple Heart with one Oak Leaf Cluster. He currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.

Serrada restructures the complex concepts of De \r\nCuerdes into an organized teaching methodology.\r\nSerrada Escrima encompasses twelve angles from which any attack can \r\nbe classified.  The countering actions to these attack angles are based on \r\nmovements that utilize the short stick(22-24 inches).  After one year of \r\nconsistent training, a student can feel confident in possessing a \r\nfoundation that will protect him/herself in most self-defense situations.\r\n\r\nFrom day one, students are drilled in following up attacks and eliminating \r\ntheir opponents offensive tools.  In a sense, there are no strict forms of \r\nSerrada, only application drills.  From Serrada\\'s basic foundation, a \r\nstudent can quickly counter and overcome a multitude of weapons, open \r\nhand attacks, as well as kicking and grappling techniques.\r\n\r\nAdditionally taught are the arts of Tae Kwon Do and Hapkido.\r\nInstruction is available in these arts for children 6 years and older.  Adult \r\ninstruction is also available.\r\n\r\nTae Kwon Do and Hapkido are Korean arts of self defense with a rich \r\nhistory.  Both of these arts can be devastating all in of themselves.  \r\nHowever, when combined they will give anyone a tremendous edge in \r\ntournament competition, or in self defense situations.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640ojm352cg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.648537,38.766478]}},{"properties":{"name":"Detective-Commander Joseph Petrocelli","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/02/2/o_com.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Paterson, New Jersey, USADetective-Commander Joseph Petrocelli has spent over two decades in New Jersey law enforcement.

He developed a teaching system using concepts instead of techniques, to ensure a high level of retention among the students.\r\nTraining in the Filipino art of Escrima teaches a person to use everyday objects as a weapon or in more civil terms, “leveling the playing field”.   Escrima teaches the basic and logical concepts in using weapons (focus, speed/timing/distance, power, balance and transition),   These concepts are so logical and pure that a person can actually use them in living their everyday life.  For example, the most important concept is balance.  Balance is the foundation of Escrima as well as most tasks we perform throughout our lives.  Knowing how to obtain it, and when you get off balanced, how to get it back. Balance is a key that opens the other concepts necessary in the martial arts.  Balance is truly multi-dimensional.  Think of balance in terms of learning how to ride a bike.  There is more then just getting on, peddling and keeping the bike upright.  The bike has two wheels, and the main objective is to keep it going forward by balancing the front wheels against the stationary back wheels while moving forward.   If there is too much weight to the left or to the right, the bike will tip over.  The rider must be able to balance their focus to make sure they don’t ride into a ditch or a tree, and also looking ahead at the cars on the road, people walking, plus being aware of what is coming up from behind.  So far that seems pretty easy but now there is an issue of speed and controlling speed so that the fast approaching tree won’t be the collision point.  And what about those traffic lights?  Eventually there has to be a time to stop.  This is the braking point, which also has to be balanced.  When there is sudden braking applied to the front of the bike, there is a chance the rear of the bike could easily become the front of the bike, or even flip over.  If there is too much brake in the rear and not any pressure on the front, this may not be enough to stop.   All these tasks have to be balanced or it becomes unsafe to ride a bike for both rider and everyone else who occupies the road.   If you look closely to this objective of riding a bike, the Escrima concepts are exactly the same.  There is the balance which becomes the foundation of the system.  Speed (timing, distance) is the element of execution as to when you can hit your attacker.  Power is driven by the foundation of balance, dictated by the distance and the speed of the attack or offense movement.  Your focus is expanded to look at the person as a whole rather then just focusing on the on coming attack.  In other words if you look too much at one hand, you may never see the other hand.   Transition is the ability to use a comb, brush or keys without radically changing any physical movements you already know.   The objective is to neutralize the situation, not focus upon whether the attacker throws a right hands or a left hand, the main objective is to nullify the attacker. \r\n\r\nEscrima makes use of concepts as the main catalyst of learning and increasing the rate of information retention.  In Escrima, techniques are used as a device to practice concepts.  Techniques teach a person how to apply the concepts in a practice setting.  Concepts are applied as needed, in various circumstances and this provides more flexibility and adaptation in the execution.  This is Latosa Escrima.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640ojpq4rfj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.816008,38.528813]}},{"properties":{"name":"Laurence Gonzales","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/3/laurence_gonzales.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> USALaurence Gonzales won the 2001 and 2002 National Magazine Awards from the American Society of Magazine Editors for National Geographic Adventure Magazine.

Our goal is is to assist you achieve personal safety.  The information we provide is tailored for your needs in the modern world. You will find a wide spectrum of crime prevention  information, including  home security, property protection, robbery prevention and self-defense. \r\n\r\nAn overwhelming majority of our recommendations are  non-violent and should have no negative impact on your lifestyle. While the ability to defend yourself is important, we believe that common sense preventative actions are a far more reliable way to ensure your personal safety and the safety of your family. You don\\'t have to pay money, learn a martial art, buy a gun or become paranoid in order to be safe. All you need are to know the details of the  problems  and then use a little common sense. After that, it\\'s easy. When it comes to crime and violence, the old saying \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" is not only true, but a potential life saver. The hardest part is doing your homework before you find yourself in a situation -- and that is what you are doing now. \r\n\r\nHaving said this, however, if you are currently in a dangerous, or  potentially dangerous, situation then obviously the necessary steps will require more effort on your part.  If you are in a \"hot\" situation, the required actions will be more intense; you are aren\\'t trying to prevent a problem, you already have one!\r\n\r\nIn this case, what you are going for is damage control. Making this \"mental shift\" is critical for your success. Things are not going to go back to \\'normal,\\' nor will the problem \"just go away\" as so many people hope it will -- and are at a loss when it doesn\\'t. Even in these extreme circumstances, the most effective steps to ensure your personal safety are not necessarily confrontational. They are measures to indemnify yourself, deter him, and failing that, to hinder him, give yourself early warning and call in help.\r\n\r\nThis is a large site with lots of information.

However, it was not until after he left the service that the flicker of interest that was kindled there became his consuming fire. \nOrlando began serious study in Chinese kenpo-karate in October, 1968.  Shortly thereafter he switched to kung fu, studying under Al Dacascos (then teaching in Denver, Colorado).  His training with Dacascos lasted three years until a back operation made it impossible to continue in Dacascos\\' high-kicking style of kung fu.  It was back to Chinese kenpo.  There Bob received his first-degree black belt from Dr. John P. Cochran.  Although Bob has subsequently earned additional rank, he prefers to say that he is a student of the arts and leave it at that .Ever a student of the arts, Bob\\'s quest for knowledge has taken him into aikido, Small-Circle Jujitsu, grappling, iaido, arnis de mano, and eskrima.  However, what has impacted him the most are the years he has spent studying Chinese kuntao and Dutch-Indonesian pukulan pentjak silat under Dutch-Indonesian master Willem de Thouars.  After a decade of training with de Thouars, Bob received his teaching certificate from him in 1994. \nA graduate of a Jesuit university, Bob is the author of Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals: The Brutal Arts of the Archipelago and Martial Arts America: A Western Approach to Eastern Arts.  He has also produced three videos:  A nearly two hour production, Fighting Arts of Indonesia: Combat Secrets of Silat and Kuntao (a companion to his first book); a two-tape video production titled, Reflex Action: From Training Drills to Fighting Skills;  and a four volume DVD series, Fighting Footwork of Kuntao and Silat.

He was told by industry \"experts\" not to bother with the original Benji film; that it wouldn\\'t work. He proved the experts wrong and now he\\'s at it again with his new best selling book The Soul of a Horse being published by the Crown/Harmony imprint of Random House on April 29, 2008. A book that will likely set traditional thinking about horses on its ear.\n\nJoe Camp showed us the heart and soul of a dog when he created Benji. Now, in this engaging, emotional, and often humorous story, he deftly lures us into the heart and soul of a horse, unlocking the mystery of a majestic creature who has survived on earth, without assistance, for fifty-five million years.\n\nMonty Roberts, author of the New York Times Bestseller The Man Who Listens to Horses , and world renowned clinician, said, \"Imagine how inadequate it makes me feel to realize how recently Joe came into horses. The man is a natural when it comes to understanding how animals tick and a genius at telling us their story. The Soul of a Horse is a must read for those who love animals of any species.\"\n\nCamp has written, produced and directed seven theatrical motion pictures (including all of the Benji movies) cumulatively grossing well over the equivalent of 00 million in today\\'s dollars, making him one of the most successful independent filmmakers of all time.\n\nJoe has also written three novels from his own screenplays, the inspirational non-fiction book Benji &amp; Me , and several children\\'s books.\n\nCamp ignored industry \"experts\" who said the original Benji movie would never work. He raised the money from private sources to produce the film, but when completed the movie was turned down by every major film distributor in Hollywood. Camp and his partner Ed Vanston had to form their own distribution company and release the picture themselves worldwide from their offices in Dallas, with Camp personally developing the marketing strategy, writing advertising copy and press releases, and supervising each and every booking. In spite of the many obstacles, Variety reported the picture was the #3 grossing movie of the year.\n\nIn advance of release of the 2004 film Benji Off the Leash , Camp and his floppy-eared star traveled the nation for months, appearing on television, radio, in newspapers and magazines, promoting the film while passionately making a case for Hollywood to \"clean up\" their family films, and extolling the values of adopting pets from shelters. \"This time around,\" Camp says, \"it\\'s all about proving that you can put food on the table and, at the same time, make a positive difference in peoples\\' lives. It\\'s about living life with purpose, on purpose.\"\n\nWhen Camp struck out across the country in the Fall of 2001 to find the new Benji in an animal shelter, media flocked to follow him around. The American Humane Association had reported that the original Benji\\'s rescue from a shelter had caused more than one million adoptions. Camp wanted to recreate that model. Local and network television, radio and newspapers covered the search, with the ultimate selection being a feature on ABC\\'s Primetime Thursday . The search and Benji\\'s new movie generated more than one billion media exposures for the efforts of shelters and rescue groups all across the nation.\n\nIn addition to his books and movies, Camp has also written, directed and produced four network television specials and a network series.\n\nOne of Joe\\'s favorite pastimes is working with the Piney Woods School in Mississippi. This historically black boarding school educates mostly high-risk kids from families below the poverty level, yet usually sends 100% of its graduates to college, many to some of the best colleges and universities in the country. \"Of all we\\'ve done,\" says Camp, \"we\\'re most proud of the things we\\'ve accomplished for these kids. And the rewards are the greatest.\"\n\nEven with all the accomplishments and media exposure, Camp is still in awe of his own success. \"Inside, I\\'m still a kid sitting in a dark theater in Little Rock, Arkansas, watching Disney\\'s \\'Song of the South\\' with happy tears rolling down my cheeks,\" he says, \"or reading books like the Black Stallion. To be able to bring that magical happiness to others is very special.\"\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640ojhv2cx1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.012886,33.205222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mr. John Giduck","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/02/2/John_Beslan_photo%5B1%5D_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_green_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_orange_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_blue_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Golden, CO, USA  80402John Giduck has a Bachelor’s Degree from Penn State and a law degree from the University of Denver.

Previously I taught at the University of San Francisco, my first academic appointment after I received my PhD from the University of Chicago. While at Notre Dame I founded the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism in 1975 and was the director of the Center until 1993. To learn more about me and what I have done over the years, you can consult my vita.\n\nAs a member of the Department of History, I taught both undergraduate and graduate students. Though I taught courses in a variety of areas, my field of specialty was American Catholic history. I have published a number of books in this field. My most recent book was In Search of an American Catholicism: A History of Religion and Culture in Tension, published by Oxford University Press in 2002. It is an interpretive study of the relationship between Catholicism and American culture over the course of the past two hundred years. I have also written a general history entitled The American Catholic Experience: A History from Colonial Times to the Present. Published in 1985 it is regarded as the standard history of American Catholicism. Originally published by Doubleday, it is presently available in paperback from the University of Notre Dame Press. Both of these books as well as others can also be purchased through Amazon.com.\n\nI am currently a professor emeritus. Though no longer teaching I am still writing. My most recent publication was an essay on Catholicism in the Midwest, entitled “A Different Breed of Catholics.” It was published in a volume on Religion and Public Life in the Midwest, (eds.) Philip Barlow and Mark Silk. At Notre Dame I taught a course on the Irish American experience for more than fifteen years. Using this as a basis I am writing a history of Irish America. This should be completed in 2007 and will appear in print with Bloomsbury Press sometime in 2008 or 2009. Be sure to check it out, it promises to be the definitive history of the Irish Americans. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a640ojl0vnoh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.239586,41.701884]}},{"properties":{"name":"Patricia (Trish) Broersma","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\" href=\"http://psychjourney_blogs.typepad.com/warrior_traditions/\">Kevinkeough</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/02/1/book_trish_horse.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Ashland, OR 97520A certified therapeutic riding instructor, Patricia (Trish) Broersma founded and directed the Saddle Light Center, a nonprofit therapeutic riding program in San Antonio, Texas.
