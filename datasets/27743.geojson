The UK now spends nearly £40bn a year on ethical products. We are told that the tea, coffee, chocolate, clothes or Christmas presents we buy will shape the fate of the poor in the developing world. Closer to home, farmer’s markets, organic foods and reusable bags denote responsible shopping, concern for producers and the planet. The internet is awash with shopping sites for eco-chic and ethical goods and services. Every supermarket parades the provenance of its goods, TV shows reveal the hardships of workers in garment factories in the developing world, and commentators recommend we buy fewer cheap clothes and darn our socks to reduce waste. The recession has brought with it a plethora of advisors, keen to tell us how to shop, save, cook, eat, and live frugally and responsibly. We may save a few pence or spend a few more but can we effect serious change through our shopping trolleys? Are ethical gifts of goats or hoes for the poor really effective, or symptomatic of low horizons and moral posturing? Should we be counting the air miles on goods we buy or celebrating the great diversity of global goods now within our reach? Is ethical consumption a principled step forward, a retreat from politics, or just better than nothing? Are we all ethical shoppers now?

How can we come together to make changes that really do have a positive effect – both in our local community and in the global community that we are all a part of? Many organisations have similar aims and objectives, how can we get these groups to work together to bring about real change? These are some of the questions that Morlan hopes to answer in this evening of discussion. Morlan has invited various groups who are working to satisfy the different \"hungers\" that exist - both on a local and national level - to see if there are ways in which they can work together to make a real difference and bring about change. The various organisations will also have stalls present and Fairtrade drinks and snacks will be on sale.\n\nAdmission Details: Free entry<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kzfwaby0f0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.08165693283,52.4174716191]}},{"properties":{"name":"19.11.09 - Counting down to Copenhagen, Bath","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.webber-design.com\" href=\"http://www.webber-design.com\">Rhys</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Counting down to Copenhagen : achieving justice for poor people at the UN climate change negotiations\n\nThe Event is a Green Light Lecture to be held on Thursday 22 October 2009 at Bath Royal Literary &amp; Scientific Institution, Queens Square, Bath 7.30pm start\n\nGiven by Eliot Whittington: Senior Adviser, Climate Justice Initiative for Christian Aid<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6kzfw5u1w7f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.36348748207,51.3832318922]}},{"properties":{"name":"19.11.09 - Earthwatch Debate - From Tsunami to Drought, Kensington","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.webber-design.com\" href=\"http://www.webber-design.com\">Rhys</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/08/1/earth_logo_3_.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Event Location: The Royal Geographical Society, 1 Kensington Gore, London SW7 2AR\n\nContact Name: Simon Laman\n\nContact Email: events@earthwatch.org.uk\n\nContact Telephone: (01865) 318856\n\nChaired by award winning broadcaster Andrea Catherwood.

The relatively high growth Africa has enjoyed in recent years is slowing as demand for the continent’s resources wanes, and foreign direct investment barely trickles in. There is a danger that the downturn will kill off the possibility of economic growth and leave Africa dependent on aid, just as NGOs and aid agencies fear donors will put aid on the back burner as the recession hits their own bank balances. But while some worry that the era of aid for international development is over, critics argue that it doesn’t help anyway, and that in order to spur development, Africans should just say no to aid and build up their own economies. Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo, for example, argues that Western aid simply perpetuates poverty in Africa, and calls instead for trade with China, accessing capital markets, and microfinance. Critics say aid breeds corruption, fosters dependency and stifles growth. Meanwhile some aid agencies reject the idea that economic growth is the only means to develop. Others make aid conditional on ‘good governance’. With aid budgets under threat, with aid agencies be still more beholden to Western government agendas? Should we call for more aid, or kiss it goodbye and look to investment instead, even in the context of global recession? Should we be less concerned about the form the cash takes and where it’s from as long as it’s there? What kind of external assistance might help or hinder development?

Far from putting people first we’ve seen nothing but a tinkering around the margins followed by the return to business as usual.\n\nOn Nov 7, as the G20 returns to the UK, the agenda on the table nurses an already failed economic model back to life, whilst looking to stitch up an unjust international climate deal outside the UN process.\n\nThey bailed out the banks to the tune of billions, and now the only choice offered is between what cuts are made to pay for it.\n\nGovernment intervention to create a Green New Deal is slipping off the agenda, and yet strong alliances are forming - for example environmentalists and trade unionists have been standing side by side at Vestas to save the UK’s largest wind turbine factory.\n\n- In the run up to Copenhagen, how do we get a global agreement on climate that truly puts climate justice at its heart?\n\n- How do we respond to the jobs crisis and growing poverty around the world\n\n- How do we ensure the global green new deal the world needs?\n\n- How we do we show that cuts are not the only option, and demonstrate what Putting People First really look like?\n\nThis counter-conference will bring together academics, activists, campaigners, unions, policy makers and YOU to share ideas on what the alternatives are to cuts, cuts and more cuts, and how we must organise across our issues, of jobs, justice and climate, to make the alternative the reality.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nTony Juniper, Princes Rainforests Projects\n\n- Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, former Danish prime minister and president of the Party of European Socialists\n\n- Jon Cruddas MP\n\n- Deborah Doane, director of World Development Movement\n\n- Billy Hayes, general secretary of CWU\n\n- Caroline Lucas MEP, leader of the Green Party\n\n- Diane Elson, University of Essex\n\n- Jesse Griffiths, Bretton Woods Project\n\n- Noel Hatch, Compass Youth\n\n- John Hilary, War on Want\n\n- Catherine Howarth, FairPensions\n\n- Neal Lawson, Compass\n\n- Larry Lohman, The Corner House\n\n- Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Friends of the Earth\n\n- Andrew Simms, new economics foundation\n\n- Glen Tarman, Bond\n\n- Hilary Wainwright, Red Pepper\nRegister now\n\nPlace are limited so registration is advised.
