The autism rooms are based on the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis. We believe it is the best evidence based practice for children on the spectrum. With the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, the children's behaviors are observed and interventions are put in place; the ABLLS is used to assess language and give a basis to build programs as well as IEP goals, and the basics of communication are worked on throughout the day. Beyond these skills, with the help of teachers and aides, the children focus on academics as well as social skills through structured play.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"lattitude":{"max":38.975037,"variance":0.00131965320920261,"mean":38.9088625555556,"stdev":0.0363270313843922,"min":38.826143,"median":38.91399},"longitude":{"max":-76.920363,"variance":0.00184706133260451,"mean":-76.9973936111111,"stdev":0.0429774514438037,"min":-77.072592,"median":-76.997112}},"features":[{"properties":{"lattitude":38.948371,"geo_score":0.831,"name
