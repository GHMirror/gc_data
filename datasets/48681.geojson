There are two playgrounds within five minutes along with several tennis courts.  Check it out at night, as well.  It\\'s a five minute drive from Tank Hill.

It\\'s one of the most amazing things about San Francisco.  Right in the middle of a big city is a park with unbelievable physical beauty.  Crissy Field used to be the airfield associated with The Presidio.  Lot\\'s of history and other cool things to do that are nearby.  There\\'s a cool evening picture of Crissy Field by David Sanger, along with some other photos I found on Flickr or the web.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64w4ukri5ha"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.450438,37.806003]}},{"properties":{"name":"Golden Gate Park","description":"Posted by Bkingbking<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/61512563@N00/121046759/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/121046759_459fd772ca_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/118_1841_IMG.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 9th Avenue at Lincoln Way San Francisco, CA 94122Golden Gate Park is enormous with everything from botanical gardens, playground, paddle boats (Stow Lake) polo grounds, lawn bowling, croquet, windmills, buffalo, fly fishing practice areas, exotic flower conservatory, tennis, model boat clubs (including submarines and speedboats that go 50mph!), Japanese tea garden, golf, outdoor theatre, concerts, and walking distance to the 9th &amp; Irving, Cole Valley and Haight neighborhoods where you can grab a coffee, burrito, or sit down to eat.  I generally recommend people to start their tour of Golden Gate Park in the Botanical Gardens.  It\\'s a good reference point to begin your exploration.  Several main roads in the park are closed on Sundays -- which is great for walkers, bikers, bladers, strollers, etc to have more room -- so parking may be more difficult.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64w4uq5m00o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.466482,37.76573]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mama's on Washington Square","description":"Posted by Bkingbking<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1701 Stockton St, San Francisco, CABest breakfast in San Francisco.

It\\'s a five minute hike but the views of downtown San Francisco, Golden Gate Bridge, and looking up the Pacific coastline are great.  It\\'s called Tank Hill because there used to be a water tank there in the 1880\\'s or so.  If you are limited on time but want to get outside and get some great views, then this is a great spot.  Check it out at night, as well.
