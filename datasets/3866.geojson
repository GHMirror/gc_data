In 1997 Vermont's\n      Regional Planning Commisions digitized the locations of\n      the schools in their region using orthophotos, existing GIS\n      data, and road maps.  Maps of school locations were sent\n      to each School Supervisory Union for verification of school\n      location and name.  The point covers created by the\n      RPCs were appended to one cover by VCGI.  In 2003 the data layer\n      was revised by VCGI using an updated list of schools from the\n      VT Department of Education. In 2004 VT Department of Education updated and validated\n      the locations of the schools.\nPlease search for Vermont-GIS for more   local level GIS datasets.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"area":{"max":0.0,"mean":0.0,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":0.0,"median":0.0},"FIPS6":{"max":27120.0,"mean":15001.3832020997,"variance":75249846.263296,"stdev":8674.66692520791,"min":1005.0,"median":17020.0},"len":{"max":0.0,"mean":0.0,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":0.0,"median":0.0}},"features":[{"properties":{"TAXTOWN":"ESSEX","PSID":"PS009","ZIP":"05452","SCHLNAME":"ALBERT D.
