By the time the dockyard closed in 1984, they had created a museum of dockyard and naval artefacts in the old Lead and Print Mill. In the spring of 2001, the Society's historical collection was amalgamated with the Historic Dockyard Trust's own collection to form the new larger Museum of The Royal Dockyard in the Fitted Rigging House, on Anchor Wharf. The Society is very active, staffing the museum, meeting the public and dealing with many and varied questions. The Society's reference library is thought to be one of the finest sources of nautical history in the south-east.Web link: <a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisureandculture/museums/museumoftheroyaldockyard.aspx\">http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisureandculture/museums/museumoftheroyaldockyard.aspx</a>Telephone 01634 832028","id":"a693swz697yy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.525187792214314,51.3923589140798]}},{"properties":{"title":"Kent Police Museum","description":"Kent Police Museum, Old Posthouse, Church Lane, Historic Dockyard, Chatham, Kent, ME4 4TEInformation: The Police Museum was started as a collection of Police memorabilia in the 1960's by officers who felt there was a need to show the history of Kent Police...
