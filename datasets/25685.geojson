We are in process of renovating a gorgeous 1920 building into an Art Lounge here in St. Petersburg and our plan is to create a single \\'bathroom\\' where every stall has a toilet which is enclosed in it\\'s own small room. Complete privacy for everyone.  Then everyone shares the 4 sinks and primping\" area.  This will be a classy modern art gallery mashed together with a swanky lounge. I\\'ve seen this type of bath setup all over Europe and am going to use it here.  But the city is giving me a headache about it.  Can you please offer any advice or comments to help us along?  Much thanks and good luck to us all!
