Many of the books challenged had LGBTQ themes. On\nMay 18, 2009, the West Bend Common Council voted not to reappoint four members\nof the Library Board because of their views and adherence to library policy.\nNCAC, ABFFE, the Association of American Publishers, and PEN American Center\njoined to urge the council to reconsider their decision and retain the books.\nThe ALA issued a separate letter and statement on the\nissue. Additionally, the Christian Civil Liberties Union filed a legal claim\narguing that its plaintiffs suffered mental and emotional damage from the\npresence of the books in the library's young adult section. On June 2, the West\nBend Library Board voted unanimously to retain the books in its YA Zone,\nwithout removing, relocating, labeling, or otherwise restricting access. Though\nno subsequent challenges were submitted, the library has faced ongoing pressure\nto remove or restrict access to online content and library materials for young\npeople.
