In some areas, faulting has\n    exposed millions of years of geologic history.The extraordinary features of the park, including balanced rocks,\n    fins and pinnacles, are highlighted by a striking environment of contrasting colors, landforms and textures. Rocks\n    have attracted visitors to Arches National Park for thousands of years. However, sightseeing has not been the main\n    activity for very long. Hunter-gatherers migrated into the area about 10,000 years ago at the end of the Ice Age.\n    As they explored Courthouse Wash and other areas in what is now Arches, they found pockets of rock perfect for\n    making stone tools. The forces of nature have acted in concert to create the landscape of Arches, which contains\n    the greatest density of natural arches in the world. Throughout the park, rock layers reveal millions of years of\n    deposition, erosion and other geologic events. These layers continue to shape life in Arches today, as their\n    erosion influences elemental features like soil chemistry and where water flows when it rains.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62yea8sn4pi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.527087,38.567674]}},{"properties":{"name":"Arkansas Post National Memorial","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> In 1686, Henri de Tonti established a trading post known as \"Poste de Arkansea\" at the Quapaw village\n    of Osotouy.

For more than 30 years Fort Bowie and Apache Pass were the focal point of\n    military operations eventually culminating in the surrender of Geronimo in 1886 and the banishment of the\n    Chiricahuas to Florida and Alabama. It was the site of the Bascom Affair, a wagon train massacre, and the battle of\n    Apache Pass, where a large force of Chiricahua Apaches under Mangus Colorados and Cochise fought the California\n    Volunteers. The remains of Fort Bowie today are carefully preserved, the adobe walls of various post buildings and\n    the ruins of a Butterfield Stage Station.

Born on August\n    10, 1874, Hoover was the son of a Quaker blacksmith, orphaned at an early age, and achieved international success\n    as a mining engineer and world-wide gratitude as \"The Great Humanitarian\" who fed a billion people in 57 countries\n    during and after World War I. Within a few short months after being elected 31st President of the United States, in\n    a 1928 landslide, the global hero had become a scapegoat in his own land. Even today, Hoover remains indelibly\n    linked with the Great Depression that put millions of his countrymen out of work in the 1930\\'s. Hoover\\'s once\n    bright reputation was put in shambles, yet he refused to fade away. By the time of his death in October, 1964,\n    Hoover had regained much of the luster once attached to his name. The Quaker theologian who eulogized him at his\n    funeral did not exaggerate when he said of Herbert Hoover, \"The story is a good one and a great one...It is\n    essentially triumphant.\" Herbert Hoover National Historic Site was established to commemorate the life of this\n    uncommon person. The Historic Site contains the cottage where Hoover was born, a blacksmith shop similar to the one\n    owned by his father, West Branch\\'s first one room schoolhouse, the Friends Meetinghouse where the Hoover Family\n    worshipped, and several homes of the era.

Visible remnants\n    of Hopewell culture are concentrated in the Scioto River valley near present-day Chillicothe, Ohio. The most\n    striking Hopewell sites contain earthworks in the form of squares, circles, and other geometric shapes. Many of\n    these sites were built to a monumental scale, with earthen walls up to 12 feet high outlining geometric figures\n    more than 1000 feet across. Conical and loaf-shaped earthen mounds up to 30 feet high are often found in\n    association with the geometric earthworks.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62yeafgy2sx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.007325,39.374296]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site is one of the finest examples of a rural American 19th century\n    iron plantation.

To seal off the bend\n    of the river, the Upper Creeks built an incredibly strong 400 yard long barricade made of dirt and logs. As the\n    Cherokee and Lower Creek warriors swam the Tallapoosa and attacked from the rear, Jackson launched the militia and\n    regular soldiers against the barricade. Facing overwhelming odds, the Red Sticks fought bravely yet ultimately lost\n    the battle. Over 800 Upper Creeks died at Horseshoe Bend defending their homeland. This was the final battle of the\n    Creek War of 1813-14, which is considered part of the War of 1812. In a peace treaty signed after the battle, both\n    the Upper and Lower Creeks were forced to give the United States nearly 20 million acres of land in what is today\n    Alabama and Georgia.

This makes it the oldest area currently in the National Park System--40\n    years older than Yellowstone National Park. People have used the hot spring water in therapeutic baths for more\n    than two hundred years to treat rheumatism and other ailments. The reservation eventually developed into a\n    well-known resort nicknamed \"The American Spa\" because it attracted not only the wealthy but also indigent health\n    seekers from around the world. Today the park protects eight historic bathhouses with the former luxurious Fordyce\n    Bathhouse housing the park visitor center. The entire \"Bathhouse Row\" area is a National Historic Landmark District\n    that contains the grandest collection of bathhouses of its kind in North America.

While living in Martinez, Muir accomplished many things: he battled to prevent Yosemite National Park\\'s Hetch\n    Hetchy Valley from being dammed, served as the first president and one of the founders of the Sierra Club, played a\n    prominent role in the creation of several national parks, and hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles and\n    several books expounding on the virtues of conservation and the natural world. Muir\\'s work laid the foundations for\n    the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. The Muir house and historic Martinez adobe became part of the\n    National Park Service in 1964.

At stake were some of the founding principles of the United States as the growing nation divided over the\n    existence and expansion of slavery. Only after the new Confederacy fired on a federal fort in Charleston harbor and\n    Lincoln had called for troops to preserve the Union, did Virginia join the Confederacy.

For it was here in 1859 that the United States and Great Britain nearly\n    went to war over a pig shot by an American farmer. Actually, it was a bit more complicated than that. Pressures had\n    been building between the two nations over possession of the San Juan Island group since 1846 when the Treaty of\n    Oregon left ownership unclear. Thus came the \"Pig War\" crisis, at the height of which more than 500 U.S. Army\n    soldiers and three British warships were nose to nose on the island\\'s southern shore, not 10 miles from Victoria,\n    BC. Fortunately, officials on both sides quickly restored calm and the nations agreed to a joint military\n    occupation of the island until the boundary could be decided. The American soldiers and British Royal Marines\n    remained for 12 years until Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, as arbitrator, awarded the islands to the United States.\n    Today the park is an excellent place to hike, picnic, play on the beach, experience wildlife and enjoy a wealth of\n    programming, including the summer living history events.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62yeaianglk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.094717,48.545416]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Juan National Historic Site","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> San Juan National Historic Site includes forts San Cristóbal, San Felipe del Morro, and San Juan de la\n    Cruz also called El Cañuelo, plus bastions, powder houses, and three fourths of the city wall.

The final push to achieve a nationwide solution to the disenfranchisement of\n    African Americans came as the result of three strategically planned marches, the first of which took place on March\n    7. Nearly 500 marchers proceeded through the streets of Selma and across the Edmund Pettus Bridge where they were\n    faced by scores of Alabama State troopers. The troopers attacked the non-violent marchers, leaving many of them\n    bloodied and severely injured, on a date forever ensconced in history as \" Bloody Sunday\". A second march ended in\n    a prayer session at the point of Sunday\\'s confrontation. When an injunction circumventing the march to the Alabama\n    State Capitol was reversed, a plan was devised to conduct the monumental trek on Sunday, March 21, 1965. Thousands\n    of people, representing many races and nationalities, moved before the eyes of the world in demonstration to\n    guarantee the right to vote. The five-day/four-night event covered a 54-mile route along state Highway 80 through\n    chilling weather and rain. The result was the personal triumph of those who participated in the historic trek and\n    the signing of the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965. Today, the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail\n    stands as a testament to the sacrifices made in the triumph to preserve the \"right to vote\" as the bedrock of\n    American democracy.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62yeacoe776"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.708374,32.428931]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> LAND OF GIANTS<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62yeacj41uu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.78469,36.54266]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sewall-Belmont House National Historic Site","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> , Washington, DCThe Sewall-Belmont House was built by Robert Sewall in 1799-1800 and was named for him and for Alva\n    Belmont, whose financial contribution enabled the National Woman\\'s Party to purchase the house.

Appointed commander of the\n    Continental Army in 1775, he molded a fighting force that won independence from Great Britain. In 1787 as President\n    of the Constitutional Convention, he helped guide the deliberations to form a government that has lasted for more\n    than 200 years. Two years later he was unanimously elected the first President of the United States. Washington\n    defined the Presidency and helped develop the relationships among the three branches of government. He established\n    precedents that successfully launched the new government on its course. Washington remained ever mindful of the\n    ramifications of his decisions and actions, for he was a consummate statesman.
