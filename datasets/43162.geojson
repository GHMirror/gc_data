Views of the Pacific Ocean can be seen along the entire trail.\r\n\r\nYou start on the dirt path on the south side of the park. The first quarter mile is flat and offers great views inland of Saddleback Mountain and Aliso Viejo.\r\n\r\nPicnic tables can be found about every 100 feet - ideal spots for lunch or even a quiet place to read.\r\n\r\nPlaques along the trail also identify the local vegetation. Look for summer holly and laurel sumac along the way.\r\n\r\nThe trail seems to end at a concrete platform. A dirt trail to the left of the platform continues toward Aliso Peak. The trail drops down a steep hill with loose rocks and dirt along this ridge. Watch your step.\r\n\r\nAfter you scoot alongside a residential road and farther down the hill, you suddenly begin a short and steep climb toward Aliso Peak, which stands a not-so-towering 600 feet.\r\n\r\nThe final 20 feet to the peak is extremely steep. Hikers without hiking shoes can use the wooden steps on the right side of the trail.\r\n\r\nViews of South Laguna to the south and Aliso Beach and the Aliso Creek Golf Course to the immediate north are unadulterated, unlike the views from other coastal bluffs that are spoiled by cell-phone towers and power lines. A bench at the peak is a perfect place to sit and soak in the views of the ocean, or cuddle up for a special moment with your hiking partner.\r\n\r\nTime for the hard part - hiking back up 800 feet to your car.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6yek3xuec3y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.73344,33.51152]}},{"properties":{"name":"Anchor Brewery","description":"Posted by Garlynn<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/promo_bock2006.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1705 Mariposa St, San Francisco, CAMakers of Anchor Steam Beer, Anchor Liberty Ale, Anchor Porter, Anchor Bock and others.

The food was decadent and scrumptious.\n\nWe did hor d\\'oeuvres in a tapas fashion...we tried the \"Tuna Tartare on Olive Toasts\". I love the fresh fish in San Francisco. Heaven.\n\nWe also tried: \"Kampachi Crudo with Blood Orange, Fennel, Daikon Sprouts and Fiordolio Olive Oil.\"\n\nI first heard about crudo in a Vogue article by Jeffrey Steingarten. He\\'s a brilliant gourmand and he has such an evocative writing style...I also read about this Italian-style of doing raw fish in the NY Times...I think. This SF Gate article has a great way of explaining crudo: \"...crudo is shorthand for any kind of raw fish -- chopped tartares, marinated ceviches, sliced sashimis, paper-thin carpaccios. The stumpy word itself conveys little about the silky, sensual feel of eating a raw scallop glistening with olive oil and shivering under sheer fennel slices and bits of orange...\". And in this NY Post article...a chef has another way of explaining crudo: \"Crudo is basically Italian sashimi with good ingredients. Instead of wasabi, we use garlic, and instead of ginger, we use tomato.\"\n\nNow, Susan said she had really good crudo at Incanto - possibly better than Bix...As for myself, this first taste of crudo was delightful. Again, fresh fish - slice thin and marinated lightly. It melted in my mouth and left my palate swooning. I especially liked how it finished off with the blood orange - a clean citrus tang...\n\nWe also did some sliders in a gourmet fashion - \"Mini Lamb Burgers with Spicy Red Pepper Sauce\".

In 1881, Adolph Sutro bought most of the western headlands of San Francisco and made his home there. Fifteen years later, Sutro Baths opened to a dazzled public at an estimated cost of over ,000,000. Spread over three acres, the Baths boasted impressive engineering and artistic detail. \r\n\r\nSwimming\r\n\r\nA classic Greek portal opened to a massive glass enclosure containing seven swimming pools of various temperatures. There were slides, trapezes, springboards and a high dive. Together the pools held 1.7 million gallons of water and could be filled in one hour by high tides. There were 20,000 bathing suits and 40,000 towels for rent. Balmy temperatures and abundant plants enhanced \"California’s Tropical Winter Garden.\" The Baths could accommodate 10,000 people at one time. \r\n\r\nEntertainment\r\n\r\nSutro’s dream was realized as San Franciscans streamed to the Baths on one of three railroads connected to the city. An amphitheater, seating up to 3,700 people, provided a variety of stage shows. Three restaurants could accommodate 1,000 people at a sitting. There were natural history exhibits, galleries of sculptures, paintings, tapestries and artifacts from Mexico, China, Asia, and the Middle East. \r\n\r\nThe Last Years\r\n\r\nFor all their glamour and excitement, the success of Sutro Baths was short lived. The Baths were not commercially successful and Sutro\\'s grandson converted part of the Baths into a skating rink in 1937, a task completed in the early 1950\\'s by new owner George Whitney. Sutro Baths never regained its popularity and the ice-skating revenue was not enough to maintain the enormous building. In 1964, developers who planned to replace the Baths with high-rise apartments bought the site. A fire in 1966 quickly finished the demolition work, but the apartment scheme was never realized. \r\n\r\nToday\r\n\r\nThe Baths became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1973. This area is popular today for the scenic and recreational values recognized by Adolph Sutro. Please use caution as you explore the remains of Sutro Baths and coastal rocks and try to imagine the elegance of life here over 100 years ago. \r\n\r\nFor more information call (415) 239-2366.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6yek3mglgw7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.513834,37.780425]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Edinburgh Castle - Scottish Pub","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Deep dark scottish pub with all the trimmings and sometimes punk shows in the upstairs.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6yek3orskqc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.418916,37.786148]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Wave Organ","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/waveorgan.jpg\">Yacht Road, San Francisco Ca.The Wave Organ \r\n\r\nBy Peter Richards\r\nExploratorium Artist in Residence, 1986\r\n\r\nThe Wave Organ is a wave-activated acoustic sculpture located on a jetty in the San Francisco Bay. The concept was developed by Peter Richards and was installed in collaboration with sculptor and master stone mason George Gonzales. Inspiration for the piece came from artist Bill Fontana\\'s recordings made of sounds emanating from a vent pipe of a floating concrete dock in Sydney, Australia. \r\nIn 1980, Richards (now a Senior Artist at the Exploratorium) received a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which enabled him to conduct an extensive period of investigation into the physicality of the Wave Organ phenomenon. The sculpture\\'s speaker horn and audio equipment were either built or acquired for use in some of the experiments of this period. \r\nA prototype, built at the same location, was presented as part of the New Music \\'81 Festival. Though very rudimentary in nature, it generated enthusiasm and support for a permanent work. Permit acquisition and fundraising efforts by Frank Oppenheimer, founding director of the Exploratorium, began soon after, but actual construction did not start until September of 1985, seven months after Oppenheimer\\'s death. The Wave Organ was completed in May of 1986 and was dedicated in June to the memory of Frank Oppenheimer. The Wave Organ is located on a jetty that forms the small Boat Harbor in the Marina district of San Francisco, walking distance from the Exploratorium. The jetty itself was constructed with material taken from a demolished cemetery, providing a wonderful assortment of carved granite and marble, which was used in the construction of this piece. The installation includes 25 organ pipes made of PVC and concrete located at various elevations within the site, allowing for the rise and fall of the tides. Sound is created by the impact of waves against the pipe ends and the subsequent movement of the water in and out of the pipes. The sound heard at the site is subtle, requiring visitors to become sensitized to its music, and at the same time to the music of the environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6yek3sperly"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.440259,37.808351]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ti Couz Creperie","description":"Posted by Jimyoung<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/DSC04934.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.coastnews.com/restaurant-guide/images/mission/ticouz-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3108 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94103<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6yek3rvng5u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.422166,37.765028]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/234163","metadata":null,"contact_name":"techturk","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:techturk","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/234163","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":15,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=234163,platial:user=techturk","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":43162}
