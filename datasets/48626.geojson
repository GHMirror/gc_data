His childhood was difficult because of his father\\'s harsh disipline and alcoholism. Ludwig van Beethoven placed himself at the head of the family after his mother\\'s death when he was 18. He took on the responsibility of his 2 younger brothers. He petitioned for half of his father\\'s salary in order to support his family. After his brother Carl died in 1815 he felt responsible for his nephew Karl. \r\n  Beethoven studied with his most important teacher Christian Gottlob Neefe in the 1780\\'s. Neefe encouraged his student to study with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whom he met briefly in Vienna \\'87. In 1792 Beethoven made another trip to study with Joseph Haydn and stayed there for the rest of his life. He was later comfronted with a loss of hearing. This only affected his playing, but it did not affected his compositional skills and instead gained more money and power. It is known for sure when he began to go deaf, but he kept it a secret until 1801. He went totally deaf by 1818. Though he continued to composeuntil the year of his death in 1827.\r\n  Throughout his life time Beethoven has written 9 symphonies,1 opera, 32 pinao sonatas, 5 piano concertos, 16 string quartets, and 16 sonatas for one instrument and piano.(5 for cello, 10 for violin, and 1 for french horn)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2fkwp1qnm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[7.096435,50.732633]}},{"properties":{"name":"grand canyon","description":"Posted by Gymbug86<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/grand_canyon2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/grand_canyon.jpg\">arizona  The Grand Caynon is 277 miles long. Its greatest depths lie more than 6,000 feet below the rim. Its one of the 7 wonders of the world near Flagstaff,Arizona. There are more than 3 million tourist that visit each year. Some popular activities are raft and boat excrusions in the river at the bottom of the caynon and trails that wine to the caynon\\'s floor. It became a national monument in 1908 and later expanded in 1919 for the park. Then in 1975 the park itself was expanded and is now 1,218,375 acres.\r\n  The rocks in the caynon have shown that there has been many years of chemical erosin. The plant varies from sub-tropical at the bottom to sub-arctic at the top. Many ancient pueblos are along the the lower part of the caynon. In the 1540\\'s Spanish explorer Garcia Lopez de Cardenas was the first European to see the caynon. Later in 1869 U.S. explorer John W. Powell was the first man to lead a party through the river.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2fkt7k9ro"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.927971,34.167862]}},{"properties":{"name":"mount everest","description":"Posted by Gymbug86<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/mt_everest2.jpg\">asia  Mount Everest is considered the hightest mountain in the world. This mountain is 29035 feet tall. It was named after Sir George Everest who was the first person to record the height and location of the mount. Due to geological forces mount everest rises a few milliters each year and up until 1856 it was known as Peak 15.\r\n  Mount Everest like the rest of the Himalayas rose from the floor. The range was created when the Eurasion continental plate collided with the Indian sub-continental plate. The mountain is covered in huge glaciers that fall from the main peak and is a pyramid-shaped horn. Its climate is naturally extreme reaching anywhere from -33 degrees to -76 degrees in January.(its coldest month) Its hightest temperature never reaches above freezing. During its warmest month, July, it averages around -2 degrees. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2fkw0xo21"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[105.45,47.15]}},{"properties":{"name":"mount rushmore","description":"Posted by Gymbug86<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/mount_rushmore.jpg\">south dAKOTA  In 1924 Doane Robinson \"Father of Mount Rushmore\" Came up with the idea to have the carvings done in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He contacted Gutzon Borglum who helped carve the face of Robert E. Lee at Stone Moutain, GA. Borglum then chose Mount Rushmore as the site for the sculture.\r\n  Dynamite was used to carve 90% of the mount. About 450,000 tons of granite rock was removed in the process. This mountain includes the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. Over 3 million people visit this National Memorial each year.

It is located close to Toronto which makes it a busy tourist attraction recieving over 2 million visitors a year. Niagara Falls dates back to the last ice age when our area in southern Ontario was coverd in ice. As ice melted the great lakes were formed and the movement of water between lakes towards the St. Lawerance river carved through the rock to form the Niagara river. Through the years Niagara falls has eroded 4 feet per year.\r\n  Originally over 5,000,000,000 gallons of water per hour flowed over the edge of the falls. (35,000,000 gallons per minute) Half of its volume now is transferred into hydro-electric power by the givernments of Canada and the U.S. The Niagara Falls region is the largest producer of hydro-electric power in the world right now.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2fkzok80e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.80872,62.394714]}},{"properties":{"name":"nile river","description":"Posted by Gymbug86<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/nile_river.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/nile_river2.jpg\">africa  The longest river in the world is located in Africa and is about 4184 miles long. The Nile River gets its name from the greek word \"Nelios\" meaning river valley. The river flows through Uganda, Sudan and Egypt. Its landscape varies from rain forests and mountains to savanna\\'s and swamps to barren deserts. Fish that are found in the Nile include nile perch and tilapia. Hippoptamuses are common in the upper part of the nile and crocodiles are found throughout the river.\r\n  The first African civilization developed in the northern Nile valley in about 5000 B.C. They were dependent on agriculture and relied on the flooding of the river for irrigation and new soils. Up until the mid 1800\\'s the soucre of the nile was one of the world\\'s great mysteries. Its principal source is Lake Victoria though the Ruvyironza River is regarded as the ultimate source. I the late 19th century European powers gained control over most of the nile\\'s basin. In 1959 the Nile Waters Agreement resovled an international disput concerning the equitable division of the river\\'s water.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2fkxjivph"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.9,1.8]}},{"properties":{"name":"panama canal","description":"Posted by Gymbug86<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/panama_canal_2.jpg\">panama  This 48 mile international waterway is a short cut allows ships to pass the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It saves about 8,000 miles of travel around the southern tip of South America. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1494. Then in 1534 king Charles V ordered the first studies for construction of a canal but the idea nevermaterialized. Later in 1880 the French began consrtuction but after 7 years of fighting disease and in domitable problems they were forced to aboandon the project. \r\n  The signing of the Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty in 1903 authorized the U.S. to begin construction in 1904. It was finally finished and offically opened on August 15, 1914. No single effort in American History at the time had costed so much in money and human lives.

Over the last century the Amazon and the Nile have neck and neck for thr title of the longest river.\r\n  The rainforest has heavy rainfall and continuos high temperatures. These forests are so big that scientists think they actually help control the world\\'s climate. It is home to a variety of Indian cultures.

It set sail on April 10, 1912 on her maiden voyage to New York. Then at 11:40 pm April 4, 1912 she struck an iceberg and sunk in less than 3 hours. Many were stunned by the fact that the \"unsinkable\" Titanic had sunk to the seafloor. It was later discoveredin 1985 by Dr. Robert Ballard, an oceanographer and marine biologist. He believed the weight of the water-filled bow raised the stern out of the water and snapped the ship in two just before it sank. The bow and stern ended up to be nearly 2000 feet apart.\r\n  Dr. Ballard kept her location a secret to keep treasure hunters from finding her and taking the artifacts. On his second expedition he left a plaque in honor of the 1500 people who lost theirs lives. The Titanic was owned by the British White Star Line, so it was under the rules and regulations of the British government. She was originally designed to carry 42 lifeboats but she only had 20. The designer/owner proposed there be 50 lifeboats,but the british White Star Line decided against it. Only 705 people were rescued; 1523 drowned or froze to death. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g2fkyo2vki"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-42.0,24.0]}},{"properties":{"name":"twin towers","description":"Posted by Gymbug86<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/twin_toers.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/twin_towers_2_.jpg\">new york city  On September 11, 2001 four planes were hijacked and driven into the twin towerrs, the pentagon, and the pennsylvania countryside. 19 people associated with Al-Qaeda hijacked the planes.(There was a twentith person but he/she was a suspected militant and had been detained.) The first plane hit the north tower at 8:46 a.m. The second plabne hit the south tower about fifteen minutes later. Both of the towers erupted into flames upon impact. (Fires at the site smoldered for more than three months.) At 9:59 the south tower collapsed followed by the north tower a half an hour later.\r\n  Rescue operations began immediately as the country tried to grasp the concept. About 2,750 people died in New York that day. 184 more died at the pentagon, 40 in pennsylvania, and the 19 terrorists. The police and fire rescue were also hit hard; more than 400 officers were killed.
