Have great memories of this place. Would walk down the road to the old Marine Parade beach front that existed before the reclamation work started. Used to play football with my friends along the beach front. Sort of samba beach soccer Katong-style. The area was well-known for its many Chinese Peranakan and Eurasian residents. We were close friends with the Chan family. They used to visit our house at night to watch TV (TV was scarce then) and go home only after the last movie. We used to play with the kids from the Chan family all the time and visit them on Chinese New Year. David Marshall, first Chief Minister of Singapore and a well-known criminal lawyer, used to live nearby.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bu94zxa5l4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.905982,1.306305]}},{"properties":{"name":"Al-Irsyad Satya Islamic School","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://educononline.com\" href=\"http://educononline.com\">Naturefoto</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> This is an Islamic school that I helped the Yayasan Parahyangan Satya (YPS) to set up. The school offers both local and international curricula. In the long term, the school should focus on only the international curricula and become a truly international Islamic school. The school currently offers classes at the pre-school, primary school (SD) and secondary school (SMP)levels. It is planned that the school will also be offering high school level (SMA) classes. Students are currently expected to sit for the iPSLE and the IGCSE. The local UASBN is offered only to students in the current upper primary levels. The school also provides for a strong Islamic education.\n\nI spent more than a year here acting as trainer, consultant and even as a shadow school Principal. I recruited the teachers and worked with the the teachers in the preparation for the school to open in July 2007. In all, I had only about three months from the recruitment of teachers to the actual opening of the school. The school took off without much of a hitch and has not looked back since. After its opening, I stayed to act as the school\\'s full-time consultant guiding the teachers and the management of the school. \n\nThe school is becoming increasingly popular with parents in Kota Baru Parahyangan and its adjacent areas, and even as far as the city of Bandung itself. It aspires to be not only the best school in the educational hub known as Kota Baru Parahyangan but also in the whole of Indonesia.\n\nIf you need help converting your school in Indonesia  to a school of international standard, visit my website (see above). You will see a copy of the testimonial from YPS of the work that I have done for them.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bu9505lqfj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[107.477145195,-6.86532078046]}},{"properties":{"name":"Al-Istighfar Mosque","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://educononline.com\" href=\"http://educononline.com\">Naturefoto</a>Al-Istighfar MosqueThis is the mosque where my children attend their Qur\\'anic recitation classes.
