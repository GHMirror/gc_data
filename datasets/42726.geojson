It lies inside a caldera, or volcanic basin, created when the 12,000 foot (3,660 meter) high Mount Mazama collapsed 7,700 years ago following a large eruption.\n\n\"Generous amounts of winter snow, averaging 533 inches (1,354 cm) per year, supply the lake with water. There are no inlets or outlets to the lake. Crater Lake, at 1,943 feet (592 meters) deep, is the seventh deepest lake in the world and the deepest in the United States. Evaporation and seepage prevent the lake from becoming any deeper.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ixv3zzu1xa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.124023438,42.944360447]}},{"properties":{"name":"Food Fight!

If you\\'re not worried about looking nerdy, you might want to bring a hard hat. I had one and was glad of it. The ceilings within the caves get very low and some parts will need to be crawled through.\n\nThe hiking here is great, but bring sun protection.\n\nThis site is also home to carved petroglyphs and painted pictographs left by native peoples. The majority of these are located at what is now called Petroglyph Point. (I\\'m quite sad because I didn\\'t know about the rock art when I was visiting here and I didn\\'t see it... Guess I\\'ll have to go back now!)\n\nThe native Modoc people used their knowledge of these caves to help them fight off the US army during the Modoc War of 1872-1873. \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ixv3m3xjmw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.511535645,41.7508241355]}},{"properties":{"name":"McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park","description":"Posted by Carpfish<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/04/3/Mom_cam_pics_0932.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> While the hiking here is great (the park is on the Pacific Crest Trail), the main reason to visit this park is Burney Falls. At 129 feet, they\\'re certainly not the biggest falls around, but take my word for it, they are spectacularly beautiful.\n\nA word of advice about vacationing here, though. I have yet to try camping in this area, but I\\'m guessing that it would be a far superior experience to lodging in the nearby town of Fall River Mills. The only place to shop for food was a tiny convenience store, and the only restaurant in town was a nightmare. If you\\'re intent on staying at a motel, the town of Burney might be a better bet- it at least has a Safeway.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ixv41e3mvz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.65058136,41.0148791653]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mt.

The park contains 368 square miles (950 km2) including all of Mount Rainier, a 14,410-foot (4,392 m) stratovolcano.[2] The mountain rises abruptly from the surrounding land with elevations in the park ranging from 1,600 feet (490 m) to over 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The highest point in the Cascade Range, around it are valleys, waterfalls, subalpine wildflower meadows, old growth forest and more than 26 glaciers. The volcano is often shrouded in clouds that dump enormous amounts of rain and snow on the peak every year and hide it from the crowds that head to the park on weekends.\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier_National_Park<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ixv3sxvmw8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.712036133,46.8564347635]}},{"properties":{"name":"Olympic National Park","description":"Posted by Carpfish<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> From wikipedia:\n\"Olympic National Park is located in the U.S. state of Washington, in the Olympic Peninsula. The park can be divided into three basic regions: the Pacific coastline, the Olympic Mountains, and the temperate rainforest. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt originally created Olympic National Monument in 1909 and after Congress voted to authorize a redesignation to National Park status, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the legislation in 1938. In 1976, Olympic National Park became an International Biosphere Reserve, and in 1981 it was designated a World Heritage Site. In 1988, almost all of the Olympic Peninsula was designated as the Olympic Wilderness, further enhancing the protection of the region.\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_National_Park<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ixv3rpcb67"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.255615234,47.7762520439]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pizza Pi (100% Vegan Pizzeria)","description":"Posted by Carpfish<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 5500 University Way NE, Seattle, Washington 98105From their website:\n\"We are 100% VEGAN which means we use no animal products in anything we make.
