Commissioned by Anne and Sid Bass in 1970, the house accommodates a complex spatial program as well as an extensive contemporary-art collection. Because of its strong horizontal cantilevers and its white-steel and glass finishes, it has been suggested that the Bass Residence resembles a hybrid of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater and Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House.

In 1969 the Burroughs Wellcome Company asked the architect to design its corporate headquarters and main research facility. Then in 1982, Burroughs Wellcome invited Rudolph back to design an annex of additional office space and a staff dining room for the 525 employees that worked at the facility.\r\nThe original three-hundred-thousand-square-foot building, completed in 1972, was conceived as a man-made extension of the ridge on which it was built. Rudolph used a steel A-frame structure and terraced floors to give the building its hill-like appearance. Using concrete panels to enclose the space, Rudolph devised an elongated hexagonal module that gives the building a strong horizontal reading on the long elevations. The module reveals its hexagonal geometry on the short elevations, pulling out of the building in different ways to express its ability to expand. In plan, the building wraps around two courts that face in opposite directions in a sort of S configuration. The smaller is the entry court, endowed with an inviting front porch. The larger is the service court, defined by the office and laboratory wings.\r\nThe interior spaces are a direct by-product of the diagonal structural geometry and are simply stunning. The entrance lobby is a thing of the future. The space soars, exposing three levels of balconies, which maintain the diagonal lines of the A-frame. The lab spaces are unusual in their high ceilings and natural illumination[by skylights]. It is not surprising that the futuristic interiors of the building were the setting for the movie ‘Brainstorm.’\r\nThe 120,00-square-foot annex, completed in 1986, contains the company’s dining room on the ground level and additional offices above. The new wing is linear in plan and runs north of the original building, forming an L with the back of the entry and administration wing. Rudolph envisioned a future expansion that would close the L into a U-shaped court. The new wing adopts some of the themes of the original building, transforming them in interesting ways. The hexagonal module reappears on the long elevation, reinforcing the linearity of the wing. The A-frame of the original turns into a V that is exposed and repeated in parallel along the length of the wing.\"\r\nDe Alba, Roberto. Paul Rudolph: The Late Work.

I came to that 120 feet because it has been shown (and I tested this myself) that most people can’t recognize other people from more than 120 feet. So what happens higher than this matters only as seen from a great distance. Therefore, you can argue that above 120 feet, the high-rise tower can be scaleless, but below this level, the building must achieve a human scale... One of the unique things about these towers is that they are always leading you around from one facade to another. They are not frontal. They are not on axis, or not usually at least.. I managed, in the 120-foot vertical span that counts as human scale, to make each of the four sides of each tower start at a different height from the ground. Several facets of the towers begin at a point only one story off the sidewalk, others begin at six stories, the rest are somewhere in between. At the base of the towers this creates a loggia of varying heights into which are placed a bank, lobbies, and other elements. At the pedestrian level, this loggia is in scale with some very delicate adjoining buildings.\r\nOn every tower floor each one of the four corners is brought forward in a trapezoidal projection, adding three additional planes of window wall and additional floor area. In addition to the commercial attractiveness of this device, the parts that are brought forward reflect themselves in the opposite tower. Each facade then appears as a cluster of towers in reflection, not as a single shaft. I have also added what I call hinges , projecting glassed-in elements marking the intersection of each tower wall with its base. At the top of each tower are little leftover hinges that are not big enough to read the way the lower ones do...\r\nI think the organization of the Fort Worth buildings is very clear. Further these towers show how they are constructed and what they are made of. I still think buildings should do this. This is very old-fashioned of me, I know.\"\r\n\r\nInterview with Mildred F.

Of course I went there. I did an interesting thing, at their suggestion, as a matter of fact. I told them that I wanted to get as clear an idea of vernacular architecture in that part of the world as possible. They took me to some villages nearby, but they also took me to a tourist park that had built about twelve structures from the Indonesian islands. They are very\r\ndistinctive architectural types. New Guinea is very different, of course, from Sumatra, and very different from Bali, and so on. They\\'re all a little bit corny and you could tell what was supposed to be there and what wasn\\'t. It wasn\\'t perfect. I knew these things from photographs because I\\'d also done a little research. I had known certainly some of them but not all of them. To see them, even in their degenerated forms in a tourist village, was a fascinating thing. You can always see certain things in reality. That was very instructive for me. You could see the intent, let me put it that way. Quite often the detail wasn\\'t as it should be. Sometimes they would fireproof things when they shouldn\\'t. It\\'s a little bit like Williamsburg; things get changed. It was very instructive to do that.

Careful study of proportion and massing led him to create a design combining the dimensional basis of the original with a novel massing and use of materials - including the use of porcelain-enameled aluminum sun-screens conceived as a kind of ‘built-in ivy’. The structure of the extension is in reinforced concrete and the facing materials are brick and limestone. The art department itself is linked to a classroom and auditorium block by a bridging exhibition gallery.

He said all of his factories had interconnecting bridges that take material and people from one part to the other. He didn\\'t want these office buildings to look like that. I was really disappointed. I couldn\\'t get around that argument though I did try.”\r\n\r\nInterview with Robert Bruegmann, 1986\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67i3v70j73c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[114.163441658,22.2794071378]}},{"properties":{"name":"Milam Residence","description":"Posted by Kelviin<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/05/1/milam.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> 1033 Ponte Vedra Blvd\r\nPonte Vedra Beach, FL 32082\r\n\r\n1959-1961 \r\n\r\n\"In the Milam beach house, essentially a series of platforms, the floor plane drops to form an extended conversation pit in the living area, rises to create a platform for dining, and four risers higher becomes and inglenook defined by a low parapet. The second floor plane is continuous as a floor but is interrupted to permit more than half of the living space below to extend to the roof.

the first of Rudolph’s major non-residential projects to be constructed… With economy in mind, these structures are built of typical wood framing left partially exposed on the interior and finished with horizontal cypress siding on the exterior. The system of interconnected vaults relates the various programmatic elements into a single composition. The vaults are constructed of two layers of plywood sheathing with built-up roofing and braced below by standard two-by-four members in tension. Unlike at the vaulted Hook Guest House, the individual units at Sanderling are painted for protection from the salt air and to differentiate distinct construction materials. Ceilings are rendered dark blue while the framing and roof edge are painted white. The horizontal cypress siding is stained a neutral grey. In a similar fashion, the tower is constructed of wood framing painted white. Eight wood ribs form the shallow arc of the vault with thin wood lattice attached along the top as a minimal covering that allows for glimpses of the sky.\"\r\n\r\nDomin, Christopher, and Joseph King.

Initially called Beach Road I, the first scheme went into construction in 1981. But four years later, with the substructures in place and the lower levels partly completed, the project came to a halt due to a recession in the local economy. Then in 1987, the developer asked Rudolph to design a second scheme, in keeping with the initial construction but accommodating a new distribution of the building program. In the first scheme the program was divided into three equal parts: one third office, one third residential, and one third commercial. In the second scheme the program requirements called for seventy percent office, fifteen percent residential hotel, and fifteen percent commercial retail space. In 1989 construction resumed.\r\nWith this second chance, Rudolph was able to rethink the character of the entire project, specifically that of the tower. He chose an octagonal plan for the tower, in keeping with local traditions [the number eight has connotations of happiness and well-being]. As in all of Rudolph’s tall buildings in Southeast Asia, the base of the Concourse tower is highly articulated: vertical structure exposed, the ground level shaken into many levels of activity, and the intricate body of the tower made up of highly developed clusters of units.\r\nRibbon windows, sunshades, and protruding eaves create a strong horizontal rhythm of light and shadow, which help unify the diverse elements of the complex.\r\n\r\nDe Alba, Roberto.

The house proper had two levels containing upper bedrooms at each end, with balconies and bridges over a two-story living-dining space that became a breezeway when opened. The slat roof continued out over a swimming pool and gazebo. Again, the structural solution was difficult to attain, but it was ultimately successful and earned much publicity. The house’s fragile lattice portion was eventually destroyed by a hurricane.\"\r\n\r\nHowey, John. The Sarasota School of Architecture: 1941-1966.
