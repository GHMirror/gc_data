We hiked a mile in the snow with our gear. We reached the entrance and she freaked. She started crying and telling me she would do anything else I wanted as long as we didn\\'t go in that hole. I was annoyed, frustrated and pushed. No luck. So, we walked back in the rain and snow. As we drove off the car got stuck in snow. We sat for several hours during which time my mom peed on the tires thinking that would help melt the snow and free us from our misery. Eventually we dug ourselves out using a piece of plastic.\r\n\r\nA few years later my mom, her husband, my brother and I went back. My mom thought she was going to hang out in the car while we did our thing. This time we forced her in the hole (see photo).

It is the one and only Wonder that does not need speculations concerning its appearance, size, and shape. It is the oldest, yet it is the only surviving of the Seven Ancient Wonders. It is the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nLocation\n\nAt the city of Giza, a necropolis of ancient Memphis, and today part of Greater Cairo, Egypt.\nHistory\n\nContrary to the common belief, only the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops), not all three Great Pyramids, is on top of the list of Wonders. The monument was built by the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty around the year 2560 BC to serve as a tomb when he dies. The tradition of pyramid building started in Ancient Egypt as a sophistication of the idea of a mastaba or \"platform\" covering the royal tomb. Later, several stacked mastabas were used. Early pyramids, such as the Step Pyramid of King Zoser (Djoser) at Saqqara by the famous Egyptian architect, Imhotep, illustrate this connection.\n\nThe great pyramid is believed to have been built over a 20 year period. The site was first prepared, and blocks of stone were transported and placed. An outer casing (which disappeared over the years) was then used to smooth the surface. Although it is not known how the blocks were put in place, several theories have been proposed. One theory involves the construction of a straight or spiral ramp that was raised as the construction proceeded. This ramp, coated with mud and water, eased the displacement of the blocks which were pushed (or pulled) into place. A second theory suggests that the blocks were placed using long levers with a short angled foot.\n\nThroughout their history, the pyramids of Giza have stimulated human imagination. They were referred to as \"The Granaries of Joseph\" and \"The Mountains of Pharaoh\".
