One of the main advantages of google earth is it helps students understand the world in a more fascinating way enaging them to the world around them. One of the disadvantages of using google earth is not all places mapped are at the best resolution but that of course will change with time. Also it is hard to map accurately because environments are constantly changing thus it is virtually impossible to keep accurate up to speed records of the environment.\nArcGIS is a useful tool and has many advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages of using ArcGIS is the ability to manipulate data in such a way that you can practically map anything that you desire. ArcGIS gives someone the possibility of using data to prove and/or research any topic with which geographical data is relevant. One of the disadvantages is not all data is up to date as is the issue with google earth. This issue can be resolved but there must be more innovation of technology in order for such present data to be accurate.
