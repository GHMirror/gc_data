You get a high-quality, hand-selected product and we are able to do what we love, produce high-quality Lamb. People have asked why we feel so strongly about supporting small family farms. The number one reason is quality. The second most important reason is knowing the meat you eat is produced humanely and with VERY low environmental impact. In fact, we have been working with wheat farmers in Eastern Oregon to provide natural weed control on fields that are rotated out of planting for the year. This creates a positive environmental impact by providing natural weed-control while the sheep and lambs get fat. The next time you buy lamb or beef from you local market or restaurant, ask where it is from. We have found 99% of the markets and restaurants we ask have no idea where or how the meat they serve/sale was raise or processed. We are working hard to increase awareness of how your meal was produced and who produced it. When you buy lamb from us, you know where, who and how it was produced.
