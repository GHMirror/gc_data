A severe drought was felt across all Canada, affecting 41,000 people, with the most devastating impacts felt in Saskatchewan and Alberta.  Record to near-record drought, as indicated by the Palmer Drought Severity Index, was recorded at several climate stations in 2001.  The winter of 2001-2002 continued the dry trend and brought above normal temperatures.  Fall 2002 brought much needed precipitation to relieve much of the drought, though dry conditions did remain in places.  The repercussions of the drought included agricultural production, employment, crop and livestock production, and the Gross Domestic

: Saskatchewan and Alberta","description":"Saskatchewan and Alberta, March 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster.  For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.","id":"a7v2rxs9l2mb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.064915429,49.0620199271],[-101.343275018,48.9123535694],[-101.86710727,55.4976733119],[-101.86710727,59.7631645088],[-119.827070204,59.9128308666],[-119.752237025,53.6268438396],[-114.813247218,50.2593507894],[-114.064915429,49.0620199271]]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Non-Residential : Toronto ON","description":"Toronto ON, August 10, 2008.

Overland flooding from March 24 to May 21 caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba's watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers.  The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk.  The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.","id":"a7v2ry62utbz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-97.4815563857555,49.1236709356308],[-96.9400689899921,49.2319684028625],[-96.6151765584946,50.0171251296997],[-97.3191101849079,51.3979179859161],[-97.860597550869,51.3708435893059],[-97.4815563857555,49.1236709356308]]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Heat Event : Vancouver and Fraser BC","description":"Vancouver and Fraser BC, July 27 to August 3, 2009.

Two mudslides slid 320 metres down a mountainside, totalling about 150,000 cubic metres of dirt, rock and trees.  The slides buried the highway just south of Passmore in the Slocan Valley.  The mudslide toppled power lines, leaving about 4,000 residents without electricity and long distance phone service.  No one was injured in either slide.","id":"a7v2ry0vme7s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.65,49.5332999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Landslide : North Vancouver BC","description":"North Vancouver BC, January 19, 2005.

The Khyex River Landslide occurred on November 28, 2003 between 00:20 and 00:30 PST. This is when Pacific Northern Gas Ltd noticed a pressure loss in the pipeline. Approximately 300 m of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. This is a spectacular landslide because it not only flowed downstream, but crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres. It is thought that the slope failure was triggered by erosion of the riverbank.","id":"a7v2ryaq7wg1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-129.8,54.2333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rail : Brantford ON","description":"Brantford ON, November 16, 2002.

An ice storm on December 13, 2008 felled 300 utility poles resulting in one of the worst power outages since the mid-1970s and cost Maritime Electric approximately $1.5 million to repair.  Nearly 95 per cent of Islanders were without electricity, as freezing rain and ice pellet-drizzle mix left thick layers of ice on roof tops, trees and transmission lines.  Power poles were pulled down by ice-laden lines and strong winds.  Across the province, makeshift shelters were organized in legion halls, fire stations, schools and community centres. Rescue teams and hydro crews arrived from outside the province to assist.

A supercell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 km. The heat and humidity hanging over Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared.  At the same time, a squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across Ontario. This system produced straight-line winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto and destructive tornados in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornados were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of supercell thunderstorms was spawning tornados in portions of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay, and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day's weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. That was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/Central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing an 11-year-old boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp.  About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge, were damaged. Thirty-eight were demolished and declared unsafe.
