It used to be fenced off, rarely visited by anybody. Then it became a homeless encampment. Now, the mounds of dirt, old rebar and chunks of concrete are overgrown with fennel and pampas grass, forming a haven for birds and lizards, a playground for unleashed dogs and an outdoor gallery for sculptors. The Bay Trail runs out to the end. Rough side trails lead to twisted found-object metal sculptures, a crazy little plaster house with a circular staircase, and cartoon-style paintings of uncertain theme, often favoring devils, fast-looking cars and flaming urban wreckage.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2do2ozg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.325296,37.889486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ars Electronica Center","description":"Posted by Derlinzer<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Museum of the Future<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2rpmu3q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.284276,48.309638]}},{"properties":{"name":"Beirut?","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/129260676_e79c135c6a.jpg?v=0\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/89239273@N00/144773778/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/48/144773778_47daa559eb_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/89239273@N00/144773269/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/48/144773269_6f939baf87_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/89239273@N00/144773713/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/144773713_dc5fae9537_o.jpg\"></a>the maps of this region are lacking tons of data!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2dxmk35"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.516396,33.872128]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cassidy's Restaurant","description":"Posted by Kbeadle<img src=\"http://cassidysrestaurant.com/content/00/01/33/86/83/userimages/29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://cassidysrestaurant.com/content/00/01/33/86/83/userimages/32.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/3f6f8eb807148ded249adb721621fd9e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1331 SW Washington St, Portland, OR, 97205Cassidy\\'s has been around since 1979.

Elm St, Fort Bragg Ca.Glass Beach is one of the most unique beaches in the world, not because nature created it that way, but because time and the pounding surf have corrected one of man\\'s mistakes.\r\nBeginning in 1949, the area around Glass Beach became a public dump. It is hard to believe these days, but back then people dumped all kinds of refuse straight into the ocean, including old cars, and their household garbage, which of course included lots of glass. By the early sixties, some attempts were made to control what was dumped, and dumping of any toxic items was banned. Finally in 1967, the North Coast Water Quality Board realized what a mistake it was and plans were begun for a new dump away from the ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, over 30 years later, Mother Nature has reclaimed this beach. Years of pounding wave action have deposited tons of polished glass onto the beach. You\\'ll still see the occasional reminder of it earlier life, such as a rusted spark plug, but for the most part what you\\'ll see is millions of pieces of glass sparkling in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn addition to searching for and collecting glass, Glass Beach has a very interesting array of tide pools to explore. Crabs, mollusks, and many aquatic plants make their homes in these ever changing environments. It is very easy to spend your whole day poking aound the tide pools and watching the busy little worlds that go on inside each one.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2jb1rj4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.813257,39.451968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Half sunk ships in Greek Harbor - (zoom in satellite view)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/38/113209304_b939d5a7f9_o.jpg\">GreeceThere tremendously large ships just seem to be sitting around waiting to sink.

Orangethorpe Ave., AnaheimAt the very, very center of Islamic Chinese food is a round of sesame-flecked bread, a minor flour-and-water achievement that\\'s as thick as the Bibles smuggled into China, with three or four doughy strata hovering between crispy top and bottom planks.\n\nThe bread, which must share DNA with ancient oven-baked Middle Eastern breads, is fine on its own, but even better when it replaces rice to soak up sauce from the shredded chicken with dry bean curd or to dunk into a warm pot of lamb stew.\n\nAt Mas\\' Islamic Chinese restaurant in Anaheim, you\\'ll have to wait at least 15 minutes for an order of it, but that\\'s fine; it\\'s the sort of food that shouldn\\'t be made ahead of time. You can have it stuffed with green onions, or not. There\\'s also a sweet version filled with red bean paste.\n\nThe restaurant stands in an industrial section near Fullerton, and with its indoor fountain, large chandelier hanging inside a domed ceiling, red walls and the presence of owner Jamilla Ma in white headdress, it feels as though it dropped down from the sky.\n\nMa owned the other Islamic Chinese restaurant in Orange County, Jamillah Garden in Tustin, which she sold two years ago. The menu is essentially the same. Plenty of familiar Chinese dishes, all prepared in the Halal way, according to Muslim dietary rules. Pork and alcohol are verboten ingredients.\n\nThere\\'s a stronger-than-usual emphasis on lamb and tripe. She serves handmade, nicely chewy noodles. And of course, there\\'s the bread, which doesn\\'t appear too much in Islamic restaurants in China where it\\'s so commonplace in homes no one orders it outside.\n\nOther than that, though, the menu is very familiar to anybody who\\'s ever ordered an egg roll, a pot sticker or kung pao anything. There\\'s a very nice shredded chicken with dry bean curd that\\'s at once mildly sweet and spicy. The hot-braised shrimp is forgettable, but the salt-and-pepper shrimp is worth fighting over, each little pink curl crispy from a coating of its two seasonings and a toss into a sizzling hot pan.\n\nI was underwhelmed by the steamed dumplings and pot stickers (even though the dough draping both was pleasantly toothsome) and the fried calamari, which looked like onion rings, was unremarkable even if its crust was as crispy as it gets.\n\nBut the sautéed pea-pod leaves, while tasting very familiar, seemed refreshing: bright green leaves still attached to crispy stalks, flecked with garlic and glistening with a touch of sesame oil. The dry sautéed string beans were crunchy and nicely charred in spots and the eggplant with curry, practically a savory pudding, was very good.\n\nThe homemade noodles show up in both brothy dishes and chow meins. They\\'re irregular cuts, thick and chewy in spots, more tender at different points along the strands. The lamb stew warm pot is a bracing dish, the broth tinged with anise and other ingredients in Chinese five-spice powder. Big chunks of supremely tender lamb still on the bone float about, although you must negotiate the clinging bits of white fat.\n\nMost beef dishes are worth your time. The stir-fry leek with beef is brazen in its embrace of five-spice powder, the beef deeply red, fully cooked and supple.\n\nMas\\' is the place where you want to start with the familiar and then tiptoe over to the cold spicy beef, the cold spicy tripe and the ox tongue in brown sauce. One day, the cold jellyfish might be a weekly necessity.\n\n-ocregister<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2jz5t85"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.862315,33.865036]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old U&amp;I sugar mill","description":"Posted by Phototron<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/bwtopwindownet.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/topwindownet.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/topdoor4net.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/topburnnet.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/Toplabnet.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/toppkitchen.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/mill.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/4/mill3.jpg\">Toppinish, WashingtonAbandon sugar mill.

But if you’re going to go to a fifties diner, why not go to one that was actually around in the fifties---such as Palo Alto Creamery which has been residing on Emerson Street in Palo Alto since 1923, long before the hula hoop or tailfins were ever invented.  \r\n\r\nBut first an attempt at name clarification.  The Palo Alto Creamery was once owned by the Peninsula Creamery Ice Cream Company which actually had a plant right in town at 800 High Street.  The plant closed in 1994 when the city asked it to start using environmentally-friendly, and drastically more expensive, Freon.  An apartment complex now stands in this location.  In any case, their Peninsula Creamery diner was leased out to Robert Fischer under the name “Peninsula Fountain &amp; Grill.”   Later when Fischer set up a second restaurant under the same name at Stanford Shopping Center, the original Creamery sued over naming rights. They said the name was only for the original Emerson Street location.  So Fischer changed the name of both locations.  Hence, the current “Palo Alto Creamery.” Confused yet?\r\n\r\nWell, if not, it gets more complicated still.  Palo Alto Creamery still keeps the “Peninsula Fountain &amp; Grill” sign over their door on Emerson, plus the old Peninsula Creamery plant still has their own milkshake-winning sandwich and ice cream shop that has survived just a few blocks away on High Street.  It’s called The Peninsula Creamery. Half the city seems to mistakenly think the two “Creameries” are the same operation and local newspapers issue retractions from time to time when they mix-up the names.  Pretty crazy.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, despite all the name perplexity, the diner at Emerson and Hamilton (whatever you want call it, regulars have always just called it “The Creamery”) has become a legend in Palo Alto.  It is probably known best for its 18 flavors of milkshakes and bigger-than-your-hand hamburgers, but the mid-century ambience is what vaults it ahead of other local greasy spoons.  \r\n\r\nThe walls feature posters for old-style cookies and drinks like Yoo-hoo (which is still around) and Green River? (maybe not so much).  There is also a collection of items such as old style speakers, a working jukebox, early televisions and standing hatracks that recall another time.  And the fifties style incorporates more than just the atmosphere.  An authentic Woolworth’s-style soda-jerk behind the lunch counter will make you a Vanilla Coke, an Egg Float or one their famous milkshakes served in one of those stainless steel cups.  Their menus may need a more modern spelling check though---it references its location at the “Standford Shopping Center.”   \r\n\r\nBut wherever it is and whatever its name is, The Creamery has become a Palo Alto institution and as such, a historical landmark---or at least a good place to get a milkshake while you’re on your tour. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2nz8axu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.16174,37.44388]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Salt House","description":"Posted by Finkster<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/44553036p1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 545 Mission St, San Francisco, CA<a href=\"http://www.opentable.com/rest_list.aspx?m=4\">Reservations (OpenTable.com)</a>\n\nNamed after a famous pub in the UK, the folks from Town Hall have certainly upscaled the pub with Town hall.  Housed in wonderfully restored old publishing house featuring the original brick, wood floors and metal and wood beams, it\\'s a warm and inviting environment.\n\nThe food is a great mix of casual style French and California cuisine...you must start with the Canadian styled Poutine which is potato wedges fried and covered with fontina and an rich beef gravy.  Also had a wonderful Monk fish with Chard and braised Ox sauce, amazing Winter Squash soup with sage oil, and Pork Belly with Poached Egg on a mixed salad...overall each dish was very well balanced and creative \"warm\" flavors you won\\'t typically find at restaurants in San Francisco.  Very creative wine list, we had the Royal Tokaji from Hungary, a nice change.\n\nMost recent trip, I went the shellfish route, SH has an excellent selection of very fresh oysters.  Also had the baked oysters which were good, but not great.  Started with a white bean soup topped with pesto which was wonderful and very well balanced.  The dungeness crab salad has an amazingly fresh appeal and is drenched in a great olive oil dressing.  The foie gras torchon was quite good quality and matched with an excellent apricot reduction.\n\nService was extraordinary, rare for a new restaurant to be this well tuned.  Very catering as well to my young daughter who joined, made us feel at home.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2e68m46"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.398733,37.788923]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tsui Shell House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.lynnerutter.com\" href=\"http://www.lynnerutter.com\">Ludmilla</a><img src=\"http://www.tdrinc.com/images/photos/large/house37.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.tdrinc.com/images/photos/tsuihs.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 2747 Mathews St, Berkeley, CA 94702groovy modern house built like a shell.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ff2h9blaa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.285816,37.856469]}},{"properties":{"name":"Willamette Shore Trolley Northern Terminus","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://tinzeroes.blogspot.com\">Tinzeroes</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/WillametteShoreTrolley.jpg\">SW Moody &amp; BancroftCheck the website.
