going through &quot;major flooding&quot; as deemed by the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service’s Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. \n\nThe dataset provides the location name, major flooding point location (city, state, lat, lon), location’s main water source, current height, current flow, current status, and forecasted status in one weeks time.  \n\nThe information was collected between 7:00 am and 9:30 am central time on the 13th of June, 2008.Various locations recorded their data within this time interval.\n\nCategories of Status: Record, Major, Moderate, Flood, Action, Non-Action\n\nLat/lon coordinates are provided by the website.\n\nFor more information about these major flood locations visit: http://www.weather.gov/ahps/  \n\nBy visiting the site you can view all major flooding points in the country and gather more information about past, present, and future flooding incidents at that point.
