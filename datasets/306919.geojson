Pitt, for example, did not content himself with just this lavish home; instead he also bought the parliamentary seat of Old Sarum.

Like many of the other Caribbean islands, Trinidad was known for its lush fields of sugar cane and cocoa, making it an economic gold mine for those in charge. For the most part, the island’s inhabitants maintained a quiet lifestyle until 1797 when Sir Ralph Abercromby and a British fleet of 17 ships approached the island and quickly and effortlessly had the possession turned over to them overnight. Soon after (by 1802), Trinidad became a typical British sugar colony - plantation owners importing enslaved Africans to work the fields until the 1807 empire-wide abolition of the slave trade and then complete banishment of slavery in 1834 presented a problem. It was then that the idea of the indentured servant became popular and in 1839 the British began a program of recruiting Indians from Calcutta to supplement the labor problem. This eventually led to the import of about 150,000 from places such as China, India, and the Middle East – contributing to the vast ethnic and cultural diversity seen on the island today.  Trinidad’s pair, Tobago, was acquired by the British in 1814 by much more dramatic means - the tiny island changing hands between 20 and 30 times among the British, Spanish, Dutch, and French due to its attractiveness as a strategic maritime possession. For decades, Trinidad and Tobago was just another English plantation colony until the discovery of oil in 1857 in La Brea, Trinidad where what was arguably the world’s first successful oil well was built. From that point on, Trinidad and Tobago dominated oil production in the Caribbean and brought much revenue for the British empire until the island finally gained independence from British ties in 1962.","{label}":"Trinidad and Tobago","id":"aavw3unw52x7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://www.cambridgehistory.org/images_graphics/Cambridge%20in%20Rev/Cambridge%20Common/IMG_0497.gif","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/04 16:48:23 -0500","original":"2/4/2012 16:48:22","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/04 16:48:22 -0500"},"{section}":"Thursday 2pm (Gitanjali)","{name}":"Alaina Murphy","{description}":"British Troops arrived at what is now known as Larz Anderson Bridge on April 19, 1775.

However, the boards were stored on the bank of the river, making it quite simple for the British troops to replace and carry on their way.

To protect the safety of its students, Harvard College cancelled classes on May 1, 1775. With the students' absence, more than 1,600 troops were quartered in Harvard's buildings.

People from England, France, Scotland, Ireland, and Germans including Protestants, Catholics, and Jews settled the city. In 1720, Charles Town officially became a royal colony, gaining the protection of the English Navy. During the eighteenth century, the city grew wealthy as they traded the cash crops of rice and indigo across the British Empire; it became one of the British Empire’s richest colonies. A vast majority of the population of South Carolina was made up of slaves, to work the cash crop plantations. Even the city expanded, the settlers of Charleston felt increased opposition to the taxes and control put upon them by the British.

The ship, called the Trouvadore, had been bound for Cuba, where the slaves were to be sold.  Because the Caicos Islands were part of the British Empire, which had gradually abolished slavery in its colonies in the wake of the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act, residents were unsure what to do with the ostensibly enslaved survivors of the wreck.  While the ship’s Spanish captain attempted to offer a cash reward to locals who would ensure the slaves’ delivery to Spain, authorities in Grand Turk ultimately sent their own ships and soldiers to rescue the survivors and brought them back to the courthouse where they were detained for some time.  Since authorities realized that sending the slaves back to Africa—or even to another local island for that matter—would be far too expensive (especially given the cost of the rescue), they decided instead to keep the majority of the Africans on the island on a three-year contract working for the salt rakers.  Though the Africans weren’t technically slaves any longer, the working conditions were difficult and locals insisted that they go to church and learn English.  There is no definitive record as to what happened after the contract was up, but evidence suggests that the former slaves became free citizens of the Caicos Islands, perhaps even starting their own settlement, known as Bambarra, in Middle Caicos, having been saved by a shipwreck from a lifetime of slavery.","{label}":"East Caicos","id":"aavw3ue18vft"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://www.libs.uga.edu/darchive/hargrett/maps/1821f6.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/07 22:35:41 -0500","original":"2/7/2012 22:35:40","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/07 22:35:40 -0500"},"{section}":"Friday 1pm (Sakura)","{name}":"Andrea Henricks","{description}":"During the Revolutionary War, the owners of a large merchant company named Panton, Leslie &amp; Company (later named John Forbes &amp; Company) moved from Georgia to Florida since they were supporters of the British empire.

They eventually made their way successfully to Jamestown, only to find the settlers there starving, before they turned around back to England. The Virginia Company decided to keep some settlers on the island and as a result Britain has maintained possession on the island continuously to this day.

The first British visit came nearly 60 years later, yet it was the British who would largely make use of the spot in the immediate future.\nAt least initially, the Britons used the islands not for its famed indigenous fauna but rather for its strategic location.  As Niall Ferguson wrote in his history, Empire, some of the first traces of imperial power were sown by British pirates ransacking the gold from Spanish ships and colonies, some of which returned was returned to the Crown. These buccaneers, as they were later called, utilized the Galapagos as a hiding ground to avoid the Spanish for over a century.\nThe aforementioned fauna, including the large whale population, which helped feed the hiding pirates, also made the island attractive to various whalers and Pacific travelers, who made such frequent visits to the island that a small post office was erected on the island of Floreana in 1800.\nBut the islands’ most significant contribution to British history came in 1835, when a 26-year old naturalist named Charles Darwin pulled into the Galapagos aboard the H.M.S. Beagle, which was charged with surveying many different parts of the world to help the ever-expansive British trade and war effort. While on the Galapagos, Darwin famously examined and studied the island’s finches, and it was there that he formulated his theory of evolution, which fundamentally changed people’s views of animals and, ultimately, of themselves. \n\nBobby Samuels","{label}":"Galapagos Islands","id":"aavw3uq8lpa0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://images.travelpod.com/users/jolyonp/20.1187404830.captian-cooks-landing-site.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/05 23:15:26 -0500","original":"2/5/2012 23:15:25","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/05 23:15:25 -0500"},"{section}":"Friday 11am (Sakura)","{name}":"Bradford McGann","{description}":"British Captain James Cook encountered the archipelago of Tonga in October of 1773 during his second voyage to the region.

This colony had been founded as a location of punishment for convicts, but was beginning to thrive and establish its own society under the rule of the colony’s governor Lcahlan Macquarie. Yet despite this, not every convict could be redeemed and Fort Denison served as one location of continued punishment for those who committed crimes while in Australia. Originally just a slab of rock, the first prisoner, Thomas Hill, was sentenced to a week chained on the rocks with just bread and water. (According to a tour guide of mine in Sydney this past winter, great white sharks were so abundant in the Sydney Harbor at that time that no prisoner—even if un-chained— dared attempt to swim back to the mainland in fear of being eaten!). In 1796, a gibbet was installed on this island to hang those who committed the most egregious of crimes while in this penal colony. It is said that the first person hung was Francis Morgan, a man who was sent to the penal colony for murder and then subsequently bashed a man to death with a rock in Sydney. While serving as a prison within a prison, convicted people were forced to build a fort upon this slab of rock.

After being owned by the Portuguese and the Dutch, Elmina came under British rule in 1871. Elmina is a significant place in the British Empire mostly because of what it represented to the British. Land on the Gold Coast was so fervently sought after because of its trade opportunities - namely, gold, ivory, and slaves. By the time the British came in possession of Elmina Castle, one of their primary concerns was maintaining superiority to other Empires. In obtaining Elmina Castle from the Dutch, the British ensured that no other powers - namely the French - would have that access.","{label}":"Elmina Castle","id":"aavw3upmy6hj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://www.faughart.com/stg/userimages/site509/subdir1/roche_castle.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/05 10:25:44 -0500","original":"2/5/2012 10:25:43","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/05 10:25:43 -0500"},"{section}":"Friday 11am (Sakura)","{name}":"Caroline Williams","{description}":"The Pale referred to the part of Ireland that was governed by British law. Though the British monarch commanded allegiance from every major Irish king after the Earl of Pembroke (called “Strongbow”) wrested Ireland from the Vikings in the 1100s, British colonization of Ireland was, in reality, far more difficult. By the reign of Elizabeth I, Ireland was informally divided into those who acknowledged British rule, mainly the British colonists of the Pale and some colonists in the south, and the rest of Ireland, which still followed Gaelic customs and traditions. A common legal system did indeed extend across the divide, but after the English conversion to Protestantism in the early 1500s, the question of religion was a contentious one, as most Irish citizens remained fiercely Catholic. The Irish finally won independence from the British in 1923, though Northern Ireland is still under British rule today.

It took many tries to lay the cable; after a failed attempt in 1857, the connection was successfully made in 1858, and the first official telegraph sent across the Atlantic Ocean was a congratulatory message from Queen Victoria to U.S. President James Buchanan. However, this first cable failed several weeks later. Several more attempts were made over the next decade; eventually, the first long-lasting, truly successful cable was laid in 1866. The cable was made of copper wires, wrapped in layers of gutta-percha (a rubber-like material from Southeast Asia - thank goodness for those colonies!), wound with tarred hemp. The thousands of miles of cable were loaded onto a ship in coils, and then gradually unwound and laid to rest on the ocean floor as the ship chugged across the Atlantic.

A few years later, the Khedive was forced to seek out loans from both Britain and France, which established a joint oversight committee into Egyptian economic and domestic affairs as a condition for financial help. As France's influence in the country waned, British control grew, and soon Britain was the de facto ruler (though the position of khedive was formally kept to present a facade of Egyptian political rule). Together with this newfound political power, the Suez Canal provided huge economic opportunities to Britain, creating entirely new and faster trading routes to connect Britain's vast empire. Maps could be drastically reworked to facilitate shipping, and overseas travel time to India could be cut in half.

Based in Baghdad, Faisal understood that his shaky government was dependent on British support, and he therefore signed the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922, which lasted eight years before a revised treaty was signed. This installed British advisers and ministers in various government positions, gave Britain the ultimate say in fiscal matters, and allowed British troops to be stationed in the country. In return, Britain would provide financial, military, and social aid, as well as political support for the monarchy.

Once met, the House of Burgesses would present their minutes and decisions to the Governor who would either accept or decline the laws they wanted to pass. It was America's first form of Representative Government where the Governor appointed a few members and the rest were elected by the \"members\" of the colonies (those above the age of 17 who were white and owned land). \n\nWhile the House was short lived due to Virginia's transformation into a royal colony in 1624, it demonstrated two vital things for the British Empire.

In 1838, Lin Zexu was sent to Guandong province to put the Qing policy into practice. Lin was very effective, capturing many of the Chinese traders on the inside and attempting to persuade the British traders to forfeit their opium in return for tea. The British traders were hesitant however, and as a result Lin was used force to capture the remaining opium. He and his troops mixed the confiscated opium with lime and salt to destroy it. They then threw the impure opium into the ocean. Although traders still entered the market on a small scale afterwards, Lin was a prominent leader in stopping the drug trafficking with the dumping of the opium in Humen bay (reminiscent to the Boston Tea Party, I might add).","{label}":"Humen Town","id":"aavw3uoog3s8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://www.cannondesign.com/FILES/original/2009/06/29/9cfbbbba85166a1f77ddb3e5a9c36b938d851701.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/08 11:27:04 -0500","original":"2/8/2012 11:27:03","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/08 11:27:03 -0500"},"{section}":"Friday 11am (Sakura)","{name}":"Elle Hagedorn","{description}":"West Point, NY served as an American military base during the American Revolutionary war, as well as up until the present.

British Empire and Ottoman Empire reached an agreement that granted control of Cyprus to Great Britain following the British intervention on the side of the Ottoman Turks by sending a fleet to intimidate the Russians. The timing of this new land acquisition was very important for the British, as it was a period of fast increase of sea-borne traffic in the Eastern Mediterranean due to the Suez Canal that had opened nine years ago. Since much of this traffic was British en route to or from India, this island proved to be a major base of operation for the occupation of Egypt that would happen only 4 years later. This was an important mark of Britain’s growing dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean. Even though the British had agreed to run Cyprus on behalf of the Ottomans, this agreement was paused and even reversed during the chaotic years of World War One. Cyprus was declared to be a Crown Colony in 1925. Its history from then until 1960 is full of events such as Italian and German invasions, internal chaos and Greek Cypriot riots.

In fact, Napoleon realized the strategic importance of Egypt to the British and landed his troops there in an effort to block this valuable corridor. This was the provocation for the great naval battle of Aboukir Bay, where Nelson and the Royal Navy dealt a decisive blow to Napoleon’s forces, with the French forces ultimately surrendering in 1801.

Needless to say, the British were less than pleased that this crucial passage was controlled by the French (in conjunction with the local Khedive government.)  However, the Khedive had borrowed heavily in undertaking this mammoth project and consequently found himself inundated with debt. The opportunistic British investors were quick to swoop in and purchased Khedive’s shares of the Suez Canal Company, once again using their economic muscle for strategic means. However, the Khedive government again found itself in dire economic straits a few years later and at this point the British and French assumed control of its financial dealings. The British then ousted Khedive after he resisted their power-grab and inserted his son Tawfiq in his stead. This Egyptians began to riot in response to this gradual loss in autonomy and tried to bring an end to all European involvement in their country..

As tensions rose, Maine raised its militia, expanding the road to the region and constructing two forts along the St. John river which today mark the Northern and Eastern-most towns in the region.

The British, for their part, moved their own militias and military to the border, making a conflict seem imminent. Thankfully, diplomats intervened before shots were fired, settling the border in part using and old map drawn by Benjamin Franklin. Though the conflict was never a hot war, dozens of troops reportedly died in the frigid Maine winter (with temperatures dipping below negative 40 degree Fahrenheit), often getting lost on patrols when blizzards would strike, and the newly constructed road aided settlement of an area that would later house Loring Air Force Base one of the largest in the world, and a key location in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.","{label}":"Aroostook County","id":"aavw3ufzs4jd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://www.generalatomic.com/AmericanHistory/falmouth.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/04 02:19:51 -0500","original":"2/4/2012 2:19:50","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/04 02:19:50 -0500"},"{section}":"Thursday 2pm (Gitanjali)","{name}":"Jason Sandler","{description}":"On October 16, 1775 -- six months after the Battles of Lexington and Concord had taken place -- Captain Henry Mowat sailed into the northern-Massachusetts port of Falmouth (now the City of Portland in present-day Maine) with a fleet of Royal Navy ships.

Drake's contributions to this set up a strong tradition of British naval entrepreneurship and strength.\n\nDrake would later go on to play a decisive role in defeating the Spanish Armada in 1588, ending Spain's hopes for conquering the British Isles and giving England time to expand her colonial holdings in the Americas and emerge as the naval power of Europe, Drake's Bay however represents the beginning of series exploration beyond traditional English spheres of influence, which would go a long way in helping make England into the British Empire.","{label}":"Drake's Bay","id":"aavw3uotzwvl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://orwell.ru/library/articles/elephant/img/elephant.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/08 11:58:38 -0500","original":"2/8/2012 11:58:37","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/08 11:58:37 -0500"},"{section}":"Thursday 4pm (Mircea)","{name}":"Jonathan Park","{description}":"In a 1936 essay titled \"Shooting an Elephant,\" George Orwell describes one memorable experience while serving the British Empire as a police officer in Moulmein, a village in lower Burma.

The Chinese Emperor had created the “Canton System” to regulate trade with the west and gave the British East India Company a monopoly on trade, so long as they only conduct trade with China at Canton (Van Dyke 2005: 3). Britain imported several goods into the harbor, such as tea, and acquired mainly fine silks and textiles from China until the early 19th century. In the early 1800s, opium – a drug from India - became one of Britain’s major imports into China (Poon 2008). The Chinese Emperor banned opium and sent Lin Zexu to govern Canton. Lin Zexu, on order of the Emperor, hoped to shut down Britain’s opium trade in Canton. The Chinese governor blockaded Canton’s waterways – effectively choking off Britain’s access to Canton – and seized 20,000 chests of British opium in 1839 (Poon 2008). This event forced a break in Britain’s policy with China because, prior to the seizure at Canton, Britain had focused on maintaining a strong economic presence in China without military intervention. Now, Britain’s informal empire, defined as land conquered by Britain through trade and influence rather than an army, in China needed to be reforged through military force. Britain responded to the seizure with her army and sparked the First Opium War (1839-1842). Britain won the war and captured Canton, freeing the British merchants who had become trapped in the harbor after Lin’s opium confiscation. After the war, Britain strengthened her economic presence in China through a series of treaties, including the Treaty of Nanjing. Through these treaties, Britain obtained the Island of Hong Kong, new ports for trade in China, and acquired “most-favored nation status” with China (Poon 2008). The opium ordeal in Canton, rather than break Britain’s profitable trade system in China, reinforced it. Britain’s response to the Canton seizure and victory in the Opium War opened the door for larger future profits in China than the crown had ever dreamed of. \n\nWorks Cited: \nLeon, Poon. “Emergence of Modern China.” University of Maryland. http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/modern.html#opium\n\nVan Dyke, Arthur. “The Canton Trade.” Hong Kong University Press. 2005.","{label}":"Canton (Guangdong), China - Opium Seizure and Start of the First Opium War","id":"aavw3uncece4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/StKitts_Brimstomhill.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/07 23:26:43 -0500","original":"2/7/2012 23:26:42","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/07 23:26:42 -0500"},"{section}":"Wednesday 5pm (Nick)","{name}":"Joseph Booth","{description}":"The British explorer Sir Thomas Warner landed on the island of St. Kitts (a small Caribbean island southeast of Puerto Rico) in 1624.

Port Arthur was notorious among transported convicts for its harsh psychological treatment of inmates and difficulty to escape, due to its location surrounded by water. \n\nPort Arthur was one of the most infamous penal settlements of the nineteenth century British Empire.

He looked to the salt tax as an issue around which all regions, classes, and ethnic groups could rally, for the mineral was a necessity to all Indian subjects. Gandhi decried the salt tax to be, “the most iniquitous of all [of the Salt Laws] from the poor man’s standpoint,” for the British monopoly on the salt tax marked the sale or production of salt—an easily accessible resource—by anyone other than the British government as a criminal offense (Scott). On March 12, 1930, Gandhi, accompanied by 78 satyagrahi men, began his 240 mile 23 day journey on foot from Sabarmati to the coastal village of Dandi. Over the course of each day, the procession swelled with more followers, eventually reaching two miles in length. On April 6, 1930, Ghandi picked up a lump of mud and salt from the seashore at Dandi and boiled it to illegally make salt in defiance of the Salt Tax. He subsequently urged his thousands of followers to make their own salt from the seashore. Thus began a “war” on the salt tax, which lasted until April 13, 1930. In reaction to Ghandi’s defiant act, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month. Ghandi was later arrested “under a regulation of 1827” on May 4 of the same year (Scott). Regardless of these arrests, thousands of people continued to make or buy illegal salt. As a result, this period is considered to be the highest point of Gandhi’s political career and a turning point in the Indian struggle for independence from Great Britain, for it mobilized thousands of Indians and attracted international attention to the independence movement (Scott). \n\nGraham, Scott. “The Salt March to Dandi.” Emory University Postcolonial Studies 1998.

During this time, Hindus and Muslims both worshiped in the temple, ultimately causing disputes between the two religious groups. In 1859, the colonial British Empire in India intervened by erecting a fence to separate Hindu and Muslim areas of worship; the fence allowed Muslims to worship inside the temple, and Hindus to only worship outside the temple. As this fence stood for almost 90 years, it caused turmoil and bloodshed for many Indians. The aftermath of the 1992 demolition is still present today, with neither Hindus nor Sunnis willing to divide the land up.

From 1890 to 1910, the Kenyan administration sponsored the emigration of tens of thousands of Indians to work on the Kenya-Uganda Railway. In Kenya, as in other spaces of empire, the introduction of a third race significantly complicated the imperial project along political (infrastructure!) and personal (identity!) dimensions. The LG Maternity Home and Infant Welfare Center at Nairobi is but one example of an attempt of a specific population (European women) to contribute to the national cause (by building out European-style infrastructure) while also carving out a specific identity (in this case institutionalizing the giver / receiver to uplifting/uplifted relationship between european and indian women).\n\n2) women's bodies as symbols and sites of imperial conquest and contest: While the role(s) of women in empire is hotly debated, it is clear that the female experience of empire was decidedly different from the male. As has been pointed out in many places, language used to describe process of colonization and project of empire was (is) highly gendered: England was the \"motherland\" responsible for colonies' upbringing, new territory was \"virgin land\" until \"penetrated\", indigenous women embody \"erotic exoticism\", etc. Surprisingly, however, such discourse was riddled with contradiction and women of all races - in concept and in flesh - found themselves endowed with ambiguous imperial agency.\n\nThe Lady Grigg Indian Maternity Hospital and Infant Welfare Center at Nairobi is an example of an institution that theoretically rails against \"conquered\" female trope by creating a literal and cultural space for female welfare. Simultaneously, however, the very project of regulating childbirth -- an extraordinarily intimate, exclusively feminine, and generally highly ritualized experience -- problematizes any understanding of the home as a neat, feminist, imperialist victory.

The massacre in Kanpur (or Cawnpore as it was known by the British) came at the heels of a twenty-day siege on the British garrison at Kanpur.  Greatly outnumbered, the British sustained heavy losses during the fighting while disease coupled with food and water shortages also took their toll on the British troops.  On June 25, 1857 the British agreed to surrender to the Sepoy forces in exchange for safe passage out of Kanpur to the nearby Allahabad.  However, on June 27, the morning of the evacuation, Sepoy soldiers attacked the British, killing many and capturing the rest.

Nevertheless, the Kanpur Massacre marks one of the bloodiest moments in the Sepoy rebellion, and perhaps in the entire history of British rule in India.  In addition to leaving hundreds of British soldiers, women, and children dead, the massacre also made headlines back home in Britain.  As stories of the horrors that occurred reached Britain, they became an important source of pro-Imperialist propaganda.  As a result, the Kanpur massacre resulted not only in massive loss of life, but also served to illustrate the barbarity and savagery of natives in India that the British feared.

In the commotion, a slave from rebel-run Esher escaped and informed white authorities of the rebellion. Planter militia, troops, and even Maroon soldiers (contracted by the British) mobilized to combat Tacky and his forces. Fearing retribution and capture, many slaves returned to their plantations. Tacky and a small company of his men continued to fight. When a Maroon fighter killed Tacky, his men went into hiding and eventually committed suicide rather than return to their slave lives.

The culture and landscape of this island nation have been indelibly affected by different empires over the course of history, beginning with the Dutch, who gave the island its name. Prior to the Dutch, the island was uninhabited, and Dutch attempts at settling it ultimately failed. In 1715, the French took control of Mauritius and established a colony based on sugar cane production. French corsairs used the island as a base for attacking British ships during the Napoleonic Wars, but the French ended up surrendering the island to the British in 1810. The British continued using the island for sugar cane production, but after the Empire abolished slavery in 1835, they had to find the workforce elsewhere. Most of it came in the form on indentured Indians, but there was also immigration from China, Madagascar, and parts of Africa, so the island's population became incredibly diverse. Mauritius finally gained its independence in 1968. Today, the languages spoken in Mauritius are English, French, and Mauritian Creole, reflecting the two empires that had once ruled it. The predominant religions (together comprising 96% of all religions represented in the republic), on the other hand, are Hinduism, Catholicism, and Islam, showing the different origins of the people of Mauritius.\nOne of the most telling effects of European colonization of the island is the extinction of the curious Dodo bird (pictured), which was numerous when the first settlers arrived, but could not survive the colonists and their imported animals.

It first established a settlement on Gaya Island just off the mainland, but this was destroyed in 1897 by an uprising of the indigenous seafaring Bajau people. The BNBC also began collecting taxes from locals. After the first settlement destruction, the BNBC established Jesselton on the mainland (after Charles Jessel, who was the Vice Chairman of the Company). Jesselton proceeded to become a major trading post and the terminus of the North Borneo Railway by 1906, the only rail transport system still operating on Borneo. Much of the city's original architecture was destroyed during WWII, as the British razed the city early in the war when fleeing the Japanese. The last South Pacific Allied offensive in 1945 destroyed what was left of the city.

The battle itself began because Captain Thomas Best sought to settle in the city of Surat to create a factory for the British East India Company. At the time, the Portuguese had a monopoly on trade with India, and the British were seeking to gain footing in the spice trade. The British ships settled by the nearby village of Suvali, which they mispronounced as \"Swally,\" and were attacked by Portuguese ships. Best quickly ran three of the Portuguese galleons aground, and then began to attack the smaller barques with cannon fire.

At the time of its construction, Ontario was part of the British Empire, and was referred to as Upper Canada. The British had two main reasons for building this fort, to protect their waterways, and to protect the Royal Navy Dockyards from attacks by the USA. An attack on Point Henry would have been detrimental to the British because it would have cut off communication between the Royal Navy Dockyards and all settlement to the east of Kingston. Thus jeopardizing possible attacks on all of Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the the St.Lawrence River. Point Henry was located where Lake Ontario met the Saint Lawrence River, both were fundamental trading routes for the British. Furthermore, after the War of 1812, Point Henry was even more vital to British trade due to construction of the Rideau Canal. After completion of the Rideau Canal, Point Henry was located where Lake Ontario, the Rideau Canal, and the St.Lawrence River all intersected, which would be considered the heart of the British's trading routes in present Canada. The original fort cost 70,000 pounds for the British to construct. It was occupied by British troops until 1870.

The university started it's activity in the Curzon Hall.\n\nThe foundation of the Curzon Hall and the University of Dhaka reminds us of the fact that the British divided the whole India in terms of religion; later we see the reflection of this very fact in 1947, when the British left India, but divided the whole region into two parts-- Parkistan and India.","{label}":"Curzon Hall, Dhaka, Bangladesh","id":"aavw3um9mtda"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Death_of_Montgomery.jpg/300px-Death_of_Montgomery.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/03 13:55:26 -0500","original":"2/3/2012 13:55:25","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/03 13:55:25 -0500"},"{section}":"Wednesday 3pm (Anouska)","{name}":"Taylor Phillips","{description}":"The Battle of Quebec, fought on December 31, 1775, was the first decisive British victory of the American Revolutionary War.

In 1585, Sir Walter Raleigh dispatched Sir Richard Grenville to lead an expedition to the island, where he established a settlement of just over a hundred colonists.  He left them there, promising to return with fresh supplies in April 1586.  However, when the relief shipment failed to show up on time, the colonists opted to sail back to England with Sir Francis Drake, who stopped by Roanoke Island on his way back from successful raids in the Caribbean.  In 1587, the British launched a second attempt at a Roanoke Colony, this time under the command of John White.  When hostilities with the natives threatened the colony's survival, John White sailed back to England to ask for help, leaving 115 colonists behind.  Once again, help arrived late.  White was not able to return to Roanoke until 1590, only to find the settlement deserted.  There were no signs of a struggle, and yet the 115 colonists at Roanoke were never found.\n\nThe Roanoke Colony illustrates the challenges and risks associated with Britain's colonial expansion.

Nearly the entire Spanish population left, and the British began an aggressive campaign to bring new settlers to Florida. The settlers tried to grow sugarcane, hemp, and indigo, but few crops survived in the sandy Florida soil, and many settlers died of tropical diseases in the sweltering heat. The indentured laborers eventually tired of Trumbull's authoritarian rule, and the settlement collapsed. The surviving settlers fled north to St. Augustine. The sparsely populated Florida remained loyal to the British Empire during the American Revolution, but as part of the Treaty of Paris ending the war, Florida south of the 31st parallel was returned to Spanish control.

European interest in Zanzibar derived largely from its position as a commercial hub of slavery, as slavery was not abolished there until 1889. Even as Zanzibar lost economic importance with the end of the slave trade, the British continued to control its leadership, appointing Sultans as they saw fit. When Sultan Hamed bin Thuwain died, the British appointed his cousin as his replacement, but Khaled bin Bargash, who had already tried to come to power when Hamed was alive, moved into the palace with 2000 men and declared himself Sultan. In response, British naval troops bombarded the palace, destroying it and causing 500 deaths amongst Khaled's forces and just one British death. The firing lasted for only 40 minutes. Khaled fled Zanzibar, and the British appointed their original choice, Sultan Hamoud, who supported the British government.

According to John Holwell, an employee of the Company, 123 out of 146 prisoners of war suffocated to death in the Black Hole. This event is significant in the history of the British Empire because it led to the ordering to Robert Clive to retaliate against this Nawab, an event know as the battle of Plassey.","{label}":"The Black Hole of Calcutta","id":"aavw3v3rx364"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6a/Slaves_sierra_leone.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/01 10:21:03 -0500","original":"2/1/2012 10:21:02","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/01 10:21:02 -0500"},"{section}":"Thursday 2pm (Gitanjali)","{name}":"Xiaokun Pam Chang","{description}":"The Slave Trade Act of 1807 served to abolish the slave trade in the Empire.

The Shwedagon Pagoda is located in Yangon, Burma and is often considered the most holy site for the Buddhist population of Burma. However this sacred place has seen the many vices of war--once by the Portuguese in 1608 and twice by the British during the first and second Anglo-Burmese wars, when it was used as a fortress. These occupations were also not brief; the first occupation lasted just over two years, essentially for the entire first Anglo-Burmese War and the second an astonishing seventy-seven years, even though the second Anglo-Burmese went on for less than a year! The first Anglo-Burmese began 1824 and the  third war ended in 1886, and by this time, the three wars had resulted in a complete annexation of the state. This lithograph dates back to the first occupation of the Shwedagon Pagoda by Britain and depicts two British men standing alfresco near the occupied holy site.","{label}":"Shwedagon Pagoda","id":"aavw3utyi70r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://www.friendsofthefusiliermuseum.co.uk/USERIMAGES/Spion%20Kop.JPG","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/02 00:25:53 -0500","original":"2/2/2012 0:25:52","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/02 00:25:52 -0500"},"{section}":"Thursday 4pm (Mircea)","{name}":"Yucheng Pan","{description}":"Spion Kop (1900) was a costly battle for the British in the Second Boer War. The Boers were armed with Mauser rifles that could match the British firearms, which eliminated the usual technological advantage for the British. In addition, lackluster strategies caused the British troops to be stuck in trenches whereas the Boers obtained higher ground. The British lost this battle and suffered large casualties.

The British and The Brethren saw a similar enemy in the Spanish and formed a mutually beneficial relationship to defend Port Royal. After a massive earthquake in 1692, the capital of Jamaica was moved to Spanish Town, then later to Kingston, both of which grew enormously through the resettlement of earthquake survivors.","{label}":"Port Royal, Jamaica","id":"aavw3uv1cnwb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"http://teacher.sheboyganfalls.k12.wi.us/staff/dmmiles/mysite/assets/ftticonderoga.jpg","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/02/06 18:07:50 -0500","original":"2/6/2012 18:07:49","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/02/06 18:07:49 -0500"},"{section}":"Wednesday 3pm (Anouska)","{name}":"Zoe DeStories","{description}":"Originally built by the French in 1755, Fort Carillon was situated along the mouth of the La Chute River, between Lake Champlain and Lake George; it was of strategic importance for trade routes. After an unsuccessful British attack in 1758, British troops under Jeffery Amherst laid siege to the fort in 1759 and renamed it Ticonderoga. During the American Revolution, Fort Ticonderoga was captured by Benedict Arnold, Ethan Allen, and the Green Mountain Boys in a surprise attack on May 10, 1775. The victory had far-reaching consequences: Henry Knox transported 59 artillery pieces from the fort to Boston, forcing the British to evacuate that city in 1776. In July of 1777, it fell back into British hands under General Burgoyne, only to be abandoned after the failure of the Saratoga campaign.","{label}":"Fort Ticonderoga","id":"aavw3v1mt8s4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":"test","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/08/29 09:10:46 -0400","original":"8/29/2012 9:10:45","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/08/29 09:10:45 -0400"},"{section}":"Wednesday 2pm (Dzavid)","{name}":"test","{description}":"test","{label}":"test","id":"aavw3v4am9s8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"{image}":null,"timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/08/29 10:05:41 -0400","original":"8/29/2012 10:05:40","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/08/29 10:05:40 -0400"},"{section}":"Wednesday 2pm (Dzavid)","{name}":"test","{description}":"test","{label}":"test","id":"aavw3v1zcc4g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":220,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-16T21:58:18-04:00","id":306919}
