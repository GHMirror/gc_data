It's very heart breaking.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCurrently (the middle of July) there are large areas of Ship Island that are covered in a small patchwork of tar balls like this one. They are thick but not so thick that you can't walk through them without stepping on them. In some areas of about a thousand square feet at a time you have to go around them to avoid them. I saw at least two areas towards the very east end of West Ship where there were warning signs encouraging people to keep out. The majority of the beach both bay side and Gulf side are free of tar from the boat dock to the end of the dunes. On the Gulf side the water was beautiful, no oil sheen in sight anywhere. On the bay side the water was kind murky but this is not unusual. There was an area on the bay side at the east end where there was a good bit of oil which was captured by boom.&lt;br /&gt;\nCurrently the island is still a great place to spend the day. I believe wildlife is being effected even now. There was a lot of fish all around the island and I saw at least a half dozen sharks about five or six feet long having a buffet. The birds seemed really agitated. I have a bad feeling about what's to come out here. Enjoy it while you can.&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/znude/4794772179/","id":"180"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.921666,30.218339]}},{"properties":{"title":"Distressed Bird","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/4795404960","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/14 23:01:24 -0400","original":"Wed Jul 14 23:01:23 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/14 23:01:23 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/znude/\"&gt;Bayou Campers&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/znude/4795404960/\" title=\"Distressed Bird\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4795404960_0648c486f5_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"128\" alt=\"Distressed Bird\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling this is a small sign of what's to come out on beautiful Ship Island. I have a feeling this chick was fed some food tainted by the oil spill. The chick was still alive and hiding near a piece of old scrap rope. He could have been just a stray that got out of the nest and sometimes when they are sick I think mom or dad throws them out. But it almost looks like patches of oil on his feathers. I'm no expert so I can't say.&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/znude/4795404960/","id":"181"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.926815,30.217616]}},{"properties":{"title":"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/4795723858","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/15 01:42:42 -0400","original":"Thu Jul 15 01:42:41 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/15 01:42:41 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/geaux/\"&gt;geauxlouisiana&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/geaux/4795723858/\" title=\"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4795723858_1cd63fae22_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"157\" alt=\"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Workers tent at Grand Isle, Louisiana on June 10, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/geaux/4795723858/","id":"182"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.982029,29.238589]}},{"properties":{"title":"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/4797955883","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/16 01:48:49 -0400","original":"Fri Jul 16 01:48:48 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/16 01:48:48 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/geaux/\"&gt;geauxlouisiana&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/geaux/4797955883/\" title=\"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4797955883_b4590029ff_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"142\" alt=\"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grand Isle, Louisiana on June 10, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/geaux/4797955883/","id":"183"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.982029,29.238589]}},{"properties":{"title":"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/4798589900","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/16 01:50:46 -0400","original":"Fri Jul 16 01:50:45 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/16 01:50:45 -0400"},"description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/geaux/\"&gt;geauxlouisiana&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/geaux/4798589900/\" title=\"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4798589900_775fbcdf9c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"169\" alt=\"BP Gulf Oil Spill 2010\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grand Isle, Louisiana on June 10, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe saw two news trucks that day, this being one of them.

It's the 12th anniversary of the Columbine shootings which certainly changed how schools handle bullying and security issues.  It's also the first anniversary of the Deep Horizon/BP oil fiasco, which has forever changed the lives of those that depend on the Gulf for a living.\nRIP+ to the 11 drillers just doing their job for BP that died on the rig and the 12 students &amp; 1 teacher that died at the hands of two emotionally deranged students with weapons in school.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wishardofoz/5638651520/","id":"a66jhoux5dkg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.619802,30.243905]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5638622556","title":"1 year ago today.........","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/20 15:07:52 -0400","original":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 12:07:51 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/20 15:07:51 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/jerseysummerrose/\">DirtyJerz Photography</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jerseysummerrose/5638622556/\" title=\"1 year ago today.........\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5227/5638622556_d4d91edb37_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"1 year ago today.........\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jerseysummerrose/5638622556/","id":"a66jhp2hfeou"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.581542,28.343064]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5635557295","title":"Peninsula Washing Away","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/19 18:04:57 -0400","original":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 15:04:56 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/19 18:04:56 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/nwfblogs/\">NWFblogs</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nwfblogs/5635557295/\" title=\"Peninsula Washing Away\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/5635557295_d1bb063f2d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"148\" alt=\"Peninsula Washing Away\"></a>\n\nMarsh grasses killed by BP oil have left a peninsula in Louisiana's Bay Jimmy at the mercy of the tides, with large gaps opening.
