There is a main dining room that seats 100 guests and a private dining room that seats 25. COLORS can accommodate up to 225 people for cocktail parties.\n\nA Peters map spans the length of the south wall, unpretentiously reminding diners of the kind of global culinary experience they are about to indulge in.\n\nThe menu is inspired by the staff’s own family recipes which are innovatively reworked to create a unique fine dining experience in New York City.\n\nIn addition, the COLORS menu changes seasonally, which allows guests to look forward to uncharted culinary journeys every season.\n\nCOLORS is the largest cooperative restaurant in the United States, owned by more than 50 worker-owners hailing from approximately 20 countries. Every member of the COLORS staff is a co-owner: chefs, bus boys, bartenders, waiters and hostesses.\n\nMany were formerly employed at Windows on the World in the World Trade Center. Post 9/11, COLORS has provided jobs where none were available, but more importantly, continues to provide all worker-owners with opportunities for advancement and invaluable experience in the decision-making that goes into running a restaurant. Members of the staff contribute recipes from their many and varied countries of origin.\n\nEvery member of the staff has a stake in the success of the enterprise meaning that each is committed to ensuring that every guest has a fine dining experience.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qhez4y33k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.992286,40.728721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Craft","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farmaid.org\" href=\"http://www.farmaid.org\">Farmaid</a>900 Broadway New York, NYwww.craftrestaurant.com<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qhes9o920"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.989761,40.739193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Craftsteak","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farmaid.org\" href=\"http://www.farmaid.org\">Farmaid</a>85 Tenth Ave. New York, NY212 400 6699\nMon- Th 5:30-10pm\nFri &amp;
