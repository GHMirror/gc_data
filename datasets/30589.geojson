As a result, there are now 71 metropolitan areas–representing nearly 40 percent of all single-family homes–that can be classified as &amp;quot;extremely overvalued,&amp;quot; according to the study. By comparison, only 64 metro regions were considered frothy at the end of last year and only 1 percent were classified as such in the first quarter of 2004.&amp;quot;\n\n&amp;quot;The fact that this number of metro areas – representing such a large percent of the total single family market–is extremely overvalued should be a cause for concern,&amp;quot; said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City.\n\nThe bottom line: Real estate prices eventually correct themselves. And unfortunately for homeowners, it often takes years before home prices start to rise again, especially after a big run up.\n\nNational City recently studied 66 major metro regions over the past 21 years that suffered through a 10 percent or greater decline in prices for at least a two-year period of time. It found that home prices, once they begin to correct, tend to decline 17 percent on average before markets heal themselves.\n\n&amp;quot;And the average duration of these adjustments is 3.5 years,&amp;quot; says DeKaser.\nFULL TEXT:  http://tinyurl.com/gdozq\n\nDEFINITION:\nValuations in excess of 34% are classified as &amp;quot;extremely overvalued.&amp;quot;  A complete ranking of overvalued and undervalued housing markets, as well as past price declines and duration of market corrections are available in PDF form from the link below:\n\nFULL REPORT:\nOvervalued Housing Market?
