Before you even get a look at the hundred-odd echt-Italian items on the menu, there are several clues that at Filiberto\\'s, the more things change, the more they stay the same. The entryway is partially covered with fan letters from the last three decades, every table is draped in red-and-white checkered cloth, and framed Ferrari posters decorate the walls. There\\'s a bar tucked into the main dining room, available wines are displayed on a wall of shelves separating the kitchen from tables, and outside, there\\'s even a traditional boccie-ball court. Most of those hundred or so items on the menu have been there since Filomina Perry opened the restaurant with her brother, the restaurant\\'s namesake, and their respective spouses. Perry continues to run Filiberto\\'s with her family and a cast of staff members who have been around so long—none fewer than 15 years—that they seem like family.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g5fh9qpgpb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.316198,47.473823]}},{"properties":{"name":"King Wha Restaurant","description":"Posted by Floggerman<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 605 SW 152nd St., Burien, WAA surprisingly good Chinese restaurant.
