Where a median income, for example, is given as $26,000, it means that exactly half of the incomes reported are greater than or equal to $26,000, and that the other half is less than or equal to the median amount. Median incomes in the data tables are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Zero values are not included in the calculation of medians for individuals.","column_3":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"column_4":null,"table 111-0035 seniors' characteristics, by age group and source of income, annual (dollars unless otherwise noted)(1,2,3)":"6","column_5":null,"column_6":null,"column_7":null,"column_8":null,"column_9":null,"id":"aa5qq5i0d9r9","column_2":"A median income is provided for total income only.","column_3":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"column_4":null,"table 111-0035 seniors' characteristics, by age group and source of income, annual (dollars unless otherwise noted)(1,2,3)":"4","column_5":null,"column_6":null,"column_7":null,"column_8":null,"column_9":null,"id":"aa5qq5g7t373","column_2":"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Ottawa-Gatineau straddles the provincial borders of Ontario and Quebec.
