The two-square block garden was designed by Philadelphia-based landscape architect and designer Laurie Olin. You will find places to be with the crowd, places of sanctuary and always an appreciation of trees. A map of most of the trees planted is printed on the back of the Garden’s brochure. These 20 stopping points deserve special notice. They are pictured in early summer but are worthy of a visit at any time of year.

A relatively compact cultivar of the southern magnolia, it is notable for leathery, glossy dark green leaves on top and rusty brown on the underside. Among the more cold hardy versions.

Lamarcki Serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea)","description":"<img src=\"http://caseytrees.org/geographic/tree-inventory/sculpturegarden/No.11sculpture\">Amelanchier arborea ‘Lamarcki’: Serviceberries can be multi-stem or single trunk. These multistem cultivars create a dense clump enticing for birds. It flowers before it leafs out (precocious) with small, white pendulous racemes. The fruit is a small, berry-like pome that ripens to dark purple. Birds love them. They’re tasty to humans, too. According to legend, the Amelanchier is known as a serviceberry in nearby mountainous areas because it blooms about the time the ground thaws enough to dig graves. Great fall color with leaves turning orange and yellow and red. Bark is gray with a reddish cast and is ornamental in winter.","id":"a6d5z0u3x85w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.022324,38.890736]}},{"properties":{"name":"12.

Another legume, it grows taller – 60-75 feet rather than 40. Also flowers in pendulous panicles, generally greenish-white, in May and June. Trees are usually either male or female. The female flower is longer and more fragrant. A great specimen tree for an open space, here they act as a direct contrast to the elms they face on the Mall.

Each leaf has three leaflets, similar to the box elder, but is a rich, dark bluish-green. Good fall color in the red-green-russet range. A small tree, it’s often planted as here, in clumps for drama. A somewhat fussy maple that hates wind and loves water. ","id":"a6d5z0xq56lr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.022713,38.890736]}},{"properties":{"name":"14.
