Far too often, local cafes either try too hard to approximate European style or they miss the boat entirely. This is why stumbling upon Cafe Metropol was such a pleasant surprise. While it hardly feels like Prague, Paris or Padua, this cafe has enough casual charm and culinary variety that you don\\'t need the fabricated appeal of a European-styled eatery to justify whiling away the hours.\n\nCafe Metropol, on the eastern edge of Little Tokyo within shouting distance of the new Southern California Institute of Architecture campus, inhabits a large brick-lined loft space at the base of a revitalized industrial building. There are no cafe tables littering the street, nor are there any cigarette smoking bohemians lingering over cold cups of coffee; instead there is a light and spacious two-part dining area. The walls are adorned with unassuming photography and art (with new shows every few weeks), and the general feel is bustling but hardly hectic.\n\nOwners Angie An and Guido Ganschow were inspired to open Metropol after noting the lack of quality cafes in the area. Now going on their fourth year in business, the establishment specializes in casual breakfast and lunch fare, offering everything from salads to baked goods. While you could pick up the ubiquitous bagel and cream cheese with a latte and be on your way, I would advise taking a bit more time to have a quality sit-down meal.\n\nThe pride of the menu are the panini (grilled sandwiches on a baguette). The ham and cheese panini () comes with a side salad of organic greens on a signature triangular plate and is simple and tasty. Made with Jarlsberg cheese and black forest ham, it\\'s flavorful without being greasy. In addition, Metropol makes an assortment of breakfast panini ranging from egg and cheese to that old Euro favorite, Nutella.\n\nSalads also comprise a large part of the menu. The sesame ginger chicken salad (.50) is a simple affair, with grilled strips of marinated chicken resting atop a large bed of organic greens. The focal point is the chicken, nicely marinated with citrus and herbs, but the ginger dressing was a bit too sweet and tended to weigh down the salad. The grilled salmon sandwich (0), served on a crunchy Ciabatta roll, is loaded with cucumbers, red onions, Roma tomatoes and a fine cut of salmon, which is well accented by a mild creamed horseradish.\n\nPizza and Coffee\n\nMetropol has an impressive selection of pizzas prepared in traditional Italian style with a thin crust (no Hawaiian pizza here). The prosciutto pizza (0.50) is topped with thin strips of sweet prosciutto and covered liberally with mozzarella, parmesan and shreds of basil. Although the basil and prosciutto complemented each other well, the parmesan left the meal a tad bit salty.\n\nMetropol also cranks out a few vegetarian pizza options, including a funghi (mushrooms), and a margherita (tomato and mozzarella).\n\nThe owners of Cafe Metropol pride themselves on the fact that their ingredients and distributors are top notch. Their bread comes from La Brea Bakery, the pizza dough from Italy, the meats are imported from Europe and the coffee is Danesi. Which leads to one of the finer points of Cafe Metropol--the cappuccino. If you find yourself with the opportunity, be certain to enjoy the wonderfully strong drinks, which can be accompanied by one of the many tarts they serve.\n\nCafe Metropol, at 923 East Third St., is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. A beer and wine license is in the works for April, to be followed by a nightly dinner service. The Cafe offers catering and local delivery.

Alvarado St., Los Angeles, CA 90057Founded in 1947, Langer\\'s Delicatessen and Restaurant has served generations of patrons for more than 59 years. What better introduction to Langer\\'s than this, by David Shaw writing for the James Beard Foundation in commemoration of our America\\'s Classics award:\n\n    In Los Angeles, where any business that stays open for more than five years is likely to proclaim itself a \"legendary institution,\" Langer\\'s Delicatessen is the real thing. Langer\\'s is also a living microcosm of the Los Angeles story, from dramatic post-war growth through all the triumphs and tribulations, changes and challenges that have followed.\n\n    Opened in 1947 with just 12 seats, almost forced out of business by recession and the urban blight of drugs and gangs in the early 90s, then rescued by — of all things in Los Angeles, a subway! — Langer\\'s lives on, serving what many deli aficionadoes on both coasts consider the best pastrami sandwich in America. Norm Langer started working for his dad, Al, in 1963, and he\\'s been there virtually every day since. His father, now 88, — still comes in for a few hours three or four days a week to help out with the lunch rush and greet longtime customers, many of whom recognize the children in the family photos on the walls.\n\n    Just west of downtown, in a neighborhood more shabby than chic, on a street corner at Seventh and Alvarado in a heavily Latino area, adjacent to a burgeoning Korea Town, it draws an eclectic and loyal clientele — including at least one Korean businessman who calls Langer\\'s pastrami \"Jewish kimchee.\"\n\nNora Ephron, writing in The New Yorker, graciously provides a fitting tribute to our hot pastrami sandwich:\n\n    The hot pastrami sandwich served at Langer\\'s Delicatessen in downtown Los Angeles is the finest hot pastrami sandwich in the world. This is not just my opinion, although most people who know about Langer\\'s will simply say it\\'s the finest hot pastrami sandwich in Los Angeles because they don\\'t dare to claim that something like a hot pastrami sandwich could possibly be the best version of itself in a city where until recently you couldn\\'t get anything resembling a New York bagel, and the only reason you can get one now is that New York bagels have deteriorated.\n\n    . . . .\n\n    The resulting sandwich, slathered with Gulden\\'s mustard, is an exquisite combination of textures and tastes. It\\'s soft but crispy, tender but chewy, peppery but sour, smoky but tangy. It\\'s a symphony orchestra, different instruments brought together to play one perfect chord. It ... is, in short, a work of art.\n\n \n\nLocated across from historic MacArthur Park, Langer\\'s is an important part of Los Angeles\\' rich cultural heritage, a tradition carefully managed by Norm, his wife Jeanette, and daughter Trisha. Visit us soon.\n\n \n\nLangers: 2001 James Beard Foundation winners of the Bertolli Olive Oil America\\'s Classics Award\n\nLangers is the proud recipient of a coveted James Beard Foundation award. The Bertolli America\\'s Classics Award is presented each year to a select few restaurants noted for timeless appeal, beloved for quality food that reflects the history and character of their communities. The establishment must have been in existence for at least 10 years and be locally owned and operated. Langer\\'s Restaurant is proud and grateful for the James Beard Foundation\\'s acknowledgement of its role in Los Angeles restaurant history.

Well, it all started long, long ago in a\nplace far, far away.  Actually no. I was a student going to a community college and was about\nto get a job for the first time in my life. I was blessed for having both of my parents who gave\nme the opportunity to go to college and not worry about a job while I was in school.\n\nEventually school was out, and it was time to get a job, the only thing was, I always wanted to\nbe my own boss but really had no idea about what to do.  In the past my parents had worked\nin the food industry and thought it would be a good idea for me to give it a shot. At first I\nwasn\\'t thrilled about the idea, but for some reason the more I thought about it the better the\nidea became. But what to sell? After debating for a couple of days, and thinking of different\nfoods, the one we finally came up with was Tamales.\n\nAs I had mentioned before, I had never had a job in my life, which means I didn\\'t have any\nmoney to begin with. So to start up, my mom let me borrow about 00 dollars, and with that\nmoney I bought a couple of steamers, a cooler, and the produce to start production. I\nremember the first time I went off to sell tamales was on February 11, 2001 out of the trunk of\nmy 1979 Honda Prelude, and I remember I sold close to nothing. Around that time it was\nraining pretty bad and nobody wanted to buy food from a wet tamalero. A lot of times I came\nhome with my cooler filled with tamales, and so I had to reheat them and sell them the next\nday. Despite the tamales being reheated, people were still complementing me on how good\nthe tamales were, even after they had been reheated, but I knew they were reheated and that\nthe tamales could taste way better and me knowing they were reheated was enough for me.\nSo I stopped selling reheated tamales and always took fresh ones everywhere I went even if I\nhad some left over from the day before, I didn\\'t care. After those few times in the beginning,     \nI’m proud to say that I have not sold reheated tamales ever again. And even though it was\nhard and costly, it was the way I wanted to do things to ensure everyone got the best tamale\nthey could eat.  GUARANTEED. It took me awhile before people started to get to know me and\nwhenever I went to new places I would end up giving tamales away as free samples, but I\ndidn\\'t  mind because I knew that what I was selling was a good product, and the minute people\ntried them, they would end up buying more.\n\nThe first time I sold tamales during Christmas I remember I sold only about 500 tamales.\nWhich took me only about 6 hours to cook. After that first Christmas, it grew more and more.\nTo the point where one Christmas I had to stop taking orders from people because there was\nno way I was going to be able to keep up. That Christmas we had the pot going for like 24hrs\nstraight. Non stop. We were so busy. My Mom, Dad, Sister, Brother, Neighbor and of course\nME were all making tamales. Fast forward 4 years and thousands of tamales later and we\narrive at Mom’s Tamales. I named it of course after the one person who has helped me the\nmost, my Mom. But not only my mom, but also every mom who has ever made tamales. Thank\nyou Mom’s. Thank you for keeping traditions alive and for starting new ones. Today at Mom’s\nTamales the only things that has changed is our menu. We offer pork, beef, cheese, cheese\nand spinach, green chicken, mole chicken, sweet corn, pineapple and any other idea our\ncustomers can come up with. We have only been open for just a couple of months and our\ncustomers are very happy with our tamales, the same way we are happy they allow us to be a\npart of their special occasions. Now that Mom\\'s Tamales is here, one thing will always be true.\nNo matter how big we get. You will never eat reheated tamales at Mom’s Tamales.\nGUARANTEED.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6eronwg6mx7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.213643,34.083451]}},{"properties":{"name":"Phelippe's","description":"Posted by Saravc<img src=\"http://philippes.com/images/history_photo2.gif\"> 1001 N. Alameda St. Los Angeles CA. 90012 Philippe The Original is one of the oldest and best known restaurants in Southern California. Philippe\\'s was established in 1908 by Philippe Mathieu, who claimed the distinction of having created the \"French Dipped Sandwich.\" One day in 1918, while making a sandwich, Mathieu inadvertently dropped the sliced french roll into the roasting pan filled with juice still hot from the oven. The patron, a policeman, said he would take the sandwich anyway and returned the next day with some friends asking for more dipped sandwiches. And so was born the \"French Dipped Sandwich,\" so called either because of Mathieu\\'s French heritage, the French roll the sandwich is made on or because the officer\\'s name was French. The answer is lost to history.\n\nHarry, Dave and Frank Martin were in the business of renting horses and wagons from their Jewel stables when they purchased Philippe\\'s from Mathieu in 1927 for around 000. They operated the restaurant 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until World War II. The business grew steadily through the depression of 1929 and World War II mainly by virtue of the dedication and perseverance to duty of these hardy Kansans.\n\nPhilippe\\'s was forced to move to make way for the then new Hollywood-Santa Ana 101 freeway, and in 1951 relocated to the present location, which was a machine shop with a hotel on the second floor. Change does not come rapidly at Philippe\\'s, so most of what we are today is very much what we were and did years ago. We like to say that only the prices have changed.\n\n Philippe\\'s \"French Dipped Sandwich\" is the specialty of the house and consists of either roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey or ham served on a lightly textured, freshly baked French roll which has been dipped in the natural gravy of the roasts. Swiss, American, Monterey Jack or Blue cheese may be added. To accompany your sandwich we offer a tart, tangy cole slaw, homemade potato and macaroni salads, hard boiled eggs pickled in beet juice and spices, large Kosher style, sour dill or sweet pickles, black olives and hot yellow chili peppers. Philippe\\'s still prepares and serves close to 300 pounds of pigs feet every week.\n\nWe prepare about 40 gallons of our own hot mustard twice weekly. It is best used sparingly as it is a truly very hot french mustard. However, used with discretion, it compliments the sandwich to perfection. It may be purchased by the jar at the front candy counter.\n\nDelicious beef stew is prepared daily made from choice beef and fresh vegetables; two soup selections are offered each day, as well as our chili and beans.\n\nLemonade, iced tea, milk, mineral and seltzer waters, and a variety of soft drinks are served. Domestic and imported beers, our house wines and several premium wines by the glass and bottle are offered.\n\nTo top off your meal at Philippe\\'s, try one of our desserts. A large variety of cream and fruit pies are offered daily. In addition, we have ice cream, New York style cheese cake, our baked apples, custard, tapioca, and fresh fruit.\n\nHearty breakfasts are served from 6:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. daily. Some of our breakfast items include eggs (any style), bacon, sausage, ham, corned beef hash and our own fried potatoes. Ask for our fresh. homemade salsa for the egg dishes. In addition, omelets, cinnamon French toast, pancakes, and a variety of fruits and juices are offered. Coffee is included with most breakfasts. Featured are our biscuits, cinnamon streusel coffee cake, cinnamon rolls donuts and muffins, all baked in-house.\n\nThe price of a cup of coffee remained a nickel until 1977, when it was increased 100%, to a dime.\n\n The way the service works is unique. There is a long display counter with 10 servers, (we call them \"Carvers\"), many of which have been working at Philippe\\'s well over 20 years. Each Carver has everything she needs to prepare your meal. You get into one of the 10 lines, and when you reach your Carver, she can take care of your whole meal; make your sandwich or fix your hot dish, serve salads or soup, give you coffee or a glass of wine, add it all up and take your money. The plates are paper, the service is fast. There are ceiling fans, neon soft drink and beer signs, sawdust on the floor, a few booths and long wooden tables with stools. Seating is family style. It is not unusual to sit with people from all walks of life at the same table. There are press clippings and civic citations on the walls, and you can weigh yourself on the same scale that was used by Norman Rockwell for the Saturday Evening Post. You can make yourself at home.\n\nIn 1951, when Philippe\\'s closed its doors on Aliso Street, Matt Weinstock, then a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News wrote \". . . Philippe\\'s was something special. It had sawdust on the floor and cracks in the wall but you didn\\'t care. You went there for the luscious French-dipped sandwich, the boiled eggs, the hot mustard, the potato salad, the cole slaw, the immense hunks of pie, the always hot mugs of coffee. You also woke up at night, maybe thousands of miles away, yearning for one of those sandwiches.\"\n\nMore than 35 years later, Merrill Shindler of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner wrote, \". . . Philippe\\'s is more than food. It\\'s one of those marvelous phenomenon\\'s I find myself constantly drawn to in an effort to connect with a bit of L.A.\\'s too often ignored past. . . What can I say? It\\'s Philippe\\'s. It\\'s the Original--and it always will be.\"\n\nAnd finally, MacDonald Harris of the New York Times (\"Real food in L.A.,\" March 1990) wrote, \"There is an air of camaraderie among the customers, a kind of unspoken friendliness and consideration that\\'s rare in a big city . . . The customers are people of all kinds: shoppers, residents of nearby Chinatown, businessmen, Amtrak workers from the station, people who have been coming here for years and are now bringing their children. More than any other place I can think of, Philippe\\'s typifies the democratic spirit of Los Angeles . . .\"\n\nPhilippe\\'s \t213-628-3781\n213-628-1812  fax\nwww.philippes.com\n1001 North Alameda Street\nLos Angeles, California 90012\nPhilippe\\'s is open from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily except Thanksgiving and Christmas.
