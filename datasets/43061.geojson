I was working with a group of volunteers building trails and bridges and the like. We lived on an island and traveled by canoe. Our only contact with the outside world was a walkie talkie and our only way off the island was a park service boat. There were rough spots, granted, but I will never get over living in a tent surrounded by bear, moose, eagles, and gods only know what else. The distance of time have turned the place into a land of mysticsm. I honestly wish I could do that kind of camping again.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xs9re2y0zy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.735397,46.926821]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brazil","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/pano_2.jpg\">brazilI\\'ve never been to Brazil and I\\'m not real sure which area, specifically, I would like to go - I just know that I\\'d like to travel there. I\\'ve heard they have an entirely sustainable eco-friendly community developed there (though I don\\'t know where) and there was an open-source conference/festival (read: geeks with lots of equipment, open source software, and demonstrations of what they\\'ve done with it...followed by discourse on the politcs of open source). From what little I know, I am impressed by both the envrinmental attitude and the technological libralism.\n\nOf course, there\\'s also the natural landscape. frankly, outside of the two things listed already, I know practically nothing about this country - to my mind it\\'s a lush green forest with lots of rain and giant flat leaves with water dropping off of them and into lakes or hollowed out trees. \n\nBut, that\\'s one of the reasons why I love to travel - to find out the reality of the world and replace my fragmented assumptions with lived experience.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xs9rdemw43"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-51.92528,-14.235004]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chequamegon National Forest","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Medford WISomewhere in this forest (located near the town of Medford) is a little campground with a lake and a full moon that the wolves howl to at night.

It\\'s pretty touristy and more crowded than I would prefer but hiking the trail around the perimeter, carefully navigating from one enormous rock to another until I can practically touch the base of the tower, and feeling the sun (or the rain) set in brilliant reds (that I swear are specific to this one spot in the entire world) is all that I can think about when i find myself within driving distance. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xs9rbdegwo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.781584,44.620616]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hawk Mountain","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/OO4W0112c.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Hawk MountainThe oldest sanctuary and rehabilitation center for birds of prey in the USA. There\\'s a long list of birds that come through hawk Mountain each year as they migrate from one place to another and I like birds - who doesn\\'t?\n\nThis is also a campground with hiking trails and heaven only knows what else. Camping on the mountain where migratory birds like Hawks and Eagles have a safe wayside along their long annual journey doesn\\'t have a mystic appeal, per se...something equally as strong but more earthy.\n\nIt\\'s a place to connect with others traveling along their routes home - wherever home may be during this half of the year.\n\nI\\'ve been hoping to get there for about 5 years now but it just hasn\\'t worked out for one reason or another. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xs9rkczd4w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.965493,40.633659]}},{"properties":{"name":"High Resolution Mass Spectrometry Group","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://kermitmurray.com/\" href=\"http://kermitmurray.com/\">Kkmurray</a><img src=\"http://www2.uj.edu.pl/RegLab/masspect/masspect.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/wawel_castle_b.jpg\">Kraków, PolandThe group unites scientists of the Regional Laboratory and the Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xs9rdde95d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.959999,50.060001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Olympic National Park","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/forest1full.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Glacier capped mountains, wild Pacific coast and magnificent stands of old-growth forests, including temperate rain forests  -- at Olympic National Park, you can find all three.

Hardly anything can be called untouched anymore, but the national parks and nature preserves have more to say about the land named for any country you care to mention than the city streets or the guide books. The cities will pass along the nature of the feet that have passed there, but the dirt and trees will tell you about the land itself.\n\nhttp://www.sentier.ca/index.php?lang=en&amp;section_id=1\nhttp://www.sepaq.com/pq/fr/<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xs9r9cd3fs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-66.48333,49.116665]}},{"properties":{"name":"Park on the Ocean's Edge in Seattle WA","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/tables_thumb.jpg\">seattle waI lived here for a while.

Sometimes it\\'s hard to know whether to search in the language of the location or in my own language.\n\nRegardless, this is one of those places that I\\'ve been to and have rather powerful memories of. All i did ws walk into the Cathedral (2 or 3 times, at the most) and wander around while a man playeed songs I no longer remember on a giant pipe organ. There is something very powerful about the cathedral. It was as though i could sense the presence of every footstep that had passed there. Not in an I-see-ghosts kinda way, but in a this-place-has-the-energy-of-many-worshipers-seeped-into-it\\'s-stones manner.\n\nThe one thing I remember most vividly was a railing on a spiral staircase that was closed to general traffic. The railing consisted of (what felt like) stone that had been carved into a long series of frogs eating one another. The mouth of one was clamped onto the backside of another, and they lay that way from the first step all the way up as far as i could see.\n\nThe frogs at the very bottom were worn down to the point of almost losing their frog-resemblance. As i touched these fading amphibian railing residents i realized that they had been filed away by the touch of hands that had brushed accross them over centuries of time.\n\nWhile the first step accross the threshold told me this place had a strong power to it, the touch of the frogs was the point where I realized why.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6xs9rc6hyp4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.40152,48.215194]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Square and the Bridge in Prague","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/300px_Charles_bridge_prague.jpg\">prague czech republicThere\\'s a bridge that I walked along, admiring the bas-relief (sp?) images all along the wall, when I came across children reaching up to touch one of the images.
