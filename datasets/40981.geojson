He was a year older than the rest of the kids on the block, and he was one of those guys who, like, pretends to throw a punch at people, then, when they flinch, he says \"Fuckin\\' Pussy!\" then punches them for real.\r\n\r\nI guess he thought being older than the rest of us made him in charge. And for a while, I guess he was. He was new, and he had lots of stories, and his mom was from England, which all of us thought was kind of cool. But he also always seemed to have this one, nasty, festering boil-sized white-head zit pressed right up against the outside of his nostril, which I thought was really gross. And probably, he could tell that I was always staring at his boil-zit and trying not to look like I was going to throw up, so he didn\\'t like me right from the start.\r\n\r\nBut we were all kids, and, ya know, sometimes Jon and I would fight and sometimes we got along just fine.  One time, he was bragging about how everyone in his family smoked pot, and he could get the best pot, and how he could even get the best pot seeds in the world and we could grow our own, if we wanted to buy some from him. Me and my buddy Blowhard were kind of interested in trying the pot, even though we were only in 6th grade, and both of our girlfriends told us that if they ever found out we smoked or did drugs, they would break up with us.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Jon agreed to get us some the next day. After school the next day, he came out and met us on the street and pulled a half a smoked joint out of his pocket. He said we could buy it for six bucks. We told him we thought that was a ripoff, and he shouldn\\'t charge us more than five. He told us we were idiots, and that this was the strongest fucking pot you could buy, and he was cutting us a deal. We told him that, for six bucks, he had to throw in some seeds too.\r\n\r\nHa! We totally worked him.\r\n\r\nHe agreed. He went back in to his house and came back out with three little seeds wrapped in toilet paper. We gave him the six bucks, and Blowhard told me to hold on to it all until we had a chance to smoke the half-joint and find a place to plant the seeds.\r\n\r\nI took it all back to my house. Closed my bedroom door and crawled into my closet. With the filing blade of a nail clipper, I punched a hole in the drywall in the back of my closet, then shaved it around, so it was about the size of a nickel. Then I stuck the half-joint and the toilet-paper wad of pot seeds into the wall. Then pushed my hamper up against it, and shuffled around my clothes and closed the door, and hoped my parents wouldn\\'t find it.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, Blowhard told me to get the joint and the seeds and meet him in the alley behind his house. I went home and tried to fish them out of the hole in my closet, but it wasn\\'t easy. I had to use a pair of tweazers to fish the joint out. And the wad of toilet paper was just jammed in there. I tried pinching the paper with the tweazers to ease it out of the hole, but all I succeeded in doing was tearing little pieces off, until, after a few minutes, I heard the \"plink, plink, plink\" that told me the seeds had fallen out and dropped to the floor behind the wall. \r\n\r\nBlowhard was pissed that the seeds were gone, and told me I should pay him back two of his three dollars because all we had now was the half-joint. Or, he said, he should just get to keep the joint himself. I don\\'t remember how we resolved it, but my guess is, I probably promised to pay him back his two bucks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we smoked the joint, but nothing happened. We went to Jon later and told him we wanted our money back, since we hadn\\'t gotten high. He told us we had probably smoked it wrong and to fuck off.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t really remember anyone hanging out with Jon after that. Not until about my junior year of high school, when I was in, like, Geometry for retards, and he was in the class with me. He was the only senior in the class, and he think he felt like kind of an idiot because of that. Which he was. He never really did anything in class except talk, and cheat off me during tests.  His brother, the year before, had gotten the role of the asshole scammer dude in the movie The Last American Virgin, and Jon never shut up about it. He went on and on about how his brother got \"so much pussy\" off that role, and about how, seriously dude, being famous was the best way to get pussy, and how he was going to be famous too. I was skeptical, since he didn\\'t seem to have any talents to speak of. I was even more skeptical when he finally came up with his grand plan for how he was going to become famous:\r\n\r\nOpen a hair salon.\r\n\r\nOh, shit, that was a funny one. \r\n\r\n\"No, seriously,\" he said, \"Like in Shampoo. Warren Beatty got so much trim in that movie.\"\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t really have the heart to argue with him at the time. I just figured, \"Yeah, whatever Jon. I\\'m sure you\\'ll get lots of pussy from cutting peoples\\' hair. You\\'ll be the most famous stud in Beverly Hills.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an idiot.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1s03im10"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.388929,34.061193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Beverly Hills High School","description":"Posted by Mapfiend<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/IMGP0937.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\">Â 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1rupoas3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.412404,34.062841]}},{"properties":{"name":"I Was Not Really Robbed at Gunpoint Here","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1rqfxl2y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.371849,34.021489]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Cienega Park","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<img src=\"http://yesnetwork.com/images/talent_article/reagan_0608.jpg\">My Incredibly Short Career as a Baseball AnnouncerDamone and I worked our very first job together at La Cienega Park. We were maybe 14.  His dad was the little league commissioner that year, so he hired us, at minimum wage, to announce the little league games. Actually, I think he may have told us we could announce the games together, but we would have to split the .35 an hour. That was fine with us.\r\n\r\nProblem was, we could never hear our voices over the loudspeaker from inside the booth. Unless we turned the speaker all the way up. And really, what\\'s the point of speaking into a microphone if you can\\'t hear what your saying.  So we would turn the speaker up to 10 and call out balls and strikes. And we were pretty good at it for the most part. We knew all the younger kids, so we took to making up little bios for them when they stepped to the plate:\r\n\r\n\"Here comes little Jesse Zlotolow, the cinderella story from south Almont Street. Last year, he played two innings a game in right field, but he\\'s really tearing it up in the second half of this season. You can see that puberty is hitting him early and often.\"\r\n\r\nOh boy did we think we were funny.\r\n\r\nAnd I don\\'t know why - I guess we were getting bored - but after a couple of games, we started announcing, at the end of every half inning:\r\n\r\nIF ANYONE IN THE STANDS HAS LOST A KEY RING THAT SAYS TENNIS IS MY RACQUET, PLEASE COME TO THE ANNOUNCERS\\' BOOTH TO PICK IT UP\r\n\r\nWe must have said that a hundred times. And, man, we would just lose it every time one of us tried to say the words \"Tennis is my Racquet.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, a bunch of the parents got together and went to Damone\\'s dad\\'s house, and let him know what we were up to. He didn\\'t really get why \"tennis is my racquet\" would be funny. He just expressed a little disappointment that we hadn\\'t taken the job more seriously, and he fired me. Damone got to keep the job though, as long as he promised not to let me in the booth.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1rx0bp6z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.375368,34.060659]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mr. Cecil's California Ribs","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\">Â 12244 W Pico Blvd Los Angeles, CA <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1roklyys"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.451622,34.028555]}},{"properties":{"name":"My First Experience With The Law","description":"Posted by StinkbottomDB, Damone and I, before we discovered the pot, pretty much spent our days and nights wandering around Beverly Hills on our bikes (or rollerskates) looking for trouble to get into. A lot of times we\\'d end up at some girl\\'s house, where we\\'d invariably have to sit in a living room under some parent\\'s watchful eye. But most of the time, we just kind of wandered looking for something to do.\r\n\r\nThis office building was on the corner of the block where we lived when I was 13. It had a five story parking lot that you could pretty much get into any time you wanted. At night, it was kind of fun to walk up to the top, put on your rollerskates and go flying in circles down the empty structure.\r\n\r\nWe went up there one night and noticed there was a long metal open-air storage bin that ran the length of the lot on the top floor. So we climbed into it and found just tons of cool junk: trophies; framed artwork; stuffed animals; books. All kinds of crap. Buried under a bunch of it, we found a garbage bag with about 10 pounds of coins in it, which we took. The next day, DB\\'s mom took us to the bank where Damone and I had our savings accounts and opened one up for DB. We sat in the lobby rolling pennies, nickels and dimes and dividing up the rolls. We ended up with maybe 15 bucks a piece. DB\\'s mom explained compound interest to us, and, the way we understood it, since we were getting like 6% interest, and it was compounding daily, that 15 bucks would take about a year to turn into 0,000.00.\r\n\r\nIf 15 will get you 10,000, it seemed pretty clear that every dollar more we could scrounge up would bring us that much closer to being millionaires by the end of high school.\r\n\r\nIt was time to head back up to the parking structure and steal more stuff from the storage lockers. Maybe find some way to sell some of the framed pictures and trophies. Maybe find another garbage bag full of coins.\r\n\r\nIt was daytime, but since it was Sunday, we figured nobody would be in the office building that looked down upon the lot. So we went back up. Since DB was the smallest, we threw him up into the storage bin alone to rummage around. We thought we were pretty cool. We figured all this stuff had pretty much been thrown away anyway. We were just turning trash into cash.\r\n\r\nBut then we heard, someone yelling up above us.\r\n\r\n\"Hey! You three! Stop right where you are!\"\r\n\r\nWe froze.\r\n\r\n\"You three! Come up to the tenth floor!\"\r\n\r\nWe didn\\'t even think about running. The guy directed us with such authority, we knew there was no escape. So we walked downstairs and around to the front of the building, got in the elevator and rode up to the tenth floor. The guy was waiting for us.\r\n\r\n\"Come in my office,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWe did. It was a small, crowded, single office, that smelled kind of stuffy with cigarette smoke. The man walked around behind his desk, sat down, and asked us what we had been doing down there. None of us really knew what to say. The guy said something about his being a lawyer, and what we were doing was illegal.\r\n\r\n\"That stuff doesn\\'t belong to you.\" Then he looked at me and said, \"Do you think your uncle would be proud of you if he saw you doing that?\" A tingle ran up my spine. How the hell did this guy know my uncle? What was he talking about?  He clearly saw my confusion, and he pointed at my t-shirt. I looked down. The t-shirt said:\r\n\r\nMY UNCLE WENT ALL THE WAY TO ISRAEL AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know why it hadn\\'t occurred to me until right then that it was the dumbest fucking piece of apparel anyone could possibly wear. But seeing my belly pressed up against those words, it occurred to me that it was.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t hear anything else the guy had to say. I had a vague sense that he had extracted promises from all of us to be better kids or something, and maybe an assurance that we hadn\\'t actually made off with anyone\\'s belongings from the locker. But, really, all I was thinking was how, the next time I saw my uncle, I was seriously going to kick his ass.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1rpz50ch"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.378544,34.066116]}},{"properties":{"name":"Our house","description":"Posted by StinkbottomThe place where my wife and I first did it<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1ruf0e5d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.435814,34.01971]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rancho Park Golf Course","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\">Â <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\">Â 10460 W Pico Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90064This course\\'s fairways are lined with mature trees and a standard cut of rough.

Itâs a conservative temple, where you had to learn Hebrew and your entire bar mitvah, which lasts about 128 hours, has to be sung completely in Yid.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 12, my dad, over my motherâs objections, gave me a Swiss army knife. He said I could carry it around with me, as long as I behaved responsibly with it. I wasnât to pull it out at people or anything like that.\r\n\r\nOne day at Hebrew school, during a break in class, I was out in the hallway and for some reason, I started running the blade of the knife down the corners of these beams that ran down the walls, cutting off long strips of thick wallpaper. Some kid that really annoyed me came over and started telling me I should stop. By then, I had cut about eight or nine 3-foot long strips of wallpaper. So I started whipping the kid with them. He kept telling me to stop, so I just kept whipping him. Then he said he was going to tell the Rabbi on me, so I kind of freaked out and grabbed him and put the knife up to his neck. I started to say something to him, like, âIf you tell the Rabbi, Iâll cut your damn neck.â But it occurred to me before I finished saying anything that I was completely out of control, and I had no business doing any of this stuff to the kid. And I got incredible scared, because I instantly felt like I would give anything to be able to take back the last five minutes of my life. So I just let him go, and watched him run toward the stairs to the Rabbiâs office.\r\n\r\nI didnât know what to do, so I ran into the boys bathroom and hid in a stall, with my feet up on the toilet seat so nobody would know I was in there. Before I knew it, I heard people enter the bathroom, including the voice of Rabbi Silverstein, the only Rabbi at the school I liked, who, even though he had one of those long gray jew-beards and always wore black, he seemed kind of youngish and he smiled a lot.\r\n\r\nHe wasnât smiling, though, when he pulled a complete fucking Chuck Norris and kicked the bathroom stall door in. He didnât even ask if anyone was inside. He just kicked it in and it slammed into the side of the stall in front of me, missing my face by a few inches. He grabbed my neck and dragged me out of the bathroom, and downstairs to his office, mumbling angrily at me the whole way.\r\n\r\nHe left me in his office for a little while, and I heard him talking in a raised voice to another Rabbi for a while. I heard them decide to call my dad, and I heard them call my dad. I didnât hear much else until my dad got there.\r\n\r\nBy then, the Rabbi had calmed down. He sat in the room with my Dad and I, and he told him what happened. Except that he left out most of the bad stuff. Basically, he just said that I had vandalized the walls with my knife, and that my dad should probably take the knife back, and the school would come up with an appropriate way for me to earn the money to fix the walls, if my dad would agree. He agreed, then took me home, not speaking, except to way that if I ever did anything like that again, he would bash my fucking teeth down my throat.\r\n\r\nThose were pretty much the exact same words my dad had said to me a year before, when I had left a prayer book in class and couldnât get it because the classroom was locked. Heâs picked me up by my collar and pressed me against the wall of a stairway, and said if I didnât make sure to get the book when I was back in Hebrew school a couple days later, he would bash my fucking teeth down my throat. Rabbi Silverstein had leapt into the stairway and touched my father on the shoulder, and said, âSir, you appear to be very upset about something, but I canât have you saying things like that in schul. Perhaps we should go back to my office and talk.â\r\n\r\nMy dad had been embarrassed, but declined to talk about it with the Rabbi. He just apologized and we left. I figured maybe that was why he let me off kind of easy on the wallpaper thing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1ruwn9ch"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.428873,34.066615]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Hughes Market Hold-Up","description":"Posted by StinkbottomMy first experience with crime<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1s1glcy8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.378254,34.072658]}},{"properties":{"name":"The One in Which I Learn to Stay Out of Mexican Family Business","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\">Â <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1s1w6q4c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.37672,34.020724]}},{"properties":{"name":"This is Where I Saw the Film DC Cab at Least 10 Times","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<img src=\"http://www.postersnthings.com/posters/dc_cab.jpg\">I don\\'t think I need to add anything to that<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1rpmwo0d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.445642,34.059593]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tito's Tacos","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/122412113_88a8e8e98d_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\">Â <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\">Â 11222 Washington Place 90230<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1rx4iw6b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.414729,34.008383]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tlapozola","description":"Posted by Stinkbottom<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\">Â 11676 Gateway Blvd, Los Angeles, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g1rnxb24k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.443143,34.028954]}},{"properties":{"name":"UCLA Dodd Hall","description":"Posted by StinkbottomThis is where I was enrolled in college, but I hardly ever went there.
