I sent flowers to her professor at HUC, so that the professor could give them to her in class.  I picked her up in a limousine at HUC.  I tried to get WFUV to play a Harry Chapin song while we were in the limousine, but that did not work.  We got to the restaurant and took pictures with the limo driver.  Then we went into the restaurant.  I arranged for a special poem that I had written for her including the line \"Will you marry me?\" and professionally printed to be included inside her menu.  She opened it, and immediately closed it, she was so surprised!  Meanwhile, I fumbled for the ring and read another poem to her.  Then we called everybody to tell them.  When we left the restaurant, I arranged for the pianist to play \"You Can\\'t Take That Away From Me.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ep5x656hcr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.002836,40.732441]}},{"properties":{"name":"Original Federal Reserve Bank location - where I first called Hayley","description":"Posted by Bposerow59 Maiden Lane, New York, NY 10045Where I placed my first call to Hayley.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ep5xgskaci"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.008104,40.708308]}},{"properties":{"name":"Our Wedding","description":"Posted by Bposerow<img src=\"http://www.swanclub.com/images/g_wed2.jpg\">Shore Road, Glenwood Landing, NY 11547It rained in the morning, but the sun came out for our wedding!
