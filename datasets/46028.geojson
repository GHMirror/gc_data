They have a 1903 Brunswick pool table still in use.  Bickleton the town where the Bluebird is located in pretty small, a population of about 90 or so, mostly wheat farmers.  I had friends in Bickleton as a kid and always wanted to go here before it was family friendly.    Bickleton is also home of the oldest rodeo in the state which they hold every summer along with a picnic.  During the rodeo weekend they pull out there Herschell-Spillman carousel and give rides for fifty cents.  The carousel was originally built in 1905, and was purchased from Oaks Park in Portland, Or in 1929.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6apvk2vboce"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.302264,45.997705]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chamna Park","description":"Posted by Phototron<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> richland Wadirt trails down by the Yakima river.
