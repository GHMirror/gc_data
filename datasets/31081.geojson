This was disclosed to me later when we had become friends.\n\nAlso, I had read way more than anyone else that they were interviewing...and I had read more than all the people who were the interviewers...and I had worked in an actual library.  \n\nI got this job because I needed one but I knew I would never take the job seriously and that I would fuck with this company as much as possible.\n\nI instantly figured out all of their security procedures and told them to anyone who asked me where I worked after I had told them to come in and steal all they could.\n\nI even told people that if they came in while I was working I would personally walk them around the store and out the front door with free books.\n\nI got employees pissed about the corporation and urged them to vandalize the building, give away free stuff, to not work at all and to purposefully fuck with the sales goals.\n\nI continually broke, destroyed and stole all the forms and clipboards where the management kept track of these goals and the employees performance.\n\nOther than that, I barely worked at all.\n\nSome days, if the one guy who cared wasn’t working, I wouldn’t do one work related thing.  Some days, if the one guy who cared wasn’t working, I would leave at lunch without clocking out.  The next day I would come in and they would ask me about when I left and I would tell them I just forgot to clock in and out.\n\nI spent whole shifts reading on the chairs and couches with tea , also stolen from the Starbuck’s café inside the store.\n\nI got a manager to start leaving scraps of meat from his lunch in the stacks of books randomly.  I got another manager to steal boxes of food from the café and books to sell before their street date.  I got a supervisor to quit and go back to school.\n\nFinally, my letter of resignation made the general manager ask for psychological services through the corporation and he finally quit after making photo copies of my letter and leaving it all over the building.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6guzh4t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.4286,34.039814]}},{"properties":{"name":"Behind The Post Office","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers801 f. street san, diegoThis now defunct store in Downtown San Diego still has a branch located in San Francisco but in the early 90s it was a cultural space to graffiti artists, collectors of Kicks and Acid Jazz Heads.

I also got to cut rubies for screen prints and do the grunt art work like driving ads to transworld, mailing stuff and developing other people\\'s photos.\n\nWhen I graduated, M.T. hired me on full time and I became Carl Hyndman\\'s offial art slave.  This was 1 of 2 jobs I loved ever.  I also got to work with Dave Andrecht, which was also amazing.  Everything was great.\n\nAfter a year of interning and a year of art slaving, I was prommoted to video photographer.  I had been working on my skills with David Schlossbach and M.T. every weekend for at least 6 months.  I would take some stills and shoot video and they would teach me while working on Virtual Reality.\n\nFinally, after quite a long time I was cut loose and I got to shoot people alone.  One of the first days I did this, I shot at Carlsbad High School with Jeremy Wray and some of his friends.  This was one of the funnest days of my life.\n\nAbout a year or so into the filming of what would end up being called Second Hand Smoke, M.T. got killed by an elderly driver.  This devastated a lot of people\\'s lives.  For me, M.T. was the most important person in my life ever and I ran away from everything for awhile after this happened.  For others, it was an opportunistic moment to grab at something that was not theirs.\n\nWhen the final edit of Second Hand Smoke came out, I was excited to see a lot of my work alongside the work of M.T. and David Schlossbach.  However, when the credits rolled, I realized that I was not credited for my shots.\n\nThe webpage above is one of the shots I was not credited for.\n\nRecently, Plan B was restarted by some of my favorite people from the old days.  I contacted them and told them how I remained silent when the video came out because I was too broken up over M.T. to deal with anything.  They immediately replied that the next run of DVDs would credit me alongside M.T.  This put an end to a decade of bad vibes.\n\nI feel like a big weight was lifted off of my chest when I got the message.\n\nhere is the link again because it is not showing up on the main page:\nhttp://alamasse.free.fr\nthey also have some other dope stuff from skate videos.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6p9lgbv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.3216,33.1623]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carver's Steaks and Chops","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Carver1.jpg\">11940 Bernardo Plaza Dr.,  Rancho Bernardo, CA 92128The sixteenth job I was fired from.\n\nChopper’s Steaks and Chops.

I don\\'t even spit, ever, but it was amazing to watch this guy have all these theories on who it was and why they were \"fucking\" with him (and specifically him).\n\nI tore down corporate slogans and posters, changed the corporate slogans on purpose, refused to memorize the corporate slogans and fucked with the “86” board by writing “86 Steve, the new manager from Arizona”.\n\nI broke stuff on purpose, got other people to break stuff, telling them it was a positive release to their frustration.\n\nI vandalized the bathroom, sampled customer’s food before giving it to them, gave away huge amounts of free food, smoked inside, slurred the bar band and yelled “Play free bird” every night until I got caught.\n\nI took smoke breaks anytime anyone else took a smoke break and always left early without telling anyone.\n\nI started fights with and between employees that I didn’t like and then made them look stupid by having an air tight story that made them look like the bad person.\n\nfinally, I just upped my horrible behavior until they asked me to leave, which was coincidently one month before I moved to LA to go to UCLA anyways.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6n0w1gc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.074461,33.020345]}},{"properties":{"name":"Casa de las Campanas","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/13639dbda8d83f40957d4d3ec0ac64b1.jpg\">18655 West Bernardo Drive San Diego, CA 92127The sixth job I was fired from:\n\nCasa De Las Campanas.  (Winter c.1992)\n\nIt was just time, after a long reign of chaos, they told me I could either quit or be fired.  I drew a drawing of a nuclear bomb going off on the company stationery drawing of the building, it simply said, \"Nuke the old, I quit.  Love, James.\"  I hung it up for everyone to see.\n\nI had openly smoked cigarettes and weed in the halls while delivering room service trays, messed with the recipes in numerous creative ways while working as a cook, had sex on the job, drank on the job, popped pills on the job and smoked weed inside the residents game room while drinking their hard alcohol and eating from their ice cream sundae bar when I was supposed to be serving them food.\n\nThis was the apex of me being an out of control teenager before I outwardly cleaned up my act after graduating high school.  This job represented me at my worst.\n\nI started a \"drawing cartoons on the service trays\" craze, depicting the mean old people and the asshole managers.  They ended up having a meeting to figure out who it was that was doing all of the derogatory cartoons.\n\nThis job was going to be a disaster from the beginning.  The guy who hired me was Richard a giant gay man who, in the interview, told me that he had sex with Huey Lewis AND The News.  We smoked weed together in his trailer at the trailer park he lived in even before I got officially hired there.  Once I was in, I smoked weed with a Junior Supervisor before he got caught smoking weed in one of the residents rooms out on their patio, which overlooked the local lake.  After he got fired I got a promotion to room service supervisor.  All this meant was that I wore a different colored bowtie and had way too much freedom.\n\nI got more and more out of control and it all culminated when they started firing all the fuck ups and hiring all these new highly motivated manager types.\n\nThe first to go was Richard.  They accused him of sexually harassing some of the dishwashers who couldn\\'t even speak English.  They basically fired him because he was very outwardly gay.  I was with him the day in question and no such incident occurred.\n\nNext, they fired some of the gangsters that worked there as a legit job while they were stealing cars and everything else on the side, and after that they fired me (technically they told me I would be fired if I didn\\'t quit).  I just gave in and quit because they should have fired me when My ex-girlfriend Heather found out I was dating someone else who worked there a week after our break up so she threw a tray with three glasses of V-8 two Chablis wines, and four glasses of burgundy at me.  Luckily for me I ducked and it all slammed on the wall, which left a nice permanent splat spraying glass into the salad prep area and the ice cream bin, which then had to be emptied and all the food exposed to the broken glass had to be discarded.  She got fired for the outburst and I got written up.\n\nI also got written up for being late, smoking on an unsanctioned smoke break in a non smoking area, leaving without being \"checked out,\" talking back to managers, talking back to the residents, talking back to security, swimming in the residents pool with my uniform on at 11:30 pm, fighting with food in the dining hall after work with the whole staff, changing the menu specials board to say \"beef strokinoff\" rather than \"beef stroganoff\" (which subsequently no one even noticed besides the manager who knew it was me and wrote me up for the incident), and for my friend Adam doing burn outs in the parking lot in his camaro, \"so that you knew I was here\" as he explained later.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6tn84zo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.076172,33.052015]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dairy Queen","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/917f3c8bd819d237a76d64d97efef04d.jpg\">12634 Poway Rd.

(winter c.1991)\n\nI was fired for telling the manager to go fuck herself after she yelled at me to clean the chocolate soft serve pump faster, which had just blown up and spewed chocolate all over, flooding the whole cashier\\'s area.\n\nI remember first of all that this place was wrong right away because all my friends rode skateboards out in front and when they found out I had a job there they would ride by and moon me all day.\n\nAlso my family would come in to see me at work and that was more embarrassing than my friends riding by shaking their asses at me for my whole shift.\n\nThe day that I got fired, my second day there, I walked in and the manager rushed me to the time clock to punch in while explaining to me the dire situation at hand.  Some \"stupid fucking asshole\" (possibly me) had left the soft serve pump on all night, so the thing made ice cream until it blew spewing chocolate all over the floor.  There was at least three inches of chocolate sludge covering the whole floor of the cashier\\'s area and threatening the front facade of the storefront where everyone who didn\\'t want chocolate soft serve was none the wiser.  Being the hardworking IQ employee I had been shaped to be in my one day of training beforehand, I set out to clean away all the chocolate sludge from the cashiers feet.  Unfortunately my method was not respected.  The managers did not think that taking the whole days allotment of towels and creating a complex dam system was the proper solution.  The manager got in my face and screamed, \"If you go back there one more time for one of my towels you\\'re fired!\"  As she was yelling I noticed that all the ice cream lickers and employees had stopped to watch me be berated by this lady who had lost control.  I looked down at the soft serve pump still sputtering loads of chocolate onto her white shoes.  When she was done I told her that if she didn\\'t like the way I was cleaning up the mess that she could clean the goddamned mess herself.  She told me that insubordination would not be tolerated at any Ice Queen.  I told her she could go fuck herself.  I threw my apron and hat right into the sludge and walked out.\n\nThey were pretty surprised the next day when I came back demanding my paycheck and telling them that it was the law that they pay me immediately.  I think that they were only a few years older than me and so they just complied because they didn\\'t want any more trouble from me.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6fnomi1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.057393,32.954148]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Pescado Loco","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2c5ae4a8af411a97c0f71e68e432b782.jpg\">14012 Poway Rd.

(Summer c.1991)\n\nI got fired for stealing the owner\\'s daughter\\'s tips after I justified this because she would not tip me on any cash tips I received.  Because of this, I would take cash tips, tip myself out ten percent and then give her the tip.\n\nOne night, after 2 months of this method of \"tipping myself,\" she accused me of stealing them, even though I had been all summer.\n\nI also smoked pot everyday before work, and sometimes during work, in the customer bathroom with some burnt out rock and roll manager who drove a teal camaro, wore a multi colored tie dye bandana, and called everyone \"buddy.\"\n\nI also stole my friend Scott cases of beer and made him all kinds of free food.\n\nI washed dishes with this really cool kid with a gigantic head from Chihuahua Mexico that didn\\'t speak a word of English but hated it there as much as I did.  I taught him how to smuggle bottles of Corona inside of 44oz. Cups full of ice.  I would bring him back Coronas and he would keep them wedged into a ring of ice in the cup drinking the beer through a plastic straw.\n\nWe both washed dishes super slow and there was always a ridiculous backlog.  The manager would flip out all the time and come back to \"bust ass\" by doing all of the dishes and giving us other things to do.  I would purposely lag to get him to come back and do all of my dishes for me.  \"Bust ass.\"\n\nThis place was next to my neighborhood in Garden Road.  Every place that has ever there goes out of business in under a year.  The place there before El Pescado Loco was The Blue Dolphin Cove, and before that was some BBQ place run by this ex pro football star on The Chargers.  He was some huge linebacker and he had his face all up on the sign with a silly ten gallon hat on.  There have been two places there since El Pescado Loco. Most recently, it was this Italian restaurant where all the big fat fake mafia bosses hang out and drink espressos all day.

We also, sneezed, spit, and threw trash and food all over the inside of the van.  On this trip, Justin also photographed me jumping the van off loading dock embankments like in the movies only more damaging.\n\nI also let Justin have sex in the van with tens of thousands of dollars of custom racing wheels inside while parked in a particularly bad neighborhood of Richmond, CA outside of a punk rock flop house when I was supposed to be sleeping in a hotel next to the actual concention.\n\nI was friends with the owner\\'s daughters so they gave me a job but I found out right away that they treated their employees like shit and I was no exception.\n\nIt all came to an end when the company took me to a car tradeshow with my best friend Justin.  They didn\\'t even give us enough cash to get a hotel room and told us to sleep in the van.  This led to us eventually getting pissed when the bosses were living it up in grand style with their whole family.  Things got so bad, we ended up totally vandalizing everything in sight with the climax of running away from the tradeshow one night to drive 100 miles away to let Justin have sex with his girlfriend amongst the chrome covered rims in the heart of the ghetto in Richmond, CA.\n\nI used to have to drive to L.A. all the time from S.D. to pick stuff up in Compton for them and I would use their credit card to eat at really nice restaurants and take anyone with me who would come.\n\nI tried to corrupt the other guy who worked there but he was really dedicated because he had a wife and kid.  He would get really nervous when I would screw around and yell at me if I was too out of line.  It was sad because they totally ruled his life which sucked all around because his wife was a jerk to him too and his kid was a snotty little brat who the mom always bragged was so smart but she was really just a normal kid but snottier.\n\nThe whole place ended up making me sad because it was all so stupid and all for nothing so I quit when they realized how worthless and depraved I had become and cut my hours as a result.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6fgrviu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.259912,33.125117]}},{"properties":{"name":"House of Fabrics","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/0d9e59e364bd5616cbc317d97e20fc95.jpg\">12313 Poway Road, Poway, ca 92064-4218 The eighth job I was fired from:\n\nHouse Of Fabrics.  (Spring c.1993)\n\nI got fired for vandalizing the breakroom, spilling a half gallon container of salt onto the floor and leaving it there to blame it on Justin, stealing from the vending machines, having \"sleeping on the job\" contests with Joe and Justin, having stealing \"shrinkage\" contests with Joe and Justin, having \"messing up the store on purpose\" contests with Joe and Justin, tagging everything in the store with my last name, messing with the old ladies until they told on us, and all around insanity.\n\n(Justin and I were asked to leave together and immediately).\n\nI used to walk around this place and just break stuff so that I could tell my friends to look at what I broke.\n\nMy best friend Justin started masturbating with various swatches of fine bridal silk in various places around the store.  Soon the bathrooms lead way to the break room, and then it got out to the bridal section behind the mannequins and over to the home decoration area and even in the crafts area right near the register.  The only place he did not do it was in the Singer sewing machine area because it was too high window exposure but if he worked there for a month longer I think he would have done it.\n\nWe also stole everything from pink stuffed potpourri bunnies to full rolls of fine silk to stainless steal 00 scissors and gave them away to our moms and random girls at parties.\n\nThe whole company was on a pay freeze because the corporation was going down so we took it upon ourselves to compensate ourselves in the only way high school rejects knew how to, by messing with everything.\n\nOne day my other best friend, Joe, slept his whole shift on a bed he made out of batting, then I slept my whole shift in the doubly vented doubly air conditioned sewing machine room (there was only one key to it).  This spawned a whole \"sleeping on the job contest\" where we even tried to sleep overtime past our shifts.\n\nWhen it got to the point where I was actually spray painting all over the store with the craft area spray paints it was long over time for them to fire us on the spot.  I think that Justin regretted going along with me on this.\n\nI ended up getting him fired from his next job at Target too because he let me walk with a FULL cart of shit for my new apartment, FULL.\n\nJoe however, worked there stoned for three more years (without a raise but with many promotions to gain more responsibility).

After my friend and boss at Plan B skateboards Mike Ternasky passed away, I was feeling particularly nihilistic.  I had planned on working at Plan B skateboards until I retired to drive around the country in an RV or something.  My friend was the graveyard shift manager.  I decided to take early morning classes at Palomar College, work the graveyard shift at the Hyatt and sleep during the afternoons.\n\nThe graveyard shift was easy enough.  Most of the time you worked alone or in small teams breaking conventions down and setting them up, or refreshing the snacks for a morning meeting.  However, I have never seen such a rag tag crew of degenerates, 3 time losers and social outcasts working together under a single crew.  Most nights I was paired with a retired gangster who had recently been released from a 15 year stay in San Quentin, a recent Filipino immigrant who did not speak a word of English, an old Russian alcoholic who kept a 5th of vodka in his locker at all times and carried a flask that attached to his belt at the hip, a Vietnam vet and some ex-heavy metal guitarist for a band that “played a lot of shows but never put anything out” complete with a long permed mane.\n\nAt first glance it does not seem that any of these people would have anything in common.  Nevertheless, the thread that tied everyone together was intoxicating substances and a brutal continuing contest of who could consume the most of them in a single evening.  Most nights it came down to the old Cholo on parole and the Vietnam vet.  To keep the subsequent insanity to a minimum, as the manager, my friend would keep the Cholo in one crew and the Vietnam vet in another crew.\n\nThe Cholo was an expert with cocaine and amphetamines.  The Filipino kid smoked at least an 8th of weed every day.  The old Russian alcoholic carried a sizeable flask of straight vodka with him at all times or else he became visibly irate.  The Vietnam vet had an extensive working knowledge of every hallucinogenic known to mankind and carried no less than three of them with him at all times and the Heavy Metal guitarist specialized in pharmaceuticals but would ingest any amount of anything handed to him.\n\nI put the Heavy metal guitarist to the test one night when he was so high that any notion of work was out of the question.  It was about 4am and we were cooling our feet in the pool.  Earlier he had finished a bottle of vicodin and tossed the container in the trash.  I took the container and filled it with these tiny M&amp;Ms that people were giving out at a convention.  He was passing in and out of consciousness.  I told him he had to get his head straight and help me finish the job we were on because we had just taken a 2 hour 15 minute break.  We were supposed to be putting chairs out next to the pool for a private breakfast function at 8am.  He told me that any help from him would be impossible because he felt like his legs were under water (which they were).  I got his legs out of the pool and told him the bottle of mini M&amp;Ms were amphetamines that would get his head straight so we could finish the job.  I also told him that the general manager was looking for us on the radio.  At this, he perked up, snatched the prescription bottle of M&amp;Ms from my hand and tossed them all down.  He smoked a cigarette and drank a handful of water out of the adjacent fountain.  After he threw the smoke into the pool he yelled “All right man!  Good lookin’ out!  Lets to this!” all too loud for a hotel pool at 4:30am but he got right up and we finished the job before it was time to leave.\n\nMost nights large quantities of booze and marijuana were consumed. The Vietnam vet mostly stuck to mushrooms and weed, The cholo and the Filipino kid stuck to beer and weed. The Russian Alcoholic only drank vodka. I never even saw him eat a bite of food. The heavy metal burnout would stick to painkillers. It was up to my friend and myself to try to keep it all together.\n\nThe other hotel employees feared and avoided us. If we got on an elevator with one of the maids, she would get right off at the next floor without fail. All the other managers made fun of our crew because we fucked up a lot but there was a secret underground of employees from other parts of the hotel that respected us and wanted to be part of the convention services graveyard crew because they knew what we were about.\n\nWord spread and in rare cases that I worked outside of the graveyard shift, people would ask me questions about the mysterious outlaw graveyard crew. We started to get an underground network of employees and allies surrounding us. It got to the point where we got free food and booze, extra rooms to nap in, keys to the pool, free parking, extra clean uniforms to keep in our lockers, access to the executive rooms, and the magic key to the super hard to get into honor bar stock closet.\n\nAt some point, I just could not handle it anymore. I started off the evening really tired because it was finals and I hadn’t slept for a couple days. I was drinking all kinds of coffee trying to stay awake. The old Cholo kept trying to talk me into taking some free crystal but I would decline each time. I grew up in Poway, CA when it as the epicenter of the crystal methamphetamine empire of North County San Diego. Crystal is a disgusting and ugly drug. It changes everyone who takes it into the most exaggerated version of the worst side of themselves. The old Cholo thought I was being respectful and that I just did not want a take out, so him and a friend who was a cook at a restaurant in the Hyatt, cooked me up a full dinner loaded with crystal. They brought it to me and the old Cholo told me that if I did not want to do drugs to wake up, a good dinner would do the trick. They even made me a triple Americano that they said had extra kick.\n\nI was unsuspecting and ate the whole meal. A little later I felt really good. I felt strong. I felt like I could work all night and do every one else’s job for them. When I got home, I studied for a final and drove in to take it feeling like I was on top of everything. I was happy that I had gotten this boost and I planned to go home and crash after the final.\n\nHowever, when I got home I could not sleep. I figured it was the coffee, so I cut myself off and did some more homework. I cleaned the house. I picked up my girlfriend from work. I cooked us dinner. I read a bunch more. It was time to go to bed again because I had the night off but I still could not get to sleep. I started to freak out. I told my girlfriend that I was overdosing on caffeine. I looked it up. It was rare but possible. I read all about caffeine. I read all about coffee too. I read about a lot of the other C things in the medical book. All of a sudden the sun came up again and I had been reading the C section of the encyclopedia all night. I knew a lot about the medical properties of caffeine, camels, cars and other things that started with the letter Ca-Cl.  Without sleeping, I took another final, this time without studying for it because I forgot to, although, I feel like I knew all of the answers just right out of the blue.\n\nBy the time I got to work, I was shaking and feeling kind of feverish and sick. I was really getting tired out but I still felt like I could not sleep. I fell into work and got my assignment. I was working with the old Cholo dude again. He asked me how I was doing. I told him. He said it sounded like I needed another good meal. Still without understanding I said, “yeah, no shit.” He laughed and told his friend from the restaurant. His friend said, “yeah man, after all the fucking crystal we put into the meal, you probably haven’t slept yet!” all of a sudden I realized what they had done. This “favor.” I had stayed away from this drug for that very reason since kids started trying it in 5th grade. Now it fucked me up on my finals and kept me from being able to work. I called in a break and went up to the executive suite. 4 hours later everyone else came up for lunch and I was passed out cold on the couch. My friend said it took him over a minute to wake me up while everyone else told him to let me sleep. I made it through the last 4 hours of my shift and told my friend I was moving to Los Angeles over the weekend.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6n4jh7x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.224145,32.871084]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little Cesar's","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/5e1d93ddea66ea5b70e6b1efb9e67245.jpg\">13391 Poway Rd, Poway, CA 92064 The fifth Job I was fired from.\n\nLittle Ceaser\\'s.  (Summer c.1991)\n\nI was fired for tearing up a bad check a friend wrote 2 years earlier (fired on the spot).\n\nThis summer was weird because I had a girlfriend that was in college.  She had a condo up in Scripps ranch with some other girls at her university and all the boyfriends were always over.  My friend J.D. loaned me his Vespa P200 so I could just ride up there and back.\n\nMy parents flipped out at me for some reason right after school was out, most likely because I was pulling straight D\\'s in high school and that I had just gotten in a jet ski accident resulting in a lawsuit that was going to cost 150,000.  They told me if I didn\\'t want to live by their rules I could move out, so I did.\n\nI spent the whole summer working nights with this Morrisey Kid Dan at Little Ceaser\\'s.  All he did was work and listen to Morrisey and the Smiths.  He wanted very badly to be cool.  He thought my friends were cool but they weren\\'t.  We were all rejects and wasteoids.  Most of them, 15 years later, are dead or in prison.  Nevertheless, he copied them, their mannerisms, their drinking problems and thought I was a great source of information on them, which could make him cool.  But it didn\\'t, it just made him a target and a doormat.\n\nDan was a manager, fresh out of High School, and he did everything by the book because instead of going to college he was going to manage Little Ceaser\\'s as a career.\n\nWithin one month I got him to drink on the job, let all my \"cool\" friends come in for free pizza, close early, fuck with asshole customer\\'s food, record crank calls on the answering machine and take turns taking hour long smoking breaks.\n\nThe place was totally dead anyways so, after I got him out of the manager mindset, we just went nuts.  He would get pretty drunk every night and I would smoke weed in the walk in freezer while punching the dough like Rocky.\n\nThe problems started when my friend Stacey\\'s parents went out of town and she threw a party.  I let my friends pick up 25 pizzas and a hundred of those breadsticks things.  The only problem was that the regional manager came in during the middle of me cooking all this shit, smoking, sitting on the countertop while Dan was over at the liquor store trading pizza for beer.  I told her that this order for 25 pizzas and a hundred of those breadstick things was a crank call.  She yelled at me for smoking, for sitting on the countertops and for letting someone trick me like that and then she yelled at Dan for not being there behind closed office doors.\n\nShe came back out of the office and told us to throw all the pizzas out leaving to the Ramona store all pissed off.\n\nDan totally snapped and was sure he was going to get fired because he came back in with a twelve pack of BUD.\n\nThe same night, my friend Hal came to pick up the pizza and told me that he had bounced a check there a year ago.  I looked for the check and tore it up in front of him without thinking twice about the whole situation.\n\nThe next time I came into work Dan looked at me with a really sad expression while solemnly layering a pizza with the exact measurement of pepperonis.  I went to clock in and that is when the manager asked me point blank, \"did you tear up a check from the bounced check file?\"  I said no but they knew it was me.  They told me to not bother clocking in.  I demanded my paycheck.  I cashed the check and went back to Stacey\\'s and ate some leftover pizza.\n\nI still have no clue how they fingered me so quick.  I think they put the pressure on Dan to tell them why he was fucking up and he just let loose all the crazy out of control shit I had been doing to save himself.  I could see him crying, \"It wasn\\'t me, James made me do it!  He is the bad guy!  I saw him tear up a bad check even!  He smokes weed in the walk in!  Please don\\'t fire me, please.\"  And so on and so on.\n\nMaybe Dan still works for Little Cesar\\'s<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6kx439q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.04253,32.955979]}},{"properties":{"name":"North County Soccer Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/girl_n_boy.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/vip7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/misc_soccerfield.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 14530 Espola Rd.

(summer c. 2000)\n\nI visibly slacked, I stole food, I trained people wrong on purpose, I called in sick excessively and I clocked in and left to go to class for full shifts.\n\nThe best thing about this job was that I stole huge amounts of food so I never had to go grocery shopping.  Every day, I drank fresh squeezed orange juice out of the carton.\n\nI played crazy “unlistenable” experimental music when all the customers were trying to study.\n\nEvery day, I gave stuff away to people I didn’t even know.\n\nEventually, my reputation was ruined and I was cut to two three hour shifts and one two hour shift per week.\n\nI pissed in the walk in freezer and watched its daily progression into a yellow block of ice.\n\nI felt bad when aforementioned ice was defrosted by the only half cool manager.  This new manager came and I had to chill out because he was too cool to mess with.  This was after my post-museum company revelation that I was, more or less, a horrible person, so I just worked way less but was still equally unreliable.\n\nFinally, after a night of excessive drinking, I woke up at 5am to puke all over myself in the shower while getting ready to open the café.  I called in sick but they told me to never come back so I fell back into bed.\n\nLater that day I called a friend for help because I was so hung over I thought I was going to die.

He said (for real), \"Hey little dudes, they just laid some fresh crete\\' up in the business park and were gonna be the first people to shred it, hop in!\"\n\nWe had no idea who this old dude was.  Actually, we were kind of scared of him.  He was all sun burned and not wearing a shirt.  His board was about 10 years old and he was drinking a tall boy of Bud but he told us he was taking us to a skate spot so we all jumped in.\n\nI rode up front.  The old dude\\'s name was Randy.  Randy was a \"shredder\" in his days.  He could rock Berts and layback grinds and bust bonelesses like the old pros.  randy took us to the Poway Banks the first day they were ridable.\n\nI found out later that Randy was waiting and keeping the banks a secret.  He wanted to be the first person to ride the banks alone.  When we got there, the powder was still freshly laid over the dry concrete.  After randy took his maiden run to Metallica \"Master of Puppets\" blairing out of his truck, we all got in there.  The concrete was smoother than anything I have ever felt.  We all ruined our boards from the powder but this was a virgin skatespot and you only get these like once if ever.\n\nFor the next 4 years this was our new spot.  Randy came back sometimes.  Randy was a good guy, he told me he just wanted to \"pass the torch.\"  While he was busting out with some amazing frontside layback grinds, we were busting head high ollies out of the banks but everyone was happy.\n\nUnfortunately, after 4 years of being vacant, the building was leased to a trucking company and the days are rare that any bank is skatable.  Originally, the spot had 3 sets of 4\\' banks with grindable curbs andsweet spots to ollie out of that could boost you head high or bigger.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6ogrwas"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.051344,32.937018]}},{"properties":{"name":"RB Inn","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/078c456e0be3fb8431dc91bccf60045e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 17550 Bernardo Oaks Dr. San Diego, CA 92128The thirteenth job I was fired from.\n\n The Rancho Bernardo Inn.

I drove the golf carts down hills and pulled e-brake slides almost flipping the carts.  I also crashed into various things on purpose including the security gate in the front which I totally demolished, and finally took out a fence, and a tree after drinking on the job in the rain and told them the brakes stopped working.\n\nWhile working valet I accidentally drove a BMW M3 into a fence and took a Porsche 911 twin turbo out for a test drive.  Upone my triumphant return from the test drive, I was told that I would be fired if this was ever attempted again.\n\nI routinely fought with the weird wannabe cop security guards and generally caused trouble by breaking stuff, stealing and not doing any real work until I was told I could \"quit\" and retain my right to a recommendation.\n\nI ended up being traded to all these different departments.

She would incessantly complain that she couldn’t ever get laid to me after yelling at me like I was supposed to do something to help her with her hideousness.\n\nI took smoke breaks in the customer bathroom, I stole tons food and candles so I didn’t have to go to the store just because they told me that it was impossible to steal from them because we were being constantly monitored.\n\nI broke things on purpose.\n\nI told the managers I would do things and then didn’t on purpose.\n\nI broke and stole expensive items on purpose, and generally pretended to work for two months without ever really working (I actually never got my uniform dirty with food).\n\nBy the end I was totally alienated from everyone except for these two other employees who told me that I was an inspiration to them.  But every other 30ish employee with no education, no talent, and no lives hated me especially because I told them that trying to be an actor in L.A. was a waste of time and that all the people who were here to make it big were really just going to end up as permanent servers.  I wished them all luck with their acting careers and auditions anyways.\n\nThe only other person who liked me there was the old Japanese chef because he hated all the stupid people there as much as I did.  He only respected me because I refused to bow to him and because I was openly rude to all the \"actors.\"\n\nHe would make all the employees bow to him and they all would.  When he told me to bow to him, I told him to give me a reason to.  He told me that I should bow to him because he was the senior chef.  I told him to bow to me because I was a food runner.\n\nSomehow he understood what I meant and we became smoking partners.  I used to get to work, eat food I wasn’t supposed to eat, drink tea I wasn’t supposed to drink, take cigarette breaks I wasn’t supposed to take, and then when the other people got there they would do all the sidework I was supposed to have done and complain to the managers that I didn’t do anything for the hour I was there before them.\n\nBecause all of the tips were pooled I would sit in back all night and act like I was polishing silverware so I could smoke more but never do any work.\n\nI was really depressed at this time so in true cliché fashion I would just sit outside and stare at the ground smoking until someone would yell at me.\n\nIt is funny that this went on for two full months before they figured out I wasn’t ever going to actually work.  One night Trish called me in during finals and I refused to come.  She told me that a bus boy walked out and she wanted me to fill in for him.  I told her I was not going to throw away a UCLA education to work at some yuppie shithole so she fired me.\n\nFive minuets later another manager called me back to beg me not to quit.  I told him to fuck off, hung up on him and came in the next day during the busiest time of the night dressed like shit to demand my paycheck.\n\nThis was probably the worst place I have ever worked.  The clientele was completely comprisedd of rich kids with their parents Credit Cards that did not know how to tip and hollywood fakers trying to make you think they were the real deal.  However, anyone who was anyone would never eat at a trendy dive shithole like this \"American Japanese Fusion\" restaurant.

He told me that he saw it on the Gap\\'s \"no stealing\" training video and that there was no way that they would suspect someone of using a method taught to them by their own \"no stealing\" video.  He finally did get caught but only after making enough money to buy a really fancy car alarm, a show quality stereo for his car, some super fancy talking radar detector, a custom tint job on the windows, full racing suspension, 17\" imported Japanese racing rims, HKS exhaust, AEM cold air intake, a custom Fuba antenna, color matching with shaved moldings, special headlights and he even bought some pimped out tropical style black lacquer salt water fish tank and bed set for his room, so by the time they fired him he didn\\'t care anyway. \n\nAt one point I was put in charge of the changing rooms and instantly called everyone I knew, even people I didn\\'t really like that much, to bring their friends and come take as much stuff as they wanted for free while I was working.\n\nI took all of the manager\\'s training manuals and sold them to my friend who wanted them for reseach he was doing towards a business degree.\n\nThe managers would search you as you left so it just made this task more fun.  One time the manager asked me what the folder was for and I said school even though I am positive she knew it was one of her training manuals.  A few weeks after I took all of the folders and videos, she asked me if I had seen them and I told her I had no idea what they were or where they kept them in the first place.  I saw her go and ask someone else after that so I knew they had no idea who did it.\n\nI also corrupted another manager at this store by talking him into buying cigarettes with money out of the register and smoking them even though his girlfriend made him promise on their relationship to quit forever.  I later talked him into taking lunch on company money and company time for two hours at a fancy Mexican restaurant with multiple margaritas when we had to drive some stuff up to another store in L.A. even though they gave us a 100 dollar bill said to bring back all change and receipts for all the stuff we bought.  We didn\\'t bring back change or receipts but we ate three meals, shopped at two different 99 cent stores, bought all the candy we could ever want at a candy store in the L.A. mall and drank a bunch of margaritas in under 8 hours.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6hr0962"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.066107,33.071261]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Museum Company","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/mccombined.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 272 East Via Rancho Parkway Escondido CA 92025The fifteenth job I was fired from.\n\nThe Museum Company.

The whole park was a snake run with a corner that had some nipples and another bowl that was half filled with dirt.  It was rough with potholes and the transitions were totally lumpy.  The concrete was like sandpaper and if you fell on it, there would be a visible mark where you had deposited skin.  Periodically some crazy gangsters would drive up in a huge white van and all the skaters would scatter.  If you got caught, they jacked all your stuff.  There was a liquor store down the street a little with 40s and soda for under a dollar.  As little kids in the 80s, we would ride the bus down or get a ride with older skaters, cross the border and skate to the park, which not unlike San Diego, was illegal.  However, if you got caught in T.J. 0 would get you off.  Once, when we showed up there, the owner Julian was getting married.  We got to hang out at the wedding, party with everyone in the wedding party and skate into the night.  The locals at this park were amazing.  They rode totally dilapidated boards at about 90mph launching over humps and into bowls.  (Note: this is actually a map to the border.  Although there is a new T.J. park under the gigantic flag, this park has been sadly dozed).  Memorable video parts by Matt Hensley and Doug Smith depict this amazing lost spot.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6sdbj2e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.040443,32.517579]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trader Joe's Rancho Palos Verdes","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/tjtardos.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/trader_joes.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/2006_03_traderjoes.jpg\">28901 S Western Ave. Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275(the eleventh job I was kinda fired from).\n\nc.1995\n\nWhen I was in my senior year in high school, I was interning at Plan B skateboards under the supervision of Mike Ternasky, Carl Hyndman and Dave Andrecht.  Upon graduating they hired me on full time.  Growing up in San Diego, this was it for me.  I was ready to work here diligently for the rest of my life.  I was now getting free product, including full clothing and I had complete art supplies at my fingertips 24 hours a day, 7 days a week—not to mention a ramp to skate in our office.  When I say full art supplies, I mean it too—from a darkroom, to paints, pens and etc… to full on video editing equipment and cameras galore.  I also got to be around the best pro skateboarders in the industry all day every day and it was my job to film them, photograph them and to create logos and artwork for them.\n\nThis was my dream job and I spent every day I worked there happy and content.  After being there for a little while, I was promoted and promoted again.  My last promotion was to become one of the head video photographers and to take on more team management tasks.\n\nThe first big management thing I did was to have all the riders fly in from their home cities to one hub and to then arrive as a team in Vancouver for the 1994 Vancouver Skateboarding Championships.  It went over fairly well and when Mike Ternasky (M.T.) came home from the trip we were supposed to have a meeting that Monday about a pay raise and more responsibilities.\n\nI was really excited about it to the point that I got to work an hour early to prepare to commit myself to M.T. for however long he was willing to work with a loser kid like me.  This is a guy who took me from a mediocre high school art kid with no chance of going to college or getting a good job, to interning for him folding clothes and shipping product under skateboarding legend Dave Andrecht, to assistant art directing under super talented Carl Hyndman, to being a video photographer for one of the most legendary skateboard filmmakers in the history of skateboarding to date—M.T. himself.\n\nHowever, on the way to work, and our subsequent meeting, M.T. was hit by an 80-year-old woman looking over her shoulder while running a red light.  It was on a blind corner.  The woman was speeding.  Mike never saw her.  He left behind a 7-month pregnant wife and a whole crew of people that would have done anything for him.  He was the most important person ever in my life.  He was the only person who truly believed in me.  And he was someone who I had idolized since I met him during the H-Street days at the H-Street house near school W (in my skatelandias map).\n\nImmediately after he died, his wife Mary, asked me to help fly in and pick up the massive amount of people that came to his funeral and to console Mary.  I kept it together the best I could between having parents who didn’t care or understand and a girlfriend who thought that Mike’s death was taking away from my time with her.  However, after the funeral, I just lost it.  I stopped working altogether and soon, I just returned all my equipment to Plan B.  It seemed like the company would not go on and I had completely lost my will to live.\n\nNevertheless, I still had to make rent, so to make ends meet, I got a job first at souplantation (job #10), which was subsequently a disaster.  Between my family not supporting me and having a horrible girlfriend, I just couldn’t keep it together any longer.  I was getting really deep into street racing at the time and I had some friends in L.A. who lived in San Pedro right near the Brotherhood Raceway on Terminal Island and another group of friends in L.A.’s Koreatown.\n\nMy friends in Pedro had recently been in a crash that killed another one of my friends only days after M.T. died—Chris Amon.  Chris was racing a girl who ran him into a pole when he lost to her.  She cut him off while giving him the finger.  Chris’ body crushed my friend Jon and his girlfriend Vanessa’s legs in the back seat.  They were in Pedro trying to walk again and felt that I would be in a good place if I came up to be with them while they were rehabilitating themselves.\n\nI was a real mess when I got up there but living with these friends helped realize that life was not over and that I could go on.  We took long walks through Del Amo mall, we went to the track and raced our cars and I took on two jobs to pull my weight.  I was working at the Carson Swap Meet selling children’s clothes while my friend Min sold chipped phones out of the back and I got a job at Trader Joe’s.\n\nAt Trader Joe’s I worked with an assortment of rejects like me.  We all kind of made each other feel better and we talked constantly about moving on from where we were at in life.  I worked with a stone butch dyke saving money to move to SF with her girlfriend where she planned on transitioning.  I worked with a tattoo covered cholo who had gotten shot in the gut and lost some internal organs.  He walked with a limp from another bullet he took in the thigh when he was in high school.  He was taking classes at the local JC and wanted to get a degree in criminal justice.  His brother was gunned down under a mile from the Trader Joe’s while we were working.  He was playing ball and waiting for my co-worker to get off work.  He got in an argument over a bet placed on the game.  The other people left and came back shooting.  I worked with a goth girl left over from the goth/rave Jane’s Addiction L.A. world that had crumbled.  She was unhappy with her boyfriend and would steal his smokes for me.  He smoked Kools.  We would take breaks together and she would plan her break up with him every day, and every day after, she would come back with a fresh pack of his Kools to offer me for my listening skills.\n\nPretty soon after staring there, the manager, who in essence was a really nice guy, realized that I was messed up and that he made a mistake hiring me.  The sad thing is, I was actually trying hard to do well but I was so depressed and so poor at the same time, that I couldn’t do a good job.\n\nAt first, I literally had to steal food from there to eat.  I let my roommates come in and load up a cart.  I would then only charge them for a few things and let them go.  I would eat out of the food on the floor and take food on breaks with me that was un-purchased.\n\nSoon after that, I started having a smoke when I brought in carts, then two smokes, finally it was taking me close to an hour to bring in the carts.  When questioned, I told the managers that I had a bad back and that I could not push more than one cart at a time.\n\nMy register was off everyday.  I never took a cent out of the register, I tried my hardest but it was off every day.  They took me off the register.  I started stocking.  I was too slow at stocking.  They put me in the freezer and would only let me out to do register for an hour or two when the other people went to lunch or on break.\n\nI smoked in the freezer, ate food in the freezer, put away about a gallon of orange juice on average a day in the freezer.  The fans made it so no one could smell the smoke.  The freezing temperatures made it so no one checked on me.  I was happy in the freezer.  I was alone in the freezer.  I could sit around in the freezer.  I could work at my own pace in the freezer.\n\nWhen I would get called in to do the register, I would try to do a good job but not too good because I didn’t want that job all over again, so I worked slow.  8 hours at a register does not work for me.  I cannot do it no matter how good I try to be.  Unfortunately, I could not even do an hour at the register perfectly.  At the time, Trader Joe’s had these old style registers that didn’t do any math for you.  I was really bad at math back then.  I never even did pre-algebra in high school.  I would be 5 cents off one day.  I would be 20 cents off another day.  Each time it would kill me to be off.  The manager would reprimand me and I would genuinely feel bad.  The manager would send me back into the freezer and I would put on the freezer gear and go back into my well-stocked snow cave and think, “fuck everything” or “no one understands me.”  I was sure I was the first person to feel this way and that besides Bukowski, everyone else in Pedro couldn’t feel what I feel when I say I am in pain.\n\nThis went on for about 3 months.  I would get there at opening, stock the isles.  Then, later on I would stock the freezer, take in some carts, cover registers for people’s breaks, take my patented 30 minute 15 minute breaks and hour long 30 minute lunches.  Finally, I would get reprimanded for all my daily failures.  I got used to this routine.  The managers got used to this routine.  No hard feelings.\n\nRight at the end of summer, one of the managers asked to see me outside.  I figured I was up for one of my daily reprimands and thought nothing of it.  I was still numb from M.T. dying.  I still didn’t have what it took to go on but I was going on day by day with nothing really pushing me forward other than the need to pay rent and eat.  The manager was the nice one.  He was a good guy.  I liked him as far as managers went.  I never really broke anything or did anything too messed up because I liked him so much.  At this point, my only crime was grazing off of the food and letting my friends walk off with some free food.  The manager told me that in the hour I was working the register that it was under 00.  He sent me home on suspension.\n\nI was devastated.  I have never stolen money from anyone.  I am totally guilty of screwing around, breaking things, eating the food on a job, taking long breaks and other stuff but I never steal money out of the register.  I don’t know why.  People have Pmed me to tell me I am an asshole for all the things I do on jobs.  Other people have Pmed me to tell me I am a genius for the things I do on jobs.  Regardless, there is a line I do not cross.  I never outright steal out of the register.\n\nWhen I got home, I got more and more depressed.  I thought about Mike.  I thought about my parents.  I thought about my 23-year-old ex-girlfriend who was now dating some 15-year-old boy with a kid already.  I thought about working at the Carson Swap Meet selling children’s clothes as a front for all this wannabe gangster shit.  I thought about racing my stupid car.  Finally, I started thinking about some kind of future but I couldn’t see one.  I felt all weird and crazy.  My roommates were out of town.  I had to get out of the apartment, so I drove up to my friend’s place in Koreatown.\n\nWhen I got up there, my friends knew I was upset and they decided to take me on a special date.  They took me to play pool.  They gave me a chipped cell phone, so I could call my best friend Justin.  They bought me dinner at Sizzler because to them, Sizzler was fancy healthy food and they thought it would make me feel better.  Even though I couldn’t eat anything at Sizzler, it did make me feel better.  We saw a movie at City Walk.\n\nNevertheless, when they all went to sleep I hit bottom.  I looked out the window.  It was pretty soon after the riots and L.A. wasn’t looking so hot.  Koreatown was still pretty burned out and there was absolutely no shortage of empty apartments.  My friends had a 1-bedroom corner top floor apartment in the Du Berry near 5th and Vermont.  I looked down in the alley and thought about jumping off.  There was a homeless guy shooting heroin sitting on an old discarded mattress below me.  I watched him shoot up and then lay back on the mattress, the needle still bobbing in his forearm.  I thought about how I would probably land on him, or near him.  I thought about all the other homeless dudes down there finding me splatted on top of this guy with a needle still in his arm and I thought about them checking my pockets and stealing my Adidas and my only good outfit.  I went back to the couch and played some streetfighter.\n\nThe following Monday, the manager at Trader Joe’s called me up in the morning and asked me to come in around noon.  When I got there, he told me I would be paid for the whole day and all the days I had missed.  He told me that another manager had taken the 00 out of my register right after I was done using it, did a drop, forgot to record it and went on a 4 day vacation.  The other manager came out and apologized.  They told me that besides the 00, I was only 3 cents off.  The general manager asked me to come back to work the next day.  I told them I couldn’t.  I said that it was wrong the way they treated me like I had stolen money from the register and that I couldn’t work there if that was standard procedure.  They still felt bad and paid me another full week.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6h8w006"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.309287,33.754234]}},{"properties":{"name":"UCLA Arts Library","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/144967lr.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 405 Hilgard Avenue 90095The nineteenth job I was (kinda) fired from.\n\nThe UCLA Arts Library.  (summer c. 2001)\n\nThis was my crowning achievement and my biggest failure.\n\nI pushed it further at this job than at any other job.  I never got to work under fifteen minuets late, some days I would come in an hour late.\n\nI barely worked.  My fucking around to work ration was 1:10… for every 1 work thing I did I would check my email, surf the web, talk to the cool librarian Alan, or my cool boss Dawn, get food, drink tea in the 8th floor gallery, go to the Wright gallery and just aimlessly walk around campus.\n\nI also reprogrammed the computers so that if you search certain catch phrases that I think are funny you will get all of these unrelated serials and monographs.  I also changed the search engine results so that if you search for something I think is lame you get unrelated links.\n\nI figured out how to clock in and out from my home computer with admin. passwords.\n\nI never did my job right on purpose, so that I could have more time to read books.  If there was 10 steps to a job I would do whatever the bare minimum was, and then I could read books all day.\n\nI spent a whole summer working like this on a big grant that was basically set for me to sit in the cage and catalogue artists books.  for any competent person, this task could be broken up into a couple of serious hours of work in one 8 hour work day.\n\nI would also go into the stacks and read for hours.\n\nThe reason why this was such a failure is that the boss knew all of this and she never fired me because I was still getting all my work done.  This made me feel horrible because I was such a shitty employee and I just hid and read all of the time but I felt guilty because it was some sort of student job dichotomy where you could get away with murder as long as you got your work done.\n\nThere was a whole quarter where I wouldn’t talk to anyone and I took every Friday off even though I was scheduled to work.\n\nI don’t know, I just feel that the people there put up with me being some eccentric asshole and that I owe something to them because the boss was so nice and I am such a piece of shit.\n\nAt almost all of the other 20 jobs they fired me, or told me I had to quit but every time they found a drawing on a wall or a defaced magazine, or graffiti in the bathroom… … … they would just tell me I was a weirdo and left it at that.\n\nShit, I should have fired myself.  Instead I just feel really bad that they all thought I was a really good artist or something.  I don’t think that.  I think I am a huge fraud.  They even threw me a huge going away party when I had to leave because I graduated.  I actually started to cry becuse they were all really nice to me and I was just an asshole.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6pjt6bd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.44098,34.075821]}},{"properties":{"name":"UCLA bookstore","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/bz_stacks.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/bz_stacks_2_.jpg\">Besides aquiring all of my books for school here while I was at UCLA, I like to go here and chill especially when I am in some kind of crisis to remind myself of the good ol days.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6jbw5f4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.44474,34.07033]}},{"properties":{"name":"Webb Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/b48fc46ae1981af1495f6c56901306bc.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Avena Pl &amp; Bernardo Center Dr San Diego, Ca 92128This was my local spot growing up.

I had the most amazing experience of skating with Matt Hensley here for the first time when he was still an AM.  He busted consistent backside lipslides down the banked ledges and other things that blew my 14 year old 1989 mind.  This spot was demolished and is now (literally) a grassed in sidewalk but before it was destroyed, there were banked and flat ledges, banked walls, gaps, walls to drops, stairs banked curbs, benches and basically everything else the DC skateplaza now has.  We could put concrete benches going down stairs and no one would move them ever.  From 1988 to 1995 I was never busted here.

They also support local zines and mini-comics not to mention housing Jordan Crane\\'s amazingness.\n\nFurther features include having a nice gallery in back and have had shows by people like Rene French when not a lot of people knew of her total genius yet—not to mention the full floor to above-your-head MARVEL and DC walls (yes WALLS).\n\nPlease go there if you are in LA, even if only to lose yourself for a few good hours.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6p1gd5y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.353385,34.098042]}},{"properties":{"name":"midgetville la jolla","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/mount_soledad_01.jpg\">when I was in 8th grade I was a good enough skateboarder to ride with high school kids.  High school kids had cars.  So at a very young age I was driving around with a bunch of skaters and their girlfriends in SD.  One night, a friend at the time decided to take some of us, including his girlfriend and her friends up to so-called \"midgetville\" in La Jolla.  Because I was in 8th grade I completelty believed that there was such a place that was built for people who were in the film \"The Wizard of Oz.\"  The version of the story I heard was that as payment for the film, the people who acted in the film were given a community that was built for little people.  There were perilous bridges we were going to have to cross and angry people who would throw rocks for entering their miniature sanctuary but we were brave and we swore we saw some mini-trashcans.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6e8hsn2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.26168,32.84943]}},{"properties":{"name":"questhaven","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/facility_friendshiphouse.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/facility_canta.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/trails2.jpg\">20560 Questhaven Rd. Escondido, CA, USA 92029Along the same lines as midgetville, there was a satanic colony in Escondido that had supernatural roads.  For example, my friend Gregg claimed that he went from one side of the 78 freeway to the other side of the freeway without ever seeing the freeway.  He claimed this was because of the Oak Tree tunnel effect created by the towering trees and that the Satanists had created this effect to entrap people.  Luckily, Gregg made it out alive to warn us, or to get us to go.  Still in 8th grade, still good enough to skate with the older kids, still hated and teased at my jr. high even though I was hella cool, I got picked up by my friends to go to Questhaven after school on Halloween.  We drove to where a bunch of people thought it was.  Everyone had a different idea.  Finally we found the road.  we drove up the road.  There was a man with a hoe and a hose standing at a \"gothic\" gate.  We could see all the satanic buildings off in the distance through the evil twisted trees.  All the buildings were very evil and jutting out in crazy sharp angles.  The man yelled at us.  I think he knew what we were about.  He chased us a little.  We tried to squirt him with the windshield wipers but his satanic powers were too great for us, so we yelled obscenities while doing an 8 point turn to get the hell out of there.  then we got lost in the wilderness.  The man had put a satanic curse on us for sure.  We came out near the beach but we never crossed any of the normal roads.  Satan.  Satan for sure.\n\nYears later, when I had gone back to college, I was studying with a really smart girl in this philosophy of religion class.  we had a project coming up and I asked her where she wanted to work on it.  My house was a punk rock flop house, so it was out.  She said at her place, we could use the community room.  I asked her where it was and she gave me general directions.  When she said Questhaven, I said, \"Isn\\'t that place run by Satanists?\"  Stupid, stupid.  She was kind of bummed but used to it I guess.  She told me that it had never been run by Satanists and that it was always a christian mystical retreat.  She had grown up there.  I told her I would come.\n\nLater that day, I went skating with some friends and told them where I was going.  They told me that was how people were lured in.  They told me I would be brain washed into being a Satanist for sure.  I was kind of scared but I went...at night.\n\nThe drive there was creepy but different from how I remembered it being like years before.  It was actually pretty easy to get to and the \"gothic\" gate was actually a 50\\'s modernist design, as were all of the buildings and the predominantly Eames and Bauhaus furniture inside the buildings.  The people there were nice and offered me food and drinks.  The room we worked in had a nice fire going, it was comfortable and quiet.\n\nWhen I left, I found my way right back to the freeway and I got home easily.  I later told the girl that I felt dumb but that I grew up with stories about goat sacrifices and killings from Questhaven.  She told me that, unfortunately, she did too.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6tkbmkl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.166157,33.090883]}},{"properties":{"name":"san Pasqual High","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/tws_vid.jpg\">3300 Bear Valley Parkway, Escondido, CA 92025In the 90s, this was a skate mecca.

I would be more inclined to call this a comic gallery that sells comics.  You do have some of the standards but this place offers more \"high end\" comic fare and indie/small press offerings.  The guys who run it are nice (for comic store owners) and they support local work.  However, they also have some serious knowledge and put on really good art shows.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6twlhv5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.27904,34.091052]}},{"properties":{"name":"skylight books","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/getty_ditwl_bookstore_owner_20041030_3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/link_skylight.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/lucywindow2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/CB&amp;TMPGL.jpg\">1818 N. Vermont Avenue, los angelesFor this map, I limited my choices to 3 comic stores.  Meltdown comics is the biggest and the best for comics.  Secret Headquarters is the snobbiest and most galleryesque comic store.  However, Skylight Books is my favorite.\n\nSkylight Books has a hand picked comic section and the largest zine selection in LA.  They also specialize in small press literature.  Those are basically 3 of my favorite things besides bikes and coffee.\n\nIf you don\\'t know anything about comics, you can just pick something out of Skylight\\'s selection and it will be good.  If you know everything about comics, Skylight\\'s selection is small yet, picked by someone who seriously knows their stuff.  Further, they are the biggest supporter in LA of mini-comics and zines.  The guy in charge of indie and DIY press has been doing this as long as I have been putting out zines (or longer) and besides being amazingly cool, has knowledge of what is happening without the troll aspect found in every other comic dweller spot.\n\nLast, there are rarely comic trolls in the store, which is a relief.  My least favorite comic store is on the westest side of LA.  Just walking by the place gives you the sense of what I am talking about, most notably from the olfactory region.  On a recent visit to “the other side of town.”  The B.O. smell was overpowering to even my girlfriend, who can’t usually smell anything and there was fresh vomit blocking the front façade.  Although I find such scenes romantic as a comic nerd, I would much rather a well picked selection of the very best in mainstream and indie comics in a bookstore environment with a nice orange tabby to keep me company while I browse (who is especially fond of scratches in the chin).\n\nOverall, Skylight Books is simply the best all around bookstore in LA.\n\nLast, I HATE Los Feliz but I come here all the time just to go to this bookstore.  At all times, I avoid Los Feliz if possible but I find myself making trips to this store regardless.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6iajokx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.291631,34.103943]}},{"properties":{"name":"souplantation","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\" href=\"http://www.jamesinger.com\">Jamesinger</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/a55faf7e50083abe74cf7515649de34b.jpg\">17210 Bernardo Center Dr. San Diego, CA 92128The tenth job I was fired from.\n\nSouplantation.  (beginning of summer c. 1995)\n\nI got fired after I called the manager 5 minuets before I was supposed to work and told him my car wouldn\\'t start but that I thought I could get it running, and to not start without me, pushed the snooze button, waited 15 minuets, called back, telling the same manager, who had subsequently yelled at me the day before while turning all red and spitting in my face, that I got my car started, not to start baking without me, and that I would be there in 15 minuets, and be ready to open on time no problem. I never came in (rumor had it they couldn\\'t open the soups or baked goods for 1 hr because of this on a Sunday, the busiest day, remember it\\'s called souplantation).\n\nI still went in the Monday after and demanded my paycheck. I told them that if they were going to fire me that they had to give it to me by law and they did right there.  They gave me a hand written check on the spot.  I think it was just to get me out of the restaurant forever though.\n\nI lied to get the job in the first place and I am sure they knew it.  I told them I had a bunch of experience cooking at all these restaurants that had unfortunately closed down.  They were stupid or desperate enough to hire me as a cook with prep cooks under me.  I told the prep cooks that they knew what to do and that as long as everything got done how it was supposed to I didn\\'t care what the hell they did.  I am pretty sure they did what they were supposed to do because I never got yelled at about them, they just thought I was funny as hell and would help me out because I was the only one in there that didn\\'t treat them like shit.\n\nthe problem was, I got yelled at for everything else besides my prep cooks.\n\nWhen they claim a muffin is born there every minute in their stupid commercials they mean it.  I was supposed to cook like some kind of madman and I had no idea how to cook anything but Mac and Chee so I just grabbed the recipes and went for it.  Everything turned out okay but it was more or less a total disaster everyday with shit constantly running out and burning or coming out undercooked or stuff was at the wrong temperature or some shit like that.\n\nIt all culminated when they gave me a really bad 3-month review and told me that a manager, this weird psychopathic Joe, was assigned to get me in shape.  He was some really serious skinny kid a few years older than me who, instead of going to college, wanted to manage souplantaions forever because he could pay off his mustang 5.0 with chrome rims and a big stereo that way.\n\nJoe would scream at me all the time and like a Zen master, I would just say okay and not do whatever it was he told me to do.  I finally snapped and decided to never show up again on the busiest day of the week.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62tj6k7uflu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.074916,33.02611]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/226024","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jamesinger","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jamesinger","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/226024","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":37,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=226024,platial:user=jamesinger","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":31081}
