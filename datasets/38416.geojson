Over the past decade, the press has written repeatedly on the practice of burying St. Joseph statues upside down to help sell homes.  The location of some articles and blog posts are shown on the maps with selected pull quotes, and others will be added on an ongoing basis. \n\nWhile some ask whether the practice is superstitious, others are devoted to it.  The St. Joe 2.0 map is open to both communities of thought.  \n\nTo those who promote the practice or are experimenting with it (estimates run from &amp;quot;hundreds of thousands&amp;quot; to two million households annually), we invite you to add the location of your home to the map, including photos, links to listing, and most importantly, your personal experience.  We are particularly interested in thoughtful reflections of your experience from a spiritual perspective, rather than the specific results of your real estate transaction.  (Those who have experienced some form of divine intervention in the past are also invited to map the location of the home you bought or sold and share your story.)\n\nTo those who think the practice of burying St. Joseph statues upside-down is &amp;quot;misguided,&amp;quot; we invite you to help recreate a more meaningful ritual or expression of faith consistent with &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.osjspm.org/major_themes.aspx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Catholic Social Teachings&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; and to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://realestatecafe.blogs.com/real_estate_cafe/2007/03/creating_a_real_1.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;share ideas&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://realestatecafe.blogs.com/million_dollar_march/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;initiatives&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with us.

According to the executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/12/01/an_elusive_goal_in_aids_battle/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;orphaned children remain the most orphaned element&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of the global AIDS response. The UN estimates that there will be 20 million children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS by 2010, and only 3 to 5 percent of these children receive any care and support.&amp;quot;\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the ultimate goal of this interactive map is to create a meeting place for those who believe spirituality and spiritual practice, from every faith tradition, have a place in real estate; and to share the diversity of those expressions on an interactive map which reflect our collective geography of faith or our spiritual home.\n\nBetween March 19th and May 1st, the two Catholic feast days devoted to St. Joseph, we invite:\n\n(1)  Boggers to link their posts to the map: and \n\n(2)  Religious bookstores and websites who sell St. Joseph to place a link, banner ad, or Widget on your website.  (Better yet, post a regional version of this map to your site, so your clients can add the location of their home and personal testimony using photos, audio, or video directly to the map); and\n\n(3)  Fellow &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://realestatecafe.blogs.com/real_estate_cafe/2007/03/march_1st_2007_.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;real estate philanthropists&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (like &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.realtyBridge.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;RealtyBridge.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.donateatclosing.org&amp;quot;&amp;gt;DonateAtClosing.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) who can use the St. Joe 2.0 map to invite millions of home buyers and sellers to &amp;quot;give a percent  of the proceeds from your sale&amp;quot; to a charitable cause as recommended by Author Stephen Binz in his book, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://catalog.americancatholic.org/product.aspx?prodid=T55361&amp;amp;pcat=73&amp;quot;&amp;gt;St. Joseph, My Real Estate Agent&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (see page 111).\n\nTo help everyone get started, we've set Platial's new Slider to automatically locate existing churches, hospitals, schools, and other places which use the keyword: &amp;quot;St. Joseph.&amp;quot;\n\nContact &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://realestatecafe.blogs.com/about-the-real-estate-cafe.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The Real Estate Cafe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; at realestatecafe [at] gmail [dot] com for more details, or call us at 617-661-4046.\n\n\n&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;NEWS FLASH:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;  Special thanks to Inman News for their article:  &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.inman.com/inmannews.aspx?ID=62574&amp;quot;&amp;gt;'St. Joe 2.0' samples the many forms of faith&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

I don\\'t consider it blasphemous or superstitious; I actually do believe it works.  2 million or so St. Joseph statues sell each year and I gather many of them end up buried.

An order of nuns, needing more land for a convent, buried their St. Joseph medals in the ground. They got the land, and word spread. The medals eventually turned into statues, and Joseph, a carpenter, who with Jesus and Mary makes up the Holy Family, became the unofficial saint of real estate.\nThe church takes no formal position on the statues — \"It is not official church practice,\" said Terrence Donilon, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Boston. \"It is more of a personal tradition for some people.\"br&gt;\nBut Angele Fillion, a clerk at the St. Joseph the Worker Shrine, calls the practice akin to voodoo.br&gt;\n\"It’s not the statue, it’s the faith that makes it work,\" said Fillion, who said she frequently has to restrain herself from coming on too strong about the importance of prayer to troubled homeowners who enter the shop looking for the statues — and little else.\n\nFULL TEXT:  See link below<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68h7rl3bgmd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.04772,42.314337]}},{"properties":{"name":"Contra Costa Times: Pope not winning popularity contest","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://Twitter.com/realestatecafe\" href=\"http://Twitter.com/realestatecafe\">Realestatecafe</a>2640 Shadelands Dr, Walnut Creek, CA 94598Pope not winning popularity contest\n3/17/07\nPull quote:\nIt was a typical weekday afternoon at the Long Island Catholic Supply store in Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y.
