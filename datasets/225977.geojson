The Peregrine Falcon gave a little difficulty to ID. It was in a leafless tree about 25 meters away and stayed for a at least 15 minutes to allow for good observations. At first it was believed to be a Merlin because there was a small supercilliary stripe but it had the mask-like markings in the face like a Peregrine. The banding on the tail was more like the Peregrine than the Merlin. Also, it seemed bigger than a Merlin but did not appear as big as a Peregrine. In the end it was concluded that it was an immature (1st Yr.) Peregrine Falcon. The reference book used was the \"Birds of the West Indies\" by Herb. Raffaele (small paper-back version). This book seemed a little deficient in its illustrations. This was mostly an identification session for Zahra and so numbers of birds were not noted, only presence absence. Also, Jamaican Euphonias were heard but not seen and Zahra insisted they not be added to the list.","month collected":3,"time observations started":7.08,"time interval ended":null,"coordinates
