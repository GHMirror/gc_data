The document contains 7 worksheets, including information about the template, instructions on using the template, notes related to revisions of the template, Resource provider information, the data, a field list (data mapping view) and a worksheet with vocabularies for use in populating the spreadsheet (data valid terms). Each feature in an active fault data set (row in this spreadsheet) should be characterized by a unique combination of name, URI, geologic history, slip, locatability and orientation properties, as well as being physically connected or inferred to be connected in the Earth. For mapped active faults ,which are the scope of this scheme, the deformation style is assumed to be brittle (as opposed to ductile). Fields in the data table include FeatureURI, Name, FullName, ParentFeatureURI, Label, Description, Symbol, OtherID, SpecificationURI, FeatureType, GeologicHistory, RepresentativeAgeURI, YoungerAgeURI, OlderAgeURI, IntervalSinceMovement, Shape, ObservationMethod, PositionAccuracyMeters, PositionAccuracy, Displacement, SlipRate, SlipAccumulationInterval, MovementType, MovementSense, DipDirection, DateMostRecentEvent, RecurrenceInterval, TotalSlip, Source and MetadataURI.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"http://catalog.usgin.org/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid={B7F5A26B-A7FF-4B5E-A788-705BFC0BEBCE}","contact_name":"Celia Coleman","contact_address":"        Office \r\n        416 W.
