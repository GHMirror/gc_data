Erie, OntarioOriginally know as Bertie Hall, the museum was built in 1835. The basement extends deep into the bedrock and is said to contain a tunnel used by the underground railroad for smuggling slaves out of the US.\n\nThe tunnel is a bit of a mystery, but one with a tragic history. A young slave, escaping from the US, is said to have drowned when the rising tide flooded the tunnel. The youngest son of Captain Forsythe, who owned the building in the late 1800s, also drowned inside the tunnel. After that, Captain Forsythe bricked up the tunnel entrance.\n\nTo this day, no one has discovered where the opening may be.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cwgwrxijy0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.914826,42.931727]}},{"properties":{"name":"Buffalo Insane Asylum","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/01/1/buffstate.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 400 Forest Ave., Buffalo, NYSome say in the Richardson building (Buffalo Psychiatric Center) possible ghost or other paranormal events take place.

The battle lasted 6 hours, during which Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond\\'s troops successfully held off the American attack. There were over 1500 casualties.\n\nThe apparition of 5 soldiers, dressed in the Royal Scots uniform, have been seen limping across the battlefield to dissapear in the distance.

The journal of a young drummer boy, backed up with evidence from a late 20th century archeological excavatation, tells the tale of these apparitions. Apparently, during the final US occupation of the fort, American Sergeant Benjamin White was having his heavy beard shaved by a young Corporal when a British 24-pound canonball descended upon them. The canon ball severed the Corporal\\'s hands and the Seargent\\'s head.\n\nOther apparitions include that of a gentleman in a top-hat; a woman in the bunkhouse; a soldier in the mess hall; and an American soldier in the North corner of the fort.\n\nSheets on an antique bed within the fort are often found in dissaray, with pillows found tossed on the floor.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cwgwyad54z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.92255,42.893976]}},{"properties":{"name":"Genesee County Insane Asylum (Rolling Hills)","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/01/1/rollinghills.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 11001 Bethany Center Road East Bethany, NY 14054Bethany - Old Genesee County Home and Infirmary - The old county poor farm and insane asylum has had over 1,000 deaths documented on the property.

The murders, subsequent trial, and following trial by media became a cause célèbre. The fame of the incident has endured in American pop culture and criminology. Although Lizzie Borden was acquitted, she was at the time (and is to an extent today) widely believed to be guilty; no one else was ever arrested or tried, and she has remained notorious in American folklore.

After that, it served two short terms as a brewery then an Inn before becoming a radio station in the late 1930s.\n\nUnderground tunnels connect the carriage house with the main building, with one arm extending north to meet the river, and the other emerging by the river (where the current Burgoyne bridge stands). The tunnels originally played a large part in the Underground Railroad, and were later used by bootleggers during Prohibition. The tunnels were sealed over for safety reasons in 1967.\n\nSeveral apparitions have been reported, including that of a woman standing behind a chair in the waiting room (which is now a studio), and that of a man standing near one of the studio doors before vanishing.\n\nDoors have been known to open and close on their own. Chairs, cups, trophies, and other items are often moved by unseen hands.\n\nEmployees have repoted the feeling of something trying to block their movements, and the sounds of a crying baby in a boardroom on the 2nd floor have been reported.\n\nElectronic equipment has picked up and broadcast some rather unusual sounds, including a man laughing, a bell, and a breathy woman sighing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cwgx36fc0h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.247429,43.153941]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Fort Niagara","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/01/1/well.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> Po Box 169, Youngstown, NYInside the castle is a well which was constructed for use in the event of a siege. While the well probably came in handy as a source of water for the troops during the many battles that took place at the fort, it best known for its role in the legend of the headless ghost of Ft. Niagara. It seems that during the period when the fort was under French control, two young officers from the fort fell in love with a young indian maiden living in a village near the fort. The rivalry betwee the two eventually eventually led to a sword fight that ended in the death and decapitation of the loser. According to legend, the head was thrown into the river and the body dumped into the well. In the centuries that have followed many have claimed to have seen the headless body of the officer who lost the fight wandering around the fort at night looking for his missing head.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cwgwy3kpyr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.0235,43.2494]}},{"properties":{"name":"Screaming Tunnel","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/01/1/screaming.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> Warner Rd., Niagara Falls, OntarioMade of rough-cut stone, measuring 16 feet high by 125 long, the tunnel runs under the railway tracks that link Niagara Falls to Toronto and New York City.\n\nLegend has it that a young girl burned to death in the tunnel during the early 1900s. How she got there, though, is a matter of some debate:\n# A farm house located on the far side of the tunnel caught fire one night. The family\\'s daughter attemted to flee through the tunnel. Unable to extinguish her flaming clothes and hair, she collapsed, screaming, and died inside the tunnel.\n# A custody battle ended in violence when a a young girl was set ablaze in the tunnel by her father.\n# A young girl was raped inside the tunnel, and her body burned to cover the evidence.\n# A butcher kidnapped a young girl and held her captive inside his home near the tunnel. She escaped one night, but the butcher (wearing a pig\\'s mask) chased her into the tunnel and burned her alive.\n\nGenerally, it is the burning farm house that is believed to be the most accurate tale. The family is said to be buried in Warner Cemetery (on the opposite side of the QEW).\n\nIn the original Dead Zone movie (1983), Christopher Walken take refuge inside the tunnel.\n\nThe sound of a young girl\\'s screams can be heard in the tunnel.\n\nFlames lit in the centre of the tunnel are immediately extinguished, even on the calmest day, while extreme cold spots can be felt nearby.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cwgwpxqv8h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.168568,43.141659]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Bonaventure University","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 3261 West State Road, St. Bonaventure, NY 14778<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cwgwv8m9er"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.477936,42.079937]}},{"properties":{"name":"Waverly Hills Sanitarium","description":"Posted by Simplethings50<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/01/1/apparition1_300x273.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 4400 Paralee Lane, Louisville, KY“Nurse” Apparition<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cwgwre6x8t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.843821,38.130589]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/572546","metadata":null,"contact_name":"simplethings50","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:simplethings50","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/572546","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":14,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=572546,platial:user=simplethings50","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44182}
