Beantown rolls up the sidewalks at 2 a.m. (depressing), so thank the heavens for this place. It’s a membership club, which means you have to find someone to sponsor you in the door, and there are no markings or signs for it at all. It’s the best kept secret here, and many of the boys want it to stay that way. So if you’re looking to get in, your best bet is to go out to Machine, BUZZ, or Avalon and find someone who is headed to Rise. Then beg them to sponsor you in.\nThe club regularly features such marquee talent as Chus &amp; Ceballos, Roger Sanchez, Richie Ladue, and more.\n\nOnce you get in, you’ll find the hottest late-night party in the smallest little venue you can imagine. The first floor is a lounge (without a real bar, since Rise doesn’t serve alcohol thanks to city ordinances), and the second is the pulsing, raving dance floor.\nThe party goes all night at Rise! The most crowded nights are when a hot DJ is in town, usually on Saturdays.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63bagswrnyi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.070193,42.349945]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Alley","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://www.thealleybar.com/images/visual_aids/PI-FROM-COURT.jpg\">14 Pi Alley, Boston 02116Levi/leather bar in Downtown Crossing.
