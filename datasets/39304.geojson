The directness of the sharing of this information is nearly invisible. With peer to peer file sharing one may never know who they received the information they were seeking from, all they know is that there are like minds out in the world, and they are gathering together towards a cumulative knowledge base. The similarities present between Bit Torrent file sharing and the democratic voice are overtly apparent - like minds are available, they are talking. It is up to the individual to harness the power of those like minds and accentuate those voices in unison for the strength of the community as a whole.\n\nFor Bit Torrent, Bring Us Together! Colin Beattie and Sam Gould have create a process oriented dance piece that requires the publics active involvement to play itself out to conclusion - to positive, or negative, results depending on that very involvement. Bit Torrent plays out with individuals serving the roles of Peers, Files, and Trackers, illustrating in real time the correlation between the framework of democratic voice/action, and the Bit Torrent process.\n\nJoin us, take part in the role you were born to play!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a649sqbssbrp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.681101,45.521923]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bourgeois in Boston","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>100 Northern Avenue Boston, MA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a649sqg2uw7m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.044662,42.352412]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ceramic monster masks at Backspace","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/107081060_6f838d3970.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 115 nw 5th ave, Portland OregonSome creepy, sinister, organic, salt fired ceramic masks that make me think of monsters and warriors, of gnarly road warrior type post and pre apocolyptic times when survival is not taken for granted.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a649sqhyivfo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675536,45.52395]}},{"properties":{"name":"Foghat Ranchero gets a Champagne Shower + brunch","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/269898901/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/110/269898901_a44209e9d0_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/269898844/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/110/269898844_f16a27cf33_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/269898762/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/115/269898762_0d421ea1c5_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Nat and Scott have been doing this Tailgating project for a while now, where they park their ranchero outside of art events and shindigs and just random places, and give away free beer and hotdogs, grilling off the tailgate.
