While the mass deportations of the civilian Armenian population was carried out in the spring and summer of 1915 and were completed by the fall, the systematic slaughter of the Armenians had started earlier with the murder of the able-bodied males already drafted into the Ottoman armed forces. By expropriating the movable and immovable wealth of the Armenians, the CUP also looked upon its policy of genocide as a means for enriching its coffers and rewarding its cohorts. The elimination of a commercially viable minority fulfilled part of the nationalist program to concentrate financial power in the hands of the state and promote greater Turkish control over the domestic economy.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x9exl1z5c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.243322,38.963745]}},{"properties":{"name":"BOSNIAK, July 1995, Srebrenica massacre","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/ptd_1096821593.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/15722L2.jpg\">Srebrenica Per Wikipedia: \"The Srebrenica massacre was the July 1995 killing of an estimated 8,102 Bosniak males, ranging in age from teenagers to the elderly, in the region of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina by a Serb Army of Republika Srpska under general Ratko Mladić including Serbian state special forces \"Scorpions\".\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x9f1cam1j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.296944,44.106388]}},{"properties":{"name":"CHEROKEE, 1838, Trail of Tears","description":"Posted by Oleander<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/image005.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/samanthaSM.jpg\">Tahlequah OklahomaPer Cherokee.org: \"Under orders from President Jackson and in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Army began enforcement of the Removal Act.
