Community Sizes Up Its Future Neighbor: Wal-Mart\nLandover Hills Weighs Pros and Qualms\nBy Ovetta Wiggins\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nSunday, October 23, 2005; Page C03\nChandler\\'s Drug and Medical Supplies, a small corner store in an aging Landover Hills strip mall, has sold everything over the past 57 years, from sugar-free candy to walking canes to hospital bedsheets.\nStephen Needel, the pharmacist and owner, has peered over the worn, brown counter for 32 of those years, long enough to watch the toddlers who came in with moms or dads return as adults to pick up medicine for their aging parents.\n\"Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart. There is always a place for the independents -- hopefully,\" says Stephen Needel, a longtime drugstore owner in Landover Hills.

This month, the Prince George\\'s County Council amended zoning laws to allow Wal-Mart, the world\\'s largest retailer and grocer, to open its first store inside the Capital Beltway late next year. The site is the abandoned Capital Plaza Mall, about a mile from Chandler\\'s.\n\"Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart,\" Needel said. \"There is always a place for the independents -- hopefully.\"\nYet history suggests that where Wal-Mart goes -- and with 3,600 stores in the United States, it is close to everywhere -- small businesses often disappear. Some community leaders also have concerns about how the Bentonville, Ark., company, the nation\\'s largest employer, treats its 1.6 million workers, who are not unionized.\nWal-Mart, which has stores in Bowie and Clinton, said its hourly wage in the region is 0.08, compared with 3.19 at Giant and Safeway, whose employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. The company offers a health plan, but labor leaders, who have tried unsuccessfully to organize Wal-Mart\\'s workforce, said the wages are so low that employees cannot afford to pay premiums.\n\"Wal-Mart doesn\\'t have the greatest reputation,\" council member David Harrington (D-Cheverly) said. \"It leads to low wages and little benefit.\"\nStill, community leaders and residents said, most people who have qualms are ready to set aside those concerns for anything that might help Landover Hills and its Annapolis Road corridor, which has been in an economic tailspin.\nEven Needel said he has hated watching Capital Plaza, which takes up several blocks, turn into another abandoned building.\n\"I really do think it will be an igniter,\" said the Rev. Terence D. Collins, executive director of the Community Ministry of Prince George\\'s County, a nonprofit group that works with unemployed and low-income residents. \"There has to be a starting point, and that\\'s what I see Wal-Mart as.\"\nIt has been almost 20 years since shoppers strolled the mall, which was anchored by Montgomery Ward and Bradlees. Girls bought shoes at Fayva, and women shopped for clothes at Merry-Go-Round.\n\"Everything was leased up, the traffic flow was great and we had quite a number of national tenants,\" said Randall J. Levitt, president of Nellis Corp., which owns and manages Capital Plaza.\nWhen Bradlees left the Washington market, Hechinger, the hardware and lumber company, moved in. \"It was a good retailer but not a good anchor for a mall,\" Levitt said. A person buying lumber isn\\'t likely to buy a pair of shoes or a dress at the same time, he said.\nMontgomery Ward and Hechinger filed for bankruptcy, leaving Capital Plaza about five years ago. That left mostly small local businesses working on month-to-month leases.\n\"Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart.

But they are better than nothing.\"\nCollins recently witnessed the area\\'s need for economic revival firsthand as he watched his son play football a few blocks from the Capital Plaza site.

(PGMC). For over four decades PGMC has been at the vanguard of efforts to expand residential, retail and office space to create a new, sophisticated urban center in Northern Prince George’s County.\n\nIn addition to many important state and federal agencies such as the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Financial Management Services (FMS), and the Department of Social Services (DSS), University Town Center tenants are drawn from diverse segments of the community. Tenants include institutions advancing education, arts, music, technology, medicine, science and more. Other UTC tenants include Prince George’s Community College; University of Maryland University College; centers for the arts; a music school; many medical and dental offices; and the Business Technology Growth Center, an incubator for start up companies.\n\nUTC is proud to be home to a number of companies who have been tenants of PGMC for ten, twenty, and thirty or more years.\n\nThe University Town Center Management Team has been working together collectively for more than twenty years. They are a cohesive unit of professionals dedicated to making UTC the place to be.\n\nNew Office Building dedicated in Hyattsville\n\nThe newest office building at University Town Center, a 200,000 square foot headquarters building for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a Department of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was officially opened on March 10th in Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\nThe new seven-story building, designed by Weihe Design Group, provides consolidated headquarters space for NCHS, which is the nation’s principal health statistics source. The University Town Center unveiled its especially commissioned outdoor sculpture, called \"Images of America,\" by renowned artist Phillip Ratner. This signature piece consists of four units, each 12 feet high and five feet wide, displaying images of personalities, events, and concepts portraying different aspects of American history. Also unveiled at the ceremony were replicas of 18 documents representing key aspects of the founding and growth of the United States.\n\n725,000 sf Of Mixed-Use Space Now Under Construction At University Town Center In Hyattsville, MD\n\n0 Million Construction Contract Signed for Unique College Student Residence, Parking Garage\n\nHyattsville, Maryland, April 2004. Ground has been broken for 725,000 square feet of mixed-use space at University Town Center (UTC) in Hyattsville, Maryland. Between now and early 2006, the existing 1.3 million SF office complex, located across the street from the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station, will add a unique 16-story residence for some 900 college and graduate students, a 16-screen movie theater, and over 250,000 SF of retail space. \n\nFrom the Ground Up\nHyattsville Complex Adds Restaurants to Mix\n\nBy Ylan Q. Mui\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, June 12, 2006; Page D03\n\nThe 60 million University Town Center development in Hyattsville is entering its final stages, with several restaurants signing deals that developers hope will turn the 56-acre site into an entertainment destination in Prince George\\'s County.\n\nThe project is off East-West Highway, about a mile from the University of Maryland and near the Hyattsville Metro station. It is already home to four office buildings with roughly 5,000 workers, mainly from government agencies.\n\t\nThe developer, Prince George\\'s Metro Center Inc., wants to channel the foot traffic from those buildings into several restaurants and retailers. Old Dominion Brewpub recently agreed to rent 10,000 square feet. Other restaurants to open include Tokyo Sushi, Mongolian Grill and Salad Creations.\n\nA New York-based coffee and wine bar and a seafood restaurant are also negotiating for space.\n\nConsolidated Theaters is building a 14-screen cineplex. Safeway has begun construction of one of its new \"lifestyle\" stores. Madison Retail Group, which is leasing the project, said it expects to announce more tenants soon.\n\nOne of the goals of the project is to attract higher-end retail to Prince George\\'s County. Residents have long complained about the lack of sit-down restaurants and upscale shopping in one of the country\\'s wealthiest predominantly African American counties.\n\nWearing a hard hat, Prince George\\'s Metro Center Inc. President Herschel W. Blumberg, 82, walked through the construction area last week and imagined the end product: wide sidewalks, landscaped greenery and plenty of people.\n\nA preview party for the project\\'s eight-story condo building was held last week. Construction is to begin at the end of this summer on another condo building, with a curved zinc facade and a loft-like atmosphere. A 910-bed student housing complex will open in the fall, intended to draw tenants from the University of Maryland and Howard and Catholic universities, among others.\n\nThe project should be finished within a year, with the exception of the Safeway, which is expected to open in 2008.\n\nThe Mall at Prince George\\'s, near Blumberg\\'s site, has Target, Old Navy, JCPenney and Hecht\\'s as anchors. Home Depot is nearby. \"This area is changing dramatically,\" Blumberg said. \"We don\\'t mind the competition.\"\n\nBlumberg bought the land in 1954. He built office complexes but was unable to put together the mixed-use development he envisioned.\n\nNow that the tide is turning, Blumberg said he is glad that he kept the property. As he walked the site, he showed off the slabs of concrete that will become patios for the condos and the steel beams that will hold up the building\\'s walls. From the top of the student apartments, the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral could be seen near the horizon.\n\"He had this dream for 50 years,\" Tim R. Taylor, vice president of leasing for Prince George\\'s Metro Center, said of Blumberg. \"He wanted to see it come to fruition.\"\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bxqi6a4k62"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.951482,38.971388]}},{"properties":{"name":"Washington Gateway - Target - 123,770 SF","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Wash Gateway - New Target- 2008 123,770 SFStep into any Target store in any city in the country, and you know exactly what to expect: high-quality, stylishly designed items plus all the essentials for your life, displayed in a clean, organized and welcoming environment.

The company is challenging the idea that discount retailers must pay workers poorly.\nPublished: July 17, 2005\n\nISSAQUAH, Wash.\n\nJIM SINEGAL, the chief executive of Costco Wholesale, the nation\\'s fifth-largest retailer, had all the enthusiasm of an 8-year-old in a candy store as he tore open the container of one of his favorite new products: granola snack mix. \"You got to try this; it\\'s delicious,\" he said. \"And just .99 for 38 ounces.\"\nDefying the Analysts\nPeter Yates for The New York Times\n\n\nSome 60 feet away, inside Costco\\'s cavernous warehouse store here in the company\\'s hometown, Mr. Sinegal became positively exuberant about the 87-inch-long Natuzzi brown leather sofas. \"This is just 99.99,\" he said. \"It\\'s terrific quality. Most other places you\\'d have to pay ,500, even ,000.\"\n\nBut the pièce de résistance, the item he most wanted to crow about, was Costco\\'s private-label pinpoint cotton dress shirts. \"Look, these are just 2.99,\" he said, while lifting a crisp blue button-down. \"At Nordstrom or Macy\\'s, this is a 5, 0 shirt.\"\n\nCombining high quality with stunningly low prices, the shirts appeal to upscale customers - and epitomize why some retail analysts say Mr. Sinegal just might be America\\'s shrewdest merchant since Sam Walton.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with Costco\\'s business strategy. Some Wall Street analysts assert that Mr. Sinegal is overly generous not only to Costco\\'s customers but to its workers as well.\n\nCostco\\'s average pay, for example, is 7 an hour, 42 percent higher than its fiercest rival, Sam\\'s Club. And Costco\\'s health plan makes those at many other retailers look Scroogish. One analyst, Bill Dreher of Deutsche Bank, complained last year that at Costco \"it\\'s better to be an employee or a customer than a shareholder.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal begs to differ. He rejects Wall Street\\'s assumption that to succeed in discount retailing, companies must pay poorly and skimp on benefits, or must ratchet up prices to meet Wall Street\\'s profit demands.\n\nGood wages and benefits are why Costco has extremely low rates of turnover and theft by employees, he said. And Costco\\'s customers, who are more affluent than other warehouse store shoppers, stay loyal because they like that low prices do not come at the workers\\' expense. \"This is not altruistic,\" he said. \"This is good business.\"\n\nHe also dismisses calls to increase Costco\\'s product markups. Mr. Sinegal, who has been in the retailing business for more than a half-century, said that heeding Wall Street\\'s advice to raise some prices would bring Costco\\'s downfall.\n\n\"When I started, Sears, Roebuck was the Costco of the country, but they allowed someone else to come in under them,\" he said. \"We don\\'t want to be one of the casualties. We don\\'t want to turn around and say, \\'We got so fancy we\\'ve raised our prices,\\' and all of a sudden a new competitor comes in and beats our prices.\"\n\nAt Costco, one of Mr. Sinegal\\'s cardinal rules is that no branded item can be marked up by more than 14 percent, and no private-label item by more than 15 percent. In contrast, supermarkets generally mark up merchandise by 25 percent, and department stores by 50 percent or more.\n\n\"They could probably get more money for a lot of items they sell,\" said Ed Weller, a retailing analyst at ThinkEquity.\n\nBut Mr. Sinegal warned that if Costco increased markups to 16 or 18 percent, the company might slip down a dangerous slope and lose discipline in minimizing costs and prices.\n\nMr. Sinegal, whose father was a coal miner and steelworker, gave a simple explanation. \"On Wall Street, they\\'re in the business of making money between now and next Thursday,\" he said. \"I don\\'t say that with any bitterness, but we can\\'t take that view. We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now.\"\n\nIF shareholders mind Mr. Sinegal\\'s philosophy, it is not obvious: Costco\\'s stock price has risen more than 10 percent in the last 12 months, while Wal-Mart\\'s has slipped 5 percent. Costco shares sell for almost 23 times expected earnings; at Wal-Mart the multiple is about 19.Mr. Dreher said Costco\\'s share price was so high because so many people love the company. \"It\\'s a cult stock,\" he said.\n\nEmme Kozloff, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, faulted Mr. Sinegal as being too generous to employees, noting that when analysts complained that Costco\\'s workers were paying just 4 percent toward their health costs, he raised that percentage only to 8 percent, when the retail average is 25 percent.\n\n\"He has been too benevolent,\" she said. \"He\\'s right that a happy employee is a productive long-term employee, but he could force employees to pick up a little more of the burden.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal says he pays attention to analysts\\' advice because it enforces a healthy discipline, but he has largely shunned Wall Street pressure to be less generous to his workers. \n\n\"When Jim talks to us about setting wages and benefits, he doesn\\'t want us to be better than everyone else, he wants us to be demonstrably better,\" said John Matthews, Costco\\'s senior vice president for human resources.\nSkip to next paragraph\nPeter Yates for The New York Times\n\nCostco\\'s strategy of using plain spaces to sell products in bulk at deep discounts has won over many customers, said Jim Sinegal, Costco\\'s chief executive.\nMultimedia\nGraphic Defying the Analysts\nDefying the Analysts\n\nWith his ferocious attention to detail and price, Mr. Sinegal has made Costco the nation\\'s leading warehouse retailer, with about half of the market, compared with 40 percent for the No. 2, Sam\\'s Club. But Sam\\'s is not a typical runner-up: it is part of the Wal-Mart empire, which, with 88 billion in sales last year, dwarfs Costco.\n\nBut it is the customer, more than the competition, that keeps Mr. Sinegal\\'s attention. \"We\\'re very good merchants, and we offer value,\" he said. \"The traditional retailer will say: \\'I\\'m selling this for 0. I wonder whether I can get 0.50 or 1.\\' We say: \\'We\\'re selling it for . How do we get it down to ?\\' We understand that our members don\\'t come and shop with us because of the fancy window displays or the Santa Claus or the piano player. They come and shop with us because we offer great values.\"\n\nCostco was founded with a single store in Seattle in 1983; it now has 457 stores, mostly in the United States, but also in Canada, Britain, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Wal-Mart, by contrast, had 642 Sam\\'s Clubs in the United States and abroad as of Jan. 31.Costco\\'s profit rose 22 percent last year, to 82 million, on sales of 7.1 billion. In the United States, its stores average 21 million in sales annually, far more than the 0 million for Sam\\'s Clubs. And the average household income of Costco customers is 4,000 - with 31 percent earning over 00,000.\n\nOne reason the company has risen to the top and stayed there is that Mr. Sinegal relentlessly refines his model of the warehouse store - the bare-bones, cement-floor retailing space where shoppers pay a membership fee to choose from a limited number of products in large quantities at deep discounts. Costco has 44.6 million members, with households paying 5 a year and small businesses paying 00.\n\nA typical Costco store stocks 4,000 types of items, including perhaps just four toothpaste brands, while a Wal-Mart typically stocks more than 100,000 types of items and may carry 60 sizes and brands of toothpastes. Narrowing the number of options increases the sales volume of each, allowing Costco to squeeze deeper and deeper bulk discounts from suppliers.\n\n\"He\\'s a zealot on low prices,\" Ms. Kozloff said. \"He\\'s very reticent about finagling with his model.\"\n\nDespite Costco\\'s impressive record, Mr. Sinegal\\'s salary is just 50,000, although he also received a 00,000 bonus last year. That puts him at less than 10 percent of many other chief executives, though Costco ranks 29th in revenue among all American companies.\n\n\"I\\'ve been very well rewarded,\" said Mr. Sinegal, who is worth more than 50 million thanks to his Costco stock holdings. \"I just think that if you\\'re going to try to run an organization that\\'s very cost-conscious, then you can\\'t have those disparities. Having an individual who is making 100 or 200 or 300 times more than the average person working on the floor is wrong.\"\n\nThere is little love lost between Wal-Mart and Costco. Wal-Mart, for example, boasts that its Sam\\'s Club division has the lowest prices of any retailer. Mr. Sinegal emphatically dismissed that assertion with a one-word barnyard epithet. Sam\\'s might make the case that its ketchup is cheaper than Costco\\'s, he said, \"but you can\\'t compare Hunt\\'s ketchup with Heinz ketchup.\"\n\nStill, Costco is feeling the heat from Sam\\'s Club. When Sam\\'s began to pare prices aggressively several years ago, Costco had to shave its prices - and its already thin profit margins - ever further.\n\n\"Sam\\'s Club has dramatically improved its operation and improved the quality of their merchandise,\" said Mr. Dreher, the Deutsche Bank analyst. \"Using their buying power together with Wal-Mart\\'s, it forces Costco to be very sharp on their prices.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal\\'s elbows can be sharp as well. As most suppliers well know, his gruff charm is not what lets him sell goods at rock-bottom prices - it\\'s his fearsome toughness, which he rarely shows in public. He often warns suppliers not to offer other retailers lower prices than Costco gets.\n\nWhen a frozen-food supplier mistakenly sent Costco an invoice meant for Wal-Mart, he discovered that Wal-Mart was getting a better price. \"We have not brought that supplier back,\" Mr. Sinegal said.\n\nHe has to be flinty, he said, because the competition is so fierce. \"This is not the Little Sisters of the Poor,\" he said. \"We have to be competitive in the toughest marketplace in the world against the biggest competitor in the world. We cannot afford to be timid.\"\nSkip to next paragraph Multimedia\nGraphic Defying the Analysts\nDefying the Analysts\n\nNor can he afford to let personal relationships get in his way. Tim Rose, Costco\\'s senior vice president for food merchandising, recalled a time when Starbucks did not pass along savings from a drop in coffee bean prices. Though he is a friend of the Starbucks chairman, Howard Schultz, Mr. Sinegal warned he would remove Starbucks coffee from his stores unless it cut its prices.\n\nStarbucks relented.\n\n\"Howard said, \\'Who do you think you are? The price police?\\' \" Mr. Rose recalled, adding that Mr. Sinegal replied emphatically that he was.\n\nIf Mr. Sinegal feels proprietary about warehouse stores, it is for good reason. He was present at the birth of the concept, in 1954. He was 18, a student at San Diego Community College, when a friend asked him to help unload mattresses for a month-old discount store called Fed-Mart.\n\nWhat he thought would be a one-day job became a career. He rose to executive vice president for merchandising and became a protégé of Fed-Mart\\'s chairman, Sol Price, who is credited with inventing the idea of high-volume warehouse stores that sell a limited number of products.\n\nMr. Price sold Fed-Mart to a German retailer in 1975 and was fired soon after. Mr. Sinegal then left and helped Mr. Price start a new warehouse company, Price Club. Its huge success led others to enter the business: Wal-Mart started Sam\\'s Club, Zayre\\'s started BJ\\'s Wholesale Club and a Seattle entrepreneur tapped Mr. Sinegal to help him found Costco.\n\nCostco has used Mr. Price\\'s formula: sell a limited number of items, keep costs down, rely on high volume, pay workers well, have customers buy memberships and aim for upscale shoppers, especially small-business owners. In addition, don\\'t advertise - that saves 2 percent a year in costs. Costco and Price Club merged in 1993.\n\n\"Jim has done a very good job in balancing the interests of the shareholders, the employees, the customers and the managers,\" said Mr. Price, now 89 and retired. \"Most companies tilt too much one way or the other.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal, who is 69 but looks a decade younger, also delights in not tilting Costco too far into cheap merchandise, even at his warehouse stores. He loves the idea of the \"treasure hunt\" - occasional, temporary specials on exotic cheeses, Coach bags, plasma screen televisions, Waterford crystal, French wine and ,000 necklaces - scattered among staples like toilet paper by the case and institutional-size jars of mayonnaise.\n\nThe treasure hunts, Mr. Sinegal says, create a sense of excitement and customer loyalty.\n\nThis knack for seeing things in a new way also explains Costco\\'s approach to retaining employees as well as shoppers. Besides paying considerably more than competitors, for example, Costco contributes generously to its workers\\' 401(k) plans, starting with 3 percent of salary the second year and rising to 9 percent after 25 years.\n\nITS insurance plans absorb most dental expenses, and part-time workers are eligible for health insurance after just six months on the job, compared with two years at Wal-Mart. Eighty-five percent of Costco\\'s workers have health insurance, compared with less than half at Wal-Mart and Target.\n\nCostco also has not shut out unions, as some of its rivals have. The Teamsters union, for example, represents 14,000 of Costco\\'s 113,000 employees. \"They gave us the best agreement of any retailer in the country,\" said Rome Aloise, the union\\'s chief negotiator with Costco. The contract guarantees employees at least 25 hours of work a week, he said, and requires that at least half of a store\\'s workers be full time.\n\nWorkers seem enthusiastic. Beth Wagner, 36, used to manage a Rite Aid drugstore, where she made 4,000 a year and paid nearly ,000 a year for health coverage. She quit five years ago to work at Costco, taking a cut in pay. She started at 0.50 an hour - 2,000 a year - but now makes 8 an hour as a receiving clerk. With annual bonuses, her income is about 0,000.\n\n\"I want to retire here,\" she said. \"I love it here.\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bxqi5no4zi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.954594,38.919687]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/5486","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rufusl","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rufusl","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/5486","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":14,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=5486,platial:user=rufusl","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44046}
