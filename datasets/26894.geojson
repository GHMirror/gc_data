Erik called from work to tell me, and I turned on the TV. I couldn\\'t believe it. I poured myself a drink. I watched the news for about an hour and then turned off the television. Every person I knew in France called me to express their sympathy, which I remember felt strange to me at the time. Unlike many Americans, I didn\\'t feel as if I had been personally attacked. I just felt dumbfounded by the horror.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqruyaggzz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.394966,48.873684]}},{"properties":{"name":"1st day of testing","description":"Posted by Woodduck<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/geico.jpg\">2nd floor of GEICO\\'s IT departmentWe were introducing a major new system, and I was in charge of the testing. 9/11 was our first day to test the full system, and I got started about 7:30. \n\nWhen the dastardly deed occurred, I was deep into the 1st tier of programs, and things in my little world were going well. Very well. Virtually all work around me stopped, with people standing everywhere, talking over cube walls like so many gophers popped out of their holes. \n\nMy wife called, asking me to come home (we lived over an hour away) because she didn\\'t want me to die. There is nothing of any headline value or strategic value around, so I felt reasonably safe and preferred to stay where I was rather than risk aeons on the Beltway and Cabin John, er, Veterans Memorial Bridge - which I felt were significantly more likely targets than my humble building. So I continued working. \n\nWe completed a full cycle of testing that day in about 14 hours, which was very impressive as trial tests earlier had taken days to run. Testing the next day ran in about 12 hours, and dropped to 8 by the end of the week. After we got into routine we typically completed the cycle of testing in about 6.5 hours, to everyone\\'s delight. (Not that anyone really cares about how well our testing went. Or how wonderful and indispensable I was to the effort. *toot toot!* *pat pat*)\n\nI finally got to see video of the crashes and collapses on the 11 o\\'clock news. And the follow up reports after the new. And the hollow-eyed comments by Dan Rather and other reports who had been working all day, and were beyond beautifying by their make-up units.\n\nI couldn\\'t help but feel for the workers who had gone in to their jobs, as I had, for a good day\\'s work, but unlike me, never finished. Well, not in the way they would have preferred. And knowing how my own wife worried, felt for the families they left behind.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqruwobttf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.090936,38.961595]}},{"properties":{"name":"301 Elizabeth","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://scott.heiferman.com\" href=\"http://scott.heiferman.com\">Heif</a><img src=\"http://heiferman.com/photo/091101.jpg\">301 elizabeth, 10012<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqruvnrmpd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.993499,40.724691]}},{"properties":{"name":"327 Henry Street, my old apartment","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.confectious.net\" href=\"http://www.confectious.net\">Egoodman</a><img src=\"http://www.confectious.net/images/ordinary/01.27.03.jpg\">327 Henry St New York NYI was in bed, deliberately oversleeping.

Being a smaller firm, the company did not send many people on business trips, and this was my first for them.  The conference was schedule for September 10 to 11, 2001.  The first day passed as one would have expected, with various presentations, panel discussions, networking, and question and answer periods regarding sales forecasting in general and the software package in particular.  The second day, though, was anything but expected.  It began innocuously enough, turning on the TV in my hotel room to listen to Good Morning America.  At some point, regular programming was interrupted for coverage of the first plane strike.  In the confusion and horror of the event, the consensus seemed to be that it was an accident that an airliner had crashed into one of the towers.  Then, live on TV, the second plane hit the other tower, and the realization sank in that these weren\\'t accidents.  Forced to leave my room for the start of a now meaningless conference, I passed groups of people huddle together watching the numerous TVs lining the halls of the casino.  Lacking information, people speculated about the meaning of the attacks, who could be behind them, what else was and could be happening.  Slowly, the conference organizers ushered people into the conference hall and gamely tried to salvage it from this unforeseen and momentous distraction.  Unable to concentrate, people rushed out of the room as soon as the session ended to get updated on the latest news.  At one point, a smaller session gathered in an impromptu computer lab set up on an upper floor of the casino.  We had heard that all air traffic had been grounded, so from my vantage point I was surprised to see an airliner in the sky being escorted by several fighters.  No one else in the session seemed to notice.  I found out later that this was Air Force One touching down at Offutt Air Force Base outside of Omaha, Nebraska.  The entire day was surreal, with people trying to go through the motions, feigning interest in the conference, trading rumors, and experiencing that disconcerting dread of the unknown.  With air traffic grounded, nearly all the conference attendees were stranded at the casino.  Being away from home only made the experience that much more strange and uncomfortable.  I sympathized with the victims, their families, the plight of the country.  I also felt powerless to do anything, stranded at a casino thousands of miles from home.  The continued ban on air travel extended my stay in Council Bluffs.  Gradually, people found alternative means to return home.  Luckily, a fellow conference attendee was also from Pennsylvania.  We were fortunate enough to rent one of the few remaining rental cars available in the area, and on the 15th, we began the fifteen hour drive home.  We drove straight through, crossing nearly half the country on I-80.  We both just wanted to return to the comfort of home to find some sense of normality in an uncomfortably abnormal time.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqrv2hq118"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.909365,41.252253]}},{"properties":{"name":"I found out in this building.","description":"Posted by Aswoodard380 Boyer Ave. Walla Walla, WAI woke up during my sophomore year at Whitman College in a hurry to get to a meeting with my academic advisor that morning.

We never discussed what we had originally planned to, and I forget what it was now.  After seeing her I went to the old Student Union, and found the place packed and completely silent as other students and faculty just gaped and gasped as the the first tower began to collapse and the second plane hit.

My friend got a call on her cell phone and said incredulously, \"oh my God, the world trade center\\'s been attacked.\"  We went inside to the library and one of my classmates was freaking out and crying.  We went into a room with a TV and watched the replays of the second tower being hit and the first tower coming down.  Then, when the hour was up we went to class and the professor lectured just like nothing had happened...no acknowlegement...that was the weirdest thing of all.  I thought Lincoln, Nebraska would be one of the safest places in such an event, but my classmates told me there are hundreds of ICBMs pointed straight at them, left over from the Cold War, due to Offut Air Force Base being right down the road, about 45 minutes.  The president even paid a visit after he got finished reading My Pet Goat to the kids.  They whisked him away to Offut because it has underground \"command and control\" bunkers.  Wonder if he had a few cocktails that day?  I know at least a few people did.  Four large planes were grounded in Lincoln when U.S. airspace was closed for the first time in history.  The hotels filled up fast and all of the rental cars were taken, but it was comforting and heartwarming to hear about giftbaskets being taken to the stranded passengers to make their stay more enjoyable.  Hearing their interviews on the radio was also comforting, since it was easier to focus on the local community rather than sort through all the geo-political forces at play on that day.  One man said he\\'d never been to Lincoln, Nebraska, but he was supposed to be on one of the hijacked airplanes, but he had gotten to the airport early and flew stand-by on an earlier flight.  Given the alternative, he said, Lincoln was a pretty good destination.

I was unemployed.  My roommate came bursting into the apartment, face white as a sheet.  They turned her away from the subway, as the first plane had hit.  We turned on our crappy TV with no reception (We didn\\'t have cable).  The second plane had just hit.  Our apartment was on the ground floor but just looking outside, two long streams of smoke could be seen in an otherwise crisp clear blue sky.  We engineered an antenna from aluminum foil and huddled around the TV to try and figure out what had happened.  The towers fell and it felt like a dream.  I was in complete denial.  No way.  This can\\'t be happening.  This is not happening.  But yet we looked outside and there were the plumes of smoke in the sky from the burning buildings.  I was able somehow to make sure my daughter was ok.  She was in the East Village and was with her mother.  My roommate located her girlfriend, who came over and we all sat around in bewilderment.  Cell phones stopped working and the internet went down.  Rumors were flying about subsequent follow up attacks: poisoned water, bombs in the subway, other planes still unaccounted for.  My roommate rushed out to buy emergency supplies.  She came back with several gallons of water, 12 jars of peanut butter, and 20 cans of tuna.  I remember laughing as we unpacked the bags--12 jars of peanut butter!  Somehow it seemed so funny, in a very human way, peanut butter is such a comfort food--it seemed surreal.  The apocalypse will not be a fine dining experience.  But yet my laughter quickly turned to sobering reality--what if the water supply really is poisoned?  What if the city shuts down?  4th Avenue is a main thoroughfare connecting to the bridges leading to Manhattan, so during the late morning through the entire day, ghostly groups of dusty figures shambled by on their way home to their neighborhoods in Southern Brooklyn.  Everyone was in shock.  There were so many rumours about what had happened and who had done it.  I felt helpless, numb, and wounded.  Vengenance and anger hadn\\'t set in yet.  It was just such a total and complete shock.  Watching those buildings fall through the blurry snow of a bad tv set, while a few miles away it actually was happening.  Nothing made sense anymore.  Slowly the impact of what had happened set in.  I watched the columns of smoke cross the sky for a long time.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqruywz79r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.980525,40.68076]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nantucket Harbor","description":"Posted by System, , MANantucket Harbor <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqrupqkupd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.045833,41.304166]}},{"properties":{"name":"National Newark Building","description":"Posted by Michaelblack<img src=\"http://www.mrofficespace.com/ob/pix/nj/bn0471.jpg\">744 broad street newark njObserved the disaster from the 22nd floor.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqruy7be72"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.171317,40.736752]}},{"properties":{"name":"Next to my old house","description":"Posted by RenaistreI was raking weeds on the hill next to my house around 9:00 A.M. when my dad came outside and told me that the towers had fallen.

My mother worked several blocks south of the WTC, near Battery Park, and my father was flying on a business trip that day to Chicago. It took me hours before I found out that both of them were okay. \n\nOnly when I got home and was able to watch tv, did I realize the immense scale and devastation of the attacks. Watching the footage and pictures made me feel as if Pearl Harbor had just happened 40-something miles south of my house. The fact that a group of terrorists BROUGHT DOWN the Twin Towers, while successfully hitting the Pentagon and killing people on board United 93, made me feel a sense of vulnerability and dread, like most other Americans felt.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqruru9ywj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.6375,41.189]}},{"properties":{"name":"Siu Lek Yuen Hill 小瀝源山旁","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kclama/\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kclama/\">Kclama</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/25888582_1184ef5531_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/112840246_e85e2c2b86_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/123646792_abfb6ef773_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/59657277_5286ca72b1_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/124606418_5d7b402b37_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/116339664_dd59411c35_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/107003510_9bb6ddac06_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/125049211_b0111ad9f7_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/52920567_f66b0b4fd8_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/157778639_62953a4de3_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/152974338_62d05354d1_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/101533017_9bd94d5a2f_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/67079012_653f3da7bf_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/102393406_2a8863bb70_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/31/58952737_695c62dee4_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/157048659_45a7cc742f_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/45825578_ec0aaf6ab8_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/67457140_5fb1856369_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/153105422_a092e39b9f_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/125581357_33129cab6b_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/151796676_6668050402_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/70026048_ce0b906d0f_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/63550302_f895e4363c_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/29938090_ca238ad868_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/140610939_1fe16a15f6_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/133335273_c40f9a73e5_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/116724818_ffd5985ef6_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/33124305_0f38d53749_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/clip=99550\">Wing Dance</a> on <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/clip=84475\">Another Jumping Friend</a> on <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/clip=61472\">View this clip on Vimeo</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/clip=53915\">View this clip on Vimeo</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/clip=46652\">View this clip on Vimeo</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/clip=60867\">View this clip on Vimeo</a>\n\nMy home is located here, with high-rise buildings by the hill side.

I was in Florida, at the Emma T. Booker Elementary School, listening to children read. Chief of Staff Andrew Card came over and whispered in my ear, \"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\"\n\nWhat did I, the Commander in Chief do? Nothing. I sat there. I sat for well over 5 minutes, doing nothing while 3,000 people were dying and the attacks were still in progress.\n\nNot only did I, the leader of the free world sit as my country was attacked, the Secret Service also did nothing. I was appearing in public at a previously announced photo-op. I was a sitting duck. The attacks were ongoing at that point (planes had yet to hit the Pentagon or the field in Pennsylvania), and nobody knew how much more destruction was going to happen. Were there two, three, four, eight more planes hijacked and on their way to crash into prominent buildings? \n\nWas one headed for the school, where anyone who checked my public itinerary would know I was located? Were other terrorists planning to detonate dirty nukes? Were they going to release anthrax or smallpox or sarin? Was an assassination squad going to burst into the school and get me? Was a suicide bomber going to ram a truck full of explosives into this classroom?\n\nDuring the midst of the attacks, any of these things could\\'ve happened. Yet I calmly sat here, seemingly unconcerned. My Chief of Staff likewise doesn\\'t think that America in flames warrants my immediate attention. And the Secret Service utterly fails to do its job of grabbing me, the President of the United States and getting me to safety. It\\'s truly inexplicable.\n\nAnd it\\'s something the administration isn\\'t too eager to trumpet. We haven\\'t released footage of my (non)actions during this historic moment of American history. Until now, the only available footage had been a little film put together by Booker Elementary.  The problem is, there\\'s a jump edit in the footage: From the time Card whispers to me until the end of the scene in the classroom, only 2 minutes and 10 seconds elapse.\n\nBut this new, fuller footage shows me sitting for a full five minutes after I\\'ve been told that \"America is under attack.\"\n\nI declined to take action even longer than this, but this footage ends before I leave the classroom. Thanks to an amazing article by Allan Wood and Paul Thompson, we know what happened after the footage suddenly cuts off:\n\n    The only source to describe what happened next is Fighting Back by Bill Sammon. Publishers Weekly described Sammon\\'s book as an \"inside account of [my] administration\\'s reaction to 9-11 [and] a breathless, highly complimentary portrait of the president [showing] the great merit and unwavering moral vision of his inner circle.\" [Publisher\\'s Weekly, 10/15/02] Sammon\\'s conservative perspective makes his account of my behavior at the end of the photo-op all the more surprising. I am described as smiling and chatting with the children \"as if I didn\\'t have a care in the world\" and \"in the most relaxed manner imaginable.\" White House aide Gordon Johndroe, then came in as he usually does at the end of press conferences, and said, \"Thank you, press. If you could step out the door we came in, please.\" A reporter then asked, \"Mr. President, are you aware of the reports of the plane crash in New York? Is there anything...\", But I interrupted, and recalling my orders, \"DON\\'T SAY ANYTHING YET,\" I responded, \"I\\'ll talk about it later.\" But still I did not leave. \"I stepped forward and shook hands with [classroom teacher] Daniels, slipping my left hand behind her in another photo-op pose. I was taking my good old time. ... I lingered until the press was gone.\" [Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism - From Inside the Bush White House, by Bill Sammon, 10/02, p. 90]\n\nFor a detailed portrait of what I did and didn\\'t do on 9/11, you can do no better than to read this article here. It is based completely on reports from mainstream media and statements from government officials.\n\nApologists claim that I didn\\'t leave simply because I didn\\'t want to interrupt and upset the children, but this falls apart for several reasons:\n\n1) America is being attacked, thousands are dying, and I don\\'t know if we\\'re facing nuclear, biological, or chemical attacks, as well. Couldn\\'t I just say, \"Excuse me, kids, I need to take care of something. It\\'s part of being President, y\\'understand. I\\'ll be back as soon as I can.\"\n\n2) At the moment Card told me about the second plane, the children weren\\'t reading to me. They had finished reading words from an easel and were reaching under their chairs for a book when Card whispered to me. Another 30 seconds would elapse before they started reading again. This pause was a perfect time for me to politely excuse myeslf, but nooooo.\n\n3) By staying, I not only endangered my own life, but the lives of all of these children. Wouldn\\'t it be better to risk upsetting them than to risk letting them die in a terror attack?\n\n4) Even if I was afraid of hurting the kiddies\\' feelings, what about my Secret Service? Have they been trained not to attempt to save  my life if it might bother some schoolchildren?\n\n5) What about Chief of Staff Andrew Card, White House Spokesperson Ari Fleischer, and other officials who were in that classroom? Didn\\'t they feel that a 21st-century Pearl Harbor and a potential attack on the President himself were worth some sort of action?\n\n6) Finally, and most damningly, this excuse doesn\\'t explain why I continued to mill around the classroom for several minutes after the children had finished reading.\n\nSomewhere, someone has the complete, uncut footage of me in Booker Elementary, from the time I enter the classroom until I finally walk out. If you have this footage, please send it to me, seriously.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqrurvq8pq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.522975,27.35968]}},{"properties":{"name":"When I found out....","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://politicalcowboy.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://politicalcowboy.wordpress.com\">Politicalcowboy</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 2150 E Southern Ave, Tempe, AZ, 85282We were getting things ready for our bike hike that day.

We were both skeptical until we went around behind the building and saw one of the students tuning in the radio. The news came on to a siren blaring. The reporter came on and noted that the fire siren was live from the Pentagon where a plane had crashed. As we continued to load bikes on the trailer, the first tower fell with a somber moment of silent prayer around the van.\n\nThe activity went on, though notably missing the usual laughing and carrying on, replaced with conversations of \"Can you believe...\" and \"Who would do this?\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqrusoaxpi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.894328,33.392827]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where I Was When 9/11 Happened","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://www.eisnor.com/emiko/old/images/iloveny.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.eisnor.com/emiko/old/images/iloveny.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/blizziumsburg/images/3274901-r1-008-2a.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Neighborhood families by day climbing over broken bottles and pieces of the piers.

She told us that it was because an airplane had crashed into the World Trade Center.  It seemed like a joke, or a misunderstanding, or an exageration.  We turned the radio right when the 2nd plane hit, then the reports about the Pentagon, the 4th Plane in the field and even the White House started coming in. The media seemed to be in a real panic, and really confused.  We didn\\'t have a tv, so went to the landlords apartment and saw the huge plumes.  Emiko was just a few months old, but we both felt an urgent need to get down to the Brooklyn waterfront and see it in real life.  We biked over to Williamsburg\\'s N 7th Piers, and stood with hundreds of stunned onlookers.  The hood was crammed with people, nobody wanted to watch the footage alone at home, everyone crammed into cafes and bars to see the news, and just shake their heads in utter confusion. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aqruzbpadi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.964789,40.672973]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where I was","description":"Posted by Scdrew1612 Fox Run Dr., Columbia MO 65202I had just gotten out of the shower and turned on the TV to check the weather.
