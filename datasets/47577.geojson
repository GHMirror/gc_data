The food\\'s good and reasonably priced, and owner Khun Noi is a delightful person. Definitely the place for refreshments during a walk around the old town.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740ybxil14a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[98.3880186081,7.88466905035]}},{"properties":{"name":"Koh Sim Bee Statue","description":"Posted by Phukethelp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/3/IMG_0637_%5B640x480%5D.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> There are two hills in Phuket Town - Rang Hill and Toh Sae Hill. There\\'s a pleasant park at the top of Rang Hill, presided over by a statue of the portly Koh Sim Bee, Lord Rassada, the governor of Phuket and other parts about 100 years ago. He built roads, introduced rubber planting and brought in big Western mining companies to extract tin more efficiently, all of which brought a boom in prosperity to Phuket - though at a cost to the island\\'s environment; opencast tin mining left areas of Phuket looking like a moonscape, and dredging took a heavy toll on local fish stocks. Nevertheless, Koh Sim Bee is still revered and his methods are still studied by government officials.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740yc1826ym"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[98.379650116,7.89419109815]}},{"properties":{"name":"Phra Pitak Chinpracha Mansion","description":"Posted by Phukethelp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/3/IMG_0628_%5B640x480%5D.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The largest mansion in Phuket built with tin money, the Phra Pitak Chinpracha Mansion is still in private hands. Though it looks most attractive from the road ir is by all accounts crumbling inside. Rumours of a sale with a possible conversion to a 50-star boutique hotel have all come to nothing.

The owners of the tin mines were also the owners of many opf the establishments on Soi Romanee and nearby. As one marveled, \"We pay the workers on Friday afternoon and in the evening we get the money back.\" These days it\\'s rather quieter. After many years of neglect the Sino-Portuguese buildings are being gentrified, with bars, cafes, craft shops and offices opening. Some nights there\\'s free live jazz in the street and once a year there\\'s a big street party (see pic) with a Chinese flavour. Oh yes, there is still one brothel, at the north end. But it\\'s pretty sad looking. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740ybrqn19w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[98.389134407,7.88540234084]}},{"properties":{"name":"Soi Romanee revival","description":"Posted by Phukethelp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/3/IMG_0618_%5B640x480%5D.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> In the past few years many buildings on Soi Romanee have been very attractively renovated. The street is also unique in Phuket in that the power lines have been buried - a great improvement. The current Mayor of Phuket Town was born in a house in this road, which may or may not have something to do with it...<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740ybmv5f6x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[98.3891451359,7.88512602863]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thai Hua Museum","description":"Posted by Phukethelp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/12/3/IMG_0627_%5B640x480%5D.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> The Thai Hua Museum is in the former Thai Hua School, a private school founded by and for the local Chinese community.
