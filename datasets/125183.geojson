By using this service, developers gain access to our most current and accurate base data for rendering customized maps.  Our OGC-compliant WMS technology will be provided free of charge and does not require a contract, license agreement or any special software systems - only a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox.  This WMS provides access to five different Framework Data Sets (world, North ciccumpolar region, North America, Canada 7.5 million, and Canada 1 million).  Each Framework Data sets provides is a set of integrated base map layers depicting the locations of features such as hydrology, roads, railways, populated places and administrative boundaries.  A number of non-standard projections are available via this WMS.  They are: 54003 - World Miller Cylindrical, 54004 - World Mercator, 54008 - World Sinusoidal, 54009 - World Mollweide, 54030 - World Robinson, 102016 - North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant, 102017 - North Pole Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area, 102018 - North Pole Stereographic, 102008 - North America Albers Equal Area Conic, and 102009 - North America Lambert Conformal Conic.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/dataservices/web_map_service.html","contact_name":"Peter Bruton","contact_address":"615 Booth Street 6th Floor Room 650\r\nOttawa, Ontario\r\nK1A 0E9\r\nCanada\r\nEmail: info@atlas.gc.ca","source":"Natural Resources Canada","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-13T05:42:20-04:00","id":125183}
