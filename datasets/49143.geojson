She translated Luigi Menabrea\\'s notes on Babbage\\'s machine from Italian, and added her own ideas on how to calculate Bernoulli numbers using the contraption. These notes came to represent the first piece of computer software ever written.\n\nByron also saw potential in Babbage\\'s machine that even the inventor himself never fully imagined. She suggested that the device might \"compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity and extent\". Bands who\\'ve used ProTools probably agree with her.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6d2f09m457y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.135849,51.507647]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aleks Krotoski","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/0/AKwanted.gif\">Malaysiafrom <a href=\"http://crave.cnet.co.uk/0,39029477,49285435,00.htm\">cnet</a>\n\n\nKrotoski is widely respected as one of the top girl geek writers.

Not content with inventing the Mark I Calculator, she wrote the first compiler (broadly, a piece of software that converts text written in a programming language into more efficient machine code). Her invention led to the creation of COBOL. Hopper\\'s contribution to the world of computers cannot be underestimated: she pioneered the idea of using programming languages that bear some relation to the English language, and then using a compiler to convert these into a form that a computer can rapidly digest. While this idea seems obvious to any modern programmer, in Hopper\\'s day it was a completely original philosophy. She also famously discovered a moth causing a computer to malfunction -- the first recorded case of a real computer bug.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6d2f04y5i83"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lisa Simpson","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/0/gallery_Lisa_Simpson_1.jpg\">Springfield, USA(I put in Springfield, USA and let the geocoder do the deciding)\n\nfrom <a href=\"http://crave.cnet.co.uk/0,39029477,49285435,00.htm\">cnet</a>\n\n\nSimpson is possibly the world\\'s most famous geek.

She discovered the elements radium and polonium, but so that others could share in her discovery, she did not patent the process she used to isolate the radium element.

Here they embarked on a ghost-story contest, but Shelley failed to find inspiration and went to bed in a huff. That night, however, she dreamt the plot of Frankenstein, the tale of a scientist who brings a monster to life using parts from \"the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse\".

Her uncle also once attacked Winston Churchill with a dog whip (for unrelated reasons). She went to Cambridge University, but wasn\\'t given a full degree because girls weren\\'t allowed them at the time. Franklin used X-rays to work out the structure of DNA, eventually discovering that helical crystalline DNA (don\\'t ask) did not exist. This meant that she was able to scoff in the faces of other scientists who had mistakenly identified this type of DNA -- and she went so far as to write a comical obituary for the erroneous DNA. Many people believe she was owed a Nobel Prize, but unfortunately she died of cancer before the nominations.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6d2f08odx5i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.03691,51.59502]}},{"properties":{"name":"Валенти́на Влади́мировна (Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/0/200px_Tereshkova.jpg\"> Yaroslavl, Russia<a href=\"http://crave.cnet.co.uk/0,39029477,49285435,00.htm\">from cnet</a>\n\nTereshkova began her life working in a textile factory and ended it as the first woman in space.
