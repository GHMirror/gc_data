At the beginning your commission will equal 10%,\nthough later it will increase up to 12%! For the research, I am\nexpecting about the sum of 5,000 in total from the clients(though the\nmoney will be sent in installment ally due to the progress of my\nresearch).\nYou could make over ,500 for the little time we will be working\ntogether.\n\nADVANTAGES?\nYou don’t have to go out of your present daily activity in order\nto engage in this Job(i.e. you can do this Work easily without\nleaving or affecting your present Job).You will work as an independent\ncontractor right from your home /office.

I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer which was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medication right now and I have only few hours left to live, according to medical experts. I have never particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone not even me but my business. Though I am very rich, but I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and I only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for in my life. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believed when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life in a different way from how I have lived now, but now that God has called me through this way I willed most of my properties and access to my immediate and extended family and as well as few close friends.\n \nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so with that reason I decided to give alms to CHARITY ORGANISATIONS, as I want this to be one of the last good deed I did on earth, so far I have distributed money to some Charity Organization in countries like India and Africa. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.\n \nI once asked my family members to close one of my accounts and distribute the funds which I have there to CHARITY ORGANSATION in Rwanda and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of the funds which no one knows of, is the cash deposit in one of the banks here. I want to know if you can be of good help to dispatch these funds to CHARITY organizations. I have set aside 20% of the total amount ,500,000.00 One million five hundred thousand dollars) for you and your time and patience for carrying out this duties. This means you will keep 00,000 (three hundred thousand dollars) for yourself and donate the rest to any charity organisation. May God be with you as you have decided to take a bold step to heal the world with me or even in my demise. I am going in for an operation now, and I don’t think I will make it.

Mr.\nMorris Thompson aged 61 hailed from Fairbanks, Alaska in United States of\nAmerica. He was one of the states\\'s mostprominent native and business\nleader. All these you are very free to verify from the web link below for\nmore information and clarification about his socio-economic status until\nhis death;\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/\n\n\nBefore the demise of my client, he disclosed to me his account status,\nwhich amounted to  5.5million (Fifteen million five hundred thousand\nUnited States dollars). He also handed over to me some vital copies of\ndocuments regarding this fund already trapped at finance house in EUROPE.\nI was at the last burial rights on February,5th,2000 to pay my final\nrespect to Late Mr.Morris Thompson.There I made thorough inquiries about\nhis relatives but,discovered no one really knows about this fund currently\nsited at EUROPE.\n\nSince then, I have made successive attempts to get his next of kin or\nrelative to come forth and claim this fund but to no avail. As personal\nlawyer to my late client, I cannot in any way claim it unless someone\noverseas does so. Just two weeks ago, I received a routine notification\nfrom the finance house concerning this fund, and the officials of this\nfirm issued a warning, stressing the urgency for late Mr. Morris\nThompson\\'s relative or next of kin to come forward to claim this fund\nimmediately or they will have it confiscated and forwarded to the nation\\'s\ntreasury account as an unclaimed fund.

All\nthrough my life I have been doing business and I was into gold mining and selling. I met our creator and the merciful one Almighty Allah when I was\nhaving a business deal with one of my partners from U.A.E and from the day I\nwas given the Islamic bath (Taw heed) my name changed to Al Ahli Usman.\n\nOn 10th February 2004 myself, family and my business partner took a flight\nfrom Kish to sharjah and we flew kish airline. We had a plane crash and all\nmembers of my family including my friend lost thier lives. I give thanks to\nAllah that i am one of the lucky ones that survived the crash. I had to\nreturn to my home town in Cuba and I am now left with my relatives to take\ncare of me. Owing to the fact that my relatives knows I have reverted to\nIslam, they have left me to suffer in pain and what disturbs me most is\nstroke that I have. I have developed paralyses from my waist region downward now. But thanks to Allah, that He does what He pleases  (HQ: The Great Doer of what He Will. 85:16); and Is never unfair to His Subjects (HQ: Surely Allah Does Not Do Injustice to the weight of an Atom…4: 40) I and my\nbusiness partner had a deal in which he was suppose to make payment to me.\nHe told me he was going to do so with the funds he deposited with a company.\nHis lawyer and mine have already concluded all legal formalities and we were almost done with the release of the funds before the plane crash.\n Owing to my failing health I am taking this bold step to let you know that\nI want to leave in your care the sum of 5Million United States Dollars in\nthe company for the enhancement and propagation of the word of Almighty\nAllah. I have decided to donate these funds to a mosque, or an Islamic\norganization or better still a Moslem that will utilize these funds the way\nI am going to instruct here in.\n\nMy main aim of doing this is for the propagation and upholding of the\nmessage of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon Him). I want these funds to be used for Zakah and for helping the poor in fasting in Ramadhan and performing pilgrimage. Also in the western world, you find out that the message of Allah has not really gotten there. The message of Islam must not only be preached and upheld, but also our youths have to be called back to the right path and thereby reawaken their consciousness. Allah didn’t send Muhammad (peace be upon him) to one particular tribe, but to mankind at large. \n \n Surah #2.254 \"Allah commands His slaves to spend out of what He has\nprovided them in His way, in charity that they may accumulate thier reward\nwith thier lord and proprietor. It is for this reason they should hasten up\nto do in this world before the Day of Resurrection in which neither\nbargaining nor friendship nor intercession shall avail. \n \n No one can bail himself out or can he ransom himself even if he spent, for\nthat purpose, and earth load of gold. Nor can kinship avail him.(#23.101) \n \n Allah Tests His Subjects in many different ways. This He Says in the Holy\nQuran in many Verses. To cite a few: (HQ: And thus Do We Try some of them by others so that they say: Are these they upon whom Allah Has conferred\nBenefit from among us? Does not Allah best know the grateful? 6:53)\n \n (HQ: Do Men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and\nnot be tried? 29:2)\n \n (HQ: And certainly We Tried those before them, so Allah Will certainly Know those who are true and He Will certainly know the liars. 29:3)\n \n (HQ: Whoever hopes to meet Allah, the term appointed by Allah will then\nmost surely come; and He Is the Hearing, the Knowing. 29:5)\n \n (HQ: And whoever strives hard, he strives only for his own soul; most\nsurely Allah Is Self --Sufficient, above (need of) the worlds. 29:6)\n \nHoping to hear from you soonest and do notify me on this Email\n(usman_al@telkom.net) address your interest to help me to propagate Islam.\nAll praise is due to Allah Who brought everything into existence and May the\npeace and blessing of Allah be upon our noble Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) and His virtuous adorers till the day of Judgments.

According to my mother, This money was the income that accrued from minning corporation\\'s over draft and minor sales.\n\nBefore the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels.\nMy father had already made arrangement for his family; my mother, my sister jane and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d\\'Ivoire.\nMy father deposited the fund for  safe custody until after the war when he will join us.\n\nBut During the war in my country, indiscriminate looting of public and Government properties by the\nrebel forces was rampant and the sierra Leone minning co-op. was one of the targets looted and destroyed.My\nfather including other top Government functionaries were attacked and killed by the rebels in November 1999 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.\n\nThe news of my father death, and my uncle,s involvement in an air crash in december 2002 while on a business trip to benin republic caused my mother\nheartfailure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital After we  have spent a\nlot of money on her.\n\nNow my 16-year-old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or\nhelp; Without any relative, we are now like refugees and orphans.\nBefore our mother died, she told us that our father deposited some money which he made from diamond sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that we should pray and find a trust worthy foreign business partner who would help us to transfer and\ninvest this money in profitable business venture overseas.\n\nShe told us to do this quickly so that we can leave Ivory Coast and, then settle  down abroad. She gave us the bank document to prove the deposit and then\ntold us that my father used my name as the beneficiary to the money in  the bank  in the event of his death.\nShe told us that this is the reason why we came to Ivory Coast\n\nI have gone to the bank to make inquires about this money and I spoke  with the Manager of International\nremittance who assured me that everything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money\nto my foreign  partners bank account as soon as I introduce my partner to them .\n\nIf you are willing to assist us, please let us know immediately so that you will arrange the transfer of the money to your account with the  bank.\n\nOur only hope now is in thIS  money our father deposited in the BANK.

Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client\\'s situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\n\nWEBSITE.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.\n\nI am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to. According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.\n\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the million legacy.\n\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours truly\n\nStephen Ayling.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a741brycpjjg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.106167,41.315316]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tasha R Calif","description":"Posted by IramzBahamasDear Lori,   A while back I was let go from my employment I held for many years.
