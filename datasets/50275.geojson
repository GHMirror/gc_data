Barbarossa. Paving stone patterns on the ground of the market place indicate the ground plan of the Renaissance guildhall. It was destroyed during the big blaze in 1726. The fountain on the market place was built by Leonhard Baumhauer in 1570 and rebuilt in 1901 by Carl Lindenberger. A sculpture representing Kaiser Maximilian II. as a knight (1527-1576) is located on the fountain column. In 1576 it was Kaiser Maximilian II. who restituted the constitution for guild trade and democracy of the imperial city Reutlingen.
