It\\'s a long story. Suffice it to say it involved a Business Journals chairman who consulted a psychic, a Lear jet, people in dark suits, a corporate spy and a briefcase pitched surreptitiously into the Willamette River. As Dave Barry would say, I am not making this up. At any rate, I applied to The Oregonian for a job. The HR department called up one of my references, the former managing editor of The Kansas City Star and, by then, executive editor of the Hartford Courant. He called me up and told me he needed a business editor. A month later, I was in Hartford.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vqnrdsmlr3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.686537,41.765599]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kansas City Business Journal, 1982-83","description":"Posted by Swo343a1100 Main St., Kansas City, MO 64105-5123I was recruited away from The Kansas City Star to this start-up weekly business newspaper.

I arrived in Portland from Kansas City with my family on Jan. 1, 1984. We had a paper on the street on March 5, 1984, and 11,000 paid subscribers a year later. Portland was the fourth paper in the American City Business Journals chain. My lunatic bosses (see Hartford Courant entry) back in Kansas City once threatened to fire me as editor for my bad attitude. Instead, I quit on the spot. The next day, they hired me back and promoted me to general manager. Go figure. I was generally clueless as a general manager, but I treated the sales staff to terrific weekly sales meetings at a local bar. During my last year, we launched the weekly Peanut Butter &amp; Jam concerts in Pioneer Courthouse Square. Our administrative assistant, Sue Magnuson, came up with that great name.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6vqnr7hfcix"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.662595,45.523813]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Francisco Business Times, 1987-88","description":"Posted by Swo343a275 Battery St., San Francisco, CA 94111 After discovering that I was not an East Coast kind of guy, I fled back to the West Coast to rejoin the editor who had recruited me to start the Kansas City Business Journal.

Then I headed back to my beloved Pacific Northwest and a job at The Oregonian.
