Cool set, I walked around looking at it durring the days when no one was there. It looked very real and convincing. In fact, when I first saw it I think I muttered a few words of surprise of seeing a plane wreck.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65y239n28b1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-158.223338,21.579071]}},{"properties":{"name":"Beppu, Japan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iansmind.com\" href=\"http://www.iansmind.com\">Ianline</a>When I traveled to Japan I had the most fun in Beppu.

I think I\\'ll stay the night there with you.\" And they were like, \"Right on dude!\" So, there was a colony of home bums (people who build little houses or live in tents) all set up. This one dude was pretty cool. He gave us a mattress to sleep on. It smelt sorta funky, but, I had a sheet and two blankets, so that was cool. Anyway, we got some 40\\'s (Camo &amp; Mickey\\'s Ice) and drank away as we sat there talking about shit. It was sweet. Then morning came... The question was, are we going to get up and walk in the rain to a church that serves breakfast at 7:30 or are we going to stay under the warm sleeping bags and blankets. We stayed there for a while.
