From over 440 participants representing over 220 countries - more countries than participate in the Olympic Games - and through a national qualification and race to become one of the Top 77, as well as the Panel of Experts recommendation of the list of 28 Official Finalist Candidates, the Official New7Wonders of Nature is now in its third and final phase in which the wonders themselves will be chosen by an estimated 1 billion votes. The Official Declaration of the New7Wonders of Nature will be in 2011.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"lon":{"max":167.92849,"mean":34.5426806428571,"variance":6145.68630914746,"stdev":78.3944277939922,"min":-113.236789,"median":35.640527},"lat":{"max":54.073805,"mean":15.64302875,"variance":756.147191904103,"stdev":27.4981306983603,"min":-44.670067,"median":21.933851}},"features":[{"properties":{"lon":-51.872764,"name":"Amazon","country/countries":"VENEZUELA/SURINAME/PERU/GUYANA/FRENCH
