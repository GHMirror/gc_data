The W-W was a response by eastside Portlanders to the electrification of other lines occuring downtown  and up north in the Albina nieghborhood.  As the small companies merged or were folded into larger and larger companies, ending with the PRL&amp;P, the barn was used for storage of little-used equipment and trolleys.
