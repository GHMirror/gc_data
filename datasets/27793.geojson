I pan seared it and (forgot to photograph) let sit in the warming drawer while I was making the scallops. The warming drawer sits at about 200 degrees.

The class involved much less learning to cook for me than it did hearing her talk about salt and the wide forms for salt and saltiness.\n\nShe used finished brines, salty other foods (like capers or pickles), and substitutes like vinegar to serve the role of salt.

They weren\\'t sure what that was, so I told them.  They made a very nice one.

William can\\'t eat cheese, but it was phenomenal.\n\nMy second course was even better.  The Tejon Tender. Char grilled, garlic leek mashers, haricot verts, blue cheese wontons and kecap demi glace.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The leek potatoes were also really good.  And Blue Cheese wontons .... how can you go wrong?\n\nFor dessert I had an amusing event.  Their Tequila Sunrise dessert was a tequila lime mousse in fillo dough and a white chocolate topping and a lime coulis.  So I get it and it was really good - but weird.\n\nSo I asked the waitress what the minty taste was in my dessert.  She looked horrified.  The new pastry chef had apparently put the wrong coulis on.

It was pretty sobering.  \n\nIt made the initially think of my friend Corey who was killed in a car accident in 1990.  Right before he was killed, he told me that his brother Tim had never spoken about his time in Viet Nam, but recently had begun talking to Corey about it.  He was very moved by it.  It was such a powerful thing after so many years.\n\nShortly thereafter, Corey was killed and at the funeral I was a wreck.  But I remember thinking that Tim had waited all this time and was finally able to share that with Corey and now Tim had lost that support.\n\nSo that was .. sobering.  Despite the very strong Pomatini I had.\n\nAfter the film there was music.  Good music.  Excellent music, in fact.
