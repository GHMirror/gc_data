The Paper Calculator provides users with the U.S. average energy and wood consumption and environmental releases of different paper types across their full lifecycle. For each of thirteen major grades of paper and paperboard, it allows the user to compare the environmental impacts of papers made with different levels of recycled content, and to see how using less paper or changing other specifications can reduce environmental impacts. Finally, the Paper Calculator helps users to measure and communicate the environmental benefits of better paper choices. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nari8167"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.987511,40.738517]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fuel Cost Calculator","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>656 Quince Orchard Road, Suite 500Calculates fuel costs and compares savings between two vehicles. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nakjhzow"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.221604,39.140674]}},{"properties":{"name":"Green Tags Calculator","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>133 SW 2nd Avenue, Suite 410, Portland, OR 97204<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nas2t26d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.6725,45.521776]}},{"properties":{"name":"Green Tags Calculator","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>133 SW 2nd Avenue, Suite 410, Portland, OR 97204This calculator helps individuals determine how much CO2 and other greenhouse gasses their activities create. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3nam8ez7c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.6725,45.521776]}},{"properties":{"name":"NERC’s Environmental Benefits Calculator","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.p2ric.org\" href=\"http://www.p2ric.org\">P2ric</a>139 Main Street, Suite 401• Brattleboro, Vermont NERC’s Environmental Benefits Calculator (in Microsoft Excel) generates estimates of the environmental benefits of a study area, based on the tonnages of materials that are source reduced, reused, recycled, landfilled, or incinerated (includes waste-to-energy).
