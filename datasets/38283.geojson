Still lit, the station is completely painted in graffiti and has much of the original equipment inside. To enter, walk half a block southeast on Ridge Avenue. Notice as you walk that there are grates on the sidewalk. Once you see one that has nothing holding it down, pick it up. This usually requires between two and three people, and is a very physical job. After the grate is off, climb through the ventilation shaft and drop down into the station. Be warned, getting out is harder than getting in. It is best to bring a stool with you, and make sure all members of your group are capable of pulling themselves out. Also, trains still run through the station, go on off peak hours.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hz8viwt5t8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.157565,39.961855]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Coffee House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.flickr.com/merrybandofthieves\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/merrybandofthieves\">Bigchimichonga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/10/2/9135_132933057923_640632923_2520300_7068806_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> Front Street and Girard Street Philadelphia PA USAThough it is not clear what the exact purpose was of this building prior to abandonment, the large painted coffee mural on the side has given it it\\'s name of the Coffee House.
