One of the many streets in the city. In South Bohemia (Czech Republic). The city is also known as Budweis --the name in German, used in the 19th century. Ceské Budejovice is famous for its Renaissance and Baroque Buildings, for the biggest square in the Czech Republic (and one of the most beautiful ones in this country, I would add) and for its local beer: Budvar. This local beer, also known as Budweiser, inspired the name of the American Beer Budweiser, but they taste completely different.

Chocen and its close vicinity was settled already in the Bronze Age. Naturally, it was a very scarce settlement just in the strip of the riverbed of Ticha Orlice. Impenetrable primaeval forests did not attract a larger expansion until the 13th century. \r\n\r\n        The original settlement was founded at the place where the romantic river valley, which is braided by hills of Orlicke foothills and Ceskomoravska highlands, ends and where Orlice\\'s [the river] stream sharply changes northwest. It originated on the territory controlled by the mighty Slavnikovec family, later Vrsovec, residing in the near Vraclav. \r\n\r\n        The first mention of Chocen comes from 1227. In the testament of Kojata, the son of Hrabis, a valet of Czech prince, the local land was hand over to new owners, brothers Sezima and Milota, called Hocen. We derive the name of the town - Chocen - from this record. \r\n\r\n        In 1292, Chocen belonged to the king Wenceslas II as a small market town. In an unknown way, Mikulas from Potstejn of the Putic family acquired the town in the beginning of the 14th century and founded a castle here which was later damaged by the troops of prince Karel. Mikulas from Podstejn terrorized with his robberies the whole surrounding area. He perished in the fight with Karel over Potstejn and Chocen fell to the king. \r\n\r\n        During Husite wars, about 70 people were killed and the town was plundered. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n        Since the mid-14th century, a part of the settlement belonged to the Litice castle and the other part to the Zampach castle. The two parts were put together only in 1548, thanks to the Penstejn family. Already in 1407, Chocen resembles the small town that was soon put together with the Chocenek settlement on the left bank of Ticha Orlice. \r\n\r\n        The craft production had an excellent tradition here, especially cutler\\'s, later also paper production. \r\n\r\n        The promising development was disrupted several times by fires. In 1602, 90 houses burned down. In 1659, almost the whole town together with the church burned down and again, in 1725, 30 houses burned down including the church and the square in 1818. In 1646, Swedes plundered the town. \r\n\r\n        A change came only after the arrival of the Kinsky family. Since 1709, Norbert Oktavian the count Kinsky, later becoming the prince, acquired privileges for the town. Beer brewing had an excellent tradition. \r\n\r\n        The marked economic development came only in the beginning of the 18th century. Another boost for the developing industry was the construction of railway tracks thanks to which Chocen became an important railway intersection. In 1845, the track from Olomouc to Prague crossed the town border, the track from Chocen to Broumov was built in 1875, and the track from Chocen to Litomysl came in 1881. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were almost 5500 people in the town and a number of industrial enterprises including a spinning factory, a weaving mill, and factories for production of butcher knives, fire squirts, spirits and artificial flowers. \r\n\r\n        During the World War I, a housing colony was build for Poles and Rusines. After the war, a new town quarter arose there. The World War II and the period after 1948 halted the economic development of the first republic. After the World War Second, the textile industry - spinning factories and weaving mills - and the machine industry, especially airplane and refrigeration car production, have been developing. \r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7j7q5cn0eit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.224403,49.994498]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cool little walk way in Prague 1, Czech Republic","description":"Posted by Knowbeforeyougo<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2c0856b517f5736df82da95dfc96f3ca.jpg\">i just thought this was a cool looking picture of one of the 100\\'s of arechways.

The first signs of the settling of farmers here in the later Stone Age date from the third century B.C. Many relics from later periods, particularly of the life of the people of the cinerary fielsds, are to be seen in to regional museum. In the 10th century the settlement, called Hradec, belonged to the Slavník family. When they were anihilated, it became the property of the Czech princes of the Poemysl family. In 1225 Hradec became a free royal town. It grew rapidly, new trades sprang up, and the size of its population and its importance soon made Hradec the wealthiest and largest Czech town after Prague.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 14th century it became the dower town of the Czech Queens and later the word Králové was added to its name. In the first half of the same century a new landmark arose in the town, the Gothic brick - built cathedral, a sign of royal favour. In 1337 John of Luxemburg conferred on Hradec all the privileges of a royal town.\r\n\r\nA famous chapter in the history of Hradec Králové was the Hussite period. In 1420 it became a Hussite town for a long period and a year later it welcomed the great millitary commander, Jan Žižka of Trocnov, at its gates.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1574 - 1580 another outstanding monument arose, the Renaissance White Tower with the second largest bell in Bohemia, Augustin.\r\n\r\nThe town burned down three times during the 15th and 16th centuries. A new period of development was halted after the Battle of the White Mountain by Swedish troops who attacked the town and occupied it in 1639. Building activity was partly revived again in the latter half of the 17th century when a monumental Baroque church was erected on the town square. War events in the 18th century made it necessary to turn the town into a fortress, this halted the development of Hradec Králové for 100 years and had decisive influence on further building activity. The citadel, erected in 1766 - 89, never fulfilled expectations, particularly not during the 1866 Austro-Prussian war, when one of the largest battles of modern military history took place in Chlum nearby at Sadova. The fortres was therefore abandoned in 1884, dismantled and during the ensuing 20 years torn down.\r\n\r\nIn the first third of the 19th century Hradec Králove became the centre of patriotic activity among the Czechs in the nort-east of Bohemia and, for a time, the most important centre of Czech writing.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the century the town rid itself of its fortifications and a building plan was worked out which was entrusted right from the begining to famous architects. Architect Profesor Jan Kotira built the Municipal Museum in 1909 -12 according to the new urban conception. Another architect Josef Goeár enriched the town with several other buildings. His name is permanently linked with the building - up of Hradec Králové from the mid 1920o when he was entrusted with the job of working out a regulation plan. Right from the beginning the new construction followed comprehensive zoning plans and as a result of this planned development and the strict adherence to zoning stipulations, Hradec Králové became well known at home and abroad. As the years pased, the urban and architectural tradition was formed in the city and became associated mainly with name of Dr. František Ulrich, Mayor of the City for many years. The city reached its pinnacle of nodern architecture during the twenties and thirties when it became renowned as \"The Salon of the Republic\". The variety of town houses with Gothic and Renaissance central parts, baroque and later fronts, an other valuable buildins had the whole headland above the confluence of the Elbe and the Orlice declared as a municipal historical reserve.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7j7q5fsyjj3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[15.811129,50.214042]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hradec Kralove Train Station, Czech Republic","description":"Posted by Knowbeforeyougo<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/101_1748.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/101_1749.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/101_1750.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/101_1751.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/101_1849.jpg\">Here is the main train station for Hradec Kralove.

This great Norman stronghold and bridgehead into Wales was the first castle with a stone keep to be built in Britain by the conquering Normans in 1070. \"Knight\\'s Fee\" manors and castles like Penhow were established to protect the outlying farmlands and give advance warning of any Welsh uprising. The area that is now known as Gwent was settled by families that had come over from France with or in the wake of William the Conqueror, and we know that Sir Roger de St Maur was at Penhow by 1129, for he witnessed the charter that founded the priory of Monmouth in that year. In return for the task of keeping down the Welsh, providing a quota of men for guard duty at Chepstow every month, and for supplying one man mounted on a horse in times of War, Sir Roger was permitted to usurp the Manor of Penhow from its native Welsh prince, and gain a toehold on the feudal ladder. Sir Roger\\'s home was a cold stone Pele tower that stood alone on its rocky knoll, and directly overlooked the conquered natives in their \\'Welshry\\' at Talgarth. It was the first home in Britain of a family destined to become one of the greatest in the land. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7j7q5c2da5q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.833743,51.614179]}},{"properties":{"name":"Polish Czech Border near Nachod, Czech Republic","description":"Posted by Knowbeforeyougo<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/101_1782.jpg\">This is the border crossing from the Czech side going into Poland.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7j7q5dp13wk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.197023,50.429135]}},{"properties":{"name":"Prague, Czech Republic - Prague meridian","description":"Posted by Knowbeforeyougo<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/101_0506.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/101_0504.jpg\">pragueThis is the Prague meridian.
