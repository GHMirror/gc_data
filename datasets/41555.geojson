Jim Wilson, a black man who allegedly assaulted a white woman in Alvin, Illinois (approx. 15 mi. north of Danville), was the target this time. Little did the mob know Sheriff Hardy Whitlock would fire into the crowd of a couple thousand with his shotgun to disperse the furious crowd. Whitlock would later be both loved by some and hated by others for his management of the riot. Many could not believe Whitlock would shoot white men to defend a black criminal, while others, including President Roosevelt, believed what Whitlock had done to terminate the riot was extremely commendable.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a634fu5ljw7f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.62972,40.12291]}},{"properties":{"name":"odd lot #1","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://platialhistory.org\" href=\"http://platialhistory.org\">Hschultz</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/lot.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/lot_KAM.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/3/fulllot.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> This is a lot that is a result of being overtaken by a construction site and parking lot.
