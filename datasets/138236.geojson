West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation (WVHTCF) will be required to: (1) Design  code  test  and document ARTS-III software and hardware modifications. (2) Support integration testing of the ARTS III with the Predator flight control system.  (3)Support flight test of the ARTS III and ARTS Manager systems. (4)Support the assessment of new technologies and demonstrations that could use the ARTS III system  identifying the workload  feasibility  cost  and modifications required to execute potential ARTS-hosted experiments. (5)Create an interface with the ARTS III software that allows an experimenter to create a new ARTS-based flight control software load using auto-coded Simulink.  The objective is to support autonomous control aircraft operations using systems developed under this contract in support of the Ikhana project.  To assist in this objective WVHTCF will: (1) Maintain ARTS-III and ARTS Manager Systems to Support Ikhana Operations. (2) Assess potential experiments that will use the ARTS.

(Touchstone) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam  which results in heating. This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens  as well as by reducing costs  weight  and improving composite part quality.  The overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials. The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed  fabricated  tested  and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven. The SCS demonstration tool will be up to an 8' diameter and 12' length mandrel  which will be approximately one-forth of the scale as a tool necessary for an ARES V composite structure.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.455,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"TOUCHSTONE RESEARCH LABORATORY","recipientcity":"TRIADELPHIA","id":"a6a0w6328x4g","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2010","granularity":"year","time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2010/01/14 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1/13/2010","granularity":"day","time":"2010/01/13 00:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.616965,40.060272]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":150000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"261649802","recipientaddressline123":"RTE 2 S CENTURY RD","projectdescription":"Ingot of Aluminum-Lithium Alloy 2050 Plate  approx. 10 000 pounds  rolled to 4' thick plate  and processed to T8 temper","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.49,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"RIO TINTO PLC","recipientcity":"RAVENSWOOD","id":"a6a0w69c7wvq","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2009","granularity":"year","time":"2009/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2009/03/18 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/17/2009","granularity":"day","time":"2009/03/17 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.794105,39.047525]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":150000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"265053352","recipientaddressline123":"3168 COLLINS FERRY RD","projectdescription":"SOFTWARE ASSURANCE TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE FOR THE NASA SAFETY CENTER AT GLENN RESEARCH CENTER.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.927,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"KEYLOGIC SYSTEMS  INC.","recipientcity":"MORGANTOWN","id":"a6a0w5utwqa6","geo_precision":"range","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2012/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2011","granularity":"year","time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2011/04/30 00:00:00 -0400","original":"4/29/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/04/29 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.971537,39.656732]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":149999.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":4900,"recipientzipcode":"260599707","recipientaddressline123":"RR 1 BOX 100B","projectdescription":"SBIR Phase I:  Microalgae-based Biofuel Utilizing Zooplankton Lipid Assimilation","contractingagency":"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","geo_score":0.455,"recipientcountyname":"OHIO","recipientname":"TOUCHSTONE RESEARCH LABORATORY","recipientcity":"Triadelphia","id":"a6a0w5yr6h5p","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2010","granularity":"year","time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":"944387","datesigned":{"end_time":"2009/11/19 00:00:00 -0500","original":"11/18/2009","granularity":"day","time":"2009/11/18 00:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.616965,40.060272]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":149940.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":4900,"recipientzipcode":"265066845","recipientaddressline123":"P.O.

SBIR Phase II project entitled 'Titanium Matrix Composite Pressure Vessel' For over fifteen years  FMW Composite Systems has developed Metal Matrix Composite manufacturing methodologies for fabricating silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced titanium components  also known as Titanium Matrix Composites (TMC)  for the aerospace industry. These efforts have resulted in successfully flight qualifying three TMC components  including a piston rod used in the divergent exhaust nozzle actuator for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine  and two exhaust nozzle actuator links for the GE F110 engine. TMC weight savings over the monolithic titanium and steel components being replaced typically varies from 35% to 45%  depending upon the application load requirements. The relatively low density of TMC combined with its excellent mechanical behavior  results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems. Additionally  creep resistance of TMC is dramatically enhanced over monolithic titanium due to the presence of the SiC Fibers  which do not exhibit discernible creep at the temperature regime of interest. Currently  FMW is working closely with the aerospace industry to develop TMC structural components for both Military and Commercial airframe applications. FMW proposes to use this same technology to work with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop a TMC pressure vessel for the Venus Lander Mission. The objective of this Phase II program is to further demonstrate the panel joining process (to create a hemisphere) by sandwiching consolidated TMC panels with monolithic edges between monolithic titanium sheets. The assembly is then HIP consolidated  yielding a one-piece spherical-shaped dome. The highest risk in the assembly concept stems from the complexity introduced by the joining method to the assembly process. The underlying theory in this approach assumes external pressure is the dominant loading mechanism. This assumption implies that the loads at the joints between the reinforced sections would be compressive  thus causing the assembly to essentially lock in place with the application of an external load.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.571,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"AERO CORPORATION","recipientcity":"BRIDGEPORT","id":"a6a0w5w2foou","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2009/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2008","granularity":"year","time":"2008/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2008/06/28 00:00:00 -0400","original":"6/27/2008","granularity":"day","time":"2008/06/27 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.2428,39.293153]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":125000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":4900,"recipientzipcode":"265066845","recipientaddressline123":"P.O.

(Touchstone) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam  which results in heating. This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens  as well as by reducing costs  weight  and improving composite part quality.  The overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials. The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed  fabricated  tested  and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven.

(Touchstone) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam  which results in heating. This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens  as well as by reducing costs  weight  and improving composite part quality.  The overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials. The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed  fabricated  tested  and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven.

SBIR Phase II project entitled 'Titanium Matrix Composite Pressure Vessel' For over fifteen years  FMW Composite Systems has developed Metal Matrix Composite manufacturing methodologies for fabricating silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced titanium components  also known as Titanium Matrix Composites (TMC)  for the aerospace industry. These efforts have resulted in successfully flight qualifying three TMC components  including a piston rod used in the divergent exhaust nozzle actuator for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine  and two exhaust nozzle actuator links for the GE F110 engine. TMC weight savings over the monolithic titanium and steel components being replaced typically varies from 35% to 45%  depending upon the application load requirements. The relatively low density of TMC combined with its excellent mechanical behavior  results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems. Additionally  creep resistance of TMC is dramatically enhanced over monolithic titanium due to the presence of the SiC Fibers  which do not exhibit discernible creep at the temperature regime of interest. Currently  FMW is working closely with the aerospace industry to develop TMC structural components for both Military and Commercial airframe applications. FMW proposes to use this same technology to work with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop a TMC pressure vessel for the Venus Lander Mission. The objective of this Phase II program is to further demonstrate the panel joining process (to create a hemisphere) by sandwiching consolidated TMC panels with monolithic edges between monolithic titanium sheets. The assembly is then HIP consolidated  yielding a one-piece spherical-shaped dome. The highest risk in the assembly concept stems from the complexity introduced by the joining method to the assembly process. The underlying theory in this approach assumes external pressure is the dominant loading mechanism. This assumption implies that the loads at the joints between the reinforced sections would be compressive  thus causing the assembly to essentially lock in place with the application of an external load.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.571,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"AERO CORPORATION","recipientcity":"BRIDGEPORT","id":"a6a0w5v5k464","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2009","granularity":"year","time":"2009/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2008/11/22 00:00:00 -0500","original":"11/21/2008","granularity":"day","time":"2008/11/21 00:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.2428,39.293153]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":100000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"260599707","recipientaddressline123":"RR 1 BOX 100B","projectdescription":"TAS::80 0123::TAS Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) materials offer tremendous potential for lightweight propellant and pressurant tankage for space applications. Thin MMC liners for COPVs would have enough strength to withstand tensile loading at maximum expected operating pressure (MEOP) and compressive loading at zero pressure without buckling. Thus  performance benefits would be expected when compared to aluminum  titanium  and stainless steel liners. Touchstone proposes to team with Carleton Technologies Pressure Vessel Division (part of the Cobham Life Support Division  Westminster  MD) to extend current MMC technology into the area of lightweight  multifunctional pressure vessels that can minimize propulsion system mass growth and achieve the efficiencies that will make future propulsion systems viable. The development of improved cryotanks can easily be extended to programs within the Departments of Defense and to private industry. The successful completion of the proposed work will expedite the implementation of this enabling technology into aerospace  military  and commercial application","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.455,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"TOUCHSTONE RESEARCH LABORATORY","recipientcity":"TRIADELPHIA","id":"a6a0w5w40z4g","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2010","granularity":"year","time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2010/01/30 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1/29/2010","granularity":"day","time":"2010/01/29 00:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.616965,40.060272]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":99999.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"260599707","recipientaddressline123":"RR 1 BOX 100B","projectdescription":"Carbon Foam Self-Heated Tooling for Out-of-Autoclave Composites Manufacturing This proposal addresses NASA's need for non-autoclave composites manufacture. The Constellation program  including the Ares V launch vehicle  will require very large-scale structures and conventional autoclave-based composites which are very costly and suffer from logistical problems. Out of autoclave (OOA) composite manufacturing technology has the potential to solve the constraint issues of autoclave processes without suffering performance issues. However  several critical issues remain a technical challenge  and further development is required to bring OOA into the mainstream of composites manufacturing. Touchstone proposes to demonstrate that a composite tool made from its carbon foam materials can be self-heated by passing an electric current through the tool body  thereby heating only the tool and part and not requiring an autoclave or oven for curing. In Phase 1  a small prototype tool will be built and tested for self-heating performance in comparison to a conventional autoclave cure cycle on the same tool. Specific resin systems suited for OOA processing will be utilized  and performance properties of composite samples produced by both the self-heated carbon foam tool and a conventional carbon foam autoclave tool will be characterized. At the end of Phase 1  the TRL will be 4  and by the conclusion of Phase 2  the TRL will reach 6.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.455,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"TOUCHSTONE RESEARCH LABORATORY LTD (INC)","recipientcity":"TRIADELPHIA","id":"a6a0w6age2a0","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2009","granularity":"year","time":"2009/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2009/01/10 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1/9/2009","granularity":"day","time":"2009/01/09 00:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.616965,40.060272]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":99994.96,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"263309687","recipientaddressline123":"1200 W BENEDUM INDUSTRIAL","projectdescription":"IN SITU PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGIES. SBIR PHASE I. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO FURTHER DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY INCORPORATING CURVED TMC PANELS INTO A HEMISPHERICAL PRESSURE VESSEL. FMW PROPOSES TO PERFORM DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING TRADE STUDIES  EXECUTE RISK ANALYSES AND MANUFACTURE A CURVED TMC PANEL WITH AN INTEGRALLY BONDED MONOLITHIC STRUCTURAL ATTACHMENT POINT. THE ANTICIPATED PRESSURE VESSEL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW: - NOMINAL OUTSIDE DIAMETER IS 90 cm (35.43 in) - SHELL MUST WITHSTAND 90 ATMOSPHERES (~1 500 psi) EXTERNAL PRESSURE AND 486'C (~900'F) EXTERNAL TEMPERATURE - PRESSURE VESSEL MUST BE HERMETICALLY SEALED AND RESISTANT TO A SULFURIC ACID ENVIRONMENT - MUST ACCOMMODATE SMALL CAMERA WINDOWS  LIFTING LUGS  STRUCTURAL ATTACHMENT POINTS ON INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF SHELL  ELECTRICAL FEED-THROUGH - MAY BE SECTIONED IN TWO OR THREE PIECES CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART MANUFACTURING PROCESSES ALLOW THE FABRICATION OF FLAT OR SIMPLE CURVATURE PANEL STRUCTURES WITH MULTIPLE FIBER DIRECTIONS AND TUBULAR PARTS WITH FIBERS ALIGNED ALONG THE AXIS AND AROUND THE DIAMETER. COMPOUND CURVED PARTS  SUCH AS THE HEMISPHERE REQUIRED FOR THE VENUS LANDER PRESSURE VESSEL  REQUIRE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS DO NOT ALLOW THE DIRECT LAYUP AND CONSOLIDATION OF A HEMISPHERE USING CONTINUOUS FLAT SHEET TMC PREFORM USED IN MANUFACTURING TUBES OF FLAT STRUCTURE. ADDITIONALLY  BECAUSE TMC IS NOT READILY MACHINED AND IS NOT WELDABLE  METHODS OF INCORPORATING INTEGRAL ATTACHMENTS AND FEED-THROUGHS MUST BE DEVELOPED. THE PRIMARY APPROACH TO MITIGATE LAYUP AND CONSOLIDATION ISSUES IS TO MANUFACTURE INDIVIDUAL PANEL;S THAT ARE SUBSEQUENTLY JOINED IN A SECONDARY DIFFUSION BONDING P[ERATION. tHIS APPROACH BUILDS ON FMW'S CURRENT CAPABILITY TO FABRICATE FLAT OR SIMPLE CURVED PANELS  WHILE KEEPING THE CURVATURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PANEL SMALL ENOUGH TO ALLOW LAYUP AND CONTROL OF THE FIBERS AND MATRIX (AS DEMONSTRATED IN JPL SUBCONTRACT #1281410). THE JOINING PROCESS COULD EITHER UTILIZE A METHOD OF SANDWICHING CONSOLIDATED TMC PANELS WITH MONOLITHIC EDGES BETWEEN MONOLITHIC TITANIUM SHEETS  OR LAYING UP 'GREEN' TMC PANELS INTO A SINGLE

SBIR Phase II project entitled 'Titanium Matrix Composite Pressure Vessel' For over fifteen years  FMW Composite Systems has developed Metal Matrix Composite manufacturing methodologies for fabricating silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced titanium components  also known as Titanium Matrix Composites (TMC)  for the aerospace industry. These efforts have resulted in successfully flight qualifying three TMC components  including a piston rod used in the divergent exhaust nozzle actuator for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine  and two exhaust nozzle actuator links for the GE F110 engine. TMC weight savings over the monolithic titanium and steel components being replaced typically varies from 35% to 45%  depending upon the application load requirements. The relatively low density of TMC combined with its excellent mechanical behavior  results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems. Additionally  creep resistance of TMC is dramatically enhanced over monolithic titanium due to the presence of the SiC Fibers  which do not exhibit discernible creep at the temperature regime of interest. Currently  FMW is working closely with the aerospace industry to develop TMC structural components for both Military and Commercial airframe applications. FMW proposes to use this same technology to work with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop a TMC pressure vessel for the Venus Lander Mission. The objective of this Phase II program is to further demonstrate the panel joining process (to create a hemisphere) by sandwiching consolidated TMC panels with monolithic edges between monolithic titanium sheets. The assembly is then HIP consolidated  yielding a one-piece spherical-shaped dome. The highest risk in the assembly concept stems from the complexity introduced by the joining method to the assembly process. The underlying theory in this approach assumes external pressure is the dominant loading mechanism. This assumption implies that the loads at the joints between the reinforced sections would be compressive  thus causing the assembly to essentially lock in place with the application of an external load.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.571,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"AERO CORPORATION","recipientcity":"BRIDGEPORT","id":"a6a0w650qdd2","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2009/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2008","granularity":"year","time":"2008/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2008/05/01 00:00:00 -0400","original":"4/30/2008","granularity":"day","time":"2008/04/30 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.2428,39.293153]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":75000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"263309687","recipientaddressline123":"1200 W BENEDUM INDUSTRIAL","projectdescription":"SAP Purchase Requisition: 4200288176 Modification No. 6 that adds incremental funds.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.571,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"AERO CORPORATION","recipientcity":"BRIDGEPORT","id":"a6a0w62cefcx","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2009","granularity":"year","time":"2009/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2009/04/01 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/31/2009","granularity":"day","time":"2009/03/31 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.2428,39.293153]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":75000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"265548331","recipientaddressline123":"1000 TECHNOLOGY DRIVE SUITE 3220","projectdescription":"SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT SUPPORT SERVICES","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.359,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"INNOVATIVE MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICES  LLC","recipientcity":"FAIRMONT","id":"a6a0w5ye5m7f","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2006/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2005","granularity":"year","time":"2005/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2005/01/15 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1/14/2005","granularity":"day","time":"2005/01/14 00:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.932526,39.635867]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":75000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"260599707","recipientaddressline123":"1142 MIDDLE CREEK RD","projectdescription":"COMPOSITE OVERWRAPPED PRESSURE VESSELS (COPVS) ARE USED FOR STORING PRESSURIZED GASES ON BOARD SPACECRAFT WHEN MASS SAVING IS A KEY REQUIREMENT.

SBIR Phase II project entitled 'Titanium Matrix Composite Pressure Vessel' For over fifteen years  FMW Composite Systems has developed Metal Matrix Composite manufacturing methodologies for fabricating silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced titanium components  also known as Titanium Matrix Composites (TMC)  for the aerospace industry. These efforts have resulted in successfully flight qualifying three TMC components  including a piston rod used in the divergent exhaust nozzle actuator for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine  and two exhaust nozzle actuator links for the GE F110 engine. TMC weight savings over the monolithic titanium and steel components being replaced typically varies from 35% to 45%  depending upon the application load requirements. The relatively low density of TMC combined with its excellent mechanical behavior  results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems. Additionally  creep resistance of TMC is dramatically enhanced over monolithic titanium due to the presence of the SiC Fibers  which do not exhibit discernible creep at the temperature regime of interest. Currently  FMW is working closely with the aerospace industry to develop TMC structural components for both Military and Commercial airframe applications. FMW proposes to use this same technology to work with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop a TMC pressure vessel for the Venus Lander Mission. The objective of this Phase II program is to further demonstrate the panel joining process (to create a hemisphere) by sandwiching consolidated TMC panels with monolithic edges between monolithic titanium sheets. The assembly is then HIP consolidated  yielding a one-piece spherical-shaped dome. The highest risk in the assembly concept stems from the complexity introduced by the joining method to the assembly process. The underlying theory in this approach assumes external pressure is the dominant loading mechanism. This assumption implies that the loads at the joints between the reinforced sections would be compressive  thus causing the assembly to essentially lock in place with the application of an external load.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.571,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"AERO CORPORATION","recipientcity":"BRIDGEPORT","id":"a6a0w6761xly","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2009/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2008","granularity":"year","time":"2008/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2007/12/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"11/30/2007","granularity":"day","time":"2007/11/30 00:00:00 -0500"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.2428,39.293153]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":50000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"265548831","recipientaddressline123":"1000 TECHNOLOGY DR STE 3220","projectdescription":"Providing technical services in the areas of software and systems engineering  software tool development and maintenance  and technical analysis.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.379,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"INNOVATIVE MGT AND TECH SVC","recipientcity":"FAIRMONT","id":"a6a0w63j67jt","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2012/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2011","granularity":"year","time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2010/10/05 00:00:00 -0400","original":"10/4/2010","granularity":"day","time":"2010/10/04 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.948929,39.623044]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":50000.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"265548824","recipientaddressline123":"1000 TECHNOLOGY DR STE 8000","projectdescription":"LEASE FOR OFFICE SPACE FOR IV&amp;V PROGRAM","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.379,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"HT FOUNDATION HOLDING","recipientcity":"FAIRMONT","id":"a6a0w5uqzjen","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2012/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2011","granularity":"year","time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2011/04/30 00:00:00 -0400","original":"4/29/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/04/29 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.948929,39.623044]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":49997.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"265548825","recipientaddressline123":"1000 TECHNOLOGY DRIVE SUITE 3140","projectdescription":"PROVIDE SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCED SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES (ASSET)","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.359,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"PROLOGIC  INC.","recipientcity":"FAIRMONT","id":"a6a0w5zl0nhn","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2006/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2005","granularity":"year","time":"2005/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2005/09/23 00:00:00 -0400","original":"9/22/2005","granularity":"day","time":"2005/09/22 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.932526,39.635867]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":49946.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":1330,"recipientzipcode":"268080068","recipientaddressline123":"P.O.

(TOUCHSTONE) HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE OUT-OF-AUTOCLAVE (OOA) COMPOSITES MANUFACTURING PROCESS WITH AN ELECTRICALLY HEATED CARBON FOAM TOOLING SYSTEM. ELECTRICALLY HEATED TOOLING (EHT) UTILIZES A COAL-BASED CARBON FOAM (CFOAMREG) CORE THAT SERVES AS BOTH THE TOOL SUBSTRATE AND THE HEATING SOURCE FOR A COMPOSITE PART BEING CURED. THE TOOL HEATING IS A RESULT OF FLOWING CURRENT THROUGH THE CARBON FOAM  WHICH RESULTS IN HEATING. THIS APPROACH TO SELF-HEATED TOOLING IS A POTENTIALLY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR MANUFACTURING LARGE COMPOSITE STRUCTURES BY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR AUTOCLAVES AND LARGE CURING OVENS  AS WELL AS BY REDUCING COSTS  WEIGHT  AND IMPROVING COMPOSITE PART QUALITY.  THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE NASA PHASE 2 PROGRAM WILL BE TO OPTIMIZE CRITICAL FACTORS FOR THERMAL UNIFORMITY IN A CFOAM ELECTRICALLY HEATED TOOL (EHT) AND TO VALIDATE THE ELECTRICALLY HEATED CURE PROCESS WITH CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART OOA MATERIALS. THE DATA GENERATED WILL BE USED TO PRODUCE A SCALED COMPOSITE SHROUD (SCS) CYLINDRICAL MANDREL EHT THAT WILL BE DESIGNED  FABRICATED  TESTED  AND USED TO CURE A LARGE COMPOSITE PART WITHOUT AN AUTOCLAVE OR OVEN. THE SCS DEMONSTRATION TOOL WILL BE UP TO AN 8' DIAMETER AND 12' LENGTH MANDREL  WHICH WILL BE APPROXIMATELY ONE-FORTH OF THE SCALE AS A TOOL NECESSARY FOR AN ARES V COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.455,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"TOUCHSTONE RESEARCH LABORATORY","recipientcity":"TRIADELPHIA","id":"a6a0w60ksiju","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2012/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2011","granularity":"year","time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2011/05/27 00:00:00 -0400","original":"5/26/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/05/26 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.616965,40.060272]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":43503.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":4900,"recipientzipcode":"265066845","recipientaddressline123":null,"projectdescription":"INTERFACE FRACTURE OF CONCRETE EXTERNALLY-REINFORCED WITH COMPOSITE MATERIALS","contractingagency":"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","geo_score":1.0,"recipientcountyname":"MONONGALIA","recipientname":"WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY RESEARCH","recipientcity":"MORGANTOWN","id":"a6a0w6907xf7","geo_precision":"zip","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2001/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2000","granularity":"year","time":"2000/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":"CMS-9970008","datesigned":{"end_time":"2000/06/07 00:00:00 -0400","original":"6/6/2000","granularity":"day","time":"2000/06/06 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.962669,39.645276]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":43478.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"26506","recipientaddressline123":null,"projectdescription":"X-RAY OBSERVATIONS OF A NEW CLAS OF RADIO BURSTING NEUTRON STARS","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":1.0,"recipientcountyname":"MONONGALIA COUNTY","recipientname":"WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY RESEARCH","recipientcity":"MORGANTOWN","id":"a6a0w621w239","geo_precision":"zip","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2007/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2006","granularity":"year","time":"2006/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":"NNX06AG20G","datesigned":{"end_time":"2006/10/01 00:00:00 -0400","original":"9/30/2006","granularity":"day","time":"2006/09/30 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.962669,39.645276]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":43313.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":4900,"recipientzipcode":"265066845","recipientaddressline123":null,"projectdescription":"CAREER: A NOVEL LIQUID CRYSTAL SYSTEM FOR CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS","contractingagency":"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","geo_score":1.0,"recipientcountyname":"MONONGALIA COUNTY","recipientname":"WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY RESEARCH","recipientcity":"MORGANTOWN","id":"a6a0w63wz2fj","geo_precision":"zip","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2004/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2003","granularity":"year","time":"2003/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":"CHE-0307245-000","datesigned":{"end_time":"2003/05/02 00:00:00 -0400","original":"5/1/2003","granularity":"day","time":"2003/05/01 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.962669,39.645276]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":43053.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":4900,"recipientzipcode":"265066845","recipientaddressline123":"P.O.

(Touchstone) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam  which results in heating. This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens  as well as by reducing costs  weight  and improving composite part quality.  The overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials. The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed  fabricated  tested  and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven. The SCS demonstration tool will be up to an 8' diameter and 12' length mandrel  which will be approximately one-forth of the scale as a tool necessary for an ARES V composite structure.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.455,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"TOUCHSTONE RESEARCH LABORATORY","recipientcity":"TRIADELPHIA","id":"a6a0w5yn1cxy","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2012/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2011","granularity":"year","time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2010/10/23 00:00:00 -0400","original":"10/22/2010","granularity":"day","time":"2010/10/22 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.616965,40.060272]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":39893.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"26554","recipientaddressline123":null,"projectdescription":"CLUSTERING AND ADVANCED VISUAL ENVIRONMENT (CAVE)","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.857,"recipientcountyname":"MARION COUNTY","recipientname":"INSTITUTE SCIENTIFIC RES","recipientcity":"FAIRMONT","id":"a6a0w5vwp72s","geo_precision":"zip","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2004/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2003","granularity":"year","time":"2003/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":"NCC5557","datesigned":{"end_time":"2003/10/01 00:00:00 -0400","original":"9/30/2003","granularity":"day","time":"2003/09/30 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.081742,39.480363]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":39463.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":8000,"recipientzipcode":"264522128","recipientaddressline123":"27 GARTON PLAZA","projectdescription":"The NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) Facility in Fairmont  WV  has established the Knowledge and Program Management Office.

(Touchstone) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam  which results in heating. This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens  as well as by reducing costs  weight  and improving composite part quality.  The overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials. The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed  fabricated  tested  and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven. The SCS demonstration tool will be up to an 8' diameter and 12' length mandrel  which will be approximately one-forth of the scale as a tool necessary for an ARES V composite

SBIR Phase II project entitled 'Titanium Matrix Composite Pressure Vessel' For over fifteen years  FMW Composite Systems has developed Metal Matrix Composite manufacturing methodologies for fabricating silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced titanium components  also known as Titanium Matrix Composites (TMC)  for the aerospace industry. These efforts have resulted in successfully flight qualifying three TMC components  including a piston rod used in the divergent exhaust nozzle actuator for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine  and two exhaust nozzle actuator links for the GE F110 engine. TMC weight savings over the monolithic titanium and steel components being replaced typically varies from 35% to 45%  depending upon the application load requirements. The relatively low density of TMC combined with its excellent mechanical behavior  results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems. Additionally  creep resistance of TMC is dramatically enhanced over monolithic titanium due to the presence of the SiC Fibers  which do not exhibit discernible creep at the temperature regime of interest. Currently  FMW is working closely with the aerospace industry to develop TMC structural components for both Military and Commercial airframe applications. FMW proposes to use this same technology to work with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop a TMC pressure vessel for the Venus Lander Mission. The objective of this Phase II program is to further demonstrate the panel joining process (to create a hemisphere) by sandwiching consolidated TMC panels with monolithic edges between monolithic titanium sheets. The assembly is then HIP consolidated  yielding a one-piece spherical-shaped dome. The highest risk in the assembly concept stems from the complexity introduced by the joining method to the assembly process.

(Touchstone) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam  which results in heating. This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens  as well as by reducing costs  weight  and improving composite part quality.  The overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials. The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed  fabricated  tested  and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven. The SCS demonstration tool will be up to an 8' diameter and 12' length mandrel  which will be approximately one-forth of the scale as a tool necessary for an ARES V composite structure.","contractingagency":"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION","geo_score":0.455,"recipientcountyname":null,"recipientname":"TOUCHSTONE RESEARCH LABORATORY","recipientcity":"TRIADELPHIA","id":"a6a0w5zra5o4","geo_precision":"street","fiscalyear":{"end_time":"2012/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2011","granularity":"year","time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"federalawardid":null,"datesigned":{"end_time":"2011/03/25 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/24/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/24 00:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.616965,40.060272]}},{"properties":{"dollarsobligated":12461.0,"recipientstate":"West Virginia","contractingagencycode":1330,"recipientzipcode":"25305","recipientaddressline123":null,"projectdescription":"OHIO RIVER PADDLEFISH CHARACTERISTICS ASSESSMENT","contractingagency":"Natl.
