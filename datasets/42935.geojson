She was going to spend part of the break at home in Chicago with family and old friends, and then fly to Minneapolis to visit with three of our sorority sisters.  The first Saturday home she went with her parents to visit her grandfather.  Though he had been diagnosed with cancer, he was doing well, and living with his wife, who suffers from Alzheimer’s, in an assisted living facility.  They had a great, if normal, day together catching up on everyone’s life and eating lunch.  But Katie had a weird feeling all day, and she even called her brother who was unable to make it, when they got home.  She told him that she just couldn’t shake an unspoken impression, and that he should stop putting off going to visit their grandparents.  He was sufficiently weirded out, and made plans to make the hour and a half drive the following weekend.  But that wasn’t soon enough… Wednesday morning Katie’s parents received a phone call that her grandfather had passed away in his sleep.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67vrmtl12jc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.04761,42.11484]}},{"properties":{"name":"2 Family Meeting","description":"Posted by Dwright1<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Along with the stress of funeral arrangements and updating family members, Katie and her parents also had to have a family meeting to decide how to best take care of her grandmother.  Because of her Alzheimer’s and age, they needed to come up with a way to make sure she was happy and healthy.  One morning they had all the vital family members come over to their house.  Her parents put out fresh flowers and orange juice.  They bought Burger King breakfast and Krispy Kremes, just like her grandfather always used to buy for breakfast when grandkids or relatives came to visit.  \n\nOne of the most difficult tasks before them was to sort through his things from his and his wife\\'s room at the living center.  She found a Valentine\\'s day card she\\'d drawn for him when she was in third grade and a little clay alligator she\\'d painted for him.  It hurt to see these objects that were meant for his hands and eyes being packed away in boxes and carefully labeled for storage or goodwill.  But then family members started telling funny and amazing stories about Katie\\'s grandfather, like the time he saved his brother\\'s life in the war by having them both transferred to a unit that suffered almost no losses instead of the unit they were in that was almost completely destroyed.  He had been smart and caring, dedicated to his wife, responsible, and infinitely proud and loving of his family.  \n\nCards and alligators and stories wouldn\\'t be near enough to satisfy his family in the absence of his presence.  But his life can be remembered and cherished because of those things.  \n\nKatie brought home the Valentine\\'s card and stuck it in the corner of her bedroom mirror.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67vrmjbfshq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.00959,42.11354]}},{"properties":{"name":"3United Center","description":"Posted by Dwright11901 W.

She went to the first round of NCAA tournaments at the United Center and tried to relax and enjoy the game with her brother.  She loved the smell of perfectly inflated basketballs, sweaty uniforms, concession stand food and beer.  Due to the two hour break between the four games, most of the fans went out to the bars and got loaded before returning to their seats.  One seventy year old man who’d had a few too many tried to make it up the stairs to his stadium seating as Kaite was making her way down.  The man tripped on his drunken feet and went sprawling into the aisle.  As he fell, he reached out for something to steady himself and landed on Katie’s chest.  Not only did she now smell too much like beer and nachos, but a man old enough to be her grandfather just copped a feel in front of an entire stadium of people and her older brother.

Katie missed coming to this hot and busy restaurant when she was in Valpo, and it was a nice treat to visit before leaving home.  They ate taco salads and talked about themed parties, as we are planning to have another one in April and we’re running out of ideas.  When her parents were in college, they threw involved parties for their friends and carried themes to the extreme.  Once they threw a racing party where her father created an elaborate chart of horses and jockeys and everyone dressed in old-fashioned hats and suits and wagered on horse races.  They also threw disco parties, a circus party with fair food and real carousel horses, and a slew of other creative get-togethers.  Katie brought home the idea of an 80’s party for the spring.

They walked through the skyway and saw the general manager of the Timberwolves, but those were minor occurrences compared with what happened as they sipped their Caribou coffee.

She thought it was nice to return to her own quiet space after such a tumultuous break.  In a couple weeks, she’d lost her grandfather and traveled to a new city.

I can’t believe that yesterday it was balmy and warm, and today I’m brushing snowflakes from my eyelashes.  This area never ceases to amuse and baffle me.  The turn of weather and unrelenting wind only adds to the strange atmosphere on campus—a place where I literally could not figure out how to get to one of my classes yesterday.  I went to the library this morning and headed up to the fourth floor, where I can usually look out of the windows and over the balcony to a beautifully laid out campus.  This is the first time I’d been up there in awhile, and my view was quite different than usual.  I’ve seen the construction on campus; I’ve complained and wondered with everybody else, but seeing it from a bird’s eye was a new experience.  I looked out at all the places I’ve become familiar with in the last four years, and I felt sad to see it so changed, to know that in a year or two years, this place will look and feel familiar to someone else.  A new group of students will keep coming in and making friends and starting traditions and making this place their own.  I’ve always looked forward to graduation and getting out of here—not because I hate Valpo or don’t appreciate my friends or experiences, but I’ve always been eager for the next step.  I’m far from home and want to get back to my family.  I’m engaged and looking forward to marriage and kids and dogs.  But I feel faced with my own mortality today.

Though they live in the same town as me, and not too many miles away, they might as well live in another country, another world, another universe.  While I find my own apartment an undeserved luxury with it’s three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and modest living and cooking areas, this house puts anything I’ve known to shame.  It’s two houses wide with three spacious floors.  Each floor has its own set of rooms, bathrooms, and recreational space.  Though the family has two children under the age of three and three obnoxious rottweiler dogs, they still insist on every toy being in its place, every rug vacuumed, every germ killed.  There’s always something going on here, but its always pure chaos and uncontrolled energy.  They have more money than anyone I’ve ever met in my life, literally… they can (and do) afford anything they want, no expenses spared.  When I park my slightly beat-up 1996 Sunfire in their driveway, it makes its own statement among their foreign cars and SUV’s.  I’m not jealous of their money or their life, like I thought I would be.  Even though they can buy whatever they want, they don’t see the falling snow the way that I do—new every winter, catching glints of sunshine, magically declaring Christmastime to the neighborhood every season.  They don’t appreciate proximity to Chicago the way I do—through a foreigners eyes, exciting expectations, mysterious wonder.

I don’t mind Valpo or Indiana, not the way other students seem to mind this town.

A majority of the pictures were of men dressed in drag—outlandish gold eyelashes, obnoxious bosoms, garish red lipstick, and huge blue hair.  The disguised men looked almost creepy in the glare from their glitter—smiling out at the camera, ignoring the pain of the place around them.  It made me think that something about a place, something inside people, never really changes.  We can suffer a huge loss and devastation, and still get fired up to dress like a woman, tucking inconvenient anatomy into the refuge of costumes.  These people wanted to make a point that life goes on, celebration goes on, protest goes on, spirit goes on.  I really liked the political commentary costumes, not because I agree with them or thought they were necessarily poignant, but I love looking at a place where people speak up and say what they’re thinking.  It sounds cheesy, but it really does make me proud to live in a place where we can do this whenever we want.

I can remember two days that school was canceled due to snow (about 2 inches) and I remember the aura that surrounded our time off.  Today, in Valparaiso, Indiana, where the sight of snow is typical and everyone is used to driving in wintery conditions, we get a snow day; classes are canceled, the piles from yesterday’s snow lay in stationary heaps all over town, and that little-kid feeling is creeping into my apartment and into my head.  Yesterday was the real storm day; I had to scrape my car between every class, drive super slow to stay in control on the roads, I couldn’t see much of anything by 5 p.m., and I didn’t have to go to work because my boss was afraid I’d get stuck there.  Today, though, it’s stopped snowing, they’re finally clearing the roads, and I can’t understand why the university would shut down for the day.  My roommates from Chicago tell me that this is normal for the area—the day that brings in all the snow is treated like any other day.  Then, when everything has calmed down, they cancel school.  It doesn’t make any sense to me, but I’m just excited to have a whole day to myself.  All the sudden I feel like playing, I feel free, I feel almost intoxicated with the unexpected surprise.  I try to remember what I would have done with a snow day in elementary school.  I probably would have put on every piece of winter clothing in my possession, taken a camera, and spent the day outside with my brother putting together a starved looking snowman from the dust in our front yard.

There are several little specialty shops featuring bags of candy tied in cellophane with bright ribbon.  Cafes put their soup of the day chalkboards out on the sidewalk in front of the shops.  The majority of the businesses are women’s clothing stores like Seasons of the Square, The Closet Exchange, and Bangles.  But there is a decent combination of used goods and clothing stores, law and insurance offices (Langer and Langer, Follis and Associates), coffee and dessert places (Express Yourself, Designer Desserts), and specialty stores that feel like the gift shop in the front of Cracker Barrel.  Valpo Pet and Hobby is much smaller than commercial Pet Smart, but offers more for the small-town shopper’s sense of the specialty of yesteryear.  The front section of the store houses rows and rows of model trains, cars, planes, and the makings for little towns.  The back half of the shop smells like sawdust and fish.  They sell gerbils, lizards, rabbits, frogs, fish, etc.  Jimmy’s Café just down the street offers college kids a place to nurse their hangovers over fried eggs and pancakes.  Jano’s Sporting Goods store encouragers passers-by to “explore Valpo by bicycle” and showcases shiny blue and green bikes in the front window.  The city library is tucked away behind the bank, and though it’s not very large, it seems like one of the friendliest quiet places downtown.  Stone steps lead up to double front doors, the landscaping outside is simple, but inviting.  On a warmer day you can sit outside the small building and watch people walk to their cars or to a coffee shop.  Men and women jog by; people smile and wave.  It’s quiet because the plot is near the older, but comfortable homes that make up much of Valparaiso’s residential areas.  As you move back toward downtown, movement and noise pick up.  Buffalo Wild Wings and Old Style Inn give eaters and drinkers a place to go, but the square around the courthouse is fairly quiet in comparison with busier cities—still, friendly, and old-fashioned.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67vrmnhbnke"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.059589,41.467479]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237578","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dwright1","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dwright1","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237578","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":17,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237578,platial:user=dwright1","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":42935}
