Chef Michael Nowak has continued this excellence by executing dishes with Roman recipes and utilizing the freshest local and organic ingredients. The menu includes brick-oven modern and traditional pizzas, house-cured salume and antipastos, Belgian beer steamed mussels, and award-winning pommes frites. Bar Cento complements the international flavor of McNulty's Bier Markt, a Belgian beer bar right next door on West 25th Street, in Cleveland's eclectic Ohio City. Food is served haute-rustic style in a lively dining room warmed by treasures discovered in Northeast Ohio and around the world. The polished bar was crafted from wood reclaimed from an Amish barn built in the 1800s.
