Auschwitz-Birkenau was the largest of the camps and was located in the German-occupied southern Poland.  Auschwitz at Birkenau was known as the extermination camp and is known to most as simply Auschwitz.  It is estimated that 1.1 to 1.6 million people died there with 90% of them being Jews from almost every country in Europe.  Most of the dead were killed in gas chambers, starvation, and lack of disease control.  This was called the Holocaust.\r\n     The camps of Auschwitz were built beginning in 1940 under Nazi Germany.  They were in all areas under Germany occupation.  The camp at Birkenau was built in 1941 in order to handle the crowding at the first camp.  There were four gas chambers that looked like showers and four crematoria where the bodies were incinerated.  Prisoners were brought to Auschwitz by rail.  While largely Jews were the main group to be killed, others that were not called \"fit\" were also killed such as disabled people, twins, and dwarfs.  Many museums are in place today to help us remember the Holocaust and what happened at Auschwitz and to honor those who suffered.   <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9hl58ht6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.21002388,50.0343748869]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bay of Pigs","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/bay_of_pigs2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/bay_of_pigs.jpg\">Cuba     The Bay of Pigs is located in a remote area on the southern coast of Cuba.  It is more than 80 miles from Cuba\\'s Escambray mountains.  The Bay of Pigs is significant to world history because it was the location that the U.S. sent Cuban exiles into in 1961 in an attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro, the Cuban dictator.\r\n     President John F. Kennedy was the one who ultimately authorized the invasion plan but it had been started before his presidency with President Eisenhower.  The invasion was planned for the Bay of Pigs because Kennedy did not want other countries to know of the U.S. involvement.  The U.S. had been \"training\" Cuban exiles in training camps in Guatemala for some time.  The invasion was not a success largely due to the fact that Fidel Castro learned of the plan and was able to prepare to fight against it.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9hkrue1c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.542092,21.513053]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boston Harbour","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/tea_parey.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/boston_harbour.jpg\">Massachusetts     Boston Harbor has long been a center of activity in the Massachusetts waterways.  In the early 1600\\'s the Massachusetts Bay Company landed and began settling in the area.  They cleared land for livestock and the Harbor became a very busy trading port.  By 1660 virtually all imports from New England came through the waters of the Harbor.\r\n     Boston Harbor is most well-known for being the site of the Boston Tea Party where in 1773, angry colonists revolted.  They were upset at the Stamp Act and the Townshend Act regarding British decisions on taxing the colonies.  They were not represented in the Parliament.  On December 16, 1773, the colonists, disguised as Native Americans, went on board the arriving ships carrying crates of tea and threw them overboard into the Harbor.  This event and the reactions after the event were said to be the scene of the beginnings of the American Revolution.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9h9qy1gn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.090999,42.321035]}},{"properties":{"name":"Great Wall of China","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/Great_wall_of_china_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/3/greatwallofchina.jpg\">ChinaThe Great Wall of China is a series of stone and earthly fortifications in China that were built and rebuilt between the 5th Century BC and the 16th Century. It was made to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire during the rule of successive dynasties. The Great Wall stretches over approximately 4,000 miles. It starts in the east at Shanhaiguan and ends at Lop Nur in the west. There is an estimation that 2 to 3 million Chinese died as a part of the project of building the wall.\r\n    The history of the Great Wall is said to have started in the Spring and Autumn Periods when seven powerful states appeared at the same time. They had to defend themselves so they all built walls and stationed troops on the borders. By that time, the total length of the wall had already reached 3,107 miles, all belonging to different states. There are more than 10,000 watch towers and beacon towers on the Great Wall. Today, some towers are standing complete and others are crumbling, but many have been rebuilt.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9h9dfcgs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[104.195397,35.86166]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jamestown settlement","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Jamestown_Settlement.jpg\">VirginiaJamestown, Virginia (originally called the Jamestown Settlement) was founded on May 14, 1607 and is commonly known as the first permanent English settlement in what is now the United States.  It was founded by Captain John Smith and was the first capital of the Colony for 92 years until 1699.  After that, the capital was relocated to Williamsburg.\r\nVirginia was the 10th state of the U.S. to be established.  \r\n\r\nDuring the time when the settlement was founded, many European countries were competing to establish colonies in what they called the “New World”.  One of the attempts by England was an effort by the Virginia Company and it was finally successful.  The original location was selected on Jamestown Island because it was a good defensive location against other European forces.  All of the struggles of the early colonists are well studied and include well known names such as John Rolfe and Pocahontas.  Jamestown is still the site of many historical attractions and is a great tourist attraction even to this day.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9h8twpot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.047806,36.741426]}},{"properties":{"name":"Olympic Grounds - Athens Greece","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Athens.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Athens2.jpg\">     Athens is the capital and largest city in Greece.  It is well known for many things but in particular, Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896.  It also hosted the Summer Olympics in 2004.  Ancient Athens was a powerful city-state and has recorded history of being at least 3,000 years old.  It was a center for the arts, learning and philosophy as well as the birthplace of many great philosophers including Socrates, Pericles, and Sophocles.\r\n     With the opening of the Summer Olympics in Athens in 1896, the revival of the modern Olympic Games had begun.  The effort was led by Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin.  In 1896, the city had a population of approximately 123,000.  The city now has over seven times that amount of people and the expanded urban area of Athens is near 3.5 million people.  Athens and its historic olympic grounds are rich in history.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9hdtn9ff"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.782997,38.041467]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pearl Harbor Naval Station","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/pharbor.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Pearl_Harbor_2_.jpg\">Oahu, Hawaii   Pearl Harbor is an inlet of the island of Oahu in Hawaii.  It is the site of one of the main naval bases of the United States.  The U.S. government first obtained the right to use the inlet for a coaling station for ships in 1887 but the Hawaiian Islands didn’t become a part of the states until 1898.  A wide channel was dredged in 1911 so that the harbor could be used for the largest naval vessels.  U.S. naval ships are located all throughout the harbor.\r\n\r\n   The attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii by the Japanese in order to destroy the United States Navy’s battleship force was one of the most notable moments in history.  This attack took place on December 7, 1941 and brought the United States fully into the Second World War.  Because of Pearl Harbor’s location in Hawaii, President Franklin Roosevelt had transferred the United States fleet there as a deterrent to the Japanese who were threatening to expand their empire.  The U.S. fleet, however, was still able to be hit by an enemy aircraft carrier force and the Japanese Navy secretly sent over a force to do just that.  Pearl Harbor will always be a notable place on the map with its history of war. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9hdd8lbo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-158.108553,21.581177]}},{"properties":{"name":"Plymouth Rock","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/plymouth_rock.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/prock.jpg\">Massachusetts     Plymouth Rock is located on the shore of Plymouth Harbour in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  The rock is known as the site where William Bradford and the Pilgrims got off of the Mayflower and founded Plymouth Colony in 1620.  It is the first solid ground that the Pilgrims stepped foot on in the New World, eventually becoming the United States of America.\r\n     It is estimated that the original Plymouth Rock weighed 20,000 pounds.  Over the years, the rock has been moved many times.  In one attempt to move it in 1774, the rock split in half.  It has been displayed in many public locations and today approximately one-third of the top portion remains.  Today, Plymouth Rock is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation of Massachusetts.  Pieces of the rock, and history, are in Pilgrim Hall Museum and the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9hej7lw2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.090999,42.321035]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Clock Tower","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/02/3/the_clock_tower.jpg\">London    The Clock Tower in Westminster, London, or \"Big Ben\", is the world\\'s largest four-faced, chiming clock. It is called Big Ben because that is the name of the main bell within the Clock Tower. It was designed by Augustus Pugin and it was his last design before his death. The Clock Tower stands at 96.3 meters high.\r\n    This clock tower was raised as a part of Charles Barry\\'s design for a new palace because the old palace was destroyed by a fire in 1834. It is a focus of New Year celebrations in the United Kingdom. The \"News at Ten\" show featured the Clock Tower for announcements in the news headlines. This clock has become a symbol for the United Kingdom and London. If you stand at the bottom of the Clock Tower, you will hear the chime of the bell about one-sixth of a second later than the bell was actually struck. The Clock Tower is a very unique structure to the world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9hlaxaly"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"World Trade Center","description":"Posted by Liljohn02<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/freedom_tower_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/World_Trade_Center_attack.jpg\">New YorkThe World Trade Center towers were located in lower Manhattan, New York City in the heart of the financial district.  The trade center was more than the two large towers but included seven buildings on 16 acres.  Each of the towers was more than 100 feet higher than the Empire State Building.  The towers were 1,368 and 1,362 feet high making them the world’s tallest buildings when they were built.  (The Sears Tower later surpassed this height.)  The site is a massive center of business and financial leadership in the world. \r\n\r\nThe World Trade Center towers were attacked on September 11, 2001 and destroyed.  This is commonly called the 9/11 attacks and were orchestrated by terrorists of al-Qaeda.  These attacked caused almost 3,000 deaths and sparked more political unrest and a focus on stopping terrorism.  30% of lower Manhattan office space was either damaged or destroyed during these attacks.  The area is currently being rebuilt and plans are underway for the New York City Freedom Tower which will be built on the site of the twin towers.  It will be 1,776 feel tall and is scheduled to be complete in 2012.  This site will always have a significant role in both history and the future.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62v9hdy39cy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/284650","metadata":null,"contact_name":"liljohn02","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:liljohn02","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/284650","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=284650,platial:user=liljohn02","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":49480}
