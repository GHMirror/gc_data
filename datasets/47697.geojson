Among the causes they blame: high rates of poverty and a culture of Southern hospitality and food that values certain types of dishes--many of them fried--over healthier choices. Memphis actually sits on the western edge of a web of Southern cities along with Birmingham, Ala., and Atlanta, that also landed on our list.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyitwh5ku"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.9697875977,35.0592287009]}},{"properties":{"name":"#10 San Diego","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/San_Diego.jpg\">The glitz of downtown San Diego belies pockets of poor neighborhoods where access to fresh fruit and vegetables is limited. Other factors contributing to the obesity rate of 26.7% may be car commuting and a large Hispanic population, whose members often have higher incidences of obesity than non-Hispanic whites. To counteract the trend, San Diego County has invested in preventing and reversing childhood obesity by forging collaborative relationships between public and private entities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyj2pknkr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.119750977,32.7260645761]}},{"properties":{"name":"#2 Birmingham","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/Birmingham.jpg\">As the second most obese city, 31.3% of Birmingham\\'s residents have a BMI of 30 or higher. Since 2001, a local non-profit organization called Jones Valley Urban Farm has tried to promote healthy eating habits with community gardening plots. The organization also offers educational programs for grade-school children in an effort to battle the city\\'s high childhood obesity rates.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyj5sa78o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.8180847168,33.5150644001]}},{"properties":{"name":"#3 San Antonio","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/San_Antonio.jpg\">Arguably the home base for calorie-rich Tex-Mex cuisine, this Texas city comes in a close third as the most obese. City officials, however, have taken note, and are exploring solutions. A team of municipal and school leaders was recently chosen by the National League of Cities to receive technical assistance for one year in combating childhood obesity and adopting wellness initiatives. The league will provide San Antonio and five other cities with experts versed in healthy eating and active living as well as fighting obesity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyiy17nk9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.4951782227,29.420460341]}},{"properties":{"name":"#4 San Bernardino","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/San_Bernardino.jpg\">Those living in the city of Riverside and the surrounding metropolitan area, located about an hour east of Los Angeles, are likely victims of a car-centric culture. But despite efforts to promote safe streets and bicycle riding, the obesity epidemic is only getting worse: 30.8% percent of Riverside residents are obese, a 5% increase from 2005. The percentage of people neglecting regular exercise is also creeping upward, now standing at 30%.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyiwkms0d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.295532227,34.1209001398]}},{"properties":{"name":"#5 Detroit","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/Detroit.jpg\">Parts of this beleaguered city, where 33% of residents live below the poverty line, may qualify as a \"food desert,\" a term used to describe urban areas devoid of healthy, fresh food choices. That may explain why 30.4% of its population, and that of the surrounding area, is obese. Still, it seems the state also suffers from unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity: Michigan was recently ranked the ninth heaviest state in the nation by the research group Trust for America\\'s Health. The state already promotes healthy living through an initiative called \"Step Up Michigan,\" but the epidemic might require a more aggressive intervention.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyivnwuw9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.0484008789,42.3280930282]}},{"properties":{"name":"#6 Jacksonville","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/Jacksonville.jpg\">Perhaps this city\\'s humid climate drives its residents, 29.8% of whom are obese, indoors. In an effort to lessen the area\\'s obesity rate. the city has launched a public health initiative called Healthy Jacksonville, which allows participants to get involved in a community-wide challenge for improved fitness and health. A primary motivator for the city was the 57 million price tag, as measured in 2003, of obesity and overweight health issues in its residents.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyj0ai3fc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.6586303711,30.3041320018]}},{"properties":{"name":"#7 Nashville","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/Nashville.jpg\">Nashville\\'s obesity crisis is worsening: At 28.8%, the percentage of residents who are obese increased roughly two points last year, while the number of overweight residents rose to 39%, up from 35.5%.

One reason? A whopping 27.5% of Oklahoma City residents are obese. Among other strategies, the city has promoted healthy living by passing a bond measure to build gyms at 47 inner city schools and increasing the number of bike paths. They\\'ve also tried to lure high-profile stores like Trader Joe\\'s and Whole Foods while also looking at ways to decrease high rates of fast food consumption.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyiuyfn8w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.4597167969,35.4875110239]}},{"properties":{"name":"#9 Kansas City","description":"Posted by Georgedukic<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/Kansas_City.jpg\">Well known for its barbecue, Kansas City has a big appetite. Like other cities on this list, where a culture of food is closely intertwined with a way of life, that may contribute to high levels of obesity. In Kansas City, 26.9% of residents have a BMI higher than 30, which qualifies them as obese. At least many are vocal about improving parks and recreation services, as well as making sidewalks more walkable. When polled by the city government last year, improved parks and sidewalks ranked at the top in terms of what residents most wanted.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67jyironbep"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.5703125,39.0277188402]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/107587","metadata":null,"contact_name":"georgedukic","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:georgedukic","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/107587","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=107587,platial:user=georgedukic","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47697}
