He stole a city picnic table. For lovesick Stefan Robichaux, it all made sense. Nothing would keep the 24-yearold international sales coordinator for Oakley from popping the question to his longtime “Lady Faire,” Naomi Goetz, 23, whom he met nearly 12 years earlier. Not even a little larceny. So, on a recent early Saturday morning – Robichaux would say “under the cover of a moonless night” – the former Marine and lover of all things poetic hit Deerfield Community Park. With the help of two friends, he unbolted the picnic table where he and Goetz first kissed, on Nov. 4, 2000. The three put the 00 aluminum bench in Robichaux’s truck and drove off. “This bench will be returned no later than 23:59 hours (PST) on June 30, 2006,” Robichaux wrote in an e-mail to city officials the next day. “Operation Purple Steel,” as he had dubbed it, had begun without a hitch. “If you’re not gonna propose in Paris, you’ve got to do it in style,” Robichaux said. He jotted down a few lines to mark his elaborate engagement scheme:\nA bench will be stolen, A question will be asked, A ring will be given, And eternity will begin …\nHe forgot one line:\nThe police will be asking questions.\nA TALE OF ROMANCE\nRobichaux and Goetz met in 1994 during a five-day church camp in Anaheim. Both were in the sixth grade. “We shamelessly flirted,” Goetz said. Their paths wouldn’t cross again until they both ended up as juniors at a small private high school in Anaheim. They became good friends. After graduating, Robichaux joined the Marines. She wrote to him and sent him cookies.\n    While stationed at Camp Pendleton, Robichaux and Goetz frequently got together on weekends. They’d go to dinner, see movies.\n    Still friends.\n    One night, while taking Goetz home to her parents’ home in Irvine, Robichaux suggested a walk through Deerfield Park. They sat on a bench and exchanged their first kiss.\n    More than friends.\n    Circumstances would keep them apart for the next several years as Goetz went to Cal State Poly in Pomona and Robichaux was sent to Texas. The two lost touch until last fall when Goetz sent her old flame an e-mail.\n    Robichaux was no longer in the Marines and had moved to Anaheim. Goetz was finishing up her last year as an architectural major.\n    The two hooked up. “Everything clicked. The timing was just right,” Goetz said.\n    The romance led to talk of marriage, but how to propose?\n    It had to be with the bench, Robichaux decided.\n    After he stole the picnic table, Robichaux painted it purple – Goetz’s favorite color – and placed in on a hilltop overlooking Mission Viejo.\n    On the big night, a friend dropped Goetz off at Deerfield Community Park. Robichaux was standing where the bench once stood, holding a bouquet of white calla lilies, grinning widely.\n    He drove her to the picnic bench. It was dark. Candles flickered on the table. A bottle of champagne chilled. Music played from a boom box. Tiki torches danced in the wind.\n    Right away, Goetz recognized the bench.\n    “I quickly put it all together,” she said.\n    Robichaux proposed.\n    She said yes.\n    “Every proposal is special,” Goetz said. “But the lengths he went to was amazing.”\n    Robichaux whisked his fiancée to a nearby friend’s house, where family and friends congratulated the couple and laughed about the picnic table.\n    The theft of that table is a misdemeanor and is punishable by six months in jail or a fine up to ,000, or both.\n    Showing no mercy for the romance tale, Irvine Police Commander Dave Freedland says he’d like to “have a chat with the suspect.”\n    Goetz said she isn’t bothered by the theft because her fiancé notified authorities right away. He plans to accept any fines or penalties for the misdemeanor.\n    “He’s truly a prince among men,” Goetz said.\n    Her prince plans to return the table after he removes the purple paint and buffs the table to a high shine. He also might donate money to the park.\n    “My most sincere hope is that cleaning and restoring the bench will make it possible for some other young couple to enjoy a childhood kiss similar to the one I once shared,” he said.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b7qle8ryup"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.793503,33.691003]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/card_joaquin.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/San_Joaquin_Wildlife_Sanctuary_Irvine.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Riparian View, Irvine, CAOnce a degraded marshland, now one of the largest coastal freshwater marshlands in Southern California.
