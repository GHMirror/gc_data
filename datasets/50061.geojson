My mother always summed it up with the adage, “too rich to be poor, too poor to be stable.” My mother had a college degree, in teaching none-the-less, but had long ago decided she couldn’t handle a class full of kids. My father dropped out of school when my older brother was born and he married my mother. He spent much of our childhoods reminding us of that. He victoriously completed his degree twenty years later and, as if in confirmation of his earlier statements, promptly divorced my mother.\r\n\t My parents’ marriage can be best described in three stages: early—getting into debt through poor judgment; middle—getting out of debt through good judgment; late—getting back into debt by no fault of their own. When I was fifteen and my parents had just stabilized enough to purchase a home they could have afforded to grow old in, my father was diagnosed with MS. In true American fashion, everything collapsed, including their marriage, from there.\r\n\tMy father’s MS was not all calamity though. Many of the fundamental principles I would need to become a teacher were instilled in me right there, through that disease. Most fundamental of these was putting the needs of others before my own. With each successive attack bringing new challenges to cope with, I had to give up adolescent egocentricism and adjust myself to balancing my social life with the needs of the family. I also had to cope with the poorly understood psychological aspects of the disease. I had to develop a new sense of empathy—an empathy and understanding that my father was no longer psychologically able to reciprocate. These traits would later dovetail well into my relationships with students.\r\n\tAnother thing: my father was around more. I could talk to him. My father is a wellspring of trivia and often-repeated stories. My discussions with him would, in some ways, establish the intellectual curiosity that drew me to university. Before then, I was planning on… Well, I wasn’t really planning on anything. I was thinking about art school or becoming a mechanic or riding the rails as a hobo. Thought I first sat down to talk to my father merely to keep him company, the conversations awakened some gears. I started to think about what I wanted to do with my brain.   \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fm7nwku"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.42092,41.49098]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hi school!

I was the classic smart-enough-but-doesn’t-care-enough student we all have to deal with now (I call it Karma). I was inconsistent—fanatically studying only what interested and disregarding the rest. And I was a rabble-rouser. I was thrown out of a football game for passing out political pamphlets, nearly suspended for inciting a riot (but it wasn’t really a riot), and did cart-wheels down the hallway because “It doesn’t say I can’t in the rule book.” Really, I was just pushing the system to see how far it would bend without breaking.\r\n\tThe only two parts of school I truly enjoyed were art class and theatre. When I was four, I had decided to be an artist; and, despite my colorblindness and very few inklings of true talent, I was still pursuing that in high school. Theatre was new though, and that would have the most profound implications when I decided to become a teacher.\r\n\tI was never the type of kid to willfully speak in front of an audience. Socially awkward, I had a nice, comfy shell, a few close friends, and lots of books to read. Freshman year, I was sort of pulled, literally, onto stage by a friend from a church youth group. I read my lines, the director’s liked my voice, and I started doing plays. And being in front of an audience, strangely, felt natural. I was more comfortable there than at most parties. The public speaking skills I learned there are part of my everyday routines in front of my classes. \r\n\tThough I consistently failed English class, I also developed a real, almost-unhealthy love for writing in high school. I skipped writing a few term papers so I could write short stories, letters to congressmen, and poetry; but I did learn most of what I teach my own students about writing when I was in high school. It’s hard now to tell what I was really taught and what I figured out for my own purposes, but some large chunk must be credited to my teachers.\r\n\tHaving been a ‘bad student’ also helps me be a better teacher. Though I’m not confirming the adage that the worst students make the best teachers, I don’t think I would be as committed to motivating each child if I hadn’t been unmotivated myself. I’ve done well enough, but I also know I used more time than I needed to, to get the education I have now. Oh, to have back half the time I would have saved by paying attention the first time through! “Two roads diverged within a yellow wood…”  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fvny1pm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.47292,41.46685]}},{"properties":{"name":"Limbo (i.e. slow boat to nowhere)","description":"Posted by Week15Limbo—\r\n\r\nThis is Harrah’s East Chicago. I spent about eight months in the casino’s Diamond Lounge, just bidding time: waiting for the Chicago PD to call and wondering if I should enter graduate school. As a security guard, I first discovered talents I had never noticed before. Because of the casino’s mission (to bilk even the most surly customer out of his hard-earned cash), I had good practice in the ability to resolve conflicts diplomatically (i.e. without throwing insults or punches). I would hate to say I learned classroom management while escorting irate drunks off casino premises, but… \r\nI also wrote. Alone, roaming my floor on the graveyard shift, I was able to fill pocket notebook after pocket notebook with my random thoughts. In one of these notebooks (irrelevantly sandwiched between my calculations of the odds against winning a jackpot on the Triple Diamond and a list of classic books I had not yet read), a question is etched: “Would you spend your life filling prisons or emptying them?”\r\nThis is the type of question guidance counselors should ask.\r\nI admit, the question is a bit melodramatic, but it was nonetheless compelling. With that question I began to turn the matter over in my mind. What is the purpose of law enforcement? “To protect and serve”—yes—but there are other careers that serve that function. There are other paths: ones that do not involve guns and handcuffs, sentencing and bars. What was my true motivation? Why had I thought that to serve others I needed a badge and riot gear?\r\nThis was disquieting (as useful self-questioning quite often is). I had left college with little more than Siddhathra’s abilities to ‘think, fast, and wait.’ When I realized the only reason I had been specifically drawn to law enforcement was that the ability to accurately fire an M16-A2 assault rifle is a marketable job skill, I had to reevaluate my plans. Limbo was over. \r\nBut what other marketable skills did I have? Well, I could read. I could write. In other words, I could go back to school. One week after I started graduate school, the Chicago P.D. called, ready to take me into police academy. I declined, but thanked them for their consideration.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fg2b4dd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.43461,41.6527]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sgt. Johnson's Office","description":"Posted by Week15Sgt. Johnson’s Office—\r\n\r\nNestled soundly in my earliest memories, two boys, my brother and I, take a charging start, run with all our pre-kindergarten strength, and slideeee down the glittering, immaculately waxed, hallway floors of the 113th Engineer Battalion’s armory. My father was a full-timer here for about five years after he was laid off from the steel mills, and I still know every crack and crevice of the building, every lump and sag of the hall tiles and cement drill floor. Did the Santa of your childhood ride an APC? But… that isn’t why we’re here.\r\n\tOn April 17th, 1997, seven days after my seventeenth birthday, I kept an 8 o’clock appointment I had ever reason to miss. My tire was flat that morning. Our water heater was out, so my shower was cold. I had been up for thirty hours straight, writing. A few days earlier, I had broken up with my girlfriend. But I showed up. Four days later, after my medical screening, I enlisted in the Army National Guard. \r\n\tWhy?\r\n\tI haven’t a clue, but I was seventeen (as if that isn’t enough reason to do just about anything).  \r\n\tThe military side of my life brought out all those things that the military is good at bringing out: discipline, selfless service, mortification of the flesh, integrity, maybe a little brutality. I don’t say the Army ‘taught’ me these things because the Army doesn’t put anything in you that wasn’t there to start—least that’s what Drill Sergeant Montgomery was fond of saying.\r\n\tThese qualities have been useful in my classroom and the lunchroom. I have the command voice needed to break up fights. My class makes a straight, well-disciplined line. I can go without sleep when lesson plans, grade books, permanent folders, summer school plans, report cards, discipline forms, etc all have to be turned in on the same day. I can even tell enough stories to muster some sort of enthusiasm for the Pledge of Allegiance.   \r\n\tAlso, I’m not sure that I would have gone to college, at least not right away, if I hadn’t gone into the Army first. My guidance counselor, Mr. Kopchich, had me lined up to go to an industrial design school, and I still have no idea what ‘industrial design’ is or why he thought it should be my life’s ambition. Not to say that I did not, occasionally, long to bind metal to metal while in school for Philosophy (Oh, to actually touch a problem!), but Mr. Kopchich’s guidance far less influenced my life than did the G.I. Bill. I never got enough out of the Guard to pay for school, but they did give me enough to survive on a part-time job while I was in school. Financially, I would not have gotten through my BA, nor be a teacher now, without the Army’s help.\r\n\tOf course, once I got out of school and did an extra year with the guard (waiting for my buddies to get back from Iraq), I was sort of lost as to what I should do with my life. Talking to a mess sergeant late one night, I stumbled back onto an adolescent ambition, one that my friends had laughed at me about. I thought about becoming a cop.\r\n\tI did more than think about it: I applied. I jumped through the hoops and I waited, in limbo, for them to call me back.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fkg1qex"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.4689,41.58046]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thesis Defense","description":"Posted by Week15Thesis Defense—\r\nHaving left the boats and any ambition to be a police officer behind, I settled into my new life as a graduate student. Continuing the patterns from my Bachelor’s degree, I made sure to be overwhelmed rather than be underwhelmed. Aside from my overtime course load in literary studies, I took up a teaching assistantship and a position in the Writing Center. By my final semester, I was teaching three hybrid (half lecture, half online) composition classes, writing my thesis (on Abortacalyptic themes in Contemporary Literature), taking on university politics as the graduate representative, and planning what to do next.   \r\n\tThough I enjoyed my studies, I ultimately found that I enjoyed my students more. In the Writing Center I guided university students in forty-five minute discussions of their work. It was the ultimate student-centered activity. I learned to negotiate revisions, inspire interest, and read student work without judging it. In my classroom, I learned independence through the baptism-through-fire technique most universities use to prepare young instructors. I was plopped into a section with little guidance—told, irreverently, to “Teach them to write—better.” Set adrift as I was, I slowly learned, by trail-and-error, many of the necessary micro-skills for every form of teaching: planning, grading, response to student work, how to conduct lectures, adapting to student needs, etc. I also learned that I really loved teaching. I loved interacting with students. I loved helping them to better their work. I loved making a class think, communicate, and laugh.\r\n\tOne thing struck me about my students though. Before I entered my teaching assistantship, I was naive about the quality of education afforded different racial and ethnic groups in my own home county. I knew that, according to Newsweek, Northwest Indiana was one of the most segregated ‘communities’ in the United States. I knew that some schools were poor and others were rich. I knew that, largely, the property taxes collected from the area around a school paid for the school. I didn’t, however, know that that combination of segregation and inequality had a profound, lasting impact on people’s lives. I was truly taken aback by how much of a qualitative difference that simple, ridiculous inequality made in my students’ work. Having been a part of an “all green” Army, I had never seen institutionalized racism, never noticed it. But it was everywhere around me. It was the reason my high school had money while other schools did not. Privilege was the reason my lower-middle class family could provide me with a quality education while another family of similar socio-economic status could not. All of this was painstakingly discussed our composition program meetings, but everyone through up their hands. They asked, “What can we, after all, do about it?” \r\nRealizing my and other instructors grades were as predicative of race as of hard work, the week before I defended my thesis, I applied for Teach for America. I realized that if I really wanted to positively affect all of my students’ lives (regardless of their race) I would have to start earlier. Much earlier. I headed off to Houston to do my small part in creating a just and equitable society. The type of society I had imagined in my Ethics courses. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fu42hou"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.47549,41.58752]}},{"properties":{"name":"To Houston","description":"Posted by Week15To Houston--\r\nIn early June of last year, I left Indiana for Houston. My car was filled with the donated essentials for becoming a teacher: pens, children’s books, a paper cutter, shirts, suits, crayons, glue, etc. The car sat low on its shocks. I drove straight through—twenty-two hours tip to tail. It was a long, lonely drive (my wife followed me a month later), but it gave me time to think.\r\n\tSomewhere in the flat, desolate, dark part of Arkansas, I finally, firmly decided that everything up until that point, my whole life through, would be worthwhile if I could teach one child who might have gone without otherwise. I remembered an Emily Dickinson poem from a graduate course:\r\n\r\n\tIf I can stop one heart from breaking\r\n\t\tI shall not live in vain.\r\n\tIf I can ease one life the aching\r\n\t\tOr cool one pain\r\n\tOr help one fainting robin\r\n\t\tUnto his nest again\r\n\t\tI shall not live in vain.\r\n\r\nI taught that poem to my summer school class last month. I hope that in some desperate moment, one filled with self-doubt and recrimination—perhaps on an empty track of highway separating an uncertain future from a whirlwind past—they might remember that poem. That it might help. I hope it helps them end up where they belong.   \r\n\t     \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fopocso"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.5252,41.49463]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zeno's Paradox and the Lifeboat Dilemma","description":"Posted by Week15Zeno’s Paradox and the Lifeboat Dilemma— \r\nWhen I first told my father I’d be going to Indiana University Northwest, he said, “Lock your doors.” It was a panic response: Gary, Indiana, the city the school calls home, competes against Detroit, Michigan each year for the designation of “Murder Capital of the USA.” With that distinction comes a lot of well-intended parental paranoia. I never saw or heard anyone reference a specific violent act the four years I commuted there, and I commuted at odd hours, when all of this evil supposedly happened. Gary is the victim of urban decay, white-flight, institutionalized racism, and rampant unemployment. For a student hoping to develop social consciousness, it is the best school in America. I choose to study Philosophy, centered on ethics.     \r\n     IUN is not known for its Philosophy program. Most of its courses were taught to nursing and business students. For the four years I was there, I was the Philosophy program. There were three other students in the program the entire time I was there—none of them lasted a semester before switching majors. Though this precluded me from starting a philosophy club, I had complete access to my professors. Most of my major courses were independent study, my professors and I batting ideas back and forth, much in the style of Plato’s dialogues. I was like Zen apprenticeship in many ways. If there is a better way to learn Philosophy, I am not aware of it. I took eighteen credit hours at a time and relished it.\r\n\tBut, of course, once I finished my degree I was still only marginally qualified to keep my job as a grocery stocker. Truly, my motivation to go to college had nothing to do with money. After all, philosophy literally means “love of wisdom,” not “love of stability.” I’ve never regretted choosing that major, but I did have a wife to please. The Beat life just wouldn’t cut it.\r\n\tI stumbled into the idea of joining the Chicago police force. My military background made it a distinct possibility. Why not apply ethics to real life? Why not shun the ivory tower. Why not test the water?\r\n\tI wouldn’t figure that out until investing about a year into the prospect.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fotnciv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.33813,41.55747]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/260862","metadata":null,"contact_name":"week15","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:week15","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/260862","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=260862,platial:user=week15","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":50061}
