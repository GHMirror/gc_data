This huge nuclear power plant would primarily export energy out of state to California, and not be used to meet the in-state energy needs of Utah citizens.Western Resource Advocates believes that this project is not appropriate for the arid climate of the West, and that the environmental impacts to Utahâ€™s Green River are too great. Already, the Green River is unable to meet the recommended water levels necessary to provide a healthy habitat to native endangered fish species like the Humpback Chub, the Bonytail, the Pipeminnow and the Razorback Sucker.
