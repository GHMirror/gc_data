His home was subsequently pumped out by DEC contractors. He gutted the first floor and basement levels and has been out of the home since. However, his basement foundation and floor joists are coated with oil that he cannot clean. Odors are very strong in his entire home. He is also downstream from Amphenol and has concerns about chemical releases from that facility that may also be affecting his home. During a meeting he attended with FEMA he was advised to contact us for air testing! This is the first I am aware of this being an issue. In looking through our Hazardous Surveillance info I only found one generic spill #1107308 for Sidney. I did not see this address associated with this spill #. I advised Mr. McHenry to call the hot-line to see if his oil/chemical contamination concerns could be evaluated by either DEC or your contractors, or at least provide some practical advice. \r\n\r\nDo you recall this location and is this a separate or another generic spill#?\r\n\r\nDo you have any additional information or insight about the Amphenol concerns. I explained to him that addressing the oil contaminated surfaces would also address the other chemicals. \r\n\r\nThanks, Mike.\r\n\r\nMichael J.
