Accessible from downtown, the HarborWalk extends along Pleasure Bay, with a detour to Castle Island. Pleasure Bay is a calm, enclosed lagoon with a sandy beach for swimming. Pleasure Bay is one of the most popular swimming and sunning beaches in the City. Foot showers and water fountains are located on-site. Because the bay is fully enclosed by the man-made Head Island Causeway, water and sediment quality are consistently high. The causeway located behind the beach provides a great walk way for strolling around Pleasure Bay.\n\nOriginally freestanding, Castle Island has been connected to the mainland since the 1930s, when streetcars brought bathers to Pleasure Bay. Fort Independence, located on Castle Island, is a five pointed granite structure. The current structure is the eighth fort to occupy this site and contains over 172,687 linear feet of hammered stone and was constructed under the direction of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer between 1834 and 1851. The fort is open during the summer months, and visitors can explore independently or take a free tour. The fort and the island are on the State and National Registers of Historic Places, and Fort Independence is a National Historic Landmark. There are views to Logan Airport and the Harbor Islands, and visitors can observe boating activity in the Harbor. The area is excellent for jogging, walking, picnicking, biking and hiking, and there is a fishing pier and swimming area.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639fszswvnp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.023521,42.335707]}},{"properties":{"name":"Race Point Beach","description":"Posted by Ericag<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/path_2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/ternsbig.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/beachbig.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/030397.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is the most beautiful beach I\\'ve ever been to.

It\\'s a youthful beach, popular with teenagers and 20-somethings, especially those who listen to WJMN-FM. This popularity comes in part because of the long sea wall where you can sit and scope for \\'\\'hotties.\\'\\' For Boston babe watch, this is the place to go.\n\nAt a venerable 102, Revere is the oldest public beach in America. Public concerts at the bandstand and easy T access make it one of the most popular beaches in the state. Lifeguards are on duty from late June to early September. Downsides are loud noise from incoming jets, and sometimes smelly water.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639ft7pyrrt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.990434,42.406094]}},{"properties":{"name":"Salem Willows Park","description":"Posted by Mathyula<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/willow1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 171-185 Fort Ave. Salem, maIf you ever visit Salem Massachusetts and tire of the mostly-cheesy witch-hysteria element which is so prominent around the center of town, you should go to the place that a lot of the tourists miss: the park called The Willows.\r\nYou won\\'t find any witch-themed toys there. Instead, you\\'ll find: \"Beautiful shaded seaside grounds, scenic ocean views, public pier, bandstand for concerts, picnic areas, beaches, children\\'s rides, activities and many eateries.\"...as well as the old-school classic coin-op video arcade! (my personal favorite Salem destination) They\\'ve got Pac Man, they\\'ve got Space Invaders, they\\'ve got Centipede...and many many more games from the golden age of video games, as well as around 10 pinball machines, air hockey, and a bunch of other games too. There\\'s also a seperate building full of play-for-tickets style games like Skee Ball - fun for the whole family! Having a walk around the willow trees and out on the pier for a nice ocean view is pretty much essential as well.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639ft749tf0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.868369,42.535341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Singing Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://kai.dyndns.org/\" href=\"http://kai.dyndns.org/\">Kaicarver</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/singbch.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/sbair4nov93(lsh)_jpg.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/pic25.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> When you walk on the sand, it sings!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639fsxubf9j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.76088,42.567747]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spectacle Island","description":"Posted by Berwin<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/33993074@N00/678480003/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1375/678480003_3023f123e9.jpg\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639ft7mi85s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.98661,42.31949]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spectacle Island West","description":"Posted by Berwin<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639ft2o8scm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.98769,42.32356]}},{"properties":{"name":"Swimming Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/193049568_9582067bed.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Grape IslandThe beach is covered in broken mussel shells, which can be rather sharp, so don\\'t forget your flip flops.\n\nIt seemed like a lot of people came to Grape to use the beach in their own boats and a lot fewer people came on the shuttle.
