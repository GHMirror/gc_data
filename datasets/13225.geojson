Lake","description":"http://www.tongilkorea.net/?action=fullnews&amp;showcomments=1&amp;id=1946\n\nBy Uriminzokkiri (BONI)\nApril 17, 2006\n\nSamilpho (Lagoon Samil) can be seen in Samilpho-ri, Kosong County, Kangwon Province which is situated in the eastern part of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIt covers 0.76 square kilometres and measures 8 kilometres round, with its greatest water depth being 4.2 metres.\n\nIt lies long from north to south. Thirty-six thickly-wooded peaks stand as precipitously as walls around the lake and to the east spreads the East Sea of Korea with flatland in between. As its bottom is covered all over with sand, the lake water is clear conspicuously.\n\nFrom olden times Samilpho is known as a place of scenic beauty and as one of the eight scenic spots in the eastern area. A legend has it that once upon a time a king visited Samilpho to have a one-day holiday, but he remained there for three days, attracted by the charming scenery.
