French soldiers and Jesuit missionaries came from Canada in 1654 to seek their friendship. In that year, Father Simon Le Moyne discovered salt springs in the area. Salt works were set up in 1788, soon after the first permanent settlement. Salt manufacturing flourished until the 1860\\'s. For many years the tax on salt supplied the State\\'s chief revenue. This industry gave the name Salina to the original site of Syracuse. The Erie Canal and the Oswego Canal, connecting the Erie at Syracuse with Lake Ontario, ushered in an era of prosperity and expansion after 1825. Railroads and highways followed the east-west water level route and stimulated industrial growth.\nSituated on the edge of the fruitful lake plain beside Onondaga Lake, Syracuse is near the geographical center of New York State. Serving a wide area, her industries which began with the salt works have been many and varied; chinaware, alloy steel, automobiles, automotive gears, air conditioning and typewriters, chemicals and electronics -\nthese reflected the industrial growth of America. The first New York State Fair was held in 1841 in Syracuse, where it has been an annual event since 1890.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a675310mrbk2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.1313807964,43.2563539748]}},{"properties":{"name":"Indian Hill","description":"Posted by Noon<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> Indian Hill\nSettled in the 1700\\'s by Jacob Crist.

This was the legendary \"Great Peace\" made by the Indian statesman Hiawatha and Dekanawidah. Called \"People of the Standing Stone\" from an upright rock at their meeting place, the Oneidas had their principal settlement south of Oneida Lake. In 1722, the Tuscaroras coming from North Carolina settled west of the Oneidas and became the sixth Iroquois nation. Living along the Mohawk River trade route and near the source of the Susquehanna River, the Oneidas were hunters, traders and farmers. Influenced by their missionary Samuel Kirkland, the Oneidas sided with the Americans during the Revolution while others of the Confederacy aided the British. Some of their lands were opened up for settlement by the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, later more Oneida land was ceded to the state.\n\nEarly in the nineteenth century turnpikes were built through this region providing a principal route westward and were followed by the Erie Canal in 1825. Later came the railroads and improved highways. The fertile soil of this bottom land is intensively cultivated for large scale truck farming.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a675314r9b06"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.8405327797,43.0958124386]}},{"properties":{"name":"Treasure Island","description":"Posted by Noon<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> French Colonists camped on Island in Escaping from Onondaga Indians in 1658.
