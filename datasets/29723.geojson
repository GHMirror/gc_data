Its Flamboyant Gothic\n    art attracted many craftsmen and artists before the city became\n    even better known through the work of the Italian architects\n    Vincenzo Scamozzi and Santini Solari, to whom the centre of\n    Salzburg owes much of its Baroque appearance. This\n    meeting-point of northern and southern Europe perhaps sparked\n    the genius of Salzburg\\'s most famous son, Wolfgang Amadeus\n    Mozart, whose name has been associated with the city ever\n    since. The Committee decided to inscribe the nominated property\n    on the basis of cultural and considered that the site is of\n    outstanding universal value being an important example of a\n    European ecclesiastical city- state which preserves to a\n    remarkable degree its dramatic townscape, its historically\n    significant urban fabric and a large number of outstanding\n    ecclesiastical and secular buildings from several centuries. It\n    is also noteworthy for its associations with the arts, and in\n    particular with music in the person of its famous son, Wolfgang\n    Amadeus Mozart.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\"
