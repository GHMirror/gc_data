Early evening on a clear day would be best.  The picture should be well worthwhile, as the place looks magical in early evening light.  Caldana itself is OK, but nothing special, however there is always the annual \\'Wild boar\\' annual summer fair which takes place towards the end of August.  A good way to try will boar meat if ever there was one, and some good local plonk. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gntz6n5dju"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[10.92114,42.89766]}},{"properties":{"name":"Castiglione della Pescara, Tuscany, Italy.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.blogfromitaly.com/\" href=\"http://www.blogfromitaly.com/\">Alexfromitaly</a>Nice, relatively quiet Italian seaside resort.

Used to be a Roman resort and the the remains of a vast villa which could house up to 1000 people are worth a visit (through a hole in a fence on the left of the main entrance - but I did not tell you).  Have a swim in the mini-bay to cool off.  I could happily have spent a day exploring the place.
