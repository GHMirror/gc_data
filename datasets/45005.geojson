The spectacle of these men swan-diving some 130 feet into La Quebrada, literally \"gorge,\" and then splashing into 12 feet of rough surf is a sight not to be missed.\n\nThe practice of cliff diving began with local fishermen, who were known to dive from high up on the rocky cliffs in order to propel themselves deep enough into the water to free snagged lines. With the advent of tourism in the 1930s, however, the divers soon discovered that their sensational diving could earn them tips. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gc8bj13pa1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.532694,20.779468]}},{"properties":{"name":"Country of Curaçao","description":"Posted by Curtispalmer<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/curacao_flag_2_.gif\">CuraçaoThis is the place where<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gc8bmlgovd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-68.913116,12.107809]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ephesus, Turkey","description":"Posted by Curtispalmer<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/th_ephesus_index_thumb__60x40.jpg\">ephususEphesus is the best-preserved classical city on the Mediterranean,and perhaps the best place in the world to get the feeling for what life was like in Roman times.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gc8bnlkgra"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.485046,37.938782]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gjovik Olympic Cavern Hall","description":"Posted by Curtispalmer<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/gjovik_situasjonsplan.gif\">Lillehammer, NorwayThe Cavern Hall is an enormous project that would have completely destroyed the proportions of the little town of Gjøvik if it had been built above ground. Norway has a long tradidion of rock tunelling and the Cavern Hall is the most advanced construction of its kind. The unsupported 60-metre roof span was the largest in the world at the time of consruction.\n\nThe interior subdivision into geometric shapes of varying sizes provides interesting visual impressions of space. The rock walls are reinforced for greater safety with steel nets sprayed with concrete and painted dark grey. They are covered with crushed glass, to provide a surface that heightens the impression of a fairytale underworld. This is enhanced by the halogen lighting effects, interspersed with brilliant sun spots. The Cavern Hall is a good exemple of energy conservation, since, once it has been warmed up, the temperature inside the mountain will remain at a stable 8 degrees Celsius all year round. Minimal maintenance in required because the building is protected from the elements.\n\nWebsite link goes to a QuicktimeVR of the interior of this building.

The order for the construction of the Topkapi Palace on the  Seraglio Point  overlooking both Marmara and Bosphorus was given by Mehmed II  after the conquest of Constantinapolis in 1453. The place was then an ancient olive grove. The final form of  the first palace  covered an area 700m², and was enclosed with fortified walls 1400 meters in length. The walls were pierced by a number of gates, namely the Otluk gate, the Demir gate and the  Imperial gate (Bab-i Humayun), and a number of minor angled gates between them. After the reign of Mehmed II the Conqueror, the palace grew steadily to form a city like complex of buildings and annexes, including a shore palace known as the Topkapi shore palace, as it was situated near the cannon gate -Topkapi- of the ancient walls of Istanbul. When the shore palace was burned down in 1863, it lent its name to the great complex we now know as Topkapi Palace.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gc8bgoffly"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.983994,41.011997]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/6041","metadata":null,"contact_name":"curtispalmer","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:curtispalmer","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/6041","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=6041,platial:user=curtispalmer","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":45005}
