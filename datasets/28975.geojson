I loved getting to know the Lord. I read through the Bible several times with my children but after about 20 years the Bible seemed so dry. I felt there was so much more to receive but I didn\\'t know how to get there, kind of deep sea fishing from a dingy! So I tried different versions of the Bible, reading commentaries, Bible on tapes, cd, vhs, different pastors and churches all of which left me feeling dry and frustrated! One day as I was sharing this with a friend she invited me to a Bible study that was featuring Mark Virkler\\'s How To Hear God\\'s Voice program so I went.\n\nMy heart lept within me as I listened to Mark\\'s presentation, he assured me that God was still alive and well and as thrilled to speak to me as I was to hear from Him! (God had been speaking to me the whole time but I didn\\'t know how to hear!) The greatest part was that it was ALL Biblically based, You cannot imagine my excitement! Unknown to me my husband had been feeling the same way spiritually and when he watched the dvds he was sold out.\nUsing the methods that we have learned in this program we are experiencing a richer more intimate relationship with God, each other, the body of Christ and on and on it grows!\n\nI have been journaling now for a little over a year and I notice that every few months it seems like the Lord elevates me to another level of understanding and spiritual growth. When I read His word and don\\'t understand I ask God and He shows me what it means and how to apply it to my life. A real one on one ministry- the best way to grow! My husband and I sense God calling us to start a Home Church, hopefully within the next year and the primary teaching will be How To Hear The Voice Of God.

Back in 1986 I saw an advert in an American Christian magazine about Bible School courses and sent a letter requesting some teaching materials and course books. At this time I had been pastoring a small and slowly growing church unpaid for just over 4 years but it was now time for me to resign from my teaching post and pastor full time. It was my longing to continue to teach but Bible rather than Physics and Mathematics. So I personally worked through a course then called \"Communion with God\" using the manual and later the teachers guide and tapes. I was astounded. It introduced me to journalling and put all I had wanted to express about walking closely with the Holy Spirit and personal spiritual development so clearly. Our vision for our new church was one where the holy Spirit lead and all the people were filled and flowing with the Spirit. How do you teach and encourage that? In the first months of my new position I persuaded a group from the church to come to our Bible School and go through Communion with God with me. What a transformation! We took 22 weeks to go through the course, as I still needed to assimilate the material so that I could teach and model it. At the same time we embarked on the Bible Survey material - our church centred Bible School was born. Now in 2006 the Bible School - \"School of Christian life and Ministry\" continues presenting two or more courses (mainly from CLU) each of three terms a year and teaching \"How to hear God\\'s voice\" at least bi-annually. We have also set up satellite schools in towns up to 50 miles away to teach Communion with God and other courses to follow on. We, that is Margaret or others trained and sent out, have also run weekend \"Communion with God Seminars\" for churches and groups in many places in the UK. We have had Mark teach for us here too. I also had the privilege of meeting Patti at Heathrow airport and taking her to visit Windsor Castle before she had to return and catch her next plane. Although I have not yet used the the new manuals, Margaret has, and with good results.\n\nI know that the initial contact with Mark was a God arranged event. I received this package of materials back in 1986 at no charge. When we told Mark, he was surprised, saying that they never sent free stuff. But we were meant to have it and God arranged it.\n\nChurch website: www.elychristianfellowship.org.uk\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gnwk75ynw5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.262696,52.400134]}},{"properties":{"name":"Audrey Jones","description":"Posted by Cwgministries<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/Audrey_Jones.jpg\">Sister Audrey Jones and her husband Christopher Jones are founders of Voice of Deliverance Outreach Ministries.  They currently strive to work and reach those OUTSIDE the church walls. “We want to bring the word of God to the streets, corners, and to save the lost. Our approach is if they won’t come to God, then we will bring God to them.” Then through prayer and study, I will bring them to learn and know how to hear from God.\n\nGod has called me to teach His word, and though I am new to this, I am very eager to learn all that God has to show me.  I believe the wife of a minister is to work right along side him, and that when God called one to do His will, He called the spouse as well.\n\nI have taught Bible Study to teen and middle school age children, and have begun showing them how to hear from God.\n\nI believe that everyone should be able to discern and hear God. God has helped me to be a better help to others, and I want to share this blessing by teaching them how to hear from their Father. A lot of Christians, as well as myself, don’t take the time to hear God, but by becoming STILL, and QUIET, we CAN.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gnwjzyjozx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.300833,32.351111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Barry and Alice Mickelson","description":"Posted by Cwgministries<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/mickelsons.jpg\">Brookfield, WIWe had received Jesus Christ as Savior and served in our church(s) for nearly 30 years in different capacities. Yet our lives were a wreck in almost every aspect. This was almost the last stop of our train speeding down a mountainside out of control, with no brakes, which would result in the destruction of our marriage, our finances, our lives, and our very beings.\nMy husband Barry and I first learned to hear God’s voice in February of 2002.  Soon after I was diagnosed with cancer and my survival rate was not good. We were faltering and gasping for air. Mark Virkler graciously led each of us into the Presence of our Heavenly Father, teaching us to listen and receive from Jesus.  We each received a fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit Love and a breath of fresh air. That was the starting point in rebuilding our relationship with our Almighty God and with each other. As we listened and obeyed, God’s miracles were and are endless. We worked closely with Mark and knew that God was directing us to share this message with others bring healing into their lives.Our ministry is out of our home allowing us the privilege and opportunity of working with people from many denominational churches and those without church backgrounds. God’s Power and Authority flows with love and grace.  He rules and reigns and has dominion over all. We have seen deaf people hear, lame crippled people jump and run, depressed, oppressed people come off medications, broken marriages healed, salvation, and most of all to see again and again the radiance, joy, and love return to people. God indeed is a miracle working God everyday, all the time.  Our greatest joy and privilege in the service of our Lord is to be a part of the miracle that God is doing or will do in your life.

But now that I can talk with Him and really be intimate with Him, it has become even better! \n\nThrough dialoging, Our Lord has blessed me with inner healing and with greater love for Him and others. My walk with Him is fun and exciting! Dialoging with Him has also given to me the great desire to share with others what He has done for and with me. My walk, my life, have been totally transformed since I learned that I could speak with him, have fellowship with Him, and even dance with Him!

Rocked by this challenge, then the Lord asked Carol \"Would you not spend one hour with Me daily?\" Under heavy conviction Carol began to seek His face to really know Him and spend that one hour with Him daily.

The Lord has directed me to move in the ministry of faith and grace through the gifting of teaching and prophecy.

The \"Four Keys\" invoke communication with God for a fuller and more personal relationship with our Abba Father.\n\nThe \"Four Keys\" have affected my life by bringing realization of a personal God, Abba Father, not a supreme being waiting to point His finger and shoot.

God IS with us always, not a shout away but here, within, leading, guiding, speaking each moment of the day that we desire to listen. Everyone can enhance their relationship with God, by learning and implementing the \"Four Keys\" in their daily life. As simple as the keys are, they impact our lives remarkably.
