We are also fortunate to have some of the most fantastic walks, views and countryside in this part of kent.  Chartham is close enough to Canterbury for a night out but far enough away for the night out to not follow you home.  By this I mean you can go out and enjoy yourself, get a cab home (because there are no trains into the village from Canterbury past 10pm), and go to bed without having to listen to everyone else on thier way home, vomiting on your doorstep as they pass.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6opuufsj62m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.0287,51.24877]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lat,Long: 51.31834,-0.23474 My Long Term Family Home","description":"Posted by Ma77y<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Seriously cool place to grow up.  Acres of space to play e.g. on the race course or in the surrounding woods.  Some great schools in the area and friendly people (in general).  Even better than this though is the fact that you are still only 40 mins to 1 hour away from central London by train and not much more that that by car.  The area come to a standstill for the first week in June when the Epsom Derby (the most important horse race of the English season), takes place.  This is a great day out even if you are not in a gambling mood.  The atmosphere is great.  A bonus is that the three pubs that surround the course  The Derby Arms, The Rubbing House and The Tattenham Corner are all well run and the food is of a good standard in all of them.  Personally I prefer the Derby Arms.  The food costs more but the quality is there to support it.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6opuu40e3j7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.23474,51.31834]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lat,Long: 51.40389,-0.0003 My Wife and I's first flat","description":"Posted by Ma77yBromly is a great town which is more like an affluent suburb of London.  Bars, shops, clubs cinema, swimming pools, all of which you would find in most large towns, but done at a slightly grander scale (due to the massive ammounts of council tax the residents pay).  The is a fantastic mexican resturant quite close to the cinema and a great belgian returant underneath (and to the rear of) the Glades Shopping centre.  The Beligian place is called L\\'Abbye and it rocks.  Shortlands is really only a place because there is a train station there and it is quite a steep walk up into the main town of Bromley.  Again Bromley is quite middle class and the population a little elderly, but the town itself is great for weekend nights out.  I particularly recomend \"The Partridge\", as a pub to go out drinking in but also for food during the day.  The pub seems to be a converted Bank or something and the interior is quite impressive.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6opuu21eiur"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0003,51.40389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lat,Long: 51.45443,-0.00217 Our First House","description":"Posted by Ma77yLIving here was great.  The rail connection into London Bridge staion takes only 12 - 13 minutes (on a fast train) and not only that but all around the staion is a parade of shops which would make some villages blush.  A good pub is the centre of this community and not only that there are two newsagents, at least two takeaways, a cafe, a florist a hardware shop and a drycleaners. The local primary schools are of a good standard and the people are generally friendly.  Hither Green was featured in the Guardian Newspaper earlier in the year as a hot place to move to.  I certainly enjoyed my time there.

However, there is a fantastic greasy spoon cafe in the central square and a couple of \"proper\" boozer type pubs that can only be found in South East London.  Ignore the Witherspoons pub and go for something a bit \"darker\".

Obviously to Football (soccer) fans, there is the slightly more important fact that Charlton Athletic\\'s football ground is also at this location.
