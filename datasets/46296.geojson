It\\'s the sort of idea that makes me <i>glad I exist</i>.\n\nSo I was terribly delighted to open Willamette Week the first week I was in Portland to <a href=\"http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3245/7977/\">discover</a> a group called <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/pillowfightpdx\">Pillow Fight PDX</a> had turned it into a recurring event, with a fight scheduled for the end of the week.\n\nI bought a small heart-shaped throw pillow at Goodwill (both for the irony of beating up people with it, and so I could give it to a friend who likes such things afterwards) and showed up at O\\'Bryant Square a half hour late.  There were still several hundred people there, mostly spectators, but in the middle was a clump of between 50 and 100 folks at any given time, clobbering each other with pillows.\n\n<a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/96/247673242_5e43e704a1_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/96/247673242_5e43e704a1_m.jpg\"></a>The number of combatants would dwindle at times, and then with a shout a new group would come running into the mix of it, adding more cotton batting and feathers to the mess.  At one point, a guy who looked a bit like a high school football player took charge, splitting the battle down the middle.  \"You can take our lives, but you can\\'t take our freedom!\" someone shouted in a Scottish accent, and then the two sides surged at each other.\n\nThe crowd really got into the silliness.  \"I\\'ve got bandaids!\" a girl bearing a first aid kit yelled.  \"Q-Tips!  And condoms!\"  There were lots of people in costume; at one point a guy was getting his picture taken on the lap of someone dressed as Santa, and when I swooped in with my camera for my own picture he yelled \"Everyone sit on Santa\\'s lap!\"\n\nI ran into Mike, the Aussie bloke from the hostel I\\'m staying at.  \"Do you have a photo of someone about to hit you in the camera with a pillow?\" he asked, and then swung his pillow like a windmill until I got a good picture.  \"I look like an evil yuppie!\" he exclaimed when he saw it.  I also followed him around a bit with my camera, figuring if I wanted to sell an article about the whole thing I could interview him later, or at least easily get his full name.  (He confessed afterwards that he was targeting cute girls, and after hitting them with his pillow, he\\'d flirt with them.)\n\n<a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/87/247672991_03450415a3_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/87/247672991_03450415a3.jpg?v=0\"></a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66jh7y0jezl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.67999,45.52129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pioneer Courthouse Square","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/6/69194260_d670bae70c_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/27/63074179_cf51dbd186_m.jpg\">715 SW Morrison, Portland, OR, 97205friday march 3, 2006. pioneer square. fight begins at 7pm. rules: 1) all pillows concealed until 7pm sharp 2) only hit other people carrying pillows 3) don\\'t put anything hard in your pillow <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66jh7yluyu3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.679398,45.519309]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santa in the empty mall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/75291554_9385579a3d.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/37/75291543_0891b7ed7d.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/36/75291529_1067c62e66.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\">Â in the nearly abandoned mallbottle rockets, hooting and merry making<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66jh7sooefq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.681751,45.519556]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santacon at Bliss","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/319370343/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/144/319370343_d6c1deb3fc_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/319370285/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/137/319370285_83e7daf83d_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/319369900/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/124/319369900_0495011b61_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/319370081/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/136/319370081_303bef3eac_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/319369862/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/137/319369862_2503148b38_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124430429@N01/319370124/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/136/319370124_d7fbd5eaf5_o.jpg\"></a>Go Santa. 400 santas in hedonistic holiday bliss. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66jh7vyvfoi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.65977,45.52345]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santacon meeting spot","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://home.comcast.net/~sefritz1/sc43545.jpg\"><img src=\"http://home.comcast.net/~sefritz1/sc43557.jpg\"><img src=\"http://home.comcast.net/~sefritz1/sc4c0408.jpg\"><img src=\"http://home.comcast.net/~sefritz1/sc43550.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\">Â <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\">Â <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\">Â <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\">Â Come in your best santa duds for some raucous mayhem and good kleen fun.

I don\\'t tend to dance in public anymore (except to ska), because my dancing is big and ridiculous and I\\'m shy.

Show up at 11am. We mush at 11:30am sharp. You can pre-register by sending e-mail. The event is held on the same date the \"real\" race each year - the first Saturday of March.\n\nIn the Alaskan Iditarod, more than sixty dog sled teams race across the frozen tundra from Anchorage to Nome. In our urban version, teams of \"dogs\" lead by a musher will pull their sleds (shopping carts) through some of Portland\\'s most scenic areas. These teams of barking humans must negotiate through the unrelenting and unforgiving dangers of Portland\\'s urban frontier. As an incentive to run, dogs and mushers alike will have several \"rest stops\"Â to replenish lost fluids and discuss tales of mayhem. The course is over four miles, so dogs and mushers alike need to be ready and able to run their tails off.\n\nThe 5th annual Urban Iditarod will start at the Fire Station on S.E. Madison right next to the Willamette River and follow the same basic course as the 2005 event. The course map will be posted on the website as well as passed out at the race start once the \"rest stops\" are confirmed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66jh8534bnz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.665889,45.513001]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/12872","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dj10ninjas","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dj10ninjas","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/12872","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=12872,platial:user=dj10ninjas","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":46296}
