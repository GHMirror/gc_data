She called me to tell me that my mothers father had died. In that instant I knew that she was next. I took my 3 year old son and went with my mother and my both of my fathers parents to my grandfathers funeral. It was the last time I saw her.  A few weeks later she died in the garden which had been the source of the strawberries that i grew during my high school years in addition to much wonder, love and care and all of the jam that they brought me during my early college years. When my grandfather died my father rounduped (sterilized) the entire garden. Then my father sold their home site unsene to a Californian for a third of my annual sallary. I found out nearly a year later. The californian by that time had already sold it at a profit to a couple from California who didnt belong to the community. I have met these people and made peace with them and the house but when that ***wipe of a half a man dies I intend to dance happily on his grave. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a0869jg83q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.730393,47.116986]}},{"properties":{"name":"Original location of sid.buymusichere.com","description":"Posted by Feurig<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/2000_0109_170120AA.JPG\">920 SW Emkay Drive, Bend ORWhen we first took on the bmh project the server was colocated in bend.
