This is a really popular entrance that leads onto the Leif Ericson drive.

The park itself is huge and it has trails through open fields and forest area. The summer dog park is at the 45th entrance and is fenced, huge, grassy and busy.

It is sanded to protect streams from doggy run off making for an interesting experience. On dry days everyone comes home with sand in their hair. It is smaller than the summer dog park so on nice weekends it can get a little crowded. Easy access to the walking trails in the park though, but watch the little leaguers in the spring.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qbgvsfhhbb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.719817,45.469175]}},{"properties":{"name":"Marquam Nature Park","description":"Posted by Alyss05<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/0/Marquam_Nature_Park.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewFile&amp;PolPhotosID=466\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> From the entrance on Sam Jackson Rd you can hike up a canyon, loop around another or follow the trails all the way up to Council Crest. Because the trails are down in the canyon you really feel like you are out in the woods, but its really just the West Hills! The trails connect all through here and you can hike for miles if you have the stamina. One of the connections is the 40 mile loop trail that circumnavigates Portland.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qbgw2042ik"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.692995,45.503339]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oredson Todd Woods Access","description":"Posted by Alyss05This parking spot connects you to the all weather trail in Oredson Todd woods and eventually to the White Rabbit and other trails in the Ashland Watershed. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qbgw1ykh68"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.676709,42.167889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Powell Butte Nature Park","description":"Posted by Alyss05<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This park is very popular with hikers, dog walkers and in the dry months bikers and horseback riders. I love going here on clear days because from the top you can see the mountains loud and clear. Trails range from paved to rutted, from open meadow to deep Douglas fir woods. Check the map at the parking lot. Be sure to have a leash with you because the rangers do patrol. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6qbgw42cv8v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.497408,45.49087]}},{"properties":{"name":"Terwilliger Trail Access","description":"Posted by Alyss05<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> The trail goes off from the west side of Terwilliger Blvd and is pretty clearly marked with a green Marquam Trail/40 mile loop sign. This trail goes up through the woods to meet up with the Maquam Nature park trails at Marquam Hill Road.

From the main parking lot I really enjoy taking the dogs on the North Horse Loop. There are generally fewer hikers here so it is easier to let the dogs loose.
