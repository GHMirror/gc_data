The apartments all contain roughly the same lay out--a large room in the entry way, a kitchen nestled between the living room and the hallway, one or two bedrooms, and a bathroom.  White paint is the only adornment on the walls and beige carpet blankets the floors.  This uniform practical layout connects every apartment in the complex.  However despite the consistency in design, cleaning each apartment is a unique experience.  The habits, messes, and even belongings of the building\\'s past inhabitants seem to haunt the space.  In last night\\'s apartment, a thin film of blackness coated windows, refrigerator, and doors indicated that its prior resident smoked.  Sometimes the kitchen cupboards contain crumbs of the crackers, cereal, or bread which once resided in them.  Earlier this year we cleaned an apartment where we found a ratty wifebeater, strong cologne, and oily tanning solution still tucked away in one of the closets.  The artifacts painted a clear portrait of the room\\'s former dweller.  \n\nLast night while scrubbing down a stove, I found myself wondering what conclusions one might draw from my own clutter--whether my empty coffee cups or the colored pencils which have slipped behind my desk provide insight into my personality.  I wonder about the material things I’ve abandoned, thrown away or left behind and how they reflect the remnants of past relationships, past hardship, and my past life.  When I was in high school I worked at a used bookstore and spent hours reading the inside covers of old books, from children’s printing to adult’s inscriptions, the inside covers reveal a glimpse of their earlier owner.  I used to wonder how people sold books to a used bookstore which contained such personal notes or such beautiful indications of the past.  Reflecting upon it now, I realize that maybe for some people, leaving the clutter behind, whether it’s old belongings, an old mess, an old book, or old feelings, is the only way to face the future.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcooz6emu5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04597,41.46285]}},{"properties":{"name":"Danielle","description":"Posted by RbuttonIt’s seventy degrees today in Denton, Texas, a stark contrast from the overcast sky and cold temperatures which characterize Valparaiso, Indiana.  Denton, Texas hosts an international jazz festival and at one point was home to musician Norah Jones.  However when Danielle talked about her hometown she talked less about the culture and more about the people.  \n\nLike her hometown, Danielle is warm.  She laughs easily and smiles easily.  She’s laid back.  She wears a grey Kappa Delta sweatshirt and a shiny diamond engagement ring, both indications of some of the people she cares about.\n\nWhen I asked Danielle why she left her warm southern hometown for Northwest, Indiana she initially answered the great financial aid package but after a couple more minutes of thinking she went on to talk about the warmth and friendliness of the people.   She said that despite the obvious geographical, cultural, and meteorological differences between Indiana and Texas, the people in the places share similar warmth.  She characterizes Valparaiso as “southern” in its friendliness and small town amiability.  \n\nThe biggest difference she notices between the places is the weather.  Unlike many Midwesterners, Danielle likes the snow.  She smiled and laughed, and told me a story about pausing on the way to class to take pictures of the snow to send her mom.  She adds with a grin, “Even though I’ve been here three years.”  Danielle doesn’t take things for granted.  It also struck me that sharing the experiance with her mother was important.  Her only qualm with the snow is the immobility that the cold weather brings.  For example, recently she was unable to make the trip to see her fiancé in Ohio because of a blizzard.  I thought it was interesting that cold and the dreariness didn’t bother her, winter only becomes a hindrance when it interferes with her seeing people she cared about.  \n\nIn the brief time I spent talking to Danielle what became obvious to me was the value she placed on people, on friendliness, on community, and on loved ones.  The small town southern friendliness she remembers in her hometown and sought out in Indiana seem embedded into her personality, values, and even wardrobe.  She notices geography and culture as a part of place but recognizes what gives a place or a person value is interaction with people.  \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcop54mpub"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.01859,41.47875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dorm","description":"Posted by RbuttonMy friend Zach says the first thing he likes to see in a person\\'s house is there computer desk.  He likes to visualize where there voice comes from in animated instant message conversations or lengthy e-mails.  \n\nThe amount of time I spend at my computer probably merits a more lavish workspace.  Many authors designate a room in there house to writing, designating a space which suites there creative needs.  My desk sits in the corner of my dorm room, a shame to feng shui.  I sit on a large metallic blue exercise ball, perched in front of a plastic vinyl desktop roosting on a sturdy wooden surface.  Knicks and scratches decorate the wood, a testament to the many students who have labored at it before me.  My shiny metallic lamp and desk accessories seem to emphasize the beige blandness of the plastic surface.  A large pencil holder sits next to a small set of metal drawers stuffed with paperclips, tea lights, fake pearls, and Neosporin.  On top of it sits colored pencils and paint brushes, a constant reminder of the art I\\'ve neglected in college, and a collection of fragrant room sprays I use to mask the musty scent of the room and the stench of wet running shoes.  Crowning my desk is a blue denim bulletin board, decorated with black and white images of my brother and I running across the beach up north, my best friend and I in Paris, and my family in Traverse City.  The photos make the space mine and transport me to my writing room, allowing me to imagine possibilities beyond my dingy dorm.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcootppkol"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05566,41.37681]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hands","description":"Posted by RbuttonAbe Jones once told me the first thing he notices about someone is there hands.  When I asked why he replied that hands reveal a lot about a person.  My hands look decades older than they actually are in the winter.  Running outside everyday in the harsh Indiana weather leaves them grooved and wrinkled, weathered and bloody.  I peel off my gloves at the end of a cold run to reveal fresh cuts on my knuckles, where the cold has punctured my leathery skin, tearing open new wounds.  My face is dry, and my feet are blistered but my hands bear the brunt of the cold weather’s abuse.   \n\t \nI have always ran well during the winter.  I crave the challenge.  To me, attacking the cold daily in my Asics and spandex is an act of defiance against our sedentary society.  I get a masochistic sense of satisfaction from slipping across the ice for six to twelve miles, with the wind slashing at my face and the cold biting my ears.  The pristine whiteness of the ground, the grey of the sky, and the wail of the winds, backdrop my rebellion with all the dignified loneliness of a black and white photograph.  Some people hate winter running.  I love it; the cold makes my mind and body as tough as my hands.\n\n\n \n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcoovw2xkj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.07352,41.47566]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jordan","description":"Posted by RbuttonJordan Stanfill sits on his black futon, slouching and staring straight ahead.  Video games and empty Gatorade bottles litter his floor.  An Elton John poster adorns his wall and bottles of sparkling grape juice decorate his shelves.  \n\n“Goshen is almost the exact same size as Valpo,” Jordan explains of his hometown.  “I lived in a trailer park until second grade, then I moved into a neighborhood.  There weren’t a lot of kids so I ended up playing with my brothers most of the time.”\n\n “My Dad is a truck driver.  He was gone a lot when I was a kid but now he takes more local routes.  He married my mom when she was 17 and he was 19, they’d been dating like three months and she got pregnant,” he says waving his arms, nonchalantly.  “She was like a sophomore,” He says with a smile, shaking his head.  “He joined the army and was stationed in Germany, then in Colorado Springs.  My Mom finished high school in Germany.  My parents always told me never to join the army…they would basically disown me if I did…they treat you like crap and pay you nothing.  My Mom was a new mother and my parents were really poor when my Dad was in the military.”\n\nHe talks about his relationship with them, “They’re younger parents.  That’s different from most people.  My Mom is only 41.  My Dad is 43.  My Dad is a funny guy,” He grins, “He’s laid back.”\n\nHe pauses, “Mom and I are always at odds…I don’t know—about random stuff…the peace corps.  She doesn’t want me to join—she thinks I should help people in this country.  That’s the most ridiculous argument,” He throws his hands up in the air, “Other stuff too…my hair…” Jordan’s reddish brown curly hair reaches his shoulders and brown stubble speckles his face.  “I think she just wants to piss me off sometimes.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcoouo6y4g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.16553,41.40978]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lancaster, PA","description":"Posted by Rbutton<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcop2ggol5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.29456,40.03813]}},{"properties":{"name":"Naperville, Illinois","description":"Posted by Rbutton<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcop6hfi5q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.20648,41.7836]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sactuary","description":"Posted by RbuttonDuring Wednesday night prayer service I slipped out of the lower chapel to get a drink of water and use the bathroom.  I mounted the steps and stole away from the sounds of voices and the bright light into the nave of the chapel.  The nave, which on a Sunday morning seats over two thousand people, lay dim and vacant before me.  Only a soft murmur of voices gave evidence to the jubilant singing in the Gloria Christi Chapel below.  The room was dark except for the faint glow of candlelight from the alter.  The stillness and dimness of the room seemed to accent the chaos of my everyday life.  For a moment I paused basking in the peacefulness I rarely find in other facets of my day.\n\nFrom the 4th to the 17th century in England, convicts found safety in the asylum of the church.  The asylum seeker was to confessed his sins, surrendered his weapons, and surrender to church supervision of the church or abbey in return for legal protection. Today some illegal immigrants still find sanctuary in the church and international law recognizes the right of asylum.\n\nThe idea of the church as a refuge, a place apart from the laws, regulations, and programs which governs our day to day life has always captivated me.  The church provided safety and a place for individuals with nowhere left to run in the middle ages.  However today, all too often it becomes just another way to discriminate and exclude, rather than a safe refuge in an unforgiving world.  \n\nWednesday night I found refuge in the empty chapel.  For a moment in the stillness I found sanctuary before it slipped away. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcoozx27t1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05292,41.46331]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stage...","description":"Posted by RbuttonSomeone once compared life to playing a violin solo in public and learning the instrument as you go.  In the stillness this image resonates with the apprehension and quiet acceptance of this pubic display of vulnerability.  We look out from a stage, not a beautifully back dropped oak stage, but one casually littered with debris, shards of metal, an old pop can--the clutter and litter with which we all co-exist.  From this imperfect pedestal the rest of the world appears more pristine than our portion of it.  Rows of grey folding chairs stand in a militant line, some illuminated by sun, others quietly lurk in the shadows.  The darkness envelopes the back of the room, so we don\\'t even know how far the audience extends, only that we are being watched.  In the left corner, sunlight peaks from an open door, a promise of escape that we cannot possibly reach from our spot across our public perch.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcoordfcb1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.00623,41.42213]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valparaiso","description":"Posted by RbuttonValparaiso seems to draw its importance from loose associations with iconic names, places, and people. Lincolnway. Washington Street. Franklin Street. European style salon. American legacy. Some of the businesses opt instead to use happy affirmations as their title. Bon Femme. Express Yourself. Butterfly Kisses. Valparaiso is a Spanish word which means Valley of Paradise. \r\n\r\nA man walks down the sidewalk in downtown Valparaiso, wearing dark blue jeans, suede boots, and a puffy charcoal jacket, his white hair brushed back into a slick cap. He looks down at the ground, averting my curious gaze. His nervousness seems to embody the self consciousness of the city. \r\n\r\nThe courthouse stands in the middle of the downtown square, decorated like a Grecian temple with Doric columns framing its front, and a scale of justice on its frieze, emblematically declaring the importance of the institution. Walking up to the imposing building, I peered through cheap plastic blinds into a window, where a heavyset middle aged man sat, twirling in his office chair. Potted plants created an artificial garden around his window sill and a plastic Casper smiled out at me from a plastic stick in one of the plastic pots. \r\n\r\nThe restaurants in downtown Valpo seem to span the globe. Tony’s Italian Cuisine. Don Quixote stands next to the Buck Stop. The China House is decorated for Easter.

We walk up the pristine white staircase in the VUCA, with oak edging and the marks of newness, cleanness, and middle class suburban safety.  I run into several friends on the way and exchange hugs and promises to call.  As we weave toward our destination, we pause for a moment at a bulletin board, looking at internships in Chicago at the art institute, eagerly anticipating our futures.  When turn the corner to Professor Tomasek\\'s gallery of New Orleans I\\'m in a completely different place altogether.  The colors, the vibrancy, and the explicitness of the photos bare no resemblance to the Northern Indiana landscape I inhabit.  One photo shows bright features picturesquely encircling a man in drag.  Another image shows a man with a bright blue feather wig, and bright blue make-up grinning knowingly.  The faces aren\\'t different from the faces I see everyday but the colors, the costumes, and the expressions are distinct and different.  I re-walk through the gallery, examining the dates and begin to notice the difference between the more recent photos and pre-Katrina Marti-Gras.  In the more current pictures, the faces are sadder and more defiant.  The landscape is weathered and the costumes are more political.  The expressions are not so blissful and the images no longer seem as funny and lively.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcoosn2rlp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.07077,41.46743]}},{"properties":{"name":"sacred","description":"Posted by RbuttonAbout fifteen minutes West of the Mackinac bridge, I crack my window and Joey begins to squirm.  He wriggles and throws his nose into the air, and inhaling the fragrance of pine trees.  He pants and wines, and his high pitched cries and his hot rancid breath engulf the backseat of the car, saturating the space with his excitement.  For Joey, my twelve year old black and white spotted dog, the scent of pines and the fresh crispness of the Northern air mean our cabin lays less than an hour away.  Upon our arrival, Joey struggles out of the car, knocking over backpacks and digging his nails into my thigh, too anxious to wait for me to gather my belongings and put on my shoes, and flies into the woods, digging his face into the ferns, smelling the pines, and marking the sacredness of the spot by urinating on every tree.\n\nThe inhabitants of Michigan’s upper peninsula claim the area as “God’s country.”  Bumper stickers declare, “say ya to the u.p. eh?” spoofing the state’s slogan with the French-Canadian Norwegian twang that characterizes the region.  They accept that the convenience of shopping malls and Sam’s Club store lay on the other side of the bridge knowing that their homeland possesses a piety unquantifiable by census statistics.\n\nThe holiness of the upper peninsula rests in the moss which carpets the woodland path and crawls over fallen trees.  It streams through the pine trees, speckling the forest floor with stripes of sunshine.  It teems in life saturated in its rivers, its lakes, and its woods.  In the minnows which flicker through the shallow waters, the ferns which canopy the forest floor, and the dragonflies which skate across the water.  It lingers in the tranquility of the winters, when the foreboding isolation drives the tourists from the territory leaving the world wrapped in a silent whiteness.  As children walking home from the neighbor’s house on winter nights, my brother and I often broke into a sprint, unsettled by the eerie silence of the north woods and the power of the world which surrounded us.   <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mcop2gob4l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.50635,46.07323]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237276","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rbutton","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rbutton","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237276","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":14,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237276,platial:user=rbutton","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44116}
