During the Spring high=water periods fish migrate from Nez Perce Creek into this pond.\n\nAs the season progresses and the water warms, those fish that can - leave.\n\nSight fishing is possible if you use stealth techniques. Hatches are rare but midges seem to be ever present. Simple nymphs produce well.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67l2oa4ovwc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.82214,44.57191]}},{"properties":{"name":"Midway Run","description":"Posted by Yellowstoner<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/06/4/midway_run.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> -- When you know where the cold water seams are this is a very productive bit of nymph water. Feather Dusters, Princes, and Hare\\'s Ears are all succesful.\n-- There is a small population of little yellow stoneflies here too. The fish look up after a spinner fall and morning fishing can be productive.\n-- In the Fall there are several deep holes that can hold some upstream migrants.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67l2oe5euud"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.83288908,44.5244772768]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Faithful","description":"Posted by Yellowstoner<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67l2o1te1x5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.82862,44.46031]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ouzel Falls","description":"Posted by Yellowstoner<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Before we knew that the American Dipper was not the Water Ouzel of Europe we called this place Ouzel Falls.\n--It\\'s really not a waterfall, and it\\'s inhabited year \\'round by American Dippers. This bit of rapid water is coming to be referred to as \"Dipper Cliff,\" which is a more appropriate name. Here the Firehole River cascades over some bedrock and forms two nice pools.\n-- The pool above the rapids is really a rather long run with a rocky bottom that harbors at least three kinds of Stoneflies. Today the large salmonflies are emerging. For the next two weeks or so there will also be an emergence of little yellow stoneflies. The trout in this section will take nymphs up to size 4 with vigor. The drawbacks to this stretch at the lower end of the upper Firehole Canyon are poor parking, traffic at streamside, and the real possibility of hooking a tour bus with your back cast.\n-- The pool below the rapids is a long gentle run that also holds fish and occasionally will provide excellent dry fly fishing to a late evening caddis hatch. Both pools are neglected by contemporary fisherfolk because of the traffic and lack of safe parking. If you are willing to walk a bit along the side of the road, and endure the sounds of continuous motor vehicles there is good fishing to be had here.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67l2o2g5c4j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.85179,44.61149]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pocket Basin","description":"Posted by Yellowstoner<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/06/4/caddis_peacock.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/06/4/fi_shere_0.jpg\">The Firehole wends its way through quicksand, treacherous &amp; slippery bedrock, hot springs, and fumeroles in Pocket Basin.\n\nThe hides are secure and the water clear. Approach the river and the fish with care and caution.\n\nCaddis and occasionally Baetis are available on the surface. Fish in the early Spring through Mid to late June.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67l2o86akpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.83289,44.55987]}},{"properties":{"name":"Upper Firehole River","description":"Posted by Yellowstoner<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/06/4/up_fire.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> -- From the parking area to Lone Star Geyser this segment of the Firehole is populated with eager fish and very few fishers. The walk is gentle and the bicycle path is often crowded with visitors. \n-- Only infrequently will technical or advanced fishing prowess be required. An Elk Hair Caddis, a red or yellow Humpy, or an Adams will suffice for the surface fisher. Prince Nymphs seem to be preferred in this section, although most nymphs will suffice.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67l2o38f9is"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.804382563,44.4379166576]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/28127","metadata":null,"contact_name":"yellowstoner","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:yellowstoner","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/28127","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=28127,platial:user=yellowstoner","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44757}
