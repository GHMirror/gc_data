On our way down we took a rest on the rocks by the river soaking in the amazing view. Then a cable car ride through the mist to the top of a mountain. We couldn\\'t see anything once we got up there so we just ate a Korean sweet pancake then went back down. I nice stroll through a temple and then we walked back to town, Seorakdong. There we found a slightly (ok very) creepy hostel to spend the night. It was empty save a few rooms. So we, of course, proceded to make a horror film in the halls, basement, and attic. I regretful and against my will became the star of this film (as I was apparently the only one who was scared!). <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69hl65odoia"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[128.410949707,38.1367169041]}},{"properties":{"name":"2 - O'Hare Airport","description":"Posted by Rebeccajanek<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> ORDDrove to lovely and exciting O\\'Hare Aiport and made my way to London, England...and eventually Ruskington.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69hl68wz498"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.887589,41.9761]}},{"properties":{"name":"3 - London, England","description":"Posted by Rebeccajanek<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> london, englandThis isn\\'t the aiport, but I don\\'t really know where that is.
