It was the place that affected me most. I actually saw numerous places throughout the city that were still being reconstructed from when the U.S. bombed the &amp;%0 out of it in WWII. One place in particular, die Fraunkirche, completely collapsed after we bombed Dresden, and after they cleared the rubble they salvaged all the sandstone they could and rebuilt with new sandstone. So, when you see a picture of it, or in person there are two colors of sandstone. Old and new. I call it the polk-a-dot church. Last year, they finished the completion of the rebuilding of it. It has taken them that long to rebuild something it took seconds to destroy. It made me think about the correlation between life changing decisions and time.

I bought 3 drawings from a street artist. I drank warm beer and loved the smell of schnitzel everywhere I went. Everyday there is an open market to buy anything from flowers to fresh meat to fabric.

(the thing I loved about the U.N. was that when we walked in, there are about 100 pictures of elderly people from all around the country (most of them dead) and it told a little snip-it of their life next to each of their pictures; I remember this one lady.

We finally stopped in a park and took a nap, where I fell in love with this nearby, rundown building. Its walls were the color of ash and it looked neglected and loved at the same time. We had drinks at this little cafe nearby and talked for 4 hours about everything and nothing. That day we also went to castle where the Austrian Monarchs used to live, when Austria was a monarchy.
