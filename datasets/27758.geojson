American Camp is one of two sections of the San Juan National Park. We biked to this little known park and discovered an obscure piece of American history. Back in 1859, an American shot a British pig eating in his garden. The British threatened the Americans and pretty soon both sides were calling in reinforcements, until saner officers diffused the situation. Today you can wander the meadows of the site were the American troops were stationed. The vistas of the sea are especially breathtaking on clear days when the wildflowers are in bloom.

I have never regretted choosing to attend here. The university is divided between the college and the music conservatory.

Students also tend to have a quirky side, which we jokingly referred to as \"the Lawrence Difference\" (which is printed on the school\\'s literature).

Off-campus teams are welcome to join and teams come from all over the Midwest and beyond.\r\n\r\n Lawrence hosts a wide range of artistic and cultural events throughout the year, many of which are open to the public. These include full-scale operas and musicals, dramas, musical concerts and student recitals.

Tucked into a quiet corner of the UBC campus, the museum has a jam-packed array of bentwood boxes, totem poles, argillite sculptures and masks. Be forewarned that the items on display are not well labelled for the novice viewer, so plan to take one of the excellent and free guided tours. While I aimlessly wandered, my husband soaked up the information and learned a lot more than I did. There\\'s also a section that\\'s a working archive, where you can peruse the storage cases of thousands of objects, using the reference catalogs to find descriptions of what you\\'re seeing. Be sure to wander outside to the longhouse and lonely totem poles overlooking English Bay. The highlight of the museum for me was the gorgeous  \"Raven and the First Men\", carved by Haida artists Bill Reid. Placed in its own atrium and bathed in sunlight, truly a jaw-dropping and mystical experience. \r\nYou can reach the museum by public transportation, just be sure to verify with the bus driver where to get off for the UBC campus.

We spent an entire day here, walking the seawall promenande from the north side of the city and around to the crowded beaches on the south side. Sane people should elect to use the park\\'s bus system or rent some bikes to get around, but if you have all day to linger, walking isn\\'t too bad. Just make sure you have a picnic packed, as there is no way up to the restaurants on Prospect Point from the promenade. (We ended up surviving on a lunch of granola bars...and if you\\'re diabetic or hypoglycemic like we are, this is a very foolish strategy...in our defense the map can be misleading!) Along the way we saw totem poles, a cannon used as a clock, locals enjoying a cricket match, the Vancouver Aquarium, lighthouses, beautiful vistas, exotic boats (one looked like it was an old Chinese trading ship from the 1800s), and locals fishing. Pack your swimming suit and towel to join the locals at the crowded beaches at the end of your walk.
