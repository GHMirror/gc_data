And you get them all—and more—here: Arab B-boys in white hats and untucked long-sleeved shirts crunking Usher from their Lincoln Navigators; little boys and girls darting around their hijab-bedecked mommy, fighting over the last drops of dough, the Middle Eastern yogurt drink; students poring over textbooks, waiting for their study buddy; men in suits stopping in for a snack before walking across the way to smoke at one of the shopping plaza’s two hookah lounges.\n\nThere’s not much yet in the way of lean-to counters and jukeboxes, but it’s no big deal: Al Amir’s primary draw is its extraordinary sphihas, what clueless food critics—me—describe as Lebanese pizza. In my defense, sphihas appear like New York-style pies, thanks to their thin, toasty, wonderfully crunchy crust. And the preparation is identical: cooks roll flat a ball of pita-bread flour in the backroom kitchen, layer it with the ingredients of your choice, and then shove the proto-sphiha into the small brick oven near the cash register. It’s ready in about four minutes.\n\nSphihas are about all Al Amir produces—no baklava, no hummus, no grape leaves and just one type of sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, charred beef and nutty tahini sauce. Unlike so many pizzas, though, the flavors in these sphihas are intense and quite rare—this is only the second sphiha shop in the county after the esteemed Al-Sanabel Bakery. The cheese is Akawi, a slightly tough Palestinian strain that confuses at first with a salty coating but eventually reveals a luscious, sweet milk flavor inside your mouth. You can eat an all-Akawi sphiha, but it’s best when combined with meats—say, soujouk, the spicy beef sausage that’s the pepperoni of the Middle East, or the tart minced-meat spread lahmbaajin. Vegetarians can relish a sphiha sprinkled with zaatar, a zesty pesto of thyme with olive oil and sesame seeds that will pucker your palate. And there are more sphihas—seven in total. They’re the size of an individual pizza, yet impossibly cheap—the most expensive tops out at .50, while a fresh spinach sphiha is an obscene 99 cents.

Brodard makes five kinds of the fresh rolls: You can get the standard, ubiquitous fresh shrimp and sliced pork version here, but the house specialties are more worth your time -- the Nem Nuong Cuon, featuring nem, sweet grilled Vietnamese sausage (referred to as a pork cake or paste) and a crispy fried leek, and the Chao Tom Cuon, with a grilled shrimp cake (\"paste\") rather than fresh shrimp. An order of 3 hearty rolls runs about .75. Also recommended: The roasted duck salad (.95), numerous versions of bun (another salad-like dish of rice noodles, lettuce and carrots topped with meat or seafood and tangy sauce), and banh xeo, a pan-fried crispy rice-flour crepe flavored with coconut milk and stuffed with shrimp, sliced pork and bean sprouts (.25). <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66p0d9wcew1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.956965,33.759455]}},{"properties":{"name":"Byblos Café","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/nightoutorg3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/sm51food1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 129 W.

Orangethorpe Ave., AnaheimAt the very, very center of Islamic Chinese food is a round of sesame-flecked bread, a minor flour-and-water achievement that\\'s as thick as the Bibles smuggled into China, with three or four doughy strata hovering between crispy top and bottom planks.\n\nThe bread, which must share DNA with ancient oven-baked Middle Eastern breads, is fine on its own, but even better when it replaces rice to soak up sauce from the shredded chicken with dry bean curd or to dunk into a warm pot of lamb stew.\n\nAt Mas\\' Islamic Chinese restaurant in Anaheim, you\\'ll have to wait at least 15 minutes for an order of it, but that\\'s fine; it\\'s the sort of food that shouldn\\'t be made ahead of time. You can have it stuffed with green onions, or not. There\\'s also a sweet version filled with red bean paste.\n\nThe restaurant stands in an industrial section near Fullerton, and with its indoor fountain, large chandelier hanging inside a domed ceiling, red walls and the presence of owner Jamilla Ma in white headdress, it feels as though it dropped down from the sky.\n\nMa owned the other Islamic Chinese restaurant in Orange County, Jamillah Garden in Tustin, which she sold two years ago. The menu is essentially the same. Plenty of familiar Chinese dishes, all prepared in the Halal way, according to Muslim dietary rules. Pork and alcohol are verboten ingredients.\n\nThere\\'s a stronger-than-usual emphasis on lamb and tripe. She serves handmade, nicely chewy noodles. And of course, there\\'s the bread, which doesn\\'t appear too much in Islamic restaurants in China where it\\'s so commonplace in homes no one orders it outside.\n\nOther than that, though, the menu is very familiar to anybody who\\'s ever ordered an egg roll, a pot sticker or kung pao anything. There\\'s a very nice shredded chicken with dry bean curd that\\'s at once mildly sweet and spicy. The hot-braised shrimp is forgettable, but the salt-and-pepper shrimp is worth fighting over, each little pink curl crispy from a coating of its two seasonings and a toss into a sizzling hot pan.\n\nI was underwhelmed by the steamed dumplings and pot stickers (even though the dough draping both was pleasantly toothsome) and the fried calamari, which looked like onion rings, was unremarkable even if its crust was as crispy as it gets.\n\nBut the sautéed pea-pod leaves, while tasting very familiar, seemed refreshing: bright green leaves still attached to crispy stalks, flecked with garlic and glistening with a touch of sesame oil. The dry sautéed string beans were crunchy and nicely charred in spots and the eggplant with curry, practically a savory pudding, was very good.\n\nThe homemade noodles show up in both brothy dishes and chow meins. They\\'re irregular cuts, thick and chewy in spots, more tender at different points along the strands. The lamb stew warm pot is a bracing dish, the broth tinged with anise and other ingredients in Chinese five-spice powder. Big chunks of supremely tender lamb still on the bone float about, although you must negotiate the clinging bits of white fat.\n\nMost beef dishes are worth your time. The stir-fry leek with beef is brazen in its embrace of five-spice powder, the beef deeply red, fully cooked and supple.\n\nMas\\' is the place where you want to start with the familiar and then tiptoe over to the cold spicy beef, the cold spicy tripe and the ox tongue in brown sauce. One day, the cold jellyfish might be a weekly necessity.\n\n-ocregister<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66p0d6j5tby"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.862315,33.865036]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mil Jugos","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/ff_miljugosca.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/ff_miljugos.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 318 W 5th St, Santa AnaA tiny Venezuelan restaurant in downtown Santa Ana on Fifth Street between Ross and Broadway.\n\nThe name translates into 1,000 juices, but in reality, you have a choice of about 20 fruit juices.

We had the Pangan Seabass with minced shallots, red chili &amp; lemon sauce wrapped in banana leaf (2 for whole fish), Roti Prata (crispy Indian style bread served with curry sauce), Mango Salad, Pineapple Curry Prawns, Potato Curry Chicken, Malay Sizzling Beef, Malay Peanut Crepe (crispy pancake stuffed with ground peanuts), and Mango and Coconut Puddings. Desserts were on the house - thanks to Daniel, owner of the restaurant and also our neighbor. We couldn\\'t get enough of the Pangan Seabass and Roti Prata - highly recommended! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66p0d8px2eh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.82747,33.759704]}},{"properties":{"name":"Village Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 22902 Los Alisos Blvd. #G, Mission Viejo, CA 92691 Serves Middle Eastern food and has excellent shwarama and baklava.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66p0d6y9kfk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.669606,33.626763]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zankou Chicken","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/foodimages%5CHalfCkHero.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/foodimages%5CTarnaPlt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2424 W.
