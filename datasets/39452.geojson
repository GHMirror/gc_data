And you get them all—and more—here: Arab B-boys in white hats and untucked long-sleeved shirts crunking Usher from their Lincoln Navigators; little boys and girls darting around their hijab-bedecked mommy, fighting over the last drops of dough, the Middle Eastern yogurt drink; students poring over textbooks, waiting for their study buddy; men in suits stopping in for a snack before walking across the way to smoke at one of the shopping plaza’s two hookah lounges.\n\nThere’s not much yet in the way of lean-to counters and jukeboxes, but it’s no big deal: Al Amir’s primary draw is its extraordinary sphihas, what clueless food critics—me—describe as Lebanese pizza. In my defense, sphihas appear like New York-style pies, thanks to their thin, toasty, wonderfully crunchy crust. And the preparation is identical: cooks roll flat a ball of pita-bread flour in the backroom kitchen, layer it with the ingredients of your choice, and then shove the proto-sphiha into the small brick oven near the cash register. It’s ready in about four minutes.\n\nSphihas are about all Al Amir produces—no baklava, no hummus, no grape leaves and just one type of sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, charred beef and nutty tahini sauce. Unlike so many pizzas, though, the flavors in these sphihas are intense and quite rare—this is only the second sphiha shop in the county after the esteemed Al-Sanabel Bakery. The cheese is Akawi, a slightly tough Palestinian strain that confuses at first with a salty coating but eventually reveals a luscious, sweet milk flavor inside your mouth. You can eat an all-Akawi sphiha, but it’s best when combined with meats—say, soujouk, the spicy beef sausage that’s the pepperoni of the Middle East, or the tart minced-meat spread lahmbaajin. Vegetarians can relish a sphiha sprinkled with zaatar, a zesty pesto of thyme with olive oil and sesame seeds that will pucker your palate. And there are more sphihas—seven in total. They’re the size of an individual pizza, yet impossibly cheap—the most expensive tops out at .50, while a fresh spinach sphiha is an obscene 99 cents. No sales tax!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642le8k77po"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.958949,33.826169]}},{"properties":{"name":"Al Sanabel Bakery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/32food1.jpg\">816 S.

But there it is in Tustin: Jamillah Garden, an expansive, always-crowded oasis where customers speak Arabic as often as Chinese, where bread is king. Inside, photos of Mecca and bamboo paintings recall a time when 7th-century Arab traders obsessed with meat (but terrified of pork) brought the rigid-but-refreshing halal guidelines to the Chinese anything’s-edible, noodles-and-rice worldview. Chinese converts to Islam went on to concoct a culinary truce famous across Asia—hearty, greasy but nuanced grub that seems like the product of a single continent before continental drift, a time when maybe the deserts of Arabia baked beneath China’s Tien Shan Mountains. And then everything was covered in soy sauce.\n\nA Jamillah Garden meal starts as it does in most Chinese restaurants—complimentary green tea, egg flower soup, and egg rolls sparkling with freshness. The service can be a bit forgetful, but forgive: Jamillah Garden runs in an industrial park, and nearby businesses provide a constant stream of customers throughout the day, all of whom try the patience of the restaurant’s waiters while deciding which of the 200-plus items they’ll order. Servers will brusquely recommend that you join everyone else in beginning the feast with a cold appetizer per the customs of Islamic Chinese cuisine. The chilly aperitifs cleanse the palate for the fiery entrées but are also delightful on their own. Eating a small bowl of beef tendon—like Jell-O in consistency and shrieking with garlic—is like slurping down frosty vermicelli noodles. Spicy beef is almost never on the menu, but it’s worth asking for—served in tender slices, as cold as a Big Stick, and spicy enough to incinerate an Aztec. Hot sauce turns the chewy bits of honeycomb tripe a pale red; the results are the best use of offal outside of menudo.\n\nThere are some vegetarian choices. One noteworthy offering subsumes half an eggplant in a soy-derived brown sauce that would make a French cook envious. But Jamillah Garden and its patrons come mostly for the meat. Lamb is prepared in about 15 different styles, from a spicy Hunan-style stir-fry (that becomes butter in your mouth and might be the greatest meat dish from China since won ton soup) to a hot pot as big as a beach pail steaming with salty broth and pungent, soft mutton. Sliced curry chicken seems to have come by way of an Indian restaurant on its way to the wok, a giant mass of bird tinted yellow with a thin but walloping curry. The braised shrimp’s tangerine-and-lemon tones, meanwhile, would easily be the next sweet-and-sour chicken of fast food Chinese joints if it didn’t involve such an elaborate cooking process. Any meat dish should be accompanied by hand-pulled wheat noodles, thick as your belt and almost as long; Jamillah presents the noodles in portions that guarantee leftovers for your next six meals.\n\nPlease don’t overlook the sesame bread. \"It takes 15 minutes to make,\" the waitress will warn you. But it’ll be worth the quarter hour. It’s a sesame-speckled loaf about the size of a manhole, two inches thick and as toasty as a pizza; regulars stuff meat, rice, noodles, everything into the layers inside the bread. The many slivers of green onion give the bread a verdant, sharp taste, and after nibbling on a slice, you’ll never want to eat anything else again.\n\n-Orange County Weekly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642leax2b59"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.808791,33.717457]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ka Ju Tofu Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/photo_1338_2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 5408 Walnut Ave, Irvine, CAKa Ju Tofu Restaurant (949) 653-2849<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642le1rusap"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.770506,33.689175]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kassra","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 27261 La Paz Road, Laguna Niguel, CAPersians have a wonderful potato chicken salad that\\'s mayonnaise-based and yet not heavy.

The sleepy market is pungent with the aroma of curry, turmeric, fenugreek and cardamom, all draping around you like six yards of a sari.\n\nLaxmi has been around for 16 years and exists as a small temple of cluttered, unmanicured hominess stocked with English teas, sacks of jasmine rice, frozen meals of curry and a thriving selection of Indian movies and CDs.\n\nPass all this by and walk to the back where a short buffet is ready every day around 11 a.m. The lamb curry is tender, vegetable meatballs sit in a creamy yellow gravy, rolled chickpea crackers are wonderful snacks. Maybe the lentil soup is too watery, but the naan, charred in spots, is never insipid.\n\nThere are battered and fried potatoes that are perfectly creamy inside. And the pakoras, lentil fritters, are smooth and spicy.\n\nAll this requires a sweet ending. The rice pudding is milky and flavored with cinnamon and cardamom and fat raisins. The gulab jamun are deep-fried dumplings tasting vaguely of sweetened condensed milk soaking in simple syrup. You can also fill up on plain lassi or mango lassi, both are thick, creamy slushies made from yogurt.\n\nThere\\'s also a vast menu of Indian specialties, including parathas (stuffed pan-roasted wheat breads), outstanding biryanis (a pile of saffron-yellow rice flecked with spices and mixed with tender lamb or chicken), and vegetarian dishes such as baingan bharta (lucious eggplant simmered with onions and cinnamon) and aloo-poori (spicy potatoes served with deep-fried whole wheat bread).\n\nYou\\'ll be shocked by the length of dosas - they\\'ll seem like baseball bats. The large, diaphanous crepe is rolled around a filling of spicy potato and served with two sauces, one is made of coconut, the other tart and bright red from tomato. On the same plate is a dark pickle that\\'s as assaulting as anything you\\'ve evertasted.\n\nThe tika masala is one of a few dishes where spices take a back seat to a sweet, creamy gravy. It\\'s excellent with either lamb or chicken.\n\nSomeone in the kitchen here is making this soul food with imprecision, and yet, it\\'ll sink permanently into your psyche.\n\n-ocregister<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642ldyziql9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.823544,33.739661]}},{"properties":{"name":"Le Diplomate Café","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/201300962_4f602c825c.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 4237 Campus Dr #B161, Irvine, CA 92612A mom-and-pop shop that has catered to swarms of regulars over the last 15 years.
