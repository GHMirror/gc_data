With kind permission of Mark Friedl, copyright by Boston University.\nThe MODIS land cover product from Boston University (MOD12Q1 V005) was created using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer instrument on the NASA Terra Platform \nusing data from the year 2005. \n\nLand cover is only one of a number of different global products, which also includes a radiation budget and ecosystem variables that are \nproduced by the MODIS team [Morisette et al., 2002]. The land cover product (MOD12Q1) was produced at a resolution of 500 meters and uses information from a number of other MODIS products. The MODIS land cover data set uses all 17 classes of the International Global Biosphere Project (IGBP) legend [Loveland and Belward, 1997], and unlike the GLC-2000, a global classification approach has been used. The MODIS land cover classification algorithm (MLCCA) uses a supervised classification methodology based on a globally distributed set of training sites. One of the key features of the MLCCA algorithm is a technique known as 'boosting', which allows robust assignments of pixel probabilities [Friedl et al., 2010]. Version 5 of the MODIS land cover data set (MOD12Q1 V005) is used in this paper.\n\nThe accuracy of MODIS version5 is 75%.\n\nThis is the UMN MapServer operated at FELIS","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"University of Minnesota","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"imagery,modis","published":"2014-08-10T16:05:20-04:00","id":83797}
