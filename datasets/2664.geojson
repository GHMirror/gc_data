developed this set of point locations for public schools in North Carolina as part of a project for the NC Division of Emergency Management. School data serves multiple purposes, but foremost for this project, public schools are vital facilities in terms of emergency management. Many schools serve as shelters and all are critical to hazard vulnerability planning and emergency response. CGIA used two methods to generate point locations for public schools. First, CGIA used a road network from GDT, Inc. with ArcView GIS to geocode the addresses. The initial process matched 60 percent of the schools with a point on the road network. Point locations are approximate, based on an interpolation of street numbers along street segments. Second, CGIA worked with the NC Department of Public Instruction to use the Transportation Information Management System (TIMS) along with geographic layers from the NC Corporate Geographic Database to determine school locations. Many of these point locations are coinciden with the center of school buildings on digital imagery or along driveways and may be more accurate than points located using the first method.\n\nThis data was created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).\n\n","stats":{"PERIMETER":{"max": 0.0, "mean": 0.0, "variance": 0.0, "stdev": 0.0, "min": 0.0, "median": 0.0},"SCHLPL07_I":{"max": 2477.0, "mean": 1239.0, "variance": 511500.5, "stdev": 715.192631393808, "min": 1.0, "median": 1239.0},"REVIEWED":{"max": null, "min": null, "median": null},"END_GRADE":{"max": 13.0, "mean": 7.20508679854663, "variance": 9.01284971984602, "stdev": 3.00214085609687, "min": 0.0, "median": 6.0},"PHONE":{"max": 9803436948.0, "mean": 6768806372.55753, "variance": 7.650307586369e+18, "stdev": 2765918940.67216, "min": 1111111111.0, "median": 8284288769.0},"MAIL_ZIP":{"max": 28906.0, "mean": 27995.841340331, "variance": 264568.875059268, "stdev": 514.362591037945, "min": 27006.0, "median": 28079.0},"FAX":{"max": 9809496771.0, "mean": 6735981332.64191, "variance": 7.87048120521016e+18, "stdev": 2805437792.07634, "min": 0.0, "median": 8283977652.0},"onemap_pro":{"max": 0.0, "mean": 0.0, "variance": 0.0, "stdev": 0.0, "min": 0.0, "median": 0.0},"SCHLPL07_":{"max": 2477.0, "mean": 1239.0, "variance": 511500.5, "stdev": 715.192631393808, "min": 1.0, "median": 1239.0},"PHYS_ZIP":{"max": 28906.0, "mean": 27995.7880500606, "variance": 265138.112975074, "stdev": 514.915636755259, "min": 27006.0, "median": 28079.0}},"next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"limit":1000000,"total":2477},"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"metadata":"http://www.nconemap.com/Portals/7/documents/metadata_records/schlpl.htm","url":"http://www.nconemap.com/default.aspx?tabid=286","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"NC Department of Public Instruction; North Carolina Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCCGIA)","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.nconemap.com/default.aspx?tabid=286","data_type":"Dataset","permissions":[{"group_id":"everyone","permissions":{"download":true,"view":true}}],"classification":null,"tags":"carolina,education,nccgia,north,public,school","id":2664}
