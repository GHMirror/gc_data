Simpson. Perched on a scenic bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, this formal six-acre garden is loaded with tulip and daffodil bulbs, which effuse through April. Hundreds of fuchsia and white rhododendrons and azaleas bloom through mid-May, while 600 rose bushes and some 5,000 flowering annuals and perennials call forth a riot of color through the month of September. Monterey cypress and Sitka spruce frame the garden, and fall foliage displays are spectacular. Trails meander above the Pacific, and hikers can picnic at rocky Cape Arago while viewing marine mammals and tide-pool life.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65ggny6bbkm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.376748,43.329804]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tohono Chul Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 7366 N Paseo Del Norte, Tucson, AZ 85704This garden\\'s name means \"desert corner\" in the native Tohono O\\'odham language, and the 500 species of plants from the Southwest and Mexico attest to the regional specialty of this 37-acre park.
