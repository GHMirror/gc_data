This location is apprx 166 nm South of Houma, LA. \r\n\r\nA significant kick entered the well bore at 0300 hrs.  At 0400 hrs the drilling crew noticed the kick and hydrocarbons began flowing past the BOP.  The crew tried to shut it in, but comms were lost with the BOP, which prevented the crew from bringing it under control.  At 0405, the rig tried to disconnect and move off, but could not due to the loss of comms.  As the rig tried to move off of location, the riser system failed and the riser system failed and the riser was lost at sea.  All crew are accounted for and there are no injuries reported.\r\n\r\nAn ROV was deployed and determined a lot of debris was on top of the BOP.  In addition, the ROV determined that hydrocarbons were flowing out of the riser pipe 30 ft above the BOP and there was some indication of hydrocarbon flow out of an area below the BOP.  Hence, the FOSC would like to initiate an Incident Specific RRT call for THIS DRILL SCENARIO for subsea dispersant application.  The RP is already mobilizing subsea dispersant equipment in anticipation of approval.","link:alternate":"http://www.incidentnews.gov/incident/8359?f=861321913","updated":{"end_time":"2011/09/14 20:00:00 -0400","original":"2011-09-14T00:00:00Z","granularity":"day","time":"2011/09/13 20:00:00 -0400"}},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"title":"Cedyco Manila Village Spill, Bayou Dupont, LA","published":{"end_time":"2011/09/11 20:00:00 -0400","original":"2011-09-11T00:00:00Z","granularity":"day","time":"2011/09/10 20:00:00 -0400"},"id":"6","summary":"The Coast Guard is responding to a report of crude oil discharge in Bayou Dupont and north Barataria Bay.

The estimated aerial release was approximately 40-50 thousand gallons of diesel fuel and the remaining flow is yet to be determined, but could bring the total to over 100K.  Virtually the entire release is confined to the land, either in the spray area or in a quickly constructed dike area.  Only minor sheens have been reported in the Seekonk River.  Gross oil recovery is nearly complete and gauging is in progress to determine the amount released.  Assessments are in progress o determine the amount of oil remaining in the soil on top of the water table.
