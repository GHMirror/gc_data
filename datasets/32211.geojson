It began operation on a limited basis in the early 1940s. Full-scale operation started in 1967 and stopped in 1977. The landfill received all types of waste, ranging from household garbage to hazardous materials. Local residents complained of run-off problems from the landfill, and leachate streams also were reported. Initially, monitoring wells in the area detected IRON and CHROMIUM. Local private wells serving approximately 1,000 people are free of contamination. No public water supply is available to residents in the area. In June 1981, EPA found ground water contamination to a depth of 80 feet. Status (July 1983): Jacksonville installed additional monitoring wells around the site. Recent sampling indicates one monitoring well contains excess LEAD. A leachate stream containing low levels of PYRENE and FLUORANTHENE has been controlled by filling and grading the area where the landfill was eroding.\nSource - <a href=\"http://www.scorecard.org/env-releases/land/site.tcl?epa_id=FLD980556351#siteinfo\">Scorecard</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n8ya9rro9l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.73545,30.371597]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pope Place Ash Site","description":"Posted by GrifrayThe Pope Place Ash Site consists of 5 parcels located at the end of Pope Place and Bagley Road in Duval County.

From 1949 to 1955, the city of Jacksonville disposed of municipal solid waste and municipal incinerator ash at the site. In 1955, the Duval County School Board (DCSB), formerly the County Board of Public Instruction, built the Mary McLeod Bethune Elementary School on 14 acres in the central portion of the site. The Jacksonville Electric Authority electrical substation occupies about 2 acres in the northeastern portion of the site. The site includes residential areas such as the Bessie Circle apartments to the west of the elementary school and the Moncrief Village and Palm Terrace apartment complexes in the northern part of the site. Moncrief Creek runs through the northwestern part of the site.\nAccording to the 1990 Census, approximately 3,930 people (6% white, 90% black, 1.5% Hispanic, and 2.5% other) live within one-half mile of the site. About 16% of the population is under the age of 9 and 18% of the population is over the age of 65. About 48% of the population over age 25 graduated from high school. About 37% have less than a 9th-grade education. The median family income is about 7,814. Eighty-five percent of the housing units are occupied (Bureau of Census, 1990).\nThe area around the site is residential. The Mary McLeod Bethune Elementary School is on the site (closed after the 2000/2001 school year) and seven child care centers are within one-half mile of the site (Bureau of Census, 1990).\nInformation from the <a href=\"http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/hac/pha/brownsdump/bro_toc.html\">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6n8ya3ewfpe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.684875,30.36564]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/236613","metadata":null,"contact_name":"grifray","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:grifray","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/236613","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":30,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=236613,platial:user=grifray","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":32211}
