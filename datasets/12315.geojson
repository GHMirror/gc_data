It almost seems unethical to call it volunteering. The simple act of teaching and preparing our youth for confirmation has opened my eyes, as well as my heart, to a learning experience like no other. I have watched our youth come together in feeding those of us who have come upon the most difficult of times. Whether feeding the homeless, helping children at a Christmas fair, making pillows for hospice patients or simply sharing in song and prayer, these youths have left an impression in my heart that will last forever.  \r\nIt is amazing what one little church, in one little village, can give to such a big world. It has shown me that no act of kindness is too large or too small; that one person, child or adult, man or woman, rich or poor can make a difference. In a world that sometimes seems to be spinning so fast that I can barely keep my feet on the ground, I know there is a place of peace. I know there is a comfort in being part of a community. I am the one who is blessed to have been included in these works of helping hands.  \r\nIt is a privilege to ask, “What can I do?”, and a greater honor in doing it.

I would like to link the adult literacy programs with family literacy starting with the preschool population. Because of family work schedules, these programs need to be offered on Saturdays and Sundays. Programs like my description are not offered here or not on the weekend. I will first take the class on adult readers and then push for these programs. Since I don't speak Spanish, I will need to go slow and find the right contact people who can guide me.

I had always been an involved parent, given the needs of having an eight-year-old and twin six-year olds.  However, this year I found myself organizing their schools in areas that they could benefit.  My son is autistic, and attends an inclusionary private school that combines small class size and technology today.  http://www.nbcbayarea.com/health/topics/High_Tech_Helps_Autistic_Kids_Communicate_Bay_Area.html.   I support the school as the Spirit Chair, encouraging pride in this small school wherever possible... including having an entire line of sensory sensitive logo gear made for purchase by the families.  My twin daughters are in kindergarten at our local public school.  I was the Chair for the first fundraising auction for Gardner Bullis Elementary and raised twice our financial PTA goal for the evening.\r\nAs that event was coming to a close, I was invited onto the Board of Advisors for GreenTown Los Altos.  I attended one meeting and saw the potential and am most excited about this grass-roots organization!  GreenTown is a non-partisan community organization begun to help Los Altos and Los Altos Hills become more sustainable vibrant communities.  We are educating people to reduce waste, water and energy use at home, in businesses, in schools and in our government. \r\nWe are currently expanding the Freiker, Bike to School Program to all of the town elementary schools.  This became an exciting program as I began to learn how politically this program fits into Obama's plan for Green Jobs.  Each Freikometer is handmade and cost $7500 per school for equipment and software leasing for the first year, and $5000 each subsequent year.  In addition to reducing the vehicle miles travelled, students are given weekly incentives for this behavior.  At Almond School, the only school at present participating in the program (there are only 12 in the nation!) a Freikometer installed in March 2009 has already DOUBLED the number of students biking and walking to school.  My goal as fundraising event Chair for GreenTown (www.greentownlosaltos.org), is to see us provide the opportunity for other Los Altos schools to participate in this awesome program.  We want to create a national competition that takes advantage of this technology and makes biking and walking to school second nature again for kids and parents...(but for an Obama Mama like me, also gets someone like Van Jones championing this cause as we begin employing more people to build the Freikometers!)\r\nThese are the things that help keep our local economy healthy, and while there have been several stores downtown close during these difficult economic times, I believe my time invested is well worth supporting the infrastructure with which this nation found its success.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,  Crysta Krames","id":"a6298tla3c0x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.137,37.3666]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cynthia","description":"I  read  for the blind two hours  weekly.","id":"a6298thywke7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9703,40.7996]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dana","description":"<i>Animals &amp; Environment</i>This first idea I think get me very excited as I live in a dought struck area.

It didn’t take long before people started to contribute. Now the bin overflows with contributions that have to be picked up every couple of days. People have been very generous. (2) In response to President Obama’s  invitation to discuss the \"American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan,\" OMNI-NWACC, the student organization that I advise, invited students, faculty, staff, and members of the community to participate in a \"house party\" that resulted in a grass roots effort to help the unemployed in our area. (3) President Obama’s withdrawal of troops from Iraq and deployment of troops to Afghanistan gives our community the opportunity to consider how we can meet the needs of returning veterans and their families and how we can ultimately bring peace to the Middle East. To begin the process, OMNI-NWACC has sponsored a series of films and discussions called \"When the Troops Come Home.\" We are taking the audience through the battlefield experience, the rehabilitation process, and the experiences of the families left behind and hoping to provide a welcoming environment for veterans when they return.

My plan was to go to law school after a year back home – hopefully someplace prestigious back East. During that year, I joined AmeriCorps St. Louis, thinking that I would enjoy working with kids and the service experience would boost my law school applications. My intentions were good but not entirely selfless. As an AmeriCorps Member in the St. Louis Public Schools, I worked with many students who had little hope for their future. Their school district was struggling and their neighborhoods overrun with drugs and crime. I aimed to be an agent of change in their young lives, but in the end I was the one who was changed. I know this story may be unoriginal, but it is the truth. My service in AmeriCorps changed my life, opening my eyes to a side of my city I did not know existed. \r\n\r\nI stayed with AmeriCorps for a second year, abandoning law school applications in the process. After my two year “tour,” I was lucky enough to be offered a position on the staff where I now remain. In the years since, I have supported the service of nearly 250 AmeriCorps Members, all while taking classes to get back in the schools. I’m leaving AmeriCorps this summer to begin my student teaching. Inspired by my service in the St. Louis Public Schools, I’ve been working on my teaching certification and hope to be a middle school social studies teacher. Leaving a pretty good job at AmeriCorps St. Louis in the middle of this recession sometimes feels crazy, but in some ways my service in the program gave me no choice. Working with kids is my calling, and it is only because of AmeriCorps that I realized this.","id":"a6298tiiv3da"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.2902,38.6121]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ericka","description":"<i>Children &amp; Youth</i><img src=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/DeliveringOnChangeSubmissions/4c5af0bdff19426e8782661928683fff.JPG\" width=\"75\">I want to help others that are struggling with education so that they will be able to better themselves and not be left behind.","id":"a6298thz9fhg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.4795,29.7139]}},{"properties":{"name":"Erin","description":"<img src=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/DeliveringOnChangeSubmissions/0460a0ce1cdf4be4a4fae2693f64ecf6.jpg\" width=\"75\">7 months ago, I quit my advertising agency job to finally find a career that made me feel alive.

A healthy lifestyle is great, it is not a drag. Somehow this is a big secret in our country.

I was helped online for free by Dr. Stoll, who guided me to create lifestyle changes that set me on the path to health!  Now I'm doing great!

Some of my 8th grade AVID students are the same students I tutored when they were in the 1st and 2nd grade. I have witnessed them growing up and becoming some remarkable young women and men. \r\nThe students in our school come from a government subsidised housing project, we have 100% low income population and are also considered a low performing school.

I was recruited by the Director of an after school program for 2nd – 5th grade students in Fulton, MO. Little did I know then that AmeriCorps would become a part of my life that would never leave me. In that year I served in Fulton High School, tutoring students in American Civics, the languages, math and sciences; and I continued my time as an educator in the after school program for the young students. Just months after my service began Hurricane Katrina struck our nation. As a proud alum, I asked to be posted with the AmeriCorps St. Louis Emergency Response Team in Pass Christian, MS for the entirety of my winter break from college. I served for the full month, rebuilding a cemetery destroyed by the flood waters on Christmas Day and digging ditches to drain the water from the tent cities to ward off the mosquito populations on New Year’s Day.\r\n\tUpon returning to college, I focused on organizing the students at school to volunteer in their local communities. I began to organize the ground work of an organization that would become Mentoro Inc, an organization dedicated to the promotion of equality for rural America. On winter break, I once more returned to Pass Christian, MS and served for an additional month alongside the AmeriCorps St. Louis Emergency Response Team. I completed my junior year with a total of 561 hours of community service under my belt.\r\n          My leadership experience as an AmeriCorps alum reached new heights in early December of 2007 mid-Missouri was struck by a devastating ice storm that cut off power to thousands and destroyed homes and threatened families. We had an upwards of 10 people living in one home because everybody’s power was out and was in need of a shelter. I took charge in figuring out how to address the growing needs. \r\n           I remember walking outside, on the second day of the bitter ice storm that battered our community in inches of ice, and thinking how similar the landscape looked to the devastation of the gulf coast post Katrina. I knew that I had the training, the network of AmeriCorps Alums, the dedication and resources to help my community. So I asked to see the mayor, and with the City Hall phones ringing off the hook offered to create a Volunteer Coordinator Call Center that would be the point source for all victims and volunteers created from the ice storm. I got a resounding yes from the Mayor and set up an office in the Emergency Operations Center for Callaway County.\r\n              I was quickly pressed by so much adversity that I was not sure I would persevere. The new Director of the EOC had only been in her position for one month and the director of the local Red Cross was on vacation. By the end of the week the devastation was settling into the families of the area. My volunteers answering the phones became swamped with requests for help clearing debris, patching holes in roofs, finding electricity and warmth for elderly, and providing food for the still hundreds of residents without power. My new duties tested every skill, every ounce of leadership and used every lesson taught to me by my AmeriCorps training. At the end of the two months, with the initiative that I took as an AmeriCorps Alum, I had engaged close to 500 volunteers from all over mid-Missouri and helped serve approximately 150 families to rebuild their homes and lives. \r\n          As I neared graduation from college in the spring of 2008, I took on the challenge of becoming the state director of the ServiceNation campaign, sponsored by Be the Change, Inc., for the state of Missouri. Our campaign was the drive behind the Serve America Act. As the Change Agent Director for the state of Missouri I was in charge of creating awareness for the Serve America Act as well as highlighting the many service and volunteer opportunities that came from AmeriCorps programs across the state. We engaged countless hundreds of citizens in the spirit of service and I applaud you for holding true to your word of passing the Senators Hatch’s and Kennedy’s bill.\r\n                   This past year has also been an amazing experience. Along with the continued development of Missouri AmeriCorps Alums I have become the Executive Director of the Foundation for the American Constitution in Education; a foundation that I co-created with the Directing Change Agent for the state of Alaska from ServiceNation. Our mission is to bring together the many varying organizations, nonprofits, private citizens and schools across the nation to create a more dedicated education of the American Constitutions in the public school system. I hope people across the world can see my commitment to serving our nation and my dedication to employing AmeriCorps and City Year alums as my dedicated staff. From the oath that I took when I first dawned my “Grey A” I have carried this commitment with me this year and beyond;  I am an AmeriCorps Alum.","id":"a6298tp6vmrv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.9463,38.8528]}},{"properties":{"name":"John","description":"<i>Civic &amp; Community</i><img src=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/DeliveringOnChangeSubmissions/52919168c75247b8a6ec1ec618fd49bb.jpg\" width=\"75\">I try to personally THANK the Police who endeavor to keep our city safe and truly do care to do a good job, without becoming a part of the problem by seeing everyone as a criminal.

I can stand in front of people and do something that makes a difference.” The comments from one middle school student about her emPower Plant experience speaks volumes. emPower Plant is a hands-on experience of civic education involving students at an age when they begin to decide how engaged they will be with their communities in the future. They work as a team to address a community challenge; research, discuss and formulate ideas; build presentations and then take turns at public speaking when their resolution is put to the test by a panel of volunteer adult council members. \r\n\r\nThe learning doesn’t stop with their day in the emPower Plant immersion process; it is carried on as curriculum in the schools and ultimately as a real-life community project to promote long-lasting civic engagement. emPower Plant is a national model created by Heartland Foundation to be replicated across the country. \r\n\r\nAfter students from Benjamin Banneker Charter Academy in Kansas City, MO, experienced emPower Plant, they applied for and received a Jump Starters grant, offered exclusively to emPower Plant or Public Achievement students. The students agreed unanimously, “We want to feed the hungry.” The students (90% of which are on subsidized lunches), began researching gardening, and using community sources, within 5 months of its conception, their inner-city garden yielded over 500 pounds of produce for the Harvesters Food Network. \r\n\r\nAnother Heartland Foundation-sponsored youth empowerment program, Public Achievement, has allowed youth to form groups, take on issues, practice citizenship and learn about the democratic process. Through “Putting a Face on Poverty,” one group of PA students shared their personal experience and perceptions through a photo voice project, comprised of hundreds of photographs of poverty in northwest Missouri. Members of the team first shared their experiences to an audience of 2,500 at the Healthy Communities in St. Joseph, MO. “…we got to start critical dialog that was needed,” said one student. “It was like seeing lightening bolts going off.” The group continues to present their story in order educate and challenge communities to take action. Most recently five members of the PA Democracy Council presented their photo voice project during an international research conference at Tulane University. \r\n\r\nThis work is made possible by over 1,200 investors and a number of local, state and national partners including Learn and Serve America and the Center for Citizenship and Democracy. With this support, these young people continue to inspire all of us to get involved and think ahead! \r\n\r\n \t\t\t \t\t \r\n\r\nHeartland Foundation is a 501©3 \r\npublic charity dedicated to empowering \r\nchildren and adults to build healthier,\r\nmore livable communities.","id":"a6298to98sfo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.8443,39.7652]}},{"properties":{"name":"Judy","description":"I serve on the board of directors of San Angelo Habitat for Humanity.

It has changed my life.  \r\n\r\nI was headed in a negative direction until I became involved with the Corps.  I came to the Corps with all sorts of challenges and struggles including gang affiliation, homelessness, drugs, alcohol, limited family support, single parent household, family conflict with stepfather, anger problems, and stereotypes.  Times were very difficult for me and my family.  By the grace of God I found my way to the LA Conservation Corps and things started to turn around. I am on a journey to better my life and the lives of others.  LA Conservation Corps changed my whole perspective on life, made me see and hear the voice inside of me which was once a whisper but is now louder than a siren wheeling down the street in an emergency case.\r\n\r\nI’ve had to overcome many barriers. English is not my first language, so in school I had to learn the language.  I struggled through school and dropped out because of the problems I had with trying to complete my school assignments.  At age 19 I enrolled in Job Corps where I received my GED.\r\n\r\nFor a period of time throughout my youth, I belonged to a local street gang.  I’ve been told many times, “you can’t save the world”.  I guess that I am one of those individuals that wanted to change it as a gang member.  Despite the threats and fear, I gave up the gang life to try something more positive.  Now I am changing my little corner of the world in a positive way.  \r\n\r\nI started working as a Corpsmember at LA Conservation Corps in March 2007. While serving at the Corps I’ve also had the opportunity to gain much needed skills including carpentry, irrigation, masonry, resource conservation, building community gardens, tree planting, fire prevention etc.  Through all this service, I was impacted by the encouragement to show up every day and learn how to deal with others.  Without a doubt I am more mature, talented, wiser and more knowledgeable.  LA Conservation Corps implanted in me a belief that there is no limit; my limit is as high or low as I want it to be. \r\n\r\nI am the President of the LA Corps Leadership Council where my responsibilities include motivating other corpsmembers.  My involvement with the Leadership Council has developed my leadership skills to the point that I now recruit and promote participation in the LA Conservation Corps program activities, school, case management and, mentoring programs. \r\n\t\r\nLife after the corps will be a big step with more opportunities to grow.  I plan to enroll in community college and hopefully become a staff member with the LA Conservation Corps.  I plan on getting my degree in electronics and moving into a career, perhaps in construction.  It is because of my involvement with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps and national service in general that I am who I am today.","id":"a6298tgvnocn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.269,34.0386]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ketley","description":"<i>Civic &amp; Community</i>I have been an activist in Miami Dade County and the City of North Miami Beach for years and also i Adocate on  behalf of abused and neglected children as a Guardian Ad-Litem, We need a lot more guardians","id":"a6298torgf2j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.1782,25.9248]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kevin","description":"<i>Health</i><img src=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/DeliveringOnChangeSubmissions/d63645870fec42b78976f8f7bc335aa1.jpg\" width=\"75\">I am currently a senior resident in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at Indiana University.  My wife Megan and I (also a pediatrician), have sponsored a community vegetable garden and a local elementary school (Crestview Elementary School).  Approximately 75 % of the student there are on free or reduced lunch.  We live here in Marion County Indiana, where we have both seen the obesity epidemic and poverty take their toll on our children.  Megan and I are both suburbanites with strong rural roots who felt that the best way for us to make a positive impact for a small group of young people is by teaching them how to grow and prepare their own food.  \r\nThe produce from the garden will first go to feed the students and their families.  The hope is that we can distribute vouches to the students that they can use at a local farmer's market which will give us a booth for free.  After the first few hours of the market, we will sell the produce to the general public and give the money back to the school.  Whatever is left will be donated to Federally Qualified Community Health Centers such as the one where my wife works.\r\nThe principal at the school has been a fantastic advocate for the project and plants to work with teachers in order to integrate learning modules and projects into the garden.  Hopefully, this will allow the students to have more substantial \"buy in\" with their garden.  \r\nIf this project is successful I would like to expand the program to other public schools in the city.  The beauty of this project is that it is relatively cheap.  At present pace, we should be able to fully institute the project for around $700 dollars this first year.

Our community partners have included the Open Door Ministries, Salvation Army, Rotary Club, Optimist Club, Red Cross, Community Partnership RSVP, State Farm Insurance, Pittsburg Corning Industries, Sedalia Mayor’s Office, local Animal Shelter, American Legion, VFW, elderly residential care facilities, and many individuals and businesses.\r\n\r\nThe impact of Service-Learning on individual students is as varied as the number and nature of the projects.  For instance, two of our bilingual Hispanic students, Maria and Daniella, have spent their mornings at Heber Hunt working with select language-challenged students.  They relate a sense of satisfaction and pride as their charges improve, an awareness of being appreciated for the skills they possess, improved attendance, and Daniella has decided to pursue a degree in education after graduation!  Both of them helped to write a successful Para Mi! State Farm Insurance grant which yielded $1000 to assist in ESL instruction at Heber Hunt.  Another example is Janeth who claims an appreciation of the unique challenges she has experienced. She has gained insight into a variety of jobs and their requisite educational requirements.  Increased tolerance and learning to work with others despite personality differences are cited as is discovering the social order and how many persons truly care.  A third student is Jake, who claims that his S-L duties have related learning to life experiences, developed leadership skills, increased confidence in both himself and others, and allowed him to overcome a fear of public speaking.  He also cites increased compassion and understanding of others.  Lastly, there’s Amber.  She expresses increased personal confidence, making future organizational and/or employment contacts, pride in representing her school, and increased organization skills as the main outcomes of her participation.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that serving others is good work AND good learning!

What a teaching opportunity!\r\n\r\nSome of the projects we have conducted this year include weekly preparation of Backpack Snacks for over three hundred area elementary students, a Pen Pal letter exchange with a second grade class, collecting stuffed animals for Project S.A.F.E., a near-weekly guest speaker schedule for Whittier students, a Veteran’s Day observation which delivered a customized glass block bank to each of over four hundred veterans in the Sedalia area, holding a garage sale to raise funds to send WW II veterans to Washington, D.C. on the Honor Flights, a twice-weekly Reading Buddies program pairing Whittier and Heber Hunt students, in-house recycling of paper and aluminum, an on-going cemetery restoration, special events for local elder care residents, support of salvation army thrift store needs, ESL assistance for Heber Hunt, and many other projects.  Our community partners have included the Open Door Ministries, Salvation Army, Rotary Club, Optimist Club, Red Cross, Community Partnership RSVP, State Farm Insurance, Pittsburg Corning Industries, Sedalia Mayor’s Office, local Animal Shelter, American Legion, VFW, elderly residential care facilities, and many individuals and businesses.\r\n\r\nThe impact of Service-Learning on individual students is as varied as the number and nature of the projects.  For instance, two of our bilingual Hispanic students, Maria and Daniella, have spent their mornings at Heber Hunt working with select language-challenged students.  They relate a sense of satisfaction and pride as their charges improve, an awareness of being appreciated for the skills they possess, improved attendance, and Daniella has decided to pursue a degree in education after graduation!  Both of them helped to write a successful Para Mi! State Farm Insurance grant which yielded $1000 to assist in ESL instruction at Heber Hunt.  Another example is Janeth who claims an appreciation of the unique challenges she has experienced. She has gained insight into a variety of jobs and their requisite educational requirements.  Increased tolerance and learning to work with others despite personality differences are cited as is discovering the social order and how many persons truly care.  A third student is Jake, who claims that his S-L duties have related learning to life experiences, developed leadership skills, increased confidence in both himself and others, and allowed him to overcome a fear of public speaking.  He also cites increased compassion and understanding of others.  Lastly, there’s Amber.  She expresses increased personal confidence, making future organizational and/or employment contacts, pride in representing her school, and increased organization skills as the main outcomes of her participation.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that serving others is good work AND good learning!  Again – natural consequence for actions taken.  Any time personal growth and development can be intertwined with learning, teaching, and good works it’s a combination to keep!","id":"a6298ttf4t63"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2422,38.6951]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kim","description":"<i>Education &amp; Technology</i>The Waynesville R-VI School District has partnered with AmeriCorps to provide tutors to at-risk youth.

I organized students, teachers, parents and other community members to build, maintain and harvest the garden. We had an abundant harvest last fall and have since planted three fruit trees, planted and tilled a cover crop and built a greenhouse. I am an advocate for integrated, self-sufficient communities with localized economies. \r\nI believe change can be brought when people truly understand the state of the globe and how they, as an individual, can make a change. I think that environmental change and community change go hand in hand and directly effect one-another.\r\nLocalized communities, where people help their neighbors and use most goods and services within a certain vicinity, create healthy societies with good, giving people and a healthy environment with less fossil fuels used for transportation of goods.\r\nAlso, the more humans work with each other and the earth the more empathy they have for both. We need to move away from what Bill McKibben terms \"hyper-individualism\" where we are isolated from each other and the earth on which we depend. This loss of connection leads to humans exploiting each other and the environment.\r\nGardens, especially located in schools, can be used as teaching tools and can be applied practically. As teaching tools, students can learn the basics of gardening and how to fend for themselves. They can become leaders, teaching others and they waste less time indoors isolated from their community. Practically, this wholesome food can be taken home by the students and shared with family or implemented in the school's cafeteria (if they still cook food).\r\nMy life’s goal is to see that at least half of the homes in America get at least half of their food from their own gardens or from local gardeners/farmers. We need to become “locavores” for the sake of our quality of life, future generation’s quality of life and the environment’s health.","id":"a6298ttz8r04"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.804,38.7262]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lemel","description":"<i>Civic &amp; Community</i>\r\nI have started a project called \"The Resilience Project\".

It is like a showing of cars to the dealers for sale on their various lots and dealerships.  \r\n\r\nIn order for the cars to be showcaseed, they need drivers to drive the cars thru the 16 barns on the yards.  These drivers are paid only 25.20  for four hours of driving cars.   Now let me explain, these drivers come from all walks of life.  Some are waiting for the first paycheck from another job, some are in between jobs, some are just down on their luck.  They are the drug addict, the drunk, the mentally challenge, the ex-convict, the new parolee, the frighten woman running for her life.  the young kid who don't have anywhere to turn.  \r\n\r\nTo come and earn 25.20 for four hours of work is a better than nothing but a crying shame here in America.  To see what this country has come to in my short life is appalling.   They have to be there on the lot by 6:00am to sign up so that means that they have to leave their shelter,  because most of them are homeless. by 4:30 in the morning.  Traveling by bus, cars and vans, they make it to the parking lot without eating breakfast because the shelter does not serve breakfast until 6:00am.  \r\n\r\nSome mornings are cold and windy. but yet they keep coming.  They huddle under a poor excuse of a shelter.  Some days it is pouring rain, or just plain windy and cold.  \r\n\r\nI have taken it upon my own to bring food, such as breakfast biscuits, hot dogs, hot links on bun, coffee, snack cakes cold drinks, coffee, chips to sell.  But I find that most of them don;t have a quater to buy a cup of coffee, yet alone a $1.00 sausage egg biscuit.  It tugs at my heart to see the mass of human being being used.  I myself have had to work the auction to get thru to the next payday.  \r\n\r\nI have watch how they are treated like animals and used just for the purpose of making someone else some money.   Granted they could do better but some just don't know their way out.  It is said that you could lead a horse to water, but can't make him drink.  \r\n\r\nTo make sure that my God's people is fed, I do this without any reservations.  It started out as a base for a business. but I can't see the profit in it when my people are hurting as they do. \r\n\r\nSo every Wednesday and Thursday of each week I provide a little love for them in the form of something to eat.  I try to be there for breakfast and lunch.   Now granted my prices are reasonable but everything I make goes back  in to feed them another day.   \r\n\r\nBut my time has come to an end.  I being pulled in another direction.  The Bible tell us that charity begins at home.  So it behooves me to leave and go to another country.  I pray that my stay there will give me a more deep understanding of how my people are suffering.  You see it is not my will but the will of God that has place me in this position.   I can not refuse the Father, not after He gave up everything for me.   I will return to continue with feeding His people, but He has other plans for me now.  Just know that I will not rest until I return and find that my people are being fed.  So I bless those who come after me and not for just the profit, but to give a helping hand and an encouraging word to one who has lost their way.  \r\n\r\nPersonal reasons has me on this journey overseas.  But I will be in a place where there was so much suffering done and still is today.  I believe God is  placing me there to see that it does not matter what or where you may be his people still need to be fed.  \r\n\r\nIt is with the prayers and blessings of all America that I may go and come back a better person,  I pray that I see the goodness and glory of God there.","id":"a6298tksdvjr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.4646,32.7144]}},{"properties":{"name":"Maria","description":"<i>Civic &amp; Community</i>I regularly go for walks and pick up waste items along the roadside.

T. to succeed pilot project for participants of the Downtown Women's Center.\r\n\r\nIt is a formalization of a non- compensated volunteer activity as Tour Leader that I have been performing for the past two years. \r\n\r\nThis time it is still a volunteer position, as we are \"paid\" in kind from donnations in kind received by the DWC.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is not important, for to me : \"The role of a DWC Tour Guide is a combination of public information, public relations, marketing, advocate and lecturer. Depending on the type of group participants, any of these roles can apply.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the first paragraph of the manual that I am drafting for future candidates that may be selected as Tour Guides. It is a pioneering job as I am the first to be officially selected as the first Tour Guide on the program.\r\n\r\nHaving been giving tours for the past two years (previously also at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels), I feel obliged to tansmit all the knowledge, experience and information that I have collected to my future colleagues and successors.\r\n\r\nThe Downtown Women's Center is an important project for women who end up in distress, especially without housing. However, there s more to it than just providing a roof above our heads. That is what the DWC has developed and done best over the years.\r\n\r\nJust as young children are nourished, nurtured and developed by their parents, so are the women that went through traumatic experiences and, therefore, lost their confidence, self-esteem and ability to fend for themselves on these projects. All the workshops in the Day Service Center aim at therapeutical healing and empowerment to help these women cope with their issues and traumas, to share and receive support in group, to place their experiences in perspective in the multitude of ills and suffering in this life all over the world, to learn to set it all behind them and to stand up and strive for a new beginning and a future where they can again perform, give and serve, where their gifts and talents can again be developed to gain appreciation, even publicly and, possibly, one day be a source of income to become financially independent.\r\n\r\nAll the activities in the Residence aim at giving the ladies that have no or cannot be with their families the necessary distractions be it in family parties, outings, entertainment or sports events, Just like childre need a break from their daily routine, so do seniors need to be drawn out of heir monotonous existence and depression.\r\n\r\nIt is especially hard for women over 60 who nowadays are still very healthy and able to perform in a job, to be forced to retire and be useless. \r\nMany have not yet made their retirement eligibility and therefore have to live on minimal income. The cash they receive is absorbed to pay the rent, so they are left only with foodstamps. That does not provide ability to exert and exercise their mind and abilities as they were used to do. That is why heart disease, breathing problems, diabetes, seizures and dual diagnosis are common illnesses.\r\n\r\nIt is a myth that all low income women were addicts or prostitutes. Many residents have University degrees, some even double and triple and have never used or drank alcohol and are staunch Christians/Catholics.\r\n\r\nIt is often their faith that keeps them healthy and alive. The oldest among us currently is 81 years old and was the reason the whole project was started. some 30 years ago when Skid Row was really what it was known for and a dangerous place for a woman to be on the street.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that is why I consider drafting this manual very important, for to the different types of visitors, whether donor, volunteer, interviewee for a job or internship, students or just any interested party, the Tour Guide acts in many different roles to transmit the correct informatin, policies and ideas that make the project thrive and grow further.\r\n\r\nOnce my manual is done, probably by next week, I shall be happy to e-mail it to you, if I may, to give you an idea of what the nation needs to implement in every City and State..\r\n\r\nThank you sor allowing me to share.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nMaria Yvonne Tan.\r\n\r\nThe picture is from a Volunteer appreciation Day.

The students discovered malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes.  More than a million people die of malaria each year, most of them children under five.  Insecticide-treated mosquito nets, if used properly, can successfully prevent mosquitoes from infecting people with this disease.  For $7.50, an insecticide-treated mosquito net and medicine kit can be purchased and distributed to the needy to save a life.   \r\n\r\nAfter learning about the disease, and how it can be prevented, the students brainstormed on how to implement a project to raise funds for these lifesaving kits.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, October 24th the Bayless Leadership students kicked off their ROLL BACK MALARIA campaign with an assembly for the student body. The students showed a power point and acted out a skit to raise awareness of the devastating effects of malaria. A YMCA member from Africa gave a first hand account of the overwhelming consequences of malaria in his country. \r\n\r\nAfter the assembly the students designed, baked and sold “Malaria Prevention Kits”, or bags of cookies covered with netting, to raise money to buy the real malaria prevention kits.  The goal of the Bayless School District was to raise $2,000 to purchase 260 kits and save 260 lives.  \r\n\r\nThe project promoted so much interest, teamwork and camaraderie that the students could not produce the “Malaria Prevention Kits” fast enough to fill daily orders.  The team leaders had to quickly work with all their associates to produce the same quality product to help meet the surprising demand.  Within two weeks 1,000 “Kits” had been sold, and the $2,000 raised was in the hands of the YMCA to be sent to Africa for the Malaria Prevention Kits.  The students had learned the dramatic effect of their own leadership and teamwork while building their own character. \r\n\r\nThe students reflected about their work in a written summation about the project.

Students deliver hot meals daily to home bound senior citizens, create Halloween and Christmas center pieces for holiday parties, sew Halloween treat bags, send holiday cards, host a “Senior Prom”, and sponsor the “Walk For Wellness” fund raiser.  \r\n\r\nEveryday drivers from the senior center pick up high school students, or “runners”, at 10:00 a.m. and take them to the center. There they help the drivers pack the meals in their cars and hit the road. The runners do the legwork for the drivers, most who are senior citizens themselves!  The interaction between the drivers, the students and the clients is awesome.  The students come back bubbling with enthusiasm! “You get to do something that really makes you feel good. You think of yourself as a decent person because you are doing something that others appreciate,” says Nermina Malkic, one of the most dedicated “runners” in the program. It [Service Learning] has helped me understand everyone needs some help now and then.  It makes me feel good to know I can give hope to other people,” senior Christy Moehle said. “The MEAL RUNNER program has provided students with the opportunity to learn about seniors as well as themselves,” states Mrs. Brown, program coordinator.\r\n\r\nHoliday parties at the center are more festive thanks to the creation of edible centerpieces by the Bayless Foods students.  The clients enjoy special treats at Halloween time when they are presented with hand sewn gift bags filled with goodies.\t \r\n\r\nThe cafeteria at Bayless High School was transformed into a nostalgic 1904 era ballroom when the district hosted a senior citizen prom on Sunday, May 6th, 2006. The sixty guests were greeted and served by high school students dressed in World’s Fair costumes.  The guests and students danced to the sounds of “The Very Special Band”, a senior band who perform every Thursday at the senior center.  After the dancing the prom king and queen were crowned.  This year’s king was Sam Tringali and Eleanor Helfrich was the queen.  The dinner severed consisted of Italian salad, lasagna, and garlic bread.   A scrumptious white cake and homemade waffle ice cream cones (invented at the Fair) were enjoyed as the afternoon concluded.     \r\n\r\nBayless School district sponsors MARCH FOR MEALS, the fundraiser for the senior center.

I joined the FIND food bank auxiliary and canvassed to collect donations for a new pilot Backpack snack program for undernourished Boys/Girls Club members from a very low income elementary school. My husband used his computer skills to design (using another volunteer's photos) a compelling poster which was professionally printed thanks to another volunteer, for food collection barrels. He also designed a way to attach the posters (at eye level) in an easily removable way to the large barrels, and fabricated the metal and wood parts to do so.  We created a small card, with picture and text to explain, to use in stores where a point of sale contribution could be made through a cashier to the Food Bank. I wrote letters asking local stores to agree to place barrels and to adopt the donation cards at check outs. The donation card program was not received through local store managers, as it required corporate level approvals. A few stores accepted the barrels, and many were able to provide contributions for the food bank's Backpack snack four month pilot program.  \r\n\r\nWe are retired and spend much of the winter in southern California because we have family there. Working with the FIND food bank was fulfilling, challenging, and a positive expenditure of time for a couple of retirees with not much money, but lots of time.

It's not easy watching your spouse leave you for months or even years at a time. Although most learn that distance makes the heart grow fonder. That and making sure your phone is always near you so you never miss a call or being the first one to run out an get the mail as soon as the mail man leaves. Its also hard holding down a job, fixing things that you have no clue how to fix but you have to learn alone since your spouse isn't around to do it for you and taking care of the children. It's a tough job but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm proud to say my husband is in the military and he's wanting to serve this wonderful country until he feels its time to retire.  \r\nI'm also preschool teacher. I teach after school kids (ages 5-12 yr olds). I work with them not only in school but out of school as well. Some of my kids are fosters, don't have a parent around or their parents are struggling to make ends meet so they can't go out and do a lot of activities with them. So I will take them out with my son to the zoo, park or anything else they decide to do that day.  I feel that helping out the younger generation will help change the world later on in life. \r\nI also help out in the animal community. Since the economy has dropped the percentage of homeless animals as drastically increased. Every day a pet has been left at an abandoned home or left on the street. So I help out by going to local orginizations or even picking up homless pets I see while driving. I make sure to give them fresh food and water then take them to the local animal shelter where they can find a new home. \r\nThese are the main things but I could almost write a book on what I do on a monthly/yearly basis to help out. I would also like to thank President Obama for the changes he has been making so for especially for the military families. You are one of the very few individuals that truely care about the welfare and financial situations we may have. Many people think the men and women in our military make too much money but thats not the case. Its heart breaking to see a military family stand in line for wic or food stamps because they can't even afford to put food on the table for their children while serving our country. \r\nAgain, Thank you President Obama and God Bless.","id":"a6298tvn4162"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.347,33.539]}},{"properties":{"name":"Patricia","description":"I am an Americorps VISTA serving this year with my local community center as a Consultant for Senior Services.

She is the “Volunteer-In-Charge” and has kept everything running smoothly for many years.  Good used toys, as well as some new ones, are collected throughout the year.  She and her volunteer group sort, launder, clean, repair, and put batteries in the used toys.

The volunteers put stickers on all the toys to designate worth in points – red-3, blue-2, green/yellow-1, and no sticker-0.  Families, who want to participate in the project, are given 6 points to spend for each child.  That way they can shop and pick out toys that their children would like for Christmas.\r\n\tArolene has made a difference in the lives of families in need at Christmas time for many years.

The hotel industry, optical lab work, security jobs, etc., all left me feeling unsatisfied that I was truly doing something that fit who I was.  So when AmeriCorps first started, it was easy for me to make the decision to venture into something new.  I didn't realize how many new things I would end up doing in the short time I was there.  I got to start an afterschool grade school program that focused on neighborhood beautification and community service projects.  I fought Missouri forest fires, partnered with the American Red Cross to assess damage to flooded homes, facilitated conflict resolution and diversity appreciation workshops, set-up a mentoring program in a local children's home, and lead diverse teams of various abilities in outward-bound experiences.  Perhaps the deepest impact on my life came when I was flown to Oklahoma City in the wake of the bombing of the federal building. At the site of such tragedy, I was profoundly moved by the outpouring of citizens across the country.  The donations were so overwhelming, that the warehouse being used was in a disorganized state.  I worked 48 hours straight to organize and inventory the food and supplies, and still couldn't sleep knowing all the help that was needed.  \r\nAfter my two terms with AmeriCorps were over, I felt impelled to start a new career path in the human services field.  I accepted an offer to become the recreation coordinator for a not-for-profit agency, the Judevine Center for Autism.  I never knew how hard it was for families to deal with the financial and emotional strains of having a child with support needs to the degree that so many with Autism do.  In 13 years with that agency, I have served in capacities to support educational needs, in keeping the family intact, in finding and maintaining a job, in community integration, and in living independently as adults.  I am currently the agency's trainer for over 400 employees, and I travel across the country teaching people about autism.  The direction I was missing in my early adulthood has now actualized, and this was all triggered by my service in AmeriCorps.","id":"a6298tt0uolw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.3184,38.5439]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rita","description":"Donating food to a local food pantry.\r\n\r\nDonating clothing to a homeless shelter.","id":"a6298tprf3zv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.351,34.0677]}},{"properties":{"name":"Robert","description":"<i>Civic &amp; Community</i>The HOPE worldwide Framingham Food Pantry, that I direct, feeds over 350 families per month.

Last week, the St. Patrick Center announced receipt of a $600,000 gift from Anheuser-Busch that will benefit the BEGIN Training &amp; Education Center, as well as the St. Patrick Center’s Employment Enhancement Program.  Smith has worked tirelessly as first-year coordinator of Project BEGIN since last June, and is the only full-time staff besides the director, Jan DeYoung, working on the project.  As an AmeriCorps*VISTA member, Smith accepted the assignment through the MU Extension Youth Enterprisers Program, a statewide VISTA project supporting Missouri communities in expanding their capacity to support entrepreneurship.\r\nSt. Patrick Center is Missouri’s largest provider of homeless services, assisting more than 9,000 individuals and their families annually through 28 employment, housing and mental health programs.  The St. Patrick Center provides opportunities for self-sufficiency and dignity to persons who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.  Jan DeYoung, BEGIN New Venture Center Director said: “We are thrilled to provide a diverse and dynamic entrepreneurial environment that creates positive personal and community outcomes based on business success.  While the country is facing some of its most challenging economic times, we are providing opportunities for people to create new lives for themselves through business ownership and to positively impact the lives of others through job creation.”  “BEGIN stands for ‘Businesses,’ ‘Employment,’ ‘Growth,’ Incomes’ and ‘Neighborhoods’. Most importantly, BEGIN changes lives and creates meaningful opportunities,” added Dan Buck, CEO of St. Patrick Center. “We thank Anheuser-Busch for recognizing how St. Patrick Center’s employment programs truly provide life-changing assistance for our homeless and poor neighbors.”  The BEGIN New Venture Center (BNVC) opened in October 2008 as the only small business incubator in the United States with a focus on the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless.  Winner of Washington University’s 2008 Skandalaris Award for Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the BNVC combines small business creation and economic development with a compelling social mission to address St. Louis’ most disadvantaged population.  The center includes a small business incubator and was built through a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce.   The 11 new small businesses now operating in the BNVC benefit from a professional business location as well as an array of expert services and amenities, including ongoing business assistance and mentorship, individualized assessment, access to investment capital, networking opportunities with other entrepreneurs and links to professional service providers.  Of these businesses, eight are minority-owned and five are women-owned.  “We are excited to be part of a project where we can live our passion of helping the earth as well as the people who live on it,” said Replenishing the Earth co-owner Cathy Ramirez. RTE is a women-owned “green” company providing sustainable waste management consulting services and related products. “We would have never had this opportunity if it weren’t for the innovation and support of the BEGIN New Venture Center,” added Clarice Hutchens, business partner.   As coordinator of the project, Smith has helped Project BEGIN lay a foundation for the program, including the development of a client assistance delivery model and graduation process for incubator companies, recruitment of resident and client companies, generation of partnerships for financing, mentoring, and support, and coordination of client training and assistance services.  Within the first month of service, Smith had secured Replenishing the Earth as the first resident client company for the incubator.   Among Smith’s other successes as a VISTA are facilitation of capital financing for multiple client startups; 20 training graduates of the Sherwin-Williams Painters Training Program in partnership with the St. Louis Housing Authority, and 20 new recruits for the next program; and 11 confirmed St. Patrick Center client training job placements;  and marketing and public relations resulting in 5 publications and various TV news stories.  St. Patrick Center and BNVC leaders reiterate Smith's critical role to the success of the project, which has contributed directly to the major gift received from Anheuser-Busch.  Galen Gondolfi, Senior Loan Counselor with Justine Petersen (and former VISTA Leader with the Massachussetts Association of CDCs) is a partner with Project BEGIN, also describes Smith as a “consummate professional” and his work on the project as “unparalleled.”\r\n\r\n(Photo: clients in the front room of the BEGIN New Venture Center)","id":"a6298tia7wpa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.3273,38.9482]}},{"properties":{"name":"Susan","description":"<i>Education &amp; Technology</i>I have been serving as a parent rep on the School Council at Leverett Elementary School.

Joshua was withdrawn from the outside world and would not open up to anyone.  They wanted us to match a senior volunteer from RSVP (Retired Senior Volunteer Program) who could work with this child one on one.  Wanda spent three days a week with Joshua - coloring, talking, trying to get him to play games but she never got a response.  This went on for eight months and Wanda became discouraged and extremely sad.   This started to take a toll on her.  She felt it was time for her to step down and take some time away.  I met her on her last day to work there so she could say her goodbyes to everyone and especially Joshua.  When she was leaving, she sat next to Joshua and told him she would not be back.  She leaned over, kissed him on top of the head, and told him goodbye.  Within an instant, Joshua stood up and said “NO.”  You cannot imagine the impact of that moment.  There were so many crying and screaming people in the room.  Just a simple word made all the difference.  Needless to say, Wanda stayed and helped Joshua.  She became his angel, his ray of hope.  Joshua within a year became a regular playful child and eventually moved with his aunt and uncle to Tennessee.  \r\n    Several years later, I spoke to a class at SEMO State University after we began the Volunteer Intergenerational Center.  Two days after my presentation, a young man called and said he had heard my presentation and was interested in becoming a volunteer through VIC.  He proceeded to tell me a story - he said, “Many years ago, I was an abused child; I hated the world and everything in it.  Everything seemed dark to me but then you sent me an angel named Wanda who showed me love and understanding.  My name is Joshua, do you remember me?” Trying to contain myself, I said, “Yes I do remember you.”  He wanted to help someone who really needed his help.   Immediately, I knew the perfect assignment.  I informed him that Wanda had suffered a stroke and was living in one of the local nursing facilities.  She had closed off from the world and was severely depressed.  Anyone who knew this terrific lady knew she was very vibrant, active, and energetic.  He agreed it was the perfect assignment for him.  I met Joshua at the nursing home and upon entering Wanda’s room, both of us began to cry.  Her eyes lit up and she said, “Joshua are you going to just stand there bawling or are you going to give Grandma Wanda a hug”.  From that day on, Joshua visited her as often as he could, reading her books, escorting her in her wheelchair for strolls outside and just talking.  Joshua became her angel, her ray of hope.  He stayed by her side until Wanda died in November of 2004.    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nSubmitted by Tina Dohogne\t\t\t\tExecutive Director\t\t\t\t\tRetired Senior Volunteer Program\r\n                     Volunteer Intergenerational Center of        \r\n                     Cape Girardeau/Scott Counties in Missouri","id":"a6298thd5cqt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.6479,37.1857]}},{"properties":{"name":"Todd","description":"<img src=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/DeliveringOnChangeSubmissions/3a4adc188c7949b3a2e0285523a8f91b.jpg\" width=\"75\">I am volunteering at the Springville Art Museum and helping catalog and index a database on Utah and Western artists.

I would like to train other volunteers to do this as well.  I have degrees from Harvard and Yale and twenty two years of experience teaching math on all levels and eight years developing programs in environmental sciences.  As the director of the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center, I oversaw 180 volunteers.  The following is a description of the need and program activities of the MATH HOUSE as it exists now and has in the past when it was based at THE CATHEDRAL SCHOOL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE.\r\n\r\nMATH HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe Demand and the Supply\r\n\r\nAccording to the media, there are not enough good math teachers in this country.  And, cause and effect, there are not enough good math students, when compared to the math proficiencies demonstrated by students in other countries.  In global economies, where global commerce is crucial even in recessionary times, math skills are increasingly valued.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTranslating Instinct and Talent into Skills\r\n\r\nThere’s a myth that some people can do math and some people just can’t.  But to some extent, all of us do math every time we jaywalk, arrive some place on time, make a guess, set a table, take the bigger slice of a pizza, build a castle with legos, or tap a foot to the beat of the music.  Math is simply a way of describing the physical universe and anyone who sees, hears or handles things is doing something that can be described mathematically.  What’s often missing in the teaching of math is helping children make those connections:  And in making connections, thoughtful instructors have youngsters speak and write about the connections -- in their own words.  Mathematical abstractions such as formulas and equations are meaningless to children when they are recited by rote; when they are not connected to real things and situations.  Regrettably much math instruction forces children to rely on memory rather than understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking Connections\r\n\r\nThe goal of Math House is to increase students’ awareness of the mathematics around them and help them make as many connections as possible between their lives and the mathematics they “do” everyday.  \r\n\r\nAt Math House, we start with patterns discernable in what we see, wear, hear, make and touch. We talk about the rules of pattern formation and extend the rules to various series of numbers.\r\n\r\nWe talk about shapes and how numbers have shapes, and how growing similar shapes generates further patterns.\r\n\r\nFrom the study of patterns—in sights and sounds, events, past and present—we pull out opportunities for problem-solving and the exploration of various techniques.  We introduce Algebra at an early age as a way of expressing the rules that patterns follow.  Basic arithmetic is not presented as a process of memorizing tables, but of visualizing sets of objects and how they’re put together.  We use hands-on materials, including money, to illustrate how our number system is built so that “borrowing” and “carrying”, from one place value column to the next, begins to make sense rather than being just words to remember in a particular order.\r\n\r\nWe encourage children to draw, to talk about problems and their similarities, to come up with approaches to solving problems. \r\n\r\nAnd we often use puzzles and games and short cuts and “tricks” to make the process fun and engaging -- and yet not terribly serious.  Mistakes are considered learning opportunities, part of the highly regarded Trial-and-Error approach.  Nothing can move thinking forward faster than a well-considered and analyzed mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe encourage peer tutoring.  We observe various learning styles and try to cater to as many as possible.  We try not to go beyond what is or will be learned in the classroom, but cover areas that support but not compete with the class curriculum.  We break down language to find out where and why there’s miscommunication.  \r\n\r\nWe talk a lot about how numbers work and we have lots of hands-on materials to illustrate concepts about place value and fractions, decimals, geometry and probability.\r\n\r\nAnd in a genuinely supportive way, we work with the teachers to devise lesson plans that will best support the students who will be attending the Math House.\r\nThe volunteers who have worked with Math House in the past represent some of the finest math teachers in New York City from schools like Dalton, Bank Street, Cathedral School and NYU.  We would like to increase this pool of volunteers and create a model that makes math awareness available to millions of children.","id":"a6298tgzyi0j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.0619,41.2327]}},{"properties":{"name":"barbara","description":"<i>Education &amp; Technology</i>running after school programs","id":"a6298trkc6mw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.0619,41.2327]}},{"properties":{"name":"becky","description":"I volunteer for the Glade Run Therapeutic Horticulture and Animal Program in Zelienople, Pa.

Members can post for Offers or Wants.  Freecycle began a few years ago as a way to reduce the volume of goods going to landfills. Another benefit of Freecycle is conservation of resources. Every new product cost energy to produce, the more life we can get out of things, the more energy conserved. This also helps us clean out our garages making life cleaner and simpler.  This is a great  help to students, young people just starting out in life and other low income people. Members have given away cars, boxes, tools, glass jars ( reusing comes before recycling), cleaning and beauty products that would otherwise get tossed, computers, cellphones, clothes (when no longer suitable for wear they may get transformed into ragrugs or cleaning rags),  One lady asked for old tee shirts for making pajamas, an artist collected bottle caps to make magazine racks. Today someone asked for a plastic garbage can to collect rain from her roof!\r\n\r\nI also volunteer with a land conservation group dedicated to protecting wildlife habitat and I have lead groups of government and nonprofit officials on hikes in our local hills to show them our wildlife corridors and streams that need preserving. \r\n\r\nI also perform music ( free) with a group of other musicians for seniors in retirement homes. \r\n\r\nWe need to watch the flow of money being given away. For example, I once saw money being made available to plant trees and suddenly strange people appeared and formed groups to get the money. It doesn't cost anything to plant a tree ( I have planted many around the city). Why do I see thousands of dollars going to groups to plant trees when volunteers love planting trees for nothing? This is an example of money wasted. \r\n\r\nThanks for getting our country back to social consciousness.\r\n\r\nJudy Garris ( 72 year old greatgrandmother, naturalist and mandolin player)","id":"a6298tmm0uqs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.603,34.1969]}},{"properties":{"name":"lueirether","description":"<i>Children &amp; Youth</i>I'm in the process of establishing a VISTA site that will accomodate \r\nchildren.
