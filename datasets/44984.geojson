Squirrel Road Rochester, MI 48309-4401Oakland University has continued to grow since its beginning. When it first opened in 1959, only 570 students were enrolled. The charter class graduated in 1963 with 125 students receiving diplomas. Today, more than 16,000 students attend classes at OU each fall, and there are more than 62,000 alumni. \r\nOakland University was created in 1957 when the late Alfred and Matilda Wilson donated  million and their 1,500-acre estate to Michigan State University to start a new college in Oakland County. Named Michigan State University Oakland, the college enrolled its first students in 1959. The name changed to Oakland University in 1963. In 1970, the Michigan Legislature recognized the maturity and stature of Oakland University by granting it autonomy, and Michigan\\'s governor appointed OU\\'s first Board of Trustees. \r\n\r\n[from http://www3.oakland.edu/oakland/aboutou/history.htm]<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1bwul6o7w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.218845,42.672685]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Japan Center for Michigan Universities","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.saraandchuck.com/chuck.htm\" href=\"http://www.saraandchuck.com/chuck.htm\">Cacharbe</a>Hikone JapanConsortium school sponsored by universities in Michigan dedicated to the teaching of Japanese and English as second languages<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1bwtd83uv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[136.252989,35.289365]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Office","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.saraandchuck.com/chuck.htm\" href=\"http://www.saraandchuck.com/chuck.htm\">Cacharbe</a>161 N. clark St, Chicago IL 60601The CDC - Avanade\\'s Central Region Main Office<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g1bws6m0v5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.630799,41.884603]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/222913","metadata":null,"contact_name":"cacharbe","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:cacharbe","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/222913","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=222913,platial:user=cacharbe","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44984}
