I flew over the door; my bike didn\\'t.  I ended up sprawled in the middle of Beacon Street, cars approaching.  My bike was twisted and mangled under the door.  I jumped up to avoid being run over, blood dribbling down my arm and legs, and fetched my bike from under the car.  The woman, slightly more than middle-aged sporting a fresh haircut and manicure,  was red-faced and muttering as she examined the rubber edge around the door.  She turned to me and started yelling that the Saab is new, that the door won\\'t properly close now (even though she hadn\\'t yet tried to close it), and that I should have been paying better attention.  Stunned, I walked away, half-carrying my bike that was now too wrecked to ride.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vgbmtzk4b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.120651,42.34257]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bicycle Accident Investigation","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>702 South 1st Street, San Jose, CA, 95113Bicycle Accident Investigation 408-294-2412<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vgbuebtp0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.882749,37.325719]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bike Accident When I was 9","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 107 s citrus ave, los angeles, caI was riding around the block on my pink Diamond Back bmx when a car zooming out of a driveway backed into me, sending me careening into another car that was reversing out of the driveway next to it.  I was thrown to the ground and bounced a few feet but found myself without a scratch.  My bicycle was pinned under the second car.  It seemed that the two old men involved were on their way to play some golf together and had been in a hurry.

It was in ok condition too.\n\nI was terrified and shaking, thinking that since I had been in a car crash that the men might \"sue me.\"  After shouting thanks for helping me retreive my bike, I sped off in fear that they might pursue me to try to find out who I was for their impending lawsuit.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vgbr4y6b5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.33982,34.073315]}},{"properties":{"name":"Causing a Commotion","description":"Posted by Justine<img src=\"http://forums.egullet.org/uploads/1121992488/gallery_28660_3_526.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> falmouth, maI was 14 years old and riding my sister\\'s ten speed to the fourth day at my first real job - bagging groceries at Purity Supreme.  I was listening to Madonna\\'s \"Who\\'s That Girl?\" album on my walkman and singing \"Causing a Commotion\" as I crossed a side street.  I looked up and saw an olive green Dodge approaching and knew it was going to hit me and thought, well maybe I won\\'t have to bag groceries today.  Then I woke up on the other side of the street, face down in the sandy gutter.  I stood up to fetch my bike from the middle of the street and attempted to get on it to ride to work, but the tires were bent and mangled.  Then I touched my bloody face and decided I had to sit on the grass under a tree or I would pass out.  People gathered around.  An ambulance and fire truck came.  I told everyone the driver had taken off after he hit me (turns out this wasn\\'t true but I liked saying it was a \"hit and run\" - the driver, a 78 year old man named Gerhart Duda, was there and more upset than I was).  In the emergency room at the Falmouth Hospital, they stitched my face and mouth in a few places.  I was a wreck for weeks with unsightly hemorrhaging in my right eye, my faced bruised and swollen and scabbed - my sisters made me wear large sunglasses at the dinner table, claiming they couldn\\'t eat while looking at me.  But I felt fortunate because I was able to quit my job and got paid for the rest of the summer by insurance, got a new bike out of the deal, and couldn\\'t go in the sun so I had an excuse to stay inside and read all day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62vgbealbnc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.570207,41.578342]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cut off by out of town driver, totalled bike.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://www.cooley-dickinson.org/images/radiology/x-ray/wrist_x-ray.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Polk &amp; Eddy, SF, CAZooming down Polk, this guy decides to take a left from the right lane in his rented minivan.

Yes, that\\'s right, build an enormous bike jump on your incredibly steep driveway.  The ramp got higher and higher, and got to a point where no sane soul would even think about it, but there was one idiot soul there, and that idiot soul was me.  I flew higher than any keg kicking urban bike jumper in history, and dearly paid the price with a massive endo\\' the handlebars.  Notice, Legacy Hospital is nearby in this pic, was a fun night there as they sewed the ear back on and set the wrist and shot me \"you dumbass\" looks.

I was headed tto the Kwik Shop to get my mom something. Milk or cigarettes or something like that. It was a short ride. Our little neighborhood hardly gets any traffic. I was just slowly pedaling along and I somehow got very deep indeed into a daydream. I remember that I was also watching the pavement move beneath me, something I used to do a lot when I was a kid. All of this while riding my bike.\n\nI was worlds away. I was probably not even really inside my own body anymore, mechanically pedaling my daydream forward. \n\nThen, suddenly, I was sitting on the trunk of a parked car. I had been so deep in my thoughts that at first I thought that I had been hit by a moving car. When I realized that I had actually just ran into the back of a parked car and been tossed (fairly gently, I wasn\\'t going very fast) onto the car\\'s trunk, my first reaction was to look around and check if anyone had seen me do it. I felt exposed and embarassed.\n\nThe bike was fine. I was fine, though it is always jarring to be yanked out of your own reality into \"real\" reality so violently.
