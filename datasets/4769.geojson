FDIC releases quarterly reports on FIDC insured banks. The current data is extracted from the 2nd quarter of 2004. The risky loans in thousands of $ are computed as the sum of the following:\n1. Foreclosed loans\n2. Mortgages that are 30+ days in late\n3. Mortgages that are 90+ days late\n4. Mortgages that are more than 90 days late but are not foreclosed yet.\n\nWaMu tops the list in risky loans even during the hey days of housing sector. FDIC took over WaMu on Sep 25, 2008 and immediately sold it for less than $2 billion to Chase Morgan bank.  \n\nEven in the so called better days for housing industry, the WaMu bank had the highest value of risky loans. \nLook elsewhere on Finder! for data on top 100 banks for other quarters. \n\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"RiskyLns":{"max":2315713.0,"mean":120164.05,"variance":138736127774.896,"stdev":372472.989322577,"min":5409.0,"median":14044.0},"X":{"max":0.0,"mean":-87.1176145043893,"variance":420.525062265451,"stdev":20.5067077383341,"min":-157.861999256086,"median":-83.916331464059},"RLns2PLns":{"max":0.450028,"mean":0.03095151,"variance":0.00359290851552515,"stdev":0.0599408751648251,"min":0.001755,"median":0.015059},"Y":{"max":47.610382990629,"mean":37.0957959494342,"variance":53.6432008083609,"stdev":7.32415188321221,"min":0.0,"median":39.657055},"p3reres":{"max":921286.0,"mean":57478.95,"variance":29479479967.2197,"stdev":171695.893856608,"min":597.0,"median":7438.0},"cert":{"max":57443.0,"mean":27813.6,"variance":93174156.8888889,"stdev":9652.67615166327,"min":178.0,"median":29805.0},"lnreres":{"max":165939371.0,"mean":7050601.72,"variance":393000346673412.0,"stdev":19824236.3452773,"min":53156.0,"median":1174213.0},"p9reres":{"max":1651000.0,"mean":23244.38,"variance":28404155309.4097,"stdev":168535.323625078,"min":0.0,"median":14.0},"nareres":{"max":1114895.0,"mean":33330.27,"variance":14645198380.8052,"stdev":121017.347437486,"min":0.0,"median":3965.0},"oreres":{"max":214995.0,"mean":6110.45,"variance":551762111.946969,"stdev":23489.617109416,"min":0.0,"median":503.0}},"features":[],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"http://www.fdic.gov/","metadata":"http://www.fdic.gov/","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Quarterly banking sector reports availbale at Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) website","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.fdic.gov/","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":100,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"banking,banks,defaults,finance,foreclosures,mortgage,sector","published":"2008-09-26T12:00:00Z","id":4769}
