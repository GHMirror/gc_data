They had a small food menu the last time I was there and considering the kitchen they had to work with (in a basement on the other side of the building) they did a really good job. They have a slick decor as well, with wine bottles and such imbedded in the floor and backlit.

I spent almost as much time here as I did at work. The Cottage to me was were I went to chill and get some killer grub on my day off or after work or whenever. I think the only things I ordered were the Cottage burger and Cottage fries or the blue cheese burger with Brew City fries (ya know, the batter dipped fries, god those were good) and a side of the infamous smoky mayo to dip my fries in. \nI had my very first Guiness there! I was hangin\\' out with a new friend and he ordered the first round and I ended up with a Guiness. It was meant to be. This was the beginning of my beer education! Thanks John Batey, wherever you are.\nAnyway, this is a great haunt.

I had the priviledge of tilling the soil in this garden one year. Thanks Richa. This was my first larger garden experience. I had a six by twenty foot space to work with and plant what I wish. I had to clear the spot and turn the sod as it had become overgrown. I planted watermelon, squash, purple pole beans on a crucifix I salvaged from the basement of the apartment I was living in, lemon cucumbers (yellow and roundish), and tomatoes. The plot went pretty wild that summer and the garden was eventually overrun by the transient community in the area, but we got a bumper crop of beans! I donated my harvest to the Hard Times Cafe, a local group of homeless folk who gathered to cook, eat, and dicuss their situation. I had one watermelon that made it and it was given as a birthday present to one of the chaps at the Cafe. All in all it was a good summer project and a lot of fun to boot!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7eqkkeqrpig"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.66954,42.95634]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jersey Junction","description":"Posted by Stek<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 652 Croswell Avenue Southeast, Grand Rapids, MI, 49506This is a great place to get an ice cream cone.

It is a small (60 people in the winter), walled village with a post box, a bar, and a good restaurant, and a city gate. Lennie Bell, my old old friend Casey\\'s sister, has renovated the old catherdral into a home for herself and her partner Fernando. She also owns a property that her parents lived in that is across the street. This is where we stayed. This village was built in the 13th century! This is pretty far out for an American boy like me. The oldest place in my home  town was maybe 100 yrs old.\nI had the pleasure of being asked to cook for a number of the locals one night. We made juniper planked salmon, salad, minted potatoes, bread, cheese, and finished with fire roasted peaches stuffed with cabrales and drizzled with a ruby port syrup. Yum. There is nothin\\' like showing up in a little town in a foreign county and being invited to dinner only to find out that you\\'ve been shanghied into cooking! \nI\\'m told that during Maderuelo\\'s local festival they load up the trebluchets and lob watermelons across the river.

It sits in the midst of a row of shops in East Fulton, a tiny collection of biz at the corner of Diamond and Fulton. Simply outstanding food. I recomend this to everyone in GR and to those who are visiting. Come prepared to chill out and relax and give yourself time. Teshlou\\'s is a one man operation and everything is prepared to order and served on great sheets of injera bread. No silverware here! Don\\'t forget the tea! This is the perfect place to go for a date or to catch up on old times as you can easily spend an hour or two casually dinning here.\nMy suggestion is to order tea and a combo and let the proprietor do the rest. Oh and get some of his chili paste on the side if ya like to spice it up a bit.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7eqkkbf15de"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.6453,42.96293]}},{"properties":{"name":"Osta's","description":"Posted by Stek<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2228 Wealthy Street Southeast, Grand Rapids, MI, 49506The hidden treasure of East Grand Rapids.

I worked hard to make this dish happen and it rocks! Hell, everything on the menu is great. A lot of my peeps worked hard over the years to put together an amazing menu for the public.

All in the same day!  Some of the \"streets\" in this town are actually stairways. We put in some serious hiking that day.\nOur visit to Toledo resulted in the Stinky Cheese Inccedent. Outside the walls I stopped at a careceria and picked up some bread, chorizo and a wedge of semi-hard sheep\\'s cheese for our lunch. We ate our fill early in the afternoon and then went hiking around the city, finding the cathedral and getting lost on the way back to the bus terminal. Well, it was a hot and sunny day in Toledo and that cheese sat in my black backpack whilst we adventured. \nOn the bus ride back to Madrid I kept getting weird wiffs off funk up my nostrils but could not place their origin. When we rode the metro from the terminal to the hotel we were surprised to notice that everyone in our section of the car got up and moved to the other side of the car at the first stop after we got on. That is when it hit me! We were the source of the stinky cheese funk! People weren\\'t getting off the treain they were getting away from us! We reeked of smelly cheese!

Oh the look on her face! She bubbled right up and totally said yes! Our waitress came around the corner just as I hit my knee and she jumped a foot easy.
