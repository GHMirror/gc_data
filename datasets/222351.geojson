Other UN agencies and international groups say Libya may already be on the brink of a catastrophe.\n\nThe World Health Organization says the health situation inside the country is precarious; aid agencies warn its food supply chain is at risk of collapsing; and Britains Save the Children Fund says up to one million children trapped in the capital Tripoli and western Libya are in danger of becoming war victims.\n\nThings could get worse if Col. Gaddafis troops try to cut off food to opposition-held cities and towns. They have already attempted to bomb some of the huge pipelines that carry water to Libyas main cities from aquifers buried deep beneath the Sahara Desert, hundreds of kilometres south of the populated Mediterranean coast.\n\nThe WFP was rushing assessment teams to Benghazi in opposition-controlled eastern Libya Wednesday to determine if the port can be used for emergency food deliveries.\n\nThe Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Charlottetown also set sail from Halifax on a six-day voyage to join a U.S.-led naval task force off the coast, where it will help in any humanitarian mission.\n\nEurope is watching the unfolding tragedy with consternation, fearing a massive regional displacement could trigger a tidal wave of illegal migration from North Africa.\n\nThe tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, just 160 km off the coast of Tunisia, has already been swamped with more than 6,000 would-be migrants seeking resettlement in Europe.\n\nJose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, announced a tripling of the European Unions humanitarian aid, to ease the crisis.\n\nBritain also said it will fly home 6,000 Egyptian refugees stranded on the Libya-Tunisia border. Still, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is appealing for governments to organize a massive humanitarian evacuation as conditions in Libya continue to deteriorate.\n\nUN officials are alarmed by a growing crisis on the Tunisian-Libyan border. Tens of thousands of foreign migrant workers, many from sub-Saharan African countries or as far away as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nepal, are stranded there.\n\nIn the last two weeks nearly 85,000 people have flooded across the border. Many are still waiting to be evacuated and have nowhere else to go, but are living with little food and shelter.\n\nUN officials flew in 80 tonnes of high energy biscuits to Djerba, Tunisia, on Tuesday to feed refugees and are trying to set up an emergency tent camp for 15,000 people. But the situation seems to be getting worse.\n\nAid workers believe up to 2.7 million people could flee in the coming weeks.\n\nA report by UNICEF says the first wave of evacuees was made up of male workers in the oil fields and construction. Now, growing numbers of Libyans are fleeing the country with their families, bringing increasing numbers of very vulnerable families and a higher portion of women and children.\n\nLibya, which has Africas richest oil fields, employed 1.5 million foreign workers before rebellions broke out against Col. Gaddafi on Feb. 17. Their sudden departure has caused the economy to collapse. Oil production has been halved and the centrally controlled economy has ground to a halt.\n\nLibya imports more than 75% of its food, but none of its ports have been operating properly for two weeks. Food stocks are depleted and distribution chains disrupted.\n\nTens of thousands of the migrant workers who fled worked in food distribution, meaning it could take weeks for things to return to normal even if the political situation is resolved.\n\nRight now, experts can only expect the worst. They have been unable to visit areas affected by violence.\n\nOur primary concern is getting access to Tripoli and surrounding areas where the situation is precarious, said Valerie Amos, the UNs Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. She said there have been alarming reports desperate people in Tripoli are being prevented from fleeing.\n\nThe situation in Libya could quickly spiral out of control, said Gareth Owen, emergency director for Save the Children.\n\nIn the meantime, Col. Gaddafi vowed Wednesday to fight to the last man and last woman to defend his regime.\n\nIn a sign he understands the value of food as a weapon and a publicity tool, he tried to bolster his claim to leadership by announcing he has sent 18 trucks loaded with rice, flour, sugar and eggs to rebel-held Benghazi.\n\nNational Post\npgoodspeed@nationalpost.com","verified":"NO","longitude":13.187507,"id":"429","report":139,"location":"Tripoli","incidenttitle":"Goodspeed Analysis: 2.7 million could flee Libya in weeks ahead"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.187507,32.876174]}},{"properties":{"latitude":32.669444,"category":"Non Food Items","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 01:54:00 -0500","original":"1:53:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 01:53:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/04 00:00:00 -0500","original":"3/3/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/03 00:00:00 -0500"},"approved":"YES","description":"BBC online\n\n2009 British Abroad tweets: \"#Libya: 2 Canadian planes to land in Tripoli 1300, 1500 Thursday; staff with clearances to pass landside onboard.

Asked if cars could stop running if a solution is not found, he replied: Well, they cant run on water, can they?\n\nSaad Al Farjani, the interim governments de facto economy minister, did not respond to Gulf News calls.\n\nThe only solution is for the oil to be shipped out to Europe, refined and sent back, said the source from the international organisation.\n\nThere have been suggestions at the interim governments headquarters that petrol may be shipped to Libya from Italy.\n\nOil has played a key part in the conflict. The rebels fought some of the most protracted battles in the oil rich areas, with both sides gaining and losing control.\nDisinformation\n\nRas Lanuf was the subject of an apparent disinformation campaign when Gaddafi-controlled Libyan state television claimed that forces loyal to Gaddafi had taken the town, which rebels denied.\n\nIn Brega, a town whose economy is built around the oil industry, heavy battles took place less than ten metres from oil and gas pipelines that transport the fuel to various parts of the country, according to eye-witnesses.\n\nAccess to Bregas oil fields is restricted by a main checkpoint and makeshift checkpoints set up by the rebels after they took over the town. Guards protect the area and only allow access to rebel leaders.\n\nForces loyal to Gaddafi have fought for control of the town three times in vain. First they fought as rebels moved westwards from Benghazi to capture the area.\n\nA few days later the mercenaries attacked again, taking refuge in a nearby university before being expelled by the rebels, and in the latest attempt a fighter jet dropped bomb just metres from the main checkpoint leading to the oil fields.\n\nGuards refused journalists access to the site until an older man, appearing to be in command, approached and said he would allow access in order to prove that the rebel leaders were in full control of the fields and were protecting it. He did not give his name.\n\nThere were over 450 of Muammars fighters trying to take control of the gated oil field area. They were fighting right here until more of our people came in and kicked them out, he said, pointing to the pipeline.\n\nBy Abbas Al Lawati, Staff Reporter\n\n Gulf News 2011.

The fighting is concentrated along the coast between Ras Lanuf and Sirte, and in the towns of Beriaga, Zawiya, and Misrata. Humanitarian access to western Libya remains limited due to insecurity.\n\n- As of March 6, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed former Foreign Minister of Jordan Abdelilah Al-Khatib as the U.N. Special Envoy to Libya to conduct consultations with government authorities in Tripoli.\n\n- On March 7, the U.N. released an appeal for $160 million to support initial humanitarian assistance efforts in Libya and border regions. The appeal includes support for the transportation of third country nationals (TCNs), food supplies and healthcare, coordination of services at transit camps in Tunisia and Egypt, and water, sanitation, and hygiene services at the camps.\n\n- On March 6, U.S. President Obama signed the U.S. Department of State's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration (State/PRM) request for $15 million in Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance funds for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\n- On March 7, USAID/OFDA committed $1 million to the International Medical Corps (IMC) to support health facilities in eastern Libya with medical supplies and staff. IMC is also poised to begin work in western Libya when security permits. USAID/OFDA committed additional funding to the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) for the emergency distribution of non-food itemsincluding blankets, hygiene kits, and water containersto conflict-affected families in Benghazi who have not yet received assistance.\n\n\nVERIFIED: verified from ReliefWeb and United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nhttp://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MUMA-8ER3C3?OpenDocument&amp;amp;amp;amp;rc=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;cc=lby","verified":"YES","longitude":17.228331,"id":"1663","report":498,"location":"Libya","incidenttitle":"USAID: Libya  Complex Emergency U.S. Government Fact Sheet #8, Fiscal Year (FY) 2011"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[17.228331,26.3351]}},{"properties":{"latitude":30.763969,"category":"Food/Nutrition","time":{"end_time":"2030/01/01 13:25:00 -0500","original":"13:24:00","granularity":"min","time":"2030/01/01 13:24:00 -0500"},"date":{"end_time":"2011/03/09 00:00:00 -0500","original":"3/8/2011","granularity":"day","time":"2011/03/08 00:00:00 -0500"},"approved":"YES","description":"Local ngo in Adjabiyeh distributing food to 6400 families.
