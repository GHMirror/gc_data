Thirteen of the brightest stars in the sky are projected in their natural colors. In addition to stars, the Chronos projector can accurately display 26 of the most popular celestial objects like the Adromeda Galaxy and the Orion Nebula with dedicated projectors for the Magellanic clouds.\n\n\nThe Astronomy Department holds planetarium shows several times each semester. To find out the current planetarium show schedule or to arrange a private show for schools or clubs, call (310) 660-3373 or 660-3245.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62gowb5iruf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.326685,33.884894]}},{"properties":{"name":"Griffith Observatory","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/7a000da1b5d997acd2295104d692f4b2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 2800 East Observatory Road, Los Angeles, CA 90027-1255 USAThe classic Griffith Observatory and its grounds are closed to the public for an extensive renovation. Public operations continue at the Griffith Observatory Satellite -- the Observatory\\'s temporary home during construction -- in the northeast corner of Griffith Park. Supposedly, the classic Observatory will reopen in the second half of 2006. \n\nThis is where the knife fight scene from Rebel Without a Cause was filmed.  Hopefully they\\'re keeping the bronze bust of James Dean as they renovate.  This used to have the same magical quality of the Natural History Museum--storehouse of elaborate dioramas made before you were born, seeminly enchanted with some permanent sense of optimism.  We\\'ll see what the renovation brings later this year.  \n\nThere was an great planetarium show here and hopefully they\\'ll continue showings when they re-open.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62gowax08b3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.300613,34.119408]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount John University Observatory","description":"Posted by AstrojafaUniversity of Canterbury\\'s observatory.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62gowcb1zh9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[170.46455,-43.98775]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palomar Observatory in Palomar Mountain State Park","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2fedcef0064881a29f64f3fbb5cd58dd.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Palomar Mountain CA 92060-0200The Palomar Observatory is open to the public from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. daily (except December 24 and 25) for self-guided visits to the 200-inch Telescope. The gallery in the 200-inch dome affords visitors a view of the Hale Telescope. \n\n The Palomar Observatory is located in north San Diego County, California.  It is a world-class center of astronomical research that is owned and operated by the California Institute of Technology.  The observatory is home to five telescopes that are nightly used for a wide variety of astronomical research programs. The research is conducted by Caltech\\'s faculty, post-doctoral fellows and students, and by researchers at Caltech\\'s collaborating institutions.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62gow3ciizp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.877778,33.322778]}},{"properties":{"name":"Reuben H.

At its heart is the Evans &amp; Sutherland Digistar II planetarium projector, the first of its kind on the West Coast. Using digital technology, audiences can fly beyond the solar system and soar among the stars. \n\nThe Planetarium is open to the public every Friday nights with public planetarium shows designed for the whole family. \n\nThe Planetarium is located in the middle of the second floor of Drescher Hall (formerly known as the Technology Building) on the north side of the Santa Monica College campus.
