In 1854, a shoe factory was set up in the village but Fritz Bally left the fledgling business and Carl Franz Bally carried on under the corporate name \"C.F. Bally.\"\n\nBy the 1860s Bally employed more than 500 people. Within another decade it had built an international reputation for quality and design in both men\\'s and women\\'s shoes and expanded operations outside of Switzerland to Buenos Aires, Argentina, Montevideo, Uruguay, and Paris, France.\n\nCarl Franz Bally died in 1899 and his sons carried on with the business. Although the Bally family maintained voting control, in 1907 \"C.F. Bally &amp; Co. Ltd.\" went public, their shares listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange. The added capital allowed massive expansion for their much-in-demand shoes and by 1916 they employed more than 7,000 people.\n\nThe company survived the Great Depression of the 1930s and the difficulties of World War II to expand globally with great success in the post-War era including a successful entry into the North American market. In 1976 they added clothing, handbags, and other leather accessories. The following year, the Bally family sold their interest in the company. Numerous difficulties followed and the company struggled under poor management against a tide of low cost products from developing countries flooding the global market. In 1999, Bally was sold to the American investment fund Texas Pacific Group.\n\nToday the company is headquartered in Caslano, near Milan, Italy.\n\nBally shoes gained a popularity with rappers in the late 1980s (along with other high-end fashion lines such as Gucci) due to their luxury status. Bally shoes are specifically mentioned in songs by a wide array of rappers ranging from Jay-Z to Dana Dane. Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew (featuring MC Ricky D aka Slick Rick) may have been the first to mention Bally shoes in a rap when they put the line, \"Put on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks,\" into \"The Show/La Di Da Di\" (1985). Bally shoes are iconic of old-school hip hop.\n\n- from wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63ueoe2zr0o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.250759,43.769647]}},{"properties":{"name":"BURBERRY","description":"Posted by Petershieh<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/burberry.gif\">Burberry is a UK-based outfitter, manufacturing clothing and other apparel.

In 1993, 70 years after its founding, Hugo Boss launched its first fragrance, and created a division which has since grown to be an important part of the company.\n\nIn 1999, Boss Orange for men was launched described as sporty and casual separating itself from the trendy Hugo brand and the sophisticated Boss Black brand. Boss Green is a completely sporty brand selling items designed for sport or a sporty look.\n\nThe company\\'s products, divided over three brands, are available throughout the world in 102 countries and more than 5,000 retail stores. These brands are Boss, Hugo, and since 2004, Baldessarini. The latter, Baldessarini GmbH, is a more independent business unit which focuses on a more prestigious image than its two sister brands. It sells, like the other Hugo Boss brands, clothing, shoes, fragrances and accessories but will leave Hugo Boss after the Spring/Summer 2007 collection has been sent to boutiques. This is due to the newly launched premium Boss line, Boss Black Selection, outselling Baldessarini.\n\nBaldessarini fashion was recently sold for up to €9m (Aug 2006) to Ahlers AG--a fashion brand holding company. Werner Baldessarini will continue to design the collections; he will also be in charge of marketing.\n\nHugo Boss is presently a subsidiary held by Italian material manufacturer Marzotto S.p.A. under a new fashion company Valentino Fashion Group with 50.9% held in the Boss Group.\n\nToday\\'s sub-brands for men include: Boss Black/Boss Black Selection, Boss Green, Boss Orange, Hugo, and Baldessarini.

The Miu Miu line, which shares Miuccia Prada\\'s nickname, emphasizes earthy colors and a less haute couture look, evoking an overall more bohemian style. In its advertising campaigns, waif-like models in \"home photo\" poses further the look. Miu Miu clothing is often simple, and evokes a continual image of high-end vintage items. It was followed by the Prada Sport \\'Linea Rossa\\' collection, which featured tennis shoes. The Prada line produces high-end ready-to-wear clothes and accessories for men and women in addition to a range of children\\'s clothes, fragrances and cosmetic products and home products, whilst the Prada Sport and Miu Miu lines produce clothes and accessories for men and women, including handbags, shoes, wallets, and sunglasses.\n\nPrada won a Council of Fashion Designers of America International Award for accessories in 1993 and currently Prada is considered one of the most influential clothes designers in the fashion industry.
