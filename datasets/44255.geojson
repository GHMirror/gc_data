I recall that they had some games there, like a deck of playing cards and a chinese checkers set...  It was just so weird... it felt like \"home\"... like Southern California, but as I stared out the window, it was so very East Coast.  Winter in the East Coast.\n\nTwo heart stickers made their way onto companion electronics... an old Fujifilm FinePix, and a new Toshiba Dynabook.  Across the street, there was some kind of bike store and costume shop.  I watched her go into the stores, tired from all the studying and writing.  \n\nI sat on a sofa-ish seat... she at the table.  Two older guys sat about two tables away... they looked like they could be professors, and talked loudly for a long time about various issues, politics, and etc.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69zshukpg6p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.938093,38.981301]}},{"properties":{"name":"CVS Pharmacy","description":"Posted by Thejames<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> The cashier was able to tell I was wearing a Kenneth Cole watch with me wearing a fairly large coat, not exactly showing much of my right wrist...<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69zshrv777u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.938361,38.979966]}},{"properties":{"name":"Campus Police?","description":"Posted by ThejamesIf I recall correctly, this was the place I went to ask for directions first, since I got lost after getting off the train.
