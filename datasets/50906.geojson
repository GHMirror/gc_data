Research scientists are tagging the giant animals to study their fate in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nThe three sharks did not appear distressed and their white-spotted hides were not visibly oiled, said Steve Gittings of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who saw them on a flight Monday to locate oiled sea turtles for rescuers in boats.\n\n\"Don't get the picture that these looked like those pelicans you see photographs of,\" he said.\n6\n0\n89Share\n\nBut oil can clog their gills and suffocate them as they swim at the surface, and they will swallow oil if they feed in it, said John Carlson, fisheries biologist in NOAA's wildlife section.\n\n\"They look like skimmer boats when they're feeding,\" Carlson said.\n\nGittings said the three whale sharks he saw, which he estimated at about 25 feet long, were about four miles from the sunken Deepwater Horizon, in an area where skimmer boats were slurping the heaviest oil.\n\n\"There's no continuous area of heavy oil. But there's so many streamers they couldn't avoid swimming through those streamers,\" he said.\n\nThe question now is how many of the creatures are dying in the oil, said Eric Hoffmayer of the University of Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast Research Lab, who has studied whale sharks in the northern Gulf since 2002.\n\n\"Taking mouthfuls of thick oil is not conducive to them surviving,\" he said.\n\nHoffmayer has found that many of the northern Gulf's whale sharks feed off the mouth of the Mississippi River; the Deepwater Horizon site is about 40 miles southeast of the river.\n\n\"That basically confirms our worst fear: These animals do not know to stay away from the oil,\" Hoffmayer said.\n\nScientists on a teleconference Wednesday agreed there isn't any known way to make whale sharks swim away from oil, the way air cannon can be used to scare birds from airports, Gittings and Carlson said.\n\nAbout all that can be done to protect them is make sure heavy oil is burned and skimmed from areas they might swim into, Carlson said.\n\nThey're easy to recognize; each is up to about 40 feet long and black with rows of white spots.\n\nBut there won't be any way to tell how many die. Sharks don't float.\n\n\"If they do die from the oil, they're going to sink to the bottom,\" Hoffmayer said.\n\nwhale-sharks-oil-spill-lots.JPGUniversity of Southern Mississippi Gulf Coast Research Laboratory via APMore than 100 whale sharks surround a research vessel in the Gulf of Mexico on June 21.\n\nNews of whale sharks in the oil came less than a week after a huge group was spotted elsewhere off the Louisiana coast where oil had not yet been found. One aerial photograph showed dozens of them.\n\n\"It blew my mind. There were probably more than a hundred sharks,\" Hoffmayer said.\n\nThe group seen June 21 was about 70 miles southwest of Port Fourchon, and about 60 miles from the western edge of the spill as shown on a federal map, he said.\n\nHoffmayer said it was hard to say whether the three seen Monday were from that group because the animals can travel more than 60 miles in a day.\n\n\"I've got a feeling that until whatever the food source they found disappears, they're not going to want to go,\" he said.\n\nNobody knows just how many whale sharks exist. They're on the World Conservation Union's \"red list\" of threatened species, but not on any U.S. list of threatened or endangered species. Federal law does ban killing them for sport or commercial use, Carlson said.\n\nHoffmayer said the animals can dive a mile deep, and could escape any effort to herd them away from the oil.\n\nLast week's spotting came as part of a two-day excursion organized by the director of a documentary being filmed about marine biologist Sylvia Earle, founder of the Mission Blue Foundation.\n\nHoffmayer said four of the sharks were tagged.\n\nBy Janet McConnaughey, Associated Press writer\n\nRelated topics: oil spill gulf of mexico 2010\n\nSponsored Links\n\nShare this story\nStory tools\n\nMore stories in 2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill\nPrevious story\nHouse spending bill, including $304 million related to oil spill, clears key hurdle\nNext story\nNOAA Gulf of Mexico oil spill trajectory forecasts for Friday through Sunday\n\n6\nComments Feed\nView: Oldest first | Newest first\nOilfield2010\nPattonAU July 02, 2010 at 12:51AM\nFollow\n\nHere is the original story (with Video) from al.com\n\nhttp://blog.al.com/live/2010/06/whale_sharks_unable_to_avoid_o.html\n\nWhat does T-P do?

No one seems to have a website to show the monitoring levels of chemicals being released over Florida. Even the CDC does not report levels of the VOCs; only what the health risks of being exposed are to these chemicals. WHY? I am scared that we are getting exposed to poisoned chemicals here.

By Monday, the blobs of oil had washed ashore as far west as Treasure Isle in Slidell.\n42\n0\n327Share\n\nCleanup crews used nets to scoop up the tar balls throughout the day, collecting more than 1,000 pounds of oil and waste. BP also deployed 19 manual skimming vessels and four decontamination vessels to the area, and placed 600-feet of hard and soft boom at a choke point in the Rigolets to prevent more oil from entering the lake. Cleanup efforts are expected to resume today.\n\nLopez said oil made its way into the lake because of winds from the far edges of Hurricane Alex last week as well as sustained east and southeast winds during the weekend. The winds from Alex pushed a large amount of oil into the Mississippi Sound for the first time, and the east winds during the past few days pushed oil into Lake Borgne, the Rigolets and eventually the eastern stretches of Lake Pontchartrain.\n\nWind patterns ultimately will decide the trajectory of oil, but Lopez said the general pattern of circulation in Lake Pontchartrain is counterclockwise, meaning if more oil came in the lake, it generally would travel along the north shore and then possibly loop back around to the south.\n\nAlthough he expects the impacts from oil in the lake to be \"pretty modest,\" Lopez acknowledged that there is a symbolism for the New Orleans area now that oil has reached the lake.\n\n\"It's kind of like it's coming to home now.\"\n\nCiting the new reports of oil, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries on Monday issued precautionary fishing closures in parts of Lake Pontchartrain and in Lake Borgne, Lake St. Catherine, the passes and surrounding areas. The state's Department of Health and Hospitals also closed all oyster harvesting areas east of the Mississippi River, which includes Lake Borgne.\n\nSo far, the oil that has entered the Rigolets and the lake has been in small amounts and has been weathered greatly after traveling a long distance from the well site. The geography of eastern Lake Pontchartrain also has played a role in keeping most of the oil out, with narrow passes such as the Rigolets preventing a full flow from Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound.\n\n\"It has a fairly tortuous route to get to the lake, and that's why we're at day 70-something of the spill, and we're just seeing the oil reach Lake Pontchartrain,\" Lopez said. \"This oil we're seeing probably headed east toward Alabama and Florida before it came this way. It's traveled probably at least 100-200 miles, depending on how far east it went.\"","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1251","id":"45"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.754915,30.18559]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1252","title":"7 gallonsof tar balls collected on Bolivar Peninsula and Galveston Island","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/06 04:55:01 -0400","original":"Tue Jul 06 04:55:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/06 04:55:00 -0400"},"description":"TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) -- Tar balls from the Gulf oil spill found on a Texas beach were the first evidence that gushing crude from the Deepwater Horizon well has reached all the Gulf states.\nGULF OIL SPILLAP Photo/ Hattiesburg American, Ryan MooreOil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the beach in Pass Christian, Miss., on Sunday.\n\n \n\nA Coast Guard official said on Monday that it was possible that the oil hitched a ride on a ship and was not carried naturally by currents to the barrier islands of the eastern Texas coast, but there was no way to know for sure.\n24\n0\n26Share\n\nThe amount discovered is tiny compared to what has coated beaches so far in the hardest-hit parts of the Gulf Coast in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. It still provoked the quick dispatch of cleaning crews and a vow that BP will pay for the trouble.\n\n\"Any Texas shores impacted by the Deepwater spill will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab,\" Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said in a news release.\n\nThe oil's arrival in Texas was predicted Friday by an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which gave a 40 percent chance of crude reaching the area.\n\n\"It was just a matter of time that some of the oil would find its way to Texas,\" said Hans Graber, a marine physicist at the University of Miami and co-director of the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing.\n\nAbout five gallons of tar balls were found Saturday on the Bolivar Peninsula, northeast of Galveston, said Capt. Marcus Woodring, the Coast Guard commander for the Houston/Galveston sector. Two gallons were found Sunday on the peninsula and Galveston Island, though tests have not yet confirmed its origin.\n\nWoodring said the consistency of the tar balls indicates it's possible they could have been spread to Texas water by ships that have worked out in the spill. But there's no way to confirm the way they got there.\n\nThe largest tar balls found Saturday were the size of pingpong balls, while the ones Sunday were more like nickels and dimes.\n\nGalveston Mayor Joe Jaworski said he believed the tar balls were a fluke, rather than a sign of what's to come.\n\n\"This is good news,\" he said. \"The water looks good. We're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly.\"\n\nThe distance between the western reach of the tar balls in Texas and the most eastern reports of oil in Florida is about 550 miles. Oil was first spotted on land near the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 29.\n\nThe spill is reaching deeper into Louisiana. Strings of oil were seen Monday in the Rigolets, one of two waterways that connect the Gulf with Lake Pontchartrain, the large lake north of New Orleans.\n\n\"So far it's scattered stuff showing up, mostly tar balls,\" said Louisiana Office of Fisheries Assistant Secretary Randy Pausina. \"It will pull out with the tide, and then show back up.\"\n\nPausina said he expected the oil to clear the passes and move directly into the lake, taking a backdoor route to New Orleans.\n\nThe news of the spill's reach comes at a time that most of the offshore skimming operations in the Gulf have been halted by choppy seas and high winds. A tropical system that had been lingering off Louisiana flared up Monday afternoon, bringing heavy rain and winds.\n\nForecasters at the National Hurricane Center said there had been a 60 percent chance the system could blow into a tropical storm. But that was reduced later Monday to almost no chance because the storm had moved over land.\n\nLast week, the faraway Hurricane Alex idled the skimming fleet off Alabama, Florida and Mississippi with choppy seas and stiff winds. Now they're idled by smaller storms that could last well into this week.\n\nOfficials have plans for the worst-case scenario: a hurricane barreling up the Gulf toward the spill site. But the less-dramatic weather conditions have been met with a more makeshift response.\n\nSkimming operations across the Gulf have scooped up about 23.5 million gallons of oil-fouled water so far, but officials say it's impossible to know how much crude could have been skimmed in good weather because of the fluctuating number of vessels and other variables.\n\nThe British company has now seen its costs from the spill reach $3.12 billion, a figure that doesn't include a $20 billion fund for damages the company created last month.\n\nThe storms have not affected drilling work on a relief well that BP says is the best chance for finally plugging the leak. The company expects drilling to be finished by mid-August.\n\n___","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1252","id":"46"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.883185,29.247749]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1253","title":"Tar balls and sheen on Cat Island south","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/06 04:17:01 -0400","original":"Tue Jul 06 04:17:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/06 04:17:00 -0400"},"description":"Tar balls 1-5cm &gt;1% coverage, surface sheen, light petroleum odor.  4 unoiled pelicans on buoy.

Benzene and other highly toxic contaminants were very low however the concentration of propylene glycol was between 360 and 440 parts per million. Just 25 parts per million is know to kill most fish and propylene glycol is just one of many ingredients found in Corexit.

When he got out of the water on the 29th, according to his lawyers, he began suffering painful rashes, nosebleeds, nasal blockages and shortness of breath - symptoms that persist to this day.\n\nDean said that Carlisle's doctor diagnosed him with chemical burns or exposure consistent with oil. He said Carlisle's biggest concern is the long-term threat of cancer.\n\nIt was not until June, after Carlisle's exposure, that state officials began posting swimming advisories and closed local waters to fishing.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources, oil at the mouth of Mobile Bay was first detected on June 1. The state issued a fishing ban on waters from Dauphin Island east on June 4.\n\nCarlisle's civil complaint also alleges that BP, because of delays in the Deepwater Horizon project, pushed to speed the drilling. \"This emphasis on speed over safety led to errors and omissions by the Drilling Defendants, which in turn caused and/or contributed to the initial explosion and subsequent Oil Spill,\" the suit states.\n\nThe suit maintains that BP and its partners had been aware for weeks that the drill pipe had intruded into the blowout preventer, damaging it. Yet, the companies ignored the problems and failed to report them to outside sources, according to the allegations.\n\nThe suit also suggests that the Deepwater Horizon may have been drilling deeper than its permitted depth.\n\nThe lawsuit also faults the BP's actions before and after the spill, accusing the company of understating the risks of a blowout and overstating its ability to respond to a massive leak. The suit cites a 2009 exploration plan submitted to federal regulators stating that \"no adverse impacts are expected\" to the coast in the \"unlikely\" event of a spill.\n\nThe suit also faults BP and the other defendants for not taking steps to prevent a leak, such as installing a backup blowout preventer. It quotes from a 2004 federal study, which found that only three of 74 rigs in the Gulf had blowout preventers strong enough to squeeze off and cut the pipe at water pressures that are present at maximum depth.\n\n\n\nRelated topics: BP, Deepwater Horizon, Gulf of Mexico oil spill 2010, Mobile Bay, Obie Carlisle, oil spill\n\nSponsored Links\n\nShare this story\nStory tools\n\nMore stories in Breaking News from the Press-Register\nPrevious story\nAllen: Spill could be contained by Monday; Navy airship arrives in Mobile (with video); Surgeon general urges counseling\nNext story\nWork starts on removing oil containment cap; replacement could catch all oil by Monday\n\n6\nComments Feed\nView: Oldest first | Newest first\nVahlsingChristina\nChristina Vahlsing July 10, 2010 at 5:50AM\nFollow\n\nThe oil dispersant COREXIT® 9500; and the Table of Chemical Constituents Commonly Found in Crude Oil can be reviewed at: http://www.gulfoilspill.20megsfree.com/\nInappropriate?

Property owners differ in what they wanted in terms of removal. Rental property owners and those who do not own waterfront property wanted mechanical sifters to come so the beach would look good. Waterfront residents/nonrental property owners wanted hand sifting (which never happened-only shovel removal-along with lots of sand) and NO big machines. In Gulf Shores apparently waterfront property owners were phoned to ask permission to clean their property. This did not happen for Ft. Morgan property owners (at least in our area). Although I thought that we had finally gotten some positive response to the BP &amp; EPA folks driving over dune areas and upper beach when the Natural Resources team was assigned (according to Susan Oller to protect the natural resources - dunes mainly) and the team had installed a flag/stake system demarcating the more fragile areas not to be driven over, this system was removed on the 10th (against the protests of local residents. We did not realize why until we awoke at 11 PM to find mechanical sifters driving down the beach and over areas previously demarcated as fragile.... BP should be required to replant in all areas that had plants prior to the clean-up. This means not just in the high dunes, but also on the areas that were finally in the process of reforming the first line of primary dunes. The mechanical sifters make the beach look superficially clean, but they have pushed oil subsurface and mixed stain inot the subsurface sand. A frustrating experience for residents.\n\npics 1: cleaning crews came out the evening of July 9 and again today from 9:30 AM until about 5pm . Although we had been told they would not clean on private property, they did so in some cases.\n\nPic 2: In treads of machines from clean-up crew\nPic 3: the \"cleaned\" area\nPic 4: 1453, 1455, 1458 At 11PM I heard a noise and went out on my deck to see 5-7 mechanical sifters cleaning the beach, including over private property. A neighbor in front of me on the beach ran out to try and stop them from going over his property. Earlier in the day he had placed a sign out On his property saying he would clean his own property and argued with the crew supervisors to keep them off his property (they had been told they could now go on private  property.  A rental property owner had been called about permission to clean his West Beach property and he had given his permission for all his properties, but the one in our grid was NOT cleaned. Also, the markers that had been put outby the Natural Resources team to keep crews off the dunes were removed. When asked how the crews would know where to keep off of, the reply was that the cleaners would just know. \nPics 5-6: Early morning we went out to record the beach after the night’s “cleaning” with mechanical sifters: Vehicles had driven through dunes, reduced the size of the TB/TPs and pushed them under the sand surface, and dug up dune plantings. Night foraging sand crabs were crushed and strewn over the beach by the sifters \npic 7.  It has taken years to get these plantings to be established. In one night’s time many of the plants are gone. \nThe ST that covered the beach (as recorded in prior pics/reports) is now well mixed into the sand.

Five of these sightings were on the water and 24 were shoreline or marsh impact. Several of these sightings included impact to wildlife with either oiled or deceased birds. Cleanup task forces were deployed to the Chandeluer Islands yesterday, which had confirmed shoreline impact. Rapid Assessment vessels with U.S. Coast Guard Pollution Investigators are working in cooperation with Air Operations, who will contact these vessels directly and immediately in the event of an oil sighting. Vessels are deployed to impacted areas to fortify these areas with hard and soft absorbent boom, and recovery vessels have also been deployed to these areas to assess impact and remediation activities. Skimming will be conducted where possible in these areas.   \n \nThere was an oil sighting on Tuesday that could not be confirmed by a pollution investigator, as it had apparently disappeared and could not be verified. There is now shoreline impact in the same area, a 100-foot long oiling near Point Lydia, evidence of submerged oil in parish waters. St. Bernard Parish President Craig Taffaro directed operations personnel to institute a program to track submerged oil. Local fishermen have begun constructing and deploying “sentinel snare booms,” which are snare or “pom pom” boom stretching from a buoy to an anchor, thus covering the entire water column, in anywhere from 6-foot to 12-foot depths. These snare booms are being placed 300 feet apart just outside of the Chandeleur Islands to detect how oil is getting into parish waters.\n \nAt the direction of President Taffaro, testing is being conducted this morning on existing technology to remediate oiled marsh. If this technology proves to be successful, operations will be able to use this process to begin cleaning oiled marsh areas in parish waters. \n \n###","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1455","id":"155"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.322695,29.879791]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1456","title":"hammerhead shark washed up on Ft.

It died while enroute to Gulf World Marine Park, a rescue facility in Panama City.\n\nA necropsy will be performed to determine exact cause of death, according to Courtnee Ferguson of the BP Unified Command Joint Information Center in Mobile.\n\nOnce the dolphin was discovered, after beaching itself, a three hour ordeal ensued to try and save the mammal in the water. Two U.S. Coast Guard volunteers and a Florida Department of Environmental Protection officer were involved in the rescue attempt.\n\nTravis said the dolphin was crying as people rushed to save it. She said people scraped oil off the dolphin with their hands.\n\n“It was so sad. It just broke our hearts,” Travis said.\n\nThe dolphin’s struggle to survive added to the dismay of people stunned to find a mass of oil washing ashore and covering the pristine coastline at Fort Pickens.\n\nThis was the worst day for oil reaching Pensacola area beaches since the BP oil disaster began with an explosion April 20 off the Louisiana coast.\n\n“It’s terrible.

Project Gulf Impact recently took their second boat trip in the last week. The first trip brought us photos of freshly sprayed dispersant, totally destroying the myth that this disaster is reaching its end.\n\nLarge oil and dispersant plumes still linger, continually poisoning and destroying our precious oceans. Internal BP documents show that there were not one but TWO wells, raising the possibility that the ROV cameras may have never been placed near the real leak.\n\nI spoke to Project Gulf Impact about their trip and they had this to say:\n\n    “In some places you could see oil, in others it was clearly freshly sprayed dispersant. In certain areas there was a heavy chemical smell, in others it was oddly quiet.”\n\n    “As far as that trip goes, it was defintly the worse i have seen the dispersant. It was scarey because some of the dispersant was still in powder form which would indicate that it was from a plane. It was horrifying to see the jelly fish and dolphins attempting to get away from the plumes, especially when certain plumes were over a mile long!“  \n\nPhoto by Project Gulf Impact © 2010\n\nWhen they reached the shore they came across a massive fish kill. Later that day they attempted to go back to the area of the fish kill and found that it was crawling with private security. That’s right, BP has hired private security to cover up the damage caused by the oil spill and the subsequent dispersant overkill.\n\n    “When we were coming in we saw a fish kill, that was the hardest part. When we came back later a huge cover up had begun. The beach was full of private security, Wackenhut security called in our plates and forced us off the beach. Private security on a public beach!  This all happened in a matter of hours.” \n\nWake up people, this chemical rape will continue until the American people demand it is stopped.

James \"Catfish\" Miller and Mark Stewart, both lifelong fishermen, have refused to trawl for shrimp because they believe the Mississippi Sound contains submerged oil. Laboratory test results from samples taken on that trip show extremely high concentrations of oil in the Mississippi Sound.\n\nThe State of Mississippi's Department of Marine Resources (DMR) opened all of its territorial waters to fishing on August 6. This was done in coordination with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the US Food and Drug Administration, despite concerns from commercial fishermen in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida about the presence of oil and toxic dispersants from the BP oil disaster.\"I can't tell you how hard it is for me not to be shrimping right now, because I'm a trawler,\" Miller told Truthout as he piloted his shrimp boat out of Pass Christian Harbor, \"That's what I do. I trawl.\"\n\nBut Miller and Stewart have been alarmed by their state's decision to reopen the waters, and have been conducting their own tests for oil in areas where they have fished for years. Their method was simple - they tied an absorbent pad to a weighted hook, dropped it overboard for a short duration of time, then pulled it up to find the results.On each of the eight tests Truthout witnessed, the white pads were brought up covered in a brown oily substance that the fishermen identified as a mix of BP's crude oil and toxic dispersants.\n\nThe first test conducted was approximately one-quarter mile out from the harbor, and the pad pulled up was stained brown.\"They're letting people swim in this,\" Miller exclaimed, while holding the stained pad up to the sun.\n\nMiller and Stewart were both in BP's Vessels Of Opportunity (VOO) program and were trained in identifying oil and dispersants.\n\nThis writer took two samples from two absorbent pads that were brought up from the water that were covered in brown residue and had them tested in a private laboratory via gas chromatography.Miller and Dahr Jamail holding oil-soaked sorbent pad. (Photo © Erika Blumenfeld 2010)\n\nThe environmental analyst who worked with this writer did so on condition of anonymity, and performed a micro extraction that tests for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH). The lower reporting limit the analyst is able to detect from a solid sample like the absorbent pad is 50 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe first sample this writer took was from a sorbent pad dropped overboard to a depth of approximately eight feet and held there for roughly one minute. The location of this was 30 18.461 North, 089 14.171 West, taken at 9:40 AM. This sample tested positive for oil, with a hydrocarbon concentration of 479 ppm. Seawater that is free of oil would test at zero ppm of hydrocarbons.\n\nThe second sample this writer took was from a sorbent pad dropped overboard to a depth of approximately eight feet and held there for roughly one minute. The location of this was 30 18.256 North, 089 11.241 West, taken at 10:35 AM. This sample tested positive for oil, with a hydrocarbon concentration of 587 ppm.\n\n\"For the sorbent pads, I had to include the weight of the actual pad itself, so that the extraction was done as a solid,\" the environmental analyst explained. \"Had I had enough liquid in these samples to do a liquid extraction, the numbers would have been substantially higher.\"\"I can verify that the shrimp boat captain retrieved what appeared to be an oily residue,\" Henderson told Truthout. \"My suspicion is that it was oil. It felt like oil to the touch, and it smelled like oil when you sniffed it.\"\n\nOn August 11, the two fishermen brought out scientist Dr. Ed Cake of Gulf Environmental Associates. (Video from the \"Bridge the Gulf Project\" of that trip with Miller and Stewart finding an oil and dispersant mixture on open Mississippi fishing waters.)\n\nDr. Cake wrote of the experience: \"When the vessel was stopped for sampling, small, 0.5- to 1.0-inch-diameter bubbles would periodically rise to the surface and shortly thereafter they would pop leaving a small oil sheen. According to the fishermen, several of BP's Vessels-of-Opportunity (Carolina Skiffs with tanks of dispersants [Corexit?]) were hand spraying in Mississippi Sound off the Pass Christian Harbor in prior days/nights. It appears to this observer that the dispersants are still in the area and are continuing to react with oil in the waters off Pass Christian Harbor.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Miller took the samples to a community meeting in nearby D'Iberville to show fishermen and families the contaminated sorbent pads. At the meeting, fishermen unanimously supported a petition calling for the firing of Dr. Bill Walker, the head of Mississippi's DMR, who is responsible for opening the fishing grounds.\n\nOn August 9, Walker, despite ongoing reports of tar balls, oil and dispersants being found in Mississippi waters, declared \"there should be no new threats\" and issued an order for all local coast governments to halt ongoing oil disaster work being funded by BP money that was granted to the state.\n\nRecent weeks in Mississippi waters have found fishermen and scientists finding oil in Garden Pond on Horn Island, massive fish kills near Cat Island and Biloxi, \"black water\" in Mississippi Sound, oil inside Pass Christian Harbor and submerged oil in Pass Christian, in addition to what Miller and Stewart showed Truthout and others with their testing.\"We've sent samples to all the news media we know, here in Mississippi and in [Washington] D.C.,\" Stewart, a third-generation fisherman from Ocean Springs told Truthout, \"We had Ray Mabus' people on this boat, and we sent them away with contaminated samples they watched us take, and we haven't heard back from any of them.\"\n\nRaymond Mabus is the United States Secretary of the Navy and a former governor of Mississippi. President Obama tasked him with developing \"a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible.\"\n\nMabus has been accused by many Gulf Coast fishermen of not living up to his task.\n\nThus, since neither the federal nor state governments will conduct the testing they feel is necessary, Miller and Stewart decided to take matters into their own hands.\n\nStewart had on board another homemade method of capturing oil in the water column. He took two tomato cages and filled them with sorbent pad, layered it in plastic to hold it together, and left a hole at the bottom for the water to flow through, creating a large sorbent cone that could flow through the water.\nStewart had on board another homemade method of capturing oil in the water column.\n\n(Photo © Erika Blumenfeld 2010)\n\nThe method proved fruitful. After several tests in the water column, being careful to never let it touch bottom, the cone was turned a dark brown with what turned out to be a very high concentration of oil.\n\n\"Normally we have a lot of white shrimp in the Sound right now,\" Stewart told Truthout of the current situation in the Mississippi Sound. \"You can catch 500-800 pounds a night, but right now, there are very few people shrimping, and those that are, are catching nothing or maybe 200 pounds per night. You can't even pay your expenses on 200 pounds per night.\"\n\n\"We think they opened shrimp season prematurely,\" Miller told Truthout. \"How can we put our product back on the market when everybody in America knows what happened down here? I have seen so many dead animals in the last few months I can't even keep count.\"On August 19, several commercial shrimpers, including Miller and Stewart, held a press conference at the Biloxi Marina. Other fishermen there were not fishing because they feared making people sick from toxic seafood they might catch.\n\nLaboratory confirmed oil-soaked sorbent pad. (Photo © Erika Blumenfeld 2010)\"I don't want people to get sick,\" Danny Ross, a commercial fisherman from Biloxi told Truthout. \"We want the government and BP to have transparency with the Corexit dispersants.\"\n\nRoss said he has watched horseshoe crabs trying to crawl out of the water and other marine life like stingrays and flounder also trying to escape the water. He believes this is because the water is hypoxic due to the toxicity of the dispersants, of which BP admits to using approximately 1.9 million gallons.\n\n\"I will not wet a net and catch shrimp until I know it's safe to do so,\" Ross added, \"I have no way of life now. I can't shrimp and others are calling the shots. For the next 20 years, what am I supposed to do? Because that's how long it's going to take for our waters to be safe again.\"\n\nDavid Wallis, another fisherman from Biloxi, attended the press conference. \"We don't feel our seafood is safe, and we demand more testing be done,\" Wallis told Truthout. \"I've seen crabs crawling out of the water in the middle of the day. This is going to be affecting us far into the future.\"\n\n\"A lot of fishermen feel as we do. Most of them I talk to don't want the season opened, for our safety as well as others,\" Wallis added. \"Right now there's barely any shrimp out there to catch. We should be overloaded with shrimp right now. That's not normal. I won't eat any seafood that comes out of these waters, because it's not safe.\"\n\nMiller told Truthout that when he worked in BP's VOO program, \"I came out here and looked at the oil and they didn't let us clean it up most days. Instead, I watched them spray dispersants on it at night, and now we're seeing acid rain burn holes in our plants. I've seen them spray Corexit from Carolina Skiffs with my own eyes. For the last several weeks now they keep shoving these lies in our face. You can only turn your head so far, for so long.\"\n\nThe hydrocarbon tests conducted on the samples taken by this writer only represent a tiny part of the Gulf compared to the massive area of the ocean that has been affected by BP's oil catastrophe. A comprehensive sampling regime across the Gulf, taken regularly over the years ahead, is clearly required in order to implement appropriate cleanup responses and take public safety precautions.\n\nOn their own, Miller and Stewart have made at least seven sampling runs, covering many tens of miles of the Mississippi Sound, and have, in their words, \"rarely pulled up a sorbent pad that did not contain oil residue.\"","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2182","id":"228"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.11241,30.18256]}},{"properties":{"title":"With BP's Oil and Chemicals Still in Gulf Coast Waters, Shrimpers Stay Out.","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2184","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/30 04:53:01 -0400","original":"Mon Aug 30 04:53:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/08/30 04:53:00 -0400"},"description":"The waters are open, but the shrimpers aren't biting, as oil and dispersant remain in water and on beaches.\n\n\"The fish are safe,\" declared LaDon Swann of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This should have been good news to the audience at Alma Bryant High School in Bayou La Batre, Alabama.\n\nVirtually all of the 150 people attending the August 19 community forum made their living in one form or another in the Alabama fishing industry, and most had for generations, until the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon.\n\nHaving spent four months with a severely reduced, or nonexistent income, all are now desperate. Even the lucky few able to participate in BP's Vessels of Opportunity (VOO) program are now largely out of work as BP has all but shut down the program in the area. Many can no longer afford rents or mortgages, pay medical bills, or even, in growing numbers, provide food for their families.\n\nEven so, none appeared relieved at Swann's words. They simply did not agree with him, as far too many continue to see far too much evidence that both oil and dispersant remain in their waters. As scientists at the University of Georgia concluded on August 17 using the federal government's own data, as much as 79% of the 4.1 million barrels of oil BP spilled in to the Gulf \"remains in the Gulf in varying forms of toxicity.\"\n\nLess then 24 hours later, in a small boat captained by Pat Carrigan, we encountered an oil slick within 15 minutes of setting off from Carrigan's backyard on Dauphin Island. We were in the Mississippi Sound heading toward the Katrina Cut, a shortcut to the Gulf of Mexico opened when the storm split one portion of Dauphin Island off from the rest of the island five years earlier.\"That's dispersed oil,\" Carrigan said as we passed through a slick of light brown foamy goo. Carrigan has fished these waters for more than 20 years and is a former VOO worker. Glint Guidry, Acting President of the Louisiana Shrimp Association, shared Carrigan's assessment. Looking at a photograph of the slick I showed him the following day, Guidry said, \"That's oil, oil with dispersant.\" The shrimpers view the slick as cause for concern because these waters were reopened to shrimping on August 8.\n\nBut, as LaDon Swann had reminded the audience at Alma Bryant, the federal government and Gulf States have established specific protocols for re-opening these waters to fishing.\n\nThese protocols state that the visual observation of oil or \"chemical contaminants\" on the surface of the water is cause for the recommendation that the fishery be closed \"until free of sheen\" for at least 30 days in federal waters and seven days in Alabama state waters.\n\n\"These waters should be filled with shrimpers,\" Carrigan explained to us on the August 20th trip. Instead, there was not a single boat on the water shrimping during the several hours of this trip. \"They're just not shrimping.\"\n\nAnd the oil was not limited to the water.\n\nAfter passing through the sheen of dispersed oil, his passengers were more than a little disconcerted when Carrigan took off his shirt and jumped into the water to pull the boat ashore as we landed at a western strip of Dauphin Island accessible only by boat. We were even more concerned when he told us to do the same as we disembarked.\n\nAfter trekking through a completely untouched and unpopulated strip of wild brush, green grass, and blue flowers, we came upon a landscape opened to clear blue sky, white clouds, and a stunning white sandy beach.\n\nRocky Kistner of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who had arranged for the trip, looked ecstatic as he gazed at the beach -- that is, until he looked down.Huge tar balls, some as large and as thick as an outstretched hand, stretched in a line where the waves had left them, as far as the eye could see down the beach.\n\nA baby's sippy cup lid covered in tar sat in a bed of white sand. A Dawn dishwashing soap bottle lay covered in the sticky goo. Using a piece of bark he found on the beach, Zach Carter of Mobile's South Bay Community Alliance bent down and started scooping tar balls into a white bucket. \"It's not only on the beach, it's in the water,\" Carrigan said, looking stricken. He stood in the ocean, bent down, gathering more tarballs in his hands as they washed up.\n\nMost disturbing was that the beach, accessible only by boat, was deserted. \"There used to be BP workers up and down this beach cleaning it up, constantly,\" Carrigan said. \"Now, nothing. Just oil.\"","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2184","id":"229"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.109722,30.255481]}},{"properties":{"title":"Helicopter pilot reports gasoline smell","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2195","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/30 13:53:01 -0400","original":"Mon Aug 30 13:53:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/08/30 13:53:00 -0400"},"description":"Helicopter pilot working in Grand Isle reports an increase in gasoline / fuel smells since April, and says that other pilots have reported itching / watery eyes.

Results from the tests, which were conducted in a Colorado laboratory, indicated the oil was from the Deepwater Horizon well, he said.\n\n“I consider this to be very interesting scientifically, as few samples detect dispersant, much less three of their major ingredients in the same sample,” said Kaltofen.\n\nThe material was collected by a group of scientists working for attorney Stuart Smith, who is representing the Louisiana-based United Commercial Fisherman’s Association and the Louisiana Environmental Action Network in a potential lawsuit regarding damage from the oil spill. The group found the oil about a mile north of Horn Island on Aug. 9.\n\n“EPA samples found only one indication of dispersant near shore in Louisiana. That location was sampled several times with no other detection,” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Terri White said in a Monday e-mail. “There is no authorization to apply any dispersant at this time. If anyone has information about this, they need to report it immediately so it can be investigated and referred to law enforcement.”\n\nJerry Moran, a New Orleans-based photographer who accompanied the group to document the sampling effort, said that the material looked unlike anything he’d seen during months of photographing the spill.\n\n“We saw birds diving over a patch of oil. I’d never seen it that thick before. It looked like cauliflower. I had never seen it that texture before,” Moran said. “There was a rainbow sheen around us, a really thick, colorful sheen.”\n\nPress-Register reporters encountered a similar material — strangely textured oil with a pronounced sheen — in Mobile Bay and Mississippi Sound several times in July and early August. The day before Moran’s group found the dispersant and oil mix, the Press-Register documented oil in a marsh on Horn Island.\n\nBP and federal officials said that dispersants have not been used in the Gulf since July 19.\n\nSmith, the lawyer who funded Kaltofen’s sampling expedition, discounted the notion that dispersants had not been used near shore.\n\n“I personally saw C-130s applying dispersants from my hotel room in the Florida Panhandle. They were spraying directly adjacent to the beach right at dusk,” said Smith. “Fishermen I’ve talked to say they’ve been sprayed. This idea they are not using this stuff near the coast is nonsense.”","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2251","id":"232"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.51668,30.266867]}},{"properties":{"title":"Oil under the sand at Raccoon Island (link to video)","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2252","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/31 13:46:01 -0400","original":"Tue Aug 31 13:46:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/08/31 13:46:00 -0400"},"description":"In the headlines portion of LPB's weekly show last Friday (Aug. 27), Melanie Driscoll of the Audubon Society was on Raccoon Island August 20 and showed LPB's photographer hidden tar balls along the shore when you scratch just below the surface.

Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Alicia Johnson confirmed the agency believes that to be the case.\n\nBut Kaltofen said the time frame raises a question.\n\n\"Why on Aug. 9 did we find on a relatively concentrated pool of dispersant on the surface, well outside where the dispersant was going to be sprayed? It shouldn't have been there,\" Kaltofen told AOL News. He added that the high concentration in the sample suggested the dispersant was not carried inland from open water.\n\n\"What person or process got this dispersant with such a high concentration into inshore waters?\" Kaltofen said.\n\nFishermen working the gulf say flatly they don't believe that BP actually stopped using the dispersant. But Kaltofen said he has talked to scientists who are searching for a more scientifically sound reason. One possibility: Could the dispersant have reconstituted itself on the surface?\n\n\"We just don't know enough about this yet,\" he said.\n\nIn all, Boston Chem has taken 250 samples from western Louisiana to the Florida Keys. The EPA has taken 300 water samples near shore, and found one \"indication of a possible dispersant constituent near Louisiana,\" according to an e-mail from the agency.\n\n\"The location was sampled several other times with no other detection,\" the agency said, adding that it is continuing to monitor the region for \"any possible safety and health threats.\"\n\nBetween June 27 and July 20, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sampled 153 fish in the area reopened to fishing and is continuing to test samples of fish caught throughout the gulf. NOAA scientists have found no oil in the area reopened for fishing since early July, according to a report by the agency.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that seafood samples from reopened fishing waters have passed sensory testing for contamination with oil and dispersant.\n\nScientific data gathered by the government \"indicate that the dispersants used in the Deepwater Horizon response are unlikely to build up in the flesh of the fish,\" the FDA said. \"This is primarily based on the assessment of their physical properties, which indicate that these compounds do not penetrate the gills or bodies of fish, and will not be concentrated in edible tissues of seafood.\"\n\nThe credibility of an analysis by a firm hired by attorneys suing BP will inevitably be challenged in court by the oil giant. Yet there is so much suspicion about the government's conclusion that much of the oil had disappeared that any report justifying those fears carries added weight.\n\nAnecdotally, fishermen recount episodes where fishermen and cleanup crews have worked the same waters.\n\n\"My cousin was working in Grand Isle. He told me they had people who were shrimping alongside people who were skimming oil,\" said Louis Molero, a Louisiana oysterman.\n\n\"Everybody believes the government is sugar-coating this,\" he said. \"If we get one person sick due to oil, our business is really going to be in a mess.\"","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2265","id":"244"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.650664,30.229936]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2358","title":"1,000 ppb TOLUENE found in INLAND waters near Florida border; “Hydrocarbon levels that exceed safe exposure limits” present in multiple areas","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/04 02:25:01 -0400","original":"Sat Sep 04 02:25:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/04 02:25:00 -0400"},"description":"8/12/10 Site 10 – Walker Ave.; Moderate Concern – Site Sample Results Yield Detections for COCs at or Below the EPA and/or ADEM Health Screening Levels; Toluene @ 1 ppm.

On the far side of the road, docked shrimp boats sit quietly along the banks of the bayou. It's Sunday morning, 102 degrees and 80 percent humidity. We're the only things moving.\n\nI weave my way among the labyrinth of markers, stopping here and there to read epitaphs and calculate ages. Then I cross the road to the boats. I want to honor the dead, but I'm interested in the living. The ones still holding on.\n\nOn June 15, eight weeks after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig's explosion began spilling crude into the Gulf of Mexico, Seaside-based photographer Justin Bailie and I began our attempt to face the tragedy in the only ways we knew how.\n\nOur idea was to travel to the Gulf, where we'd spend several weeks learning firsthand about the ecosystem and economy. We planned to talk to people who stood to lose everything, and then to share those conversations, those stories, with people at home. Our goal was to start additional conversations that revolved around how we live, play and work in our shared environment.\n\nWe made the assumption that along the Gulf we would find people like us. Individuals who were motivated by their love of place and unwilling to sit idly by waiting for others to come in and clean up the mess left on their doorstep. In my notes I named the project \"The Cessation of Apathy.\"\n\nIdealistic for sure. Rationally I know that much like the oil that brought us here, apathy isn't easily stopped. Lethargy is hard to beat. But I believe in people.\n\nI believe that overcoming inertia -- getting off the couch, out of the car, into the world and engaging -- is the hardest part. I believe that sometimes outrage and anger have purpose. I believe in loving my neighbor more than myself and in trusting you, him and the other guy to do the same.\n\nMost of all I believe in love. And, following my beliefs to Louisiana, I found it. Or maybe it found me.\n\nA boat feels haunted\n\nI wander near the boats, step onto the small docks where they're tethered, hold on to the pilings and lean out over the murky green water. Below me, tiny fish, maybe sculpins in huge schools, dart in one direction then another as if chased. Behind me a door opens and a man walks out. He sits heavily on the porch as if this effort alone is the limit of what he can bear.\n\nIt's his boat. The one I've been admiring. It's newly painted white with royal blue accents, but down by the waterline the paint has turned grimy with residual oil. BP had hired the man, who asked not to be named, after the spill forced the closure of the fisheries. Working as part of a cleanup crew, he said he had gotten sick from the chemicals used to contain the oil, and after being hospitalized had been forced to abandon his coveted slot. Since then his boat hasn't moved. His eyes begin to tear and spill over as he asks whether I'd like to go aboard.\n\nI would, and I do. Accompanied by his wife, I explore the cabin and decks. They're tidy and well-kept, but the boat feels haunted and sad without purpose. Stepping back on to land, Justin and I are invited to come back later in the week for dinner and a prayer meeting. We're told that no one is ready to give up, pull out, or move on.\n\nScream and be heard\n\nThe exterior of the Southern Sting Tattoo Parlor in Larose, La., is painted with images of the Grim Reaper wearing the BP logo, a portrait of Barack Obama, a dismembered human body and a giant water tower spilling oil. In front of the building, and slightly to the right, a statue of a man wearing a gas mask and holding a sign saying, \"God help us all,\" has been erected. It's the work of the parlor's owner and operator, Bobby Pitre, 33, and tattoo artist Eric Guidry, 20.\n\nPitre, with his slicked hair and charismatic personality, has received a fair amount of press and acclaim for the work. The shop's visibility along the highway, coupled with the unsettling paintings and Pitre's rockabilly style, make an easy, if slightly intimidating, target for media searching out local reactions to the oil spill and cleanup efforts.\n\n\"What happened here could have been prevented,\" says Pitre of the oil spill. \"Now what can we do? This art -- painting -- this is a way for us to scream and to be heard. Maybe it's the only thing we can do.\"\n\nBoth men grew up within 15 miles of here. Their roots run deep, but Guidry isn't sure that a future remains in Larose for him.\n\n\"Did you hear what (former BP chief executive) Tony Hayward said?\" he asked. \"He said he couldn't wait to have his life back. What about us? We're never going to have our lives back.\"\n\nGuidry has to return to a customer, but Pitre invites us fishing with his family. Their land backs up to a canal, one of the few places in the area that has not been closed to fishing. There we meet him, his mom and his 5-year-old daughter, Sailor. I stand and watch as three generations bait hooks and cast their lines.\n\n\"Last year she didn't want anything to do with fish or fishing,\" says Pitre of his daughter as he cuts several large worms with a long kitchen knife. \"This year it's all she wants to do. And now they're telling us we can't fish. Crabbing and shrimping are all closed, too.\n\n\"How do I explain that? All this water here, all this space and life, and we can't fish anymore? She's not going to get to experience what I got to experience -- what my mom got to experience and her parents.\"\n\nOther family members and friends appear, and an impromptu picnic and fishing derby develop.\n\nAs the party winds down, Bridget Broussard, one of the matriarchs of the group and the landowner, invites us to stay the night. She met us an hour earlier, yet offers us room in her house, space in her yard, whatever we need.\n\nWe ask to sleep out by the water, and though she seems perplexed by our decision to forgo air conditioning, she walks out later to share bags of garden-fresh produce and barbecue.\n\nAs the moon rises and the temperature falls below 90, the humidity drops with it. The air, heavy and thick all week, turns gentle and lovely.\n\nAt this moment, 1,600 miles from home, in the middle of one of the greatest environmental disasters in history, eating a just-picked cucumber as if it were an apple, I realize there's no place I'd rather be.\n\nOne day at a time\n\nWe continue moving up and down the bayous. In some areas people still fish and shrimp, in others they wait and explore options for survival. In Dulac, La., where shrimpers are still at work, we spend a morning at the Bluewater Shrimp Co. Tropical Storm Alex spins on the horizon, and workers in the plant talk about the additional devastation a hurricane could bring.\n\nOwner Allen Estay predicts the complete closure of the fishery within the week.\n\n\"We can hang on for a month and keep paying everybody, but if we get oil in the estuaries, we're not going to have a fall season,\" he says. \"A lot of these guys have no other way to make a living. We're just going to have to take it one day at a time.\"\n\nIt turns out the storm is not as bad as forecast, and Estay's prediction is wrong, but the fear and worry don't dissipate with the change in weather.\n\n\"One of my most devastating thoughts isn't the closure of the fisheries, or even the failure of the business,\" says Estay. \"It's that oil gets pushed all the way up here into the estuaries and onto the land. They'll condemn this whole area and we'll have to leave.\"\n\nWaiting is hardest part\n\nLouisiana was hot, sticky, buggy, sometimes scary and absolutely beautiful. In many ways it was the hardest, but also the best, trip I've ever taken.\n\nComplete strangers welcomed us with smiles and thick accents. People we'd never met were willing to share their time, their food, their stories and their homes.\n\nI was consistently impressed and surprised by the tenacity of the individuals and families living along the bayous. Though all were saddened and many were heartbroken by the spill and its potential impact on their homes, few said they would consider leaving.\n\nMany said the hardest part was simply the waiting. They were a community used to rebuilding and taking action after disaster struck. A roof can be rebuilt after a hurricane, one shrimp fisherman told me. But this, he said, this I don't know how to rebuild.\n\nWith all that, how could I not feel a connection between their coast and ours?\n\nHow could I not fall in love?\n\n-- Aimee Brown","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2403","id":"254"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.381748,29.572438]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2405","title":"Oil on back beach BP never cleaned up in Grand Isle","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/06 14:32:01 -0400","original":"Mon Sep 06 14:32:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/06 14:32:00 -0400"},"description":"Frustrated Experts Do What They Can For Wildlife\n\nSUBMITTED BY: Rachel McKay Laskowski and Craig Hill, Kinship Circle Team #7\nLOCATION: REGION #1 — Grand Isle, Louisiana\n\nSITES AND ACTIVITIES, 9/1/10: At 10:00am, we meet with Leann Sarco, Interpretive Ranger for Grande Isle Louisiana State Park, to discuss her Hermit Crab Survival Project.

At 39 miles out in Gulf waters, divers on boat #1 jump overboard in wet suits while Chris snorkels near an oilrig. Chris and Scott Procter return with coral samples to assess at a lab. Divers report two black tip sharks, one Kemp's Ridley turtle, a large redfish, and many smaller fishes. They note that fish numbers, for this area, are down.\n\nExperienced diver Deb Castellana, of Bluewater, refuses to enter the water because she doesn't “like the look of it.” At one spot, the water is a dark olive green rather than its normal blue-green. Divers say stringy strands hang in the water — like “swimming through chicken soup.” On our return to Venice, we stop three times to observe naturally occurring “foam fractation” flecked with brown spots and oily brown strands believed to be oil. Both boats gather foam samples for analysis and we record GPS coordinates... During our exploratory tour, we see no sign of U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Coast Guard or BP.\n\nMeanwhile, Kinship Circle's Jane Allen heads to Hammond, LA to tour International Bird Rescue Research Center. A bird with “old oil” is used to demonstrate the washing process. IBRRC Executive Director Jay Holcomb says older oil never completely comes off. Many “old oiled birds” are now brought in from rookeries where earlier rescue attempts would have caused extensive damage to un-hatched eggs. Delayed captures have resulted in extraction of dead and live birds... IBBRC sees roughly 4-5 oiled birds daily, mostly fledglings, with 10 oiled birds in house. A total 220 birds are on-site, compared to over 500 birds (150 laughing gulls, young pelicans and spoonbills) two weeks ago. Oiled birds are stabilized, cleaned and released in Florida, Georgia and Texas.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2406","id":"256"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.367317,29.2684]}},{"properties":{"title":"Oil On Pensacola Beach / Ft.

A special thanks to Spot.us for partial funding to cover travel expenses for reporting on this story.\nRobin_Young1b.jpg\nGlynn Wilson\n\nRobin Young of Orange Beach talks about the health problems she suffered from BP’s Gulf oil disaster (see video below).\n\nby Glynn Wilson\n\nORANGE BEACH, Ala. — Wherever disaster strikes, there’s always an associated crud.\n\nThere was the Exxon Valdez Crud. The Nine Eleven Crud. The Katrina Cough, and then the TVA coal ash cough.\n\nNow, along the entire coast of the Gulf of Mexico, there is the BP Crud, afflicting workers and the general population from Louisiana to Florida.\n\nWhen the Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew up in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, Robin Young, a 47-year-old director of guest services for a property management company in Orange Beach, Alabama, was gearing up for what promised to be the best tourist season on the coast in years. From the city of New Orleans to the Florida panhandle, communities were finally starting to feel like they were recovering from the devastation left in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Ivan.\n\nSince suffering a debilitating bout of what locals are calling the “BP Crud,” however, like thousands of other people along the coast due to their exposure to the oil and chemical dispersants, she is now part of a growing community of activists along the coast who are worried about their health.\n\nJust a few days after BP’s oil made landfall along the Alabama Gulf Coast in June, Ms. Young’s symptoms started with “a fiery, burning sore throat,” she said. Then came the horrible, constant cough, followed by an achy feeling much like a severe flu virus — and a lethargy that kept her in bed for two weeks solid. Her memory started playing tricks on her, and her motor skills and even hand-to-eye coordination went south.\n\n\nShe started communicating with other sick folks over the Internet, and attending local meetings with corporate and government officials. At one meeting early on, she asked for a show of hands in a room of maybe 400 people to see how many had suffered symptoms similar to hers.\n\n“Half the people in the room raised their hands,” she said in an interview at her cottage right next to the Intercoastal Waterway, which was polluted with oil and chemicals at the height of the disaster. Clearly, this was not some isolated event unrelated to the oil rig blowout.\n\nHer new friends, who soon started a nonprofit group called Guardians of the Gulf, tried to find a local doctor to help them. After having no luck, they eventually found an out of state toxicologist and a doctor who knew enough about a new area of occupational and environmental health to order blood tests.\n\nThey found Dr. Michael R. Harbut, a clinical professor of Internal Medicine and director of the Environmental Cancer Program at Wayne State University’s Karmanos Cancer Institute, board certified in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. And they found Metametrix, a lab to test their blood.\n\nWhat they found in the blood tests was a stew of toxic chemicals directly associated with oil and gas production and the chemical dispersant Corexit, including ethylbenzene, xylenehigh and high levels of hexane, a hydrocarbon chiefly obtained by the refining of crude oil.\n\nThe long-term toxicity of hexane in humans is extensive peripheral nervous system failure. The initial symptoms are tingling and cramps in the arms and legs, followed by general muscular weakness. In severe cases, skeletal muscles atrophy and those exposed suffer a loss of coordination and vision problems, the very symptoms Ms. Young reported.\n\nTown officials and even local doctors have tried to silence her and others who raise the health issue, worried that if news got out, it could hurt the local economy even more. But a group of local pharmacists started keeping diaries of people coming in with similar symptoms.\n\n“There’s a core group of them that finally said, ‘Holy Cow,’ something’s going on,” she said. “They started listening to what we were saying. But we still couldn’t get a lot of help. We couldn’t get help from the local doctors because they didn’t know what to do.”\n\nEarly on, Ms. Young invited a crew from Bio-Cascade, air-pollution specialists out of New Jersey and Boston, to come down and test the air. She put them up in a house right on the beach.\n\nOn the third day John Vallier of Bio-Cascade woke up with a sore throat. He put the air monitoring machine on the deck and within 15 minutes it showed 110 parts per million of Volatile Organic Compounds in the air. The crew quickly packed and said they would help from outside the vicinity of the bad air coming off the Gulf. It was striking how scared they were and how fast they got out of town, Ms. Young said, while EPA was downplaying the threat coming from its own air monitoring stations.\n\nAnother member of her group who suffered similar symptoms but does not want to be identified by name called the local schools and confirmed that there were an unusual number of children out sick with what was diagnosed as “strep throat” and a “stomach virus,” at the end of summer and long before flu season is supposed to start.\n\nAnother woman, Robyn Hill of Foley, actually passed out while working for a BP contractor cleaning up the beach. When she was taken to the hospital by ambulance, the doctor tried to make her sign a form saying she suffered a heat stroke. She refused, and has now joined the cause to save the Gulf.\n\n“It really fired us up,” Ms Young said.\n\nSo they found a chemist in Mobile to test the water, Bob Naman, an analytical chemist with nearly thirty years of experience. They have tracked the oil, natural gas and Corexit. One sample right off Dauphin Island was so full of methane that it blew up in the lab’s test tube.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Young and her friends are now being told they need a high resolution scan of their lungs, brain, liver and kidneys.\n\n“They’ve also told us that in five to 10 years — they don’t have a time frame, they’re just guessing,” she said, “that we could come down with some godawful form of cancer.”\n\nThat’s exactly what happened in the area around Prince Williams Sound, Alaska, after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in the spring of 1989 and leaked about 11 million gallons of crude into the water, according to Dr. Riki Ott, a recognized expert with a Ph.D. in marine toxicology and a specialty in oil pollution.\n\nDr. Ott’s information is so sought after in four of the five Gulf states most affected by the largest and worst environmental disaster in U.S. history that she has practically moved to the Gulf Coast. I finally caught up with her in a hotel room on my iPhone from Gulf Shores.\n\nAfter spending the past four months working to try to get a handle on the scope of the problem, and getting sick herself, she has heard similar stories first-hand now from people ranging from Terrebonne Parish Louisiana to Apalachicola Florida.\n\n“What struck me when I first started hearing these stories was how similar the symptoms were to what happened after the Exxon Valdez oil spill,” she said.\n\nThe human health effects of that spill were mostly confined to sick workers, she indicated, because that area of Alaska is not heavily populated like the Gulf Coast.\n\n“I expected the vessel of opportunity workers to get sick because they were given hard hats instead of respirators just like our guys were. So it really didn’t surprise me in early May when I heard pretty much identical health symptoms,” she said. Dizziness, sore throat, headache, nausea, burning eyes, and eventually skin rashes resistant to treatment with antibiotics.\n\n“What convinced me that we may have a really big problem here,” she said, is when she heard similar stories at community forums from people not working directly in the oil and chemical tainted water, marshes and sand, and when she talked to pharmacists who reported seeing a huge increase in respiratory illnesses and bad skin rashes.\n\n“Now that the children are back in school, there’s a series of ’strep throat,” she said. “It’s the same symptoms, the blisters in the throat, the rashes I’d heard about all summer.”\n\nThere is a new area of occupational and environmental medicine covering chemical related illnesses, and the symptoms literally mimic flu-like symptoms. Dr. Ott is launching a Gulf-wide health survey along with coastal non-profit groups including the Louisiana Bayoukeeper and Ultimate Civics, a project of Earth Island Institute. The groups are also holding community health forums and opening health centers to try to get a handle on the scope of the problem.\n\nBut there are serious gaps in the law that allows workers to be exempted from coverage by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and even under the existing workers compensation regime. Under the U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA does not recognize chemical illnesses, Dr. Ott said, although it is recognized under the American Disabilities Act.\n\n“We’ve got a safety net with two big holes in it, and the workers are falling through those holes. It’s time to close those holes, and not only for the workers, but for the public,” she said. “What’s going on in the Gulf is to pretend that we can have this release of 200 million plus gallons of oil, 2 million plus gallons of toxic chemicals, and it’s not going to have any effect? In a highly populated area? I mean, come on!”","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2465","id":"261"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.573594,30.294368]}},{"properties":{"title":"Destin, FL: “Smelly black mat, hundreds of yards long” trapping marine life; “Nothing but pitch black water” with “sludge-like” waves — BP SAYS “black algae”, NOT OIL","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2466","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/08 04:46:01 -0400","original":"Wed Sep 08 04:46:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/08 04:46:00 -0400"},"description":"DESTIN - It was a smelly sludge that looked like oil and made the holiday weekend a disappointment on one Destin beach.\nBP says it was a seaweed called black algae.\nBut as Channel Three's Laura Hussey found out, some people aren't convinced.\n\nRobert Herrin\n\"You could see nothing but pitch black water.

Such consumption rates offer a built in-safety net, the FDA says, because the agency believes only 10 percent of the people in the U.S. eat that much seafood in a month.\n\nThe agency is allowing much higher PAH levels in shrimp, crabs and oysters based on the assumption that people eat more fish than the other types of seafood.\n\n“What’s really reassuring, to keep this in context, there hasn’t been a sample collected yet above Levels of Concern,” said Don Kraemer, a senior FDA official overseeing the seafood testing program.\n\nDr. Gina Solomon, a University of California toxicologist, member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's science advisory board, and senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the FDA’s approach leaves people who like shellfish more vulnerable.\n\n“The FDA’s allowable level of cancer-causing PAHs for Gulf shrimp is about four times higher than for fish, and is far higher than levels that have been allowed for human consumption after previous oil spills,” Solomon said. “These levels are not likely to cause immediate health threats, but for people who like shrimp, these contaminants could pose a significant health problem over time.”\n\nThe assumption that people eat more fish than shrimp made a difference in Florida, where all nine of the shrimp samples tested before Florida waters reopened to commercial shrimping were double the level that would have triggered more testing for fish.\n\nThe FDA’s higher “Level of Concern” for shrimp meant no further testing was done.\n\n“We don’t think there is anything we need to do to immediately ensure the safety of seafood,” Kraemer said, adding that the FDA would begin to test shrimp in the marketplace after the reopening sampling concludes. “If the levels continue to increase, we need to figure out what is going on.”\n\nFlorida officials discounted the FDA results and said their own tests showed no cause for concern.\n\nMore protective standards were issued for seafood after significant spills in Alaska, Oregon, Rhode Island, California and Maine, according to figures in a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s document titled “Managing Seafood Safety after an Oil Spill.”\n\nAfter a spill, health officials set limits based on the BaPE — benzo(a)pyrene equivalent — an estimated total of the cancer-causing PAHs present in seafood.\n\nFederal records show that after the tanker New Carissa ran aground on the Oregon coast in 1999, the state health division said that a 45 parts per billion BaPE standard in shellfish would protect the average consumer.\n\nAfter a spill in California, that state chose a standard of 34 parts per billion for shellfish.\n\nIn the Gulf, the FDA set limits between 132 parts per billion (for shrimp and crab) and 143 parts per billion (for oysters), all at least three times higher than levels in Oregon and California.\n\nThe FDA said that it came up with the higher levels based on updated cancer risk data from the EPA, and data that suggest people now weigh more and live longer than when those spills occurred.\n\nAnother difference, FDA officials said, is that the agency set its levels based on a 1-in-100,000 risk of developing cancer, while California and Oregon used a 1-in-1 million risk factor.\n\n“Basically, if more health-protective assumptions were incorporated, the allowable levels of the contaminants would go down significantly,” said Solomon, after examining the FDA’s methodology. “More samples might be within a range of concern.”\n\nIf fish had registered at even half the PAH level seen in the Florida shrimp, the fish would have been sent off for a more accurate lab analysis and the fishery would have remained closed pending those tests, according to the FDA protocol and agency officials.\n\nBut that is not what happened with the Florida shrimp.\n\nInstead, the FDA testing was cited in an Aug. 13 letter granting Florida officials permission to open state waters for shrimping.\n\nFDA officials said they were not concerned that the Florida shrimp samples tested about 30 times higher for PAHs than samples from neighboring Gulf states, because the shrimp remained well below the agency’s Level of Concern.\n\nThe “estimated total PAH” level found in nine Florida shrimp samples caught off Pensacola tested between 28 and 31 parts per million, according to the FDA. Shrimp in neighboring Alabama, by contrast, tested between 0.2 and 1.2 parts per million. Mississippi shrimp tested between 1.2 and 1.8 parts per million.\n\nKraemer said comparing samples from the different states was “not appropriate” due to factors including differences in the laboratories that conducted the testing. He also said FDA scientists do not believe the levels were actually as high as the testing suggested.\n\nIn e-mails and telephone interviews, he explained that deficiencies in the fluorescence testing method used by FDA might explain the high levels seen in Florida.\n\nFluorescence is a quicker and cheaper test than gas chromatography, which the FDA would use for re-testing any samples where initial results showed PAHs at half the Level of Concern for the given seafood type.\n\nKraemer suggested the FDA’s “estimated total PAH” in the Florida shrimp may be five to 10 times higher than the actual amount present because of “interferences” in the fluorescence tests.\n\nAs to why the Florida shrimp tested so much higher than other states, Kraemer said, “we don’t have a good explanation.”\n\nAsked if the agency would test the shrimp further, Kraemer said, “the answer is no.”\n\nAll of the FDA’s samples were caught off Pensacola, an area that received large amounts of oil during the spill.\n\nOfficials in Florida said they had tested shrimp collected from seafood dealers in Panama City and Apalachicola and found no contamination. The officials said that they did not know where those shrimp were caught, and have not tested any shrimp from Pensacola seafood dealers.\n\nFish from a Pensacola-area seafood dealer tested by the state were free of contaminants, officials said.\n\nFlorida officials dismissed the FDA shrimp results because they were done with the fluorescence technique.\n\nThe NOAA paper on seafood safety after oil spills also dismisses the fluorescence method, stating, that since it “does not quantify individual aromatic compounds, the results cannot be used to assess risk to human health from consumption of contaminated seafood.”\n\nKraemer said the agency tested the fluorescence method side by side with gas chromatography and found the results were similar.\n\nThe agency declined to release the results of that comparison testing or the full lab reports from the reopening tests to the Press-Register without a Freedom of Information Act request.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2468","id":"264"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.216915,30.421309]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2469","title":"Two oiled pelicans found on Breton Island","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/09 16:48:01 -0400","original":"Thu Sep 09 16:48:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/09 16:48:00 -0400"},"description":"Two oiled pelicans were caught alive today on Breton Island.

An investigative team from Greenpeace also walked the beaches to see how the barrier island is faring in the wake of the Gulf oil disaster. And they have a very different assessment of how the cleanup is progressing.\n\nScience Coordinator Adam Walters and Senior Oceans Campaigner Phil Kline dug small holes in the sand and discovered layers of oiled sand less than a foot below the surface. They also found tar balls at various stages of weathering and various sizes on both the leeward and windward sides of the islands. \n\n\"BP keeps telling us that the oil has been cleaned up,\" Kline said. \"This is outrageous.  Horn Island is a habitat for birds and turtles, and BP will not be able to attempt a cleanup without risking irreparable damage to those habitats.  The oil and dispersants, plus new invasive clean up methods using bulldozers will put this sensitive ecosystem over the edge.\"\n\nThose \"invasive clean up methods\" were painted in a much different light by BP's Chief Operating Officer Mike Utsler.\n\n\"We've been able to modify that technology into its use in helping us fight this challenge of picking up these small tar balls that you've had an opportunity to see in a few places,\" Utsler told WLOX News.\n\nDr. Bill Walker, the director of the Department of Marine Resources, was impressed with the island's recovery thus far.\n\n\"I would say, if nothing else is done, the island would recover,\" Walker said.  \"What you're seeing out here is weathered oil that's going to continue to weather and go away like the typical tar balls that wash up here all the time.\" \n\nGreenpeace Science Coordinator Adam Walters disagrees with that optimistic assessment.  \n\n \"Much of the oil from this disaster will never be cleaned up,\" Walters said. \"What we see on the Gulf coast beaches is what made it to shore.  Vast amounts of the oil released into the Gulf will never reach the coast and will never be cleaned up. Instead, mixed, dissolved and dispersed into the water this oil it causing as yet unquantified and potentially highly significant effects on the Gulf's aquatic ecosystem.\"\n\nThe investigative work at Horn Island is part of a three month long Gulf impacts expedition. The Arctic Sunrise is acting as a platform for independent scientists to study the impact of the oil and dispersants on various Gulf ecosystems.  Scientists during the month of August studied blue crab larvae, marine mammals and sponges.  \n\nIn September, two scientists will be on board, representing the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center.  The scientists, using already existing baseline data, will assess the impact of the oil spill sperm whale populations using acoustic buoys.  Additional scientists will join the expedition in September and October.\n\nThe Arctic Sunrise is a 50 meter long icebreaker purchased by Greenpeace in 1995. Since then, it has peacefully protested whaling in the Southern Ocean and documented the impacts of climate change at the poles.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2476","id":"272"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.650664,30.229936]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2477","title":"Oil cleanup continues on Mississippi barrier islands","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/10 04:24:01 -0400","original":"Fri Sep 10 04:24:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/10 04:24:00 -0400"},"description":"BP and the federal Park Service have brought in some heavy machinery to remove Gulf oil spill debris from Mississippi's barrier islands before shifting winter tides bury it too deep.\ngulf-islands-national-seashore.JPGAssociated Press archiveOn Aug. 24, Oceana's senior vice president for North America and chief scientist, MIchael Hirshfield, center, talks with actors Morgan Freeman, left, and Ted Danson as they tour West Ship Island of the Gulf Island National Seashore in Mississippi. Oceana is an international organization focused solely on ocean conservation.\n\nGulf Islands National Seashore superintendent Dan Brown said people using small sifters and hand shovels continue to work on the islands. The cleanup comes after a ruptured BP well spewed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico for several weeks before workers capped the well in July.\n3\n0\n17Share\n\n\"We're all keeping our fingers crossed that we won't have any hurricanes this year,\" Brown said.\n\nThe sand-sifting devices pulled by tractors started operating on the barrier islands in Mississippi after successful tests about two weeks ago, Brown said. Island cleanup had been limited to small crews using hand tools in an effort to tread lightly around nesting sites of shorebirds, some of which are threatened or endangered.\n\nBrown said tons of oil debris has been picked up using the crews but the Park Service realized that it was becoming necessary to remove surface oil as soon as possible.\n\n\"Preservation of the wilderness character of Horn and Petit Bois is of the utmost importance,\" Brown said. \"However, we only have a narrow window of opportunity in which to respond before the oil becomes too far embedded in the substrate to reach via mechanical means.\n\n\"These are tough choices that have to be made to ensure the islands' natural processes are allowed to continue unimpeded.\"\n\nBrown said the park had to get special permission to use the German-made Beach Techs, which weigh about 4,000 pounds each, on the fragile islands.\n\n\"It took quite a bit to get to this point, because Petit Bois and Horn islands are designated wilderness areas and, by law, you're not allowed to use vehicles and mechanized equipment in those areas,\" Brown said.\n\nBy the end of the Labor Day weekend, five machines were operating on Horn, said Greg Knox, public information officer for BP in Mississippi, which is working with the Park Service on the effort.\n\nKnox was not sure when any machines would start operating on Petit Bois.\n\nHe said that human observation combined with the machines should keep wildlife casualties to a minimum.\n\nBrown said the machines are able to cover much more ground.\n\n\"At best, crews were maybe covering a tenth of a mile a day,\" Brown said.\n\nThe sifters are able to cover at least several times that, he said.\n\nThe machines are most productive at night, when temperatures drop and the debris is less gooey, Brown said.\n\nThe Beach Techs flip sand into a screen where tarballs and debris are trapped and sand filters back onto the beach. They've also been operating in Florida for several weeks.\n\nBrown said the accelerated island cleanup efforts should continue at least for the next several months before the stormy winter season cranks up sometime in November.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2477","id":"273"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.437965,30.198737]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2478","title":"Researchers found oil and \"marine snow\" on the seafloor causing significant harm to marine organisms","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/10 04:27:01 -0400","original":"Fri Sep 10 04:27:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/10 04:27:00 -0400"},"description":"Biogeochemist Samantha Joye, from the University of Georgia in Athens, and her colleagues have found a layer of oilburied about three centimetres deep in a canyon some 30 kilometres from the wellhead.

BP and the government would like us to believe that the problem is gone, the oil dispersed or evaporated, and the beaches clean.  Oil beneath the surface of the ocean is no less damaging than oil on the shore.  Even in small concentrations it can be harmful, and with the amount that is likely in the Gulf, I imagine there will be dramatic effects on many of the marine life populations: the delicate plankton, the whales, the fish, the sensitive deep sea corals and sponges.   \n\nToday, I saw Horn Island, off the coast of Mississippi, covered in tarballs, a painful, visual reminder that this devastating catastrophe isn't over.  Just as we had seen in the early weeks of the spill, this island showed all the signs of a delicate habitat at substantial risk.  We saw a turtle nest just a few feet away from tarballs; we dug in the sand a few feet and found layers of black sand beneath the surface.  It was clear that this small island would be changed forever.  Even though most of the oil has never even made landfall and we're just seeing the tiniest percent of the problem, still we see the absolute futility of our attempts to mitigate the effects of the spill.  It is enormous, out of control, and impossible to clean up, and it is outrageous that we are being told that the problem is solved.It makes me angry that the clean up efforts are so bad that the tarballs beside a turtles nest have not yet been cleaned, but I don't know what the answer is in terms of recovering these islands.  The laborious process of land cleanup likely won't be fast enough to spare the wildlife that call these islands their home.   \n\nWhat can we do but witness the destruction?

We were primarily in search of whale sharks to report on their current status and to possibly tag them for future monitoring.\n\nThe trip was both very troubling and incredibly uplifting in regard to the marine life we saw.\n\nFirst of all, I was thrilled to be going on this trip, hoping to see some signs of life…some signs that the Gulf was starting down its long road to recovery. According to pilot Bonny Schumaker: “The search grid was about 75 NM wide (roughly west to east) and 25 NM tall, with the western sector overlapping the Macondo rig.”\n\nPilot Schumaker: “No whale sharks were seen in the western sector…. We also did run across a lot of white foamy substance never seen before and that none of us could identify from the air.”Unfortunately, much of the day flying back and forth over the grid (roughly centered at Latitude 29.16228, Longitude -88.05911), we saw VERY little life. Sadly, that was not unexpected, as this is the area severely impacted by the spill. The “kill zone” may remain lifeless for quite some time.\n\nThe second half of the day, further east, was an entirely different story.We sighted sperm whales, whale sharks, huge schools of tuna and bonita as well as sea turtles. It was a huge relief to see signs of life in the Gulf after the devastating conditions we’ve been confronted with during the past few months.Again, this tour was extremely emotional. It was fantastic to see vibrant marine life toward the end of the day – but the nearly lifeless waters we observed from Mississippi to Louisiana continue to concern me greatly.\n\nI’ll be back soon with more visual updates.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2482","id":"277"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.05911,29.16228]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2484","title":"Permanent Dulac resident reports livelihood threatened","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/14 00:21:01 -0400","original":"Tue Sep 14 00:21:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/14 00:21:00 -0400"},"description":"Shrimp processor reports receiving less work since the oil spill.

(Photo: Don Tillman)\n\nShirley and Don Tillman, residents of Pass Christian, Mississippi, have owned shrimp boats, an oyster boat and many pleasure boats. They spent much time on the Gulf of Mexico before working in BP’s Vessels Of Opportunity (VOO) program looking for and trying to clean up oil.\n\nDon decided to work in the VOO program in order to assist his brother, who was unable to do so due to health problems. Thus, Don worked on the boat and Shirley decided to join him as a deckhand most of the days.\n\n“We love the Gulf, our life is here and so when this oil disaster happened, we wanted to do what we could to help clean it up,” Shirley explained to Truthout.\n\nHowever, not long after they began working in BP’s response effort in June, what they saw disturbed them. “It didn’t take long for us to understand that something was very, very wrong about this whole thing,” Shirley told Truthout. “So that’s when I started keeping a diary of what we experienced and began taking a lot of pictures. We had to speak up about what we know is being done to our Gulf.”\n\nShirley logged what they saw and took hundreds of photos. The Tillmans confirm, both with what they logged in writing as well as in photos, what Truthout has reported before: BP has hired out-of-state contractors to use unregistered boats, usually of the Carolina Skiff variety, to spray toxic Corexit dispersants on oil located by VOO workers.\n\nShirley provided Truthout with key excerpts from the diary she kept of her experiences out on the water with her husband while they worked in the VOO program before they, like most of the other VOO workers in Mississippi, were laid off because the state of Mississippi, along with the US Coast Guard, has declared there is no more “recoverable oil” in their area.\n\n“The first day I went, I noticed a lot of foam on the water,” reads her entry from June 26. “My husband said he had been seeing a lot of it. At that time, we were just looking for ‘Oil.’ We would go out in groups of normally, five boats. The Coast Guard was over the VOO operation. There was always a Coast Guard on at least one of the boats. They would tell us when to leave the harbor, where to go and how fast to go. They had flags on each of the VOO boats and also a transponder. Sometimes we would have one or more National Guardsmen in our group too, as well as an occasional safety man to monitor the air quality and procedures on the boat. If we found anything, the Coast Guard in our group would call it in to ‘Seahorse’ and they would determine what action would be taken.”\n\nAlong with giving a clear description of how the Coast Guard was thus always aware of the findings of the VOO workers, her diary provides, at times, heart-wrenching descriptions of what is happening to the marine life and wildlife of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n“Before we went to work, I went down by the beach,” reads her entry from July 4. “There were dead jellyfish everywhere. Some of them were surrounded by foam. A seagull was by the waters edge, as the foamy stuff continued to wash up. There was also a crane that appeared to be sick. It didn’t look like it had any oil on it, but it just stood there, no matter how close I got.”\n\nOn the morning of August 5, Shirley describes spotting a dead young dolphin floating in the water. “As we waited for the VOO Wildlife boat to come pick it up, we noticed a pod of dolphins close by,” she writes. “Even with all the boats around, they did not leave until the dead one was removed from the water. It was very emotional, for all of us.”\n\nIt’s a crucial time to fight ignorance - help Truthout get the word out by donating here.\n\nThe next day, August 6, found her logging more death. “Last night on the news, they reported a fish kill. Before we went to work, I went to the beach by the harbor. The seagulls were everywhere. As for the dead fish, the only ones on the beach, were ones that the tide had left when it went back out. The rest of the ‘Fish Kill,’ was laying underwater, on the bottom. It was mainly flounder and crab. We only spotted two dead flounder floating that day. I can only imagine how many were on the bottom … I went back to the beach after work. The tide had gone out and the seagulls were eating all the dead fish that had been exposed. You could still see dead fish underwater, still on the bottom. Dead fish don’t float anymore?”\n\nThe Tillman’s primary concern is the rampant use of toxic dispersants by what they described as private contractors working in unregistered boats, that regularly were going out into the Gulf as they and other VOO teams were coming in from their days’ work. There was, oftentimes, so much dispersant on top of the water, their boat left a trail.\n\n“The first thing I noticed, was the ‘trail’ the boat was leaving in the water,” her log from July 10 reads. “You could see exactly where we had been, as far back as you could see. Around 11:00, we were in oil sheen and brownish clumps. We were North of Cat and Ship Island when the Coast Guard told us to drop the boom over. When you pick the boom up, you have to wear ‘protective gear.’”\n\nHer log from August 1 describes, in detail, an incident of the Coast Guard not allowing them to collect oil and his proceeding to deny what they found was even oil:\n\n    “Around 2:00 p.m., we started noticing a lot of oil sheen. We were North of the East end of Cat Island, but South of the Inter Coastal channel. There was, as usual, a Coast Guard on one of the boats in our team. He called in to report it, but we were told not to drop the boom, it was just ‘Fish Oil.’ In the beginning of the clean-up operation, if something was floating on the water and it looked like oil, it was oil or oil sheen. Later they would sometimes say it was just ‘Fish Oil.’ Also, if it was heavy foam with a brown or rust color, originally it was ‘Oil Mousse.’ Later it was called ‘Algae.’ We were then told to head Northwest. The further we went, the worse the ‘Fish Oil’ got. Then, the foam was mixed in with the oil. It was at least the size of a football field, around our boat alone. My husband got on the radio and asked if they could put the boom over.” The Coast Guard, again, told them no. “We were then headed West, back towards Pass Christian. A pleasure boat flagged one of the boats in our group down and told him that there was oil all over. The Coast Guard said to tell him that they were aware of the situation … On the way back to the Pass Harbor, I asked my husband, ‘Just exactly what are we even doing out here?’ He told me that he was beginning to think that it was all just for show. I can only imagine what the people on the pleasure boat had to say when they got back home that day. Probably, that they had seen a lot of oil on the water and the VOO boats were out there just riding around in it and not doing anything to clean it up. That is exactly what happened. We decided then to start documenting as much as we could. I believe it was the very next day, Thad Allen was on TV saying that they were scaling operations back due to the fact that, ‘No oil has been seen in the Gulf in almost two weeks.’ Now, if we had pulled boom on Sunday and unloaded a bunch of dirty boom in the Pass harbor, it might have been a problem for him later.”\n\nDispersant remnant.

We went to the West of the Pass Harbor. The water looked black in places. Lots of bubbles, not foam, just bubbles. Around 8:30, we were in oil sheen and mousse and were told to drop the boom. The more we pulled the boom, it appeared the more was coming up. The Pass [Christian] Harbor was closed because the oil was coming in so bad. We pulled boom back and forth the rest of the afternoon.”\n\nOiled Boom. August 5, 2010.\n\nOiled boom, August 5, 2010. (Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nOil sheen and dispersant remnant.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nBy early August, the total number of VOO boats operating out of Pass Christian Harbor, where Shirley and Don worked, was down to 26.\n\nOn August 8, Shirley wrote, “talk at the harbor was that airplanes were spraying dispersants on the water at night, out by the islands. There was also talk of skiffs, from Louisiana, with white tanks on them, that were spraying [dispersants] too. We had seen the skiffs before. They would pass us up in the mornings and head towards the Bay St. Louis Bridge. We were told that they were working out of an area at Henderson Point. Henderson Point has a county-owned area with a boat launch &amp; piers. It was closed to the public after the oil spill and a BP sub-contractor staging area was set up. It always appeared that these boats were finishing up their work day, just as we were going to start ours. Most of these skiffs were Carolina Skiffs.”\n\nLater that same morning, Shirley and her husband headed out of the harbor with a member of the National Guard on their boat, heading west, while a member of the Coast Guard and another member of the National Guard were on another boat in their VOO team. After boating for an hour, they turned back to the east, at which point Don spotted five of the Carolina Skiffs.\n\n“I got my camera and started taking pictures of them,” Shirley writes. “As I was zooming in as close as I could, I saw one of them spraying something onto the water. I did not get a picture of it, I was too busy telling my husband to tell the Coast Guard on the other boat. The skiffs had turned North and were scattered out, zigzagging South of the train bridge. The Coast Guard called the incident in and sent one of our boats to follow the skiffs. The skiffs immediately left. When I saw the boat spraying, it was upwind from our boat. Within a few minutes, my nose started drying out. Later my throat and eyes did the same thing. A Coast Guard helicopter was dispatched along with a Coast Guard boat. We saw the helicopter about twenty minutes later, but I never saw the Coast Guard boat.”\n\nBack at Pass Christian Harbor, her team reported the Carolina Skiffs actively spraying dispersants. She was told by the contracting company, Parson’s, that managed their VOO team, to bring in her photographs.\n\nHer entry from the next day, August 9, reads:\n\n    “I took the pictures, 8×10’s to Parson’s. A short time later, my husband called and said the Coast Guard wanted me to make a disc of the pictures. I took the disc and turned it over to the Coast Guard. I was told, in the presence of others, that the incident had been investigated and the boats in question had been located at the Henderson Point site. He said that these boats were in the VOO program as skimmer boats, but it had not yet been verified. He said that he had questioned them about spraying something on the water. They told him that if I had seen them spraying anything, they were probably just rinsing out their tanks. He also asked me, ‘Don’t you think if they were spraying dispersants, they would be wearing respirators?’ I told him, ‘You would think so, but nothing surprises me around here anymore.’ We basically left after that. I knew all they had really wanted was to see exactly what I had gotten pictures of. There is of course the question, ‘Why would a skimmer boat need to rinse out his tanks?’ If he had been skimming oil, why dump it back over? If he hadn’t been skimming oil, what was he rinsing out? I know what I saw and I know how I felt afterwards. I also know that in one of the pictures I took, you can see a helicopter over those boats. BP has spotters looking for oil. Could it be he was telling them where to ‘Touch Up’ before they called it a day? One thing I did learn from Coast Guard guy that day, evidently these so-called skimmer boats, also have the ability to spray!”\n\nThe Tillman’s curiosity drove them to investigate further, given the inconsistencies they were seeing in the Coast Guard’s actions regarding the dispersant being sprayed from contractors in the Carolina Skiffs.\n\n“My husband came home and said that they had seen the ‘Skiffs’ again today,” reads Shirley’s entry from August 10. “He took pictures of them and a jack-up-rig. The rig moves around in the sound and is suppose to be a de-contamination station. However, some Captains have said when they went there, they were told it wasn’t in operation at the time. After thinking about the tank skiffs and the Coast Guard for two days, I could not make any sense of this whole situation. The Coast Guard is supposedly over the VOO Program, but it knows nothing about the skiffs at the site, so close to the Pass Harbor. They not only tell us every move to make, but they are always with us when we make the moves. Our boats are flagged and have transponders on them. Those boats have no flags, we have not seen a transponder, nor a Coast Guard member on one of them telling them what to do.”\n\nThat afternoon, the Tillmans visited the Henderson Point staging area. Though it was guarded, what they found shocked them:\n\n    “There were probably more boats there than in the entire Pass [Christian] VOO program at the time,” reads her entry. “There were only a couple of regular skimmer boats. All appeared to have Louisiana registrations. Almost all of the skiffs had the white tanks on them. A few of the tanks looked like they could have had something in them at one time, but nothing like the oily, sticky mess we had been dealing with. If we got something on our boat, it was almost impossible to get it off. I don’t see how they could have gotten it out of the tanks and still looked like they did. Also, there was a Harrison County Sheriffs Department car, right by the boats and some large, plastic, white containers with yellow bases.”\n\nCorner of Canal Road and I-10, in Gulfport, Mississippi, at the Gulfport site used as a BP staging area.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nOn August 13, the VOO boat that Shirley and Don were running was deactivated. Still very concerned, the next day they visited the BP staging area in Hancock County.\n\n“They had evacuated this site,” she writes. “Same setup though, a guard and a Sheriff’s car. We then went to a site in Gulfport. Evidently, this is a main BP storage site. There were all kinds of boats, including the tank skiffs. The Sheriffs Department was there also and so was those large, plastic tanks with the yellow bases.”\n\nOther reports, of a very similar nature, have been reported about other BP staging areas along the Gulf of Mexico. The tanks are clearly used to store and transport Corexit dispersant. The Carolina Skiffs are clearly used to spray it atop oil.\n\nCorner of Canal Road and I-10, in Gulfport, at the Gulfport site used as a BP staging area. Corexit Tanks.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nHer August 16 entry details her discovery:\n\n    “Over the next few days, I continued to go by the Henderson Point site and the Gulfport site. The Henderson Point site brought back a few boats, but none of the tank skiffs or the large plastic tanks. The Gulfport site stayed the same, full of everything. On August 25, I received an email with a link to an article about dispersants. It had a picture of the tanks that dispersants come in, with the label ‘Nalco Corexit EC9005A.’ They were 330 gallon, large, plastic, white tanks with a yellow base. These were the same tanks that I had been seeing at the Henderson Point site and the Gulfport site. I was able to get the name of the manufacturer of the tanks, off a picture I took and compared it to the picture in the article. It was the same manufacturer. I researched this company on the internet and found the 330 gal tanks. They are marketed as: ‘The only manufacturer in the industry to offer portable tanks certified for hazardous goods transport by the United Nations and the U.S. Department of Transportation.’”\n\nDead founder amongst fish kill.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nShirley and Don are, like tens of thousands of other VOO workers and Gulf residents, left with more questions than answers.\n\n“While working on the boats, if you pull boom back onto the boat, you not only had to wear Tyvek suits, protective glasses and gloves, you also had to put tape around the gloves and suit sleeves, as well as around your boots and the suit.” Shirley asks, “Why would it be safe for people to get into the same water that all of this hazardous stuff was coming out of?”\n\nFor the Coast Guard, she aks:\n\n    “How can you not know there are boats in the VOO program if you are in charge of the VOO program? The Coast Guard was supposedly over the VOO program, but they acted like they don’t know anything about the Carolina Skiffs. The boats were in either a task force or strike force. Every VOO boat has a flag. We all had transponders. This was VOO and Coast Guard regulations. But these skiffs didn’t have flags and we never saw transponders on them, nor did they have Coast Guard with them and supposedly every group had at least one Coast Guard in each group. Sometimes we would have two. But the Skiffs didn’t have any.”\n\nLocal media in Pass Christian and Gulfport, Mississippi, are now reporting that BP hopes to have the VOO program in that area completed by September 19.\n\nShirley is incredulous. “Why would anyone bring their children here and put them in water that has had millions of gallons of toxic chemicals dumped into it, not counting the oil itself?” she asks. “Why would you want to eat seafood that has been living and dying in the water, with all those contaminates?”\n\nTruthout has earlier reported on other fisherman in the area, James “Catfish” Miller and Mark Stewart, who have reported being eyewitnesses to the contractors in the Carolina Skiffs spraying dispersant as well.\n\nMeanwhile, local, state and federal authorities continue to claim that dispersant was only used south of Mississippi’s barrier islands and that the Carolina Skiffs and the large tanks they carry are only used to “skim” oil.\n\n“If dispersants were only being sprayed South of the islands, why would these 330 gallon hazardous goods tanks be located at two different work sites, right by the tank skiffs?” Shirley asks. “Why would the skiffs tanks be so clean if they were really skimming oil?”\n\nThe Tillmans and thousands of other fishermen and residents along the Gulf of Mexico are deeply concerned about local, state and federal government complicity in what they see as a massive cover-up of the oil disaster by using toxic dispersants to sink any and all oil that is located.\n\nDr. Riki Ott, a toxicologist and marine biologist, is a survivor of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska. She recently submitted an open letter\nto the US Environmental Protection Agency expressing many of these same concerns.\n\nOngoing government denials of this problem neither fool nor dissuade Shirley. “I know what I have seen,” she told Truthout. “I know what I have been told. I know what I have experienced. I know what I have documented. I also know that I have taken hundreds of pictures to verify what I am saying.”","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2624","id":"282"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.286989,30.308808]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2625","title":"New wave of oil coating 16 miles of beaches in Plaquemines Parish","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/14 16:34:01 -0400","original":"Tue Sep 14 16:34:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/14 16:34:00 -0400"},"description":"A new wave of black oil suddenly came ashore west of the Mississippi River on Friday and Saturday, coating beaches and fouling interior marshes, according to anglers' reports.

The water samples our research team took on August 10, 2010 from Mississippi Sound contain dispersant-related chemicals from the Gulf’s surface.\n\nThe samples contain the following toxic compounds: propylene glycol, 2-ethylhexanol, and di (propylene glycol) butyl ether in the seawater, all of which are markers for dispersant.\n\nOur team, headed by civil engineer Marco Kaltofen, has confirmed the presence of toxic Corexit 9500A in Mississippi Sound in August. The purpose of the experiments performed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute’s Water Quality Laboratory was to prove that we, indeed, found the chemical signature for Corexit use in Mississippi Sound. The experiments also confirmed which Corexit product had been detected. Using Gulf seawater, BP/Deepwater Horizon crude oil samples and Nalco Corexit products, we confirmed our earlier finding that Corexit 9500A dispersant was still present in Mississippi Sound in August.\n\nThese test results, obviously, have implications for the re-opening of federal waters to fishing and the safety of seafood coming out of the Gulf.\n\nSpiking Experiment Methodology\n\nTo confirm these results, four Gulf seawater samples were spiked with 100 parts per million volume to volume Corexit dispersants, in a 1:25 Corexit/BP crude oil mix. The four spiked samples were analyzed at the same certified laboratory as the field samples, and were found to contain propylene glycol, 2-ethylhexanol, 2 butoxy ethanol and di (propylene glycol) butyl ether.\n\nThe samples spiked with Corexit 9527A also contained 2 butoxy ethanol. The samples spiked with Corexit 9500A did not contain 2 butoxy ethanol.\n\nThe samples spiked with Corexit 9500A also contained di (propylene glycol) butyl ether. The samples spiked with Corexit 9527A did not contain di (propylene glycol) butyl ether.\n\nThe August 10 Mississippi Sound sample did not contain 2 butoxy ethanol, which is the expected result if the field sample contained Corexit 9500A, rather than Corexit 9527A.\n\nThe August 10 Mississippi Sound sample did contain di (propylene glycol) butyl ether, which is also the expected result if the field sample contained Corexit 9500A, rather than Corexit 9527A.\n\nThe results of this spiking experiment confirm that our team found Corexit 9500A in Mississippi Sound on August 10th.\n\n© Smith Stag, LLC 2010 – All Rights Reserved","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3101","id":"289"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.51668,30.266867]}},{"properties":{"title":"Confirmed Fish Kill on Grand Isle; “Overpowering Stench of Death and Decay” Coming From BP “Death Mounds”","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3102","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 04:41:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 08:40:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 04:40:00 -0400"},"description":"For the first time in a few weeks, I headed out to Grand Isle, Louisiana – primarily to document cleanup progress that has – or has not – been made since the spill response began.\n\nEarlier in the week, I received information regarding a possible fish kill around Grand Isle, which I confirmed to be true. My first stop was the west end of the island. Upon arrival, I did not see many dead fish, but while walking along the jetties, I was hit by an overpowering stench of death and decay. Back in May, I smelled this same scent and found a mound of buried bull redfish and dolphin, so I decided to go back to that same spot to check it out.\n\nWhen I was about 10 yards from a recognizable mound of sand, I started hearing the unmistakable buzz of flies.\n\nWhat I found was truly indescribable visually, I had never seen so many flies and the smell nearly brought me to my knees. There were at least 40 to 60 large redfish, drum – and who knows what else – under a BP “death mound” of sand in the exact same spot that I found the decapitated dolphin and bull redfish in May.I find it very disturbing that BP cleanup crews are simply burying large numbers of dead fish and other marine life without letting anybody know.There was also another death mound about 20 yards away closer to the beach at Latitude 29.199 N, Longitude 90.047 W. The media continues to consistently disregard or overlook these occurrences, reporting that everything is just fine in the Gulf. I know these reports are untrue, based on what I am finding six months after the spill.\n\nAdditionally, more evidence of land farming (or burying oil) on the west end of the island is seen in the images of the levee resembling the Grand Canyon rock strata, Latitude 29.195 N, Longitude 90.055 W.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3102","id":"290"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.042,29.199]}},{"properties":{"title":"Oil on Ocean Springs","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3103","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 04:48:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 08:47:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 04:47:00 -0400"},"description":"An absolute mess…\n\n    Sheen spots look a lot worse than they have in the past…\n\n    All these spots are just completely loaded with rainbow colored sheen…\n\n    Kind of speechless…","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3103","id":"291"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.754,30.389805]}},{"properties":{"title":"Healthy 16 y/o goes swimming, then hospitalized with \"compromised lung\" &amp; \"enlarged heart\"","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3104","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 04:53:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 08:52:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 04:52:00 -0400"},"description":"Healthy 16 year old hospitalized after swimming in Gulf Shores public beach.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3104","id":"292"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.700819,30.246036]}},{"properties":{"title":"Sulfur Dioxide over 200 ppb at Chalmette","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3105","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 22:00:00 -0400","original":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 01:00:00 GMT","granularity":"hour","time":"2010/10/25 21:00:00 -0400"},"description":"The LDEQ Chal_Vista air monitor at Bluebird neighborhood park had high sulfur dioxide readings Oct 25 2010 (add two hours to display time of \"Site Data\" for Chal_Vista at this link \n\nhttp://www.deq.louisiana.gov/portal/DIVISIONS/AirQualityAssessment/AmbientAirMonitoringProgram/AirMonitoringData.aspx   ) After 6pm the sulfur dioxide readings were well above the new health standard of 75 ppb, reaching over 200 ppb in the evening and remaining above the health standard the morning of Oct 26 2010.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3105","id":"293"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.97601,29.942552]}},{"properties":{"title":"dirt spill refinery","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3108","published":{"end_time":"1969/12/31 19:00:01 -0500","original":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 19:30:00 GMT","granularity":"usec","time":"1969/12/31 19:00:00 -0500"},"description":"gas/diesel smell\ndirt tracked from refinery through streets.\ncars driving through and tracking dirt back home","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3108","id":"294"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.780099,32.470976]}},{"properties":{"title":"FIre from Calumet","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3109","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 19:31:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 23:30:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 19:30:00 -0400"},"description":"bad odor\nheard roaring noise\nmade me feel congested","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3109","id":"295"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.780099,32.470976]}},{"properties":{"title":"Blood samples from 5 Gulf Coast residents show contamination by hydrocarbons","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3111","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/27 15:37:00 -0400","original":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 19:36:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/27 15:36:00 -0400"},"description":"The Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN) just released a report by Wilma Subra proving that local Gulf residents have been contaminated by oil.\n\nThe blood from eight individuals, 3 women and 5 men, tested positive for ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and hexanes.  Comparing the blood samples with regular, unexposed Americans1, the BP workers and community members had shockingly high levels of toxic chemicals in their bodies.   These chemicals have been shown to have deleterious health affects in these high amounts.\n\nBreathing high levels of ethylbenzene can causes dizziness and throat and eye irritation.   In animals studies, researchers found that exposure to relatively low concentrations of ethylbenzene caused permanent damage to the inner ear and hearing after only a few days to weeks of exposure and kidney damage after several months to years of exposure.  Newborn animals whose mothers were exposed during pregnancy had minor birth defects and low birth weights.  Further, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that ethylbenzene could cause cancer in human beings.2\n\nPeople exposed to m,p-Xylene may get headaches, lose muscle coordination, and become dizzy or confused.  For just short periods of exposure, people may experience \"irritation of the skin, eyes, nose, and throat; difficulty in breathing; problems with the lungs; delayed reaction time; memory difficulties; stomach discomfort; and possibly changes in the liver and kidneys.  Children may be more sensitive to acute inhalation exposure than adults because their narrower airways would be more sensitive to swelling effects.  Studies of unborn animals indicate that high concentrations of xylene may cause increased numbers of deaths, and delayed growth and development. In many instances, these same concentrations also cause damage to the mothers.\"3\n\nWorkers who breathed hexanes reported that their feet and hands went numb followed by muscle weakness in the lower legs. Continued exposure led to paralysis of the arms and legs. The workers recovered in 6 months to a year.  In laboratory studies, animals exposed to high levels of n-hexane in air had signs of nerve damage. Some animals also had lung damage. In other studies, rats exposed to very high levels of n-hexane had damage to sperm-forming cells.4\n\nEach of these chemicals is known to be present in BP’s spilled crude oil and each was found in the blood of all eight Gulf citizens that were tested.  For these people, all the short-term and long-term impacts of having high amounts of petroleum chemicals in their blood is not known.  How many other people are walking around with toxic compounds coursing in their blood is also currently unknown.  What we do know is that the BP Gulf Petro-Chemical Experiment is continuing.\n\n \n\nCasey DeMoss Roberts is the Assistant Director of Water Resources at the Gulf Restoration Network.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3111","id":"296"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.216915,30.421309]}},{"properties":{"title":"A message of solidarity","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3112","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/28 20:19:00 -0400","original":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 00:18:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/28 20:18:00 -0400"},"description":"We are with you.

Soto, medical doctor for the Younger You Institute in Santa Rosa Beach, recently started testing and treating patients in relation to high levels of volatile solvents in the blood stream that he says may be linked to BP's oil spill in the Gulf.\n\n\"What I am concerned most about is a long-term effect, that won’t even show up for years, but are going to have tremendous implications in human immune system and hormonal function and brain function,” Soto said.\n\nThese compounds (petroleum and dispersants) are liposoluble; meaning they have a “high affinity for fat,” Soto said.\n\nWhile the clinic specializes in \"anti-aging and aesthetic medicine,\" Soto points out that he is a medical doctor licensed in two states. He said the medical community has been monitoring the spill's impact but has failed to develop adequate treatment methods. \n\n“It is not the fat that you would think of, it is the fat tissue in your body; the brain is 70 percent fat and the glands, immune cells, the intestinal tract, thyroid, breast, prostate, the organs and systems. That is why it causes all of these disorders,” Soto said. “That is why it is so significant for children.\"\n\n\nTo read a related article, click here.\n\nChildren’s brains and reproductive organs and processes are still forming, which could potentially make their exposure to the petro chemicals even more significant.\n\nOkaloosa Island resident Joseph Yerkes says he recently tested positive for high levels of volatile solvents in his blood and is being treated for toxic exposure.\n\nHis longtime attending physician at the Immediate Care Center in Fort Walton Beach performed the test at Yerkes’ request, after he experienced multiple symptoms related to exposure of this type, such as tiredness, lethargy, headaches, blisters, non-healing sores on his elbows and head, as well as an aggravating cough and chronic body aches.\n\nYerkes was referred to a toxicologist following testing. The doctor gave him the sobering news.\n\n“He was very clear about his diagnosis, explaining how dangerous and damaging these chemicals can be to our bodies, and concluded all of my symptoms are due to the elevated, abnormal levels of chemicals present in my system from the Gulf oil spill,” the former Vessels of Opportunity operator, who was employed by BP, told The Sun in a recent e-mail.\n\nYerkes is among a growing number of people testing for high levels of volatile solvents in his blood, one watchdog group claims.\n\nAccording to Mississippi Riverkeeper of the Waterkeeper Alliance, blood samples from eight individuals from Florida (Pensacola) and Alabama, male and female, residents and BP cleanup workers “were analyzed for volatile solvents and all came back with Ethylbenzene and m,p-Xylene  in excess of 95th percentile values of 0.11 ppb for ethylbenzene and 0.34 ppb for m,p-Xylene.” The highest concentration value was four times the 95the percentile.\n\nThe report went on to say, “The blood of all three females and five males had chemicals that are found in the BP crude oil.”\n\nLocal emergency operation officials and health department personnel say they are unfamiliar with this testing.\n\nCapt. Joe Preston, chief for Walton County Emergency Management and Public Safety Division, said, “It falls under more of a public health purview but it is something that needs to be tracked closely.\"\n\nGail Allen, administrator for the Walton County Health Department, said “I have not heard of this (volatile solvents blood) testing.” \n\n“As far as air and water quality, testing, it hasn’t given any indication that it is necessary,” Allen said. “There are things in place to do long-term tracking (of BP workers), but it has not started” yet.\n\nA total of 119 water samples were taken in Walton County, which resulted in one “hit” on July 22 at Grayton Beach State Park. A hit refers to a positive indicator for oil product or dispersants.\n\nAccording to the Department of Environmental Protection website, 23 samples were taken and tested for dispersants between June 22 and Aug. 16, resulting with two “hits.”\n\nBoth “hits” were on Aug.16, one in Escambia/Santa Rosa counties and the other in Bay County, no samplings have been listed since.\n\nThe dispersant “hits” are followed by an asterisk which denotes, “trace amounts of DOSS, which is an ingredient of the Corexit dispersant and other common consumer products, such as paints, coatings and pharmaceutical products, were observed.\" It went on; \"dispersants were never used in state of Florida waters.”\n\nHealth officials such as Dr. Soto said the Exxon oil spill tragedy in Alaska showed it is important to \"provide healthcare\" for people exposed to the hazardous materials. \n\nPart of the treatment, for patients that test positive, will consist of an oral and an intravenous detoxification, said Soto.\n\n“The liver has the ability to detox these compounds efficiently until it gets overloaded or overwhelmed, then it is deposited into the fat cells,” Soto said. “The all natural intravenous agent will help detox through the stool and urine.”\n\nYerkes’ physician’s suggested treatment includes diet and his temporary relocation.\n\n“It’s very hard to accept the fact that I have to leave the Gulf of Mexico,” Yerkes said. “It deeply saddens me after living on or around it, making a living from it, and experiencing the serenity and contentedness it has always brought to me.”\n\n“I don’t know if they can ‘make this right’ anymore,” he added.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3168","id":"309"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04459,30.350783]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3297","title":"bad sulfur odors from Murphy Oil","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/07 22:31:00 -0500","original":"Mon, 08 Nov 2010 03:30:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/07 22:30:00 -0500"},"description":"bad sulfur odors around the Dollar Tree and DMV Office near Murphy Oil; stack emitting and roaring noise of steaming","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3297","id":"310"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.94554,29.937048]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3302","title":"Update / Swans and all kinda of seabirds paralyzed and dead","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/13 01:00:00 -0500","original":"Sat, 13 Nov 2010 05:59:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/13 00:59:00 -0500"},"description":"on Longboat Key Fl Published Sept 23. 173 ppm found in sand on Siesta Key.

Then on November 4 he passed out in the shower. Concerned by his uncontrollable nausea and bleeding in his esophagus, his wife took him to the emergency room.\n\n\"The doctor just told me I have acid reflux,\" Miller, who has been experiencing many of his symptoms since joining the VOO programme, said. \"They don't even know what this is. I told him I needed to be tested for toxic chemicals. I'm in a major hospital and they are telling me they don't know what this is.\"\n\nMiller's friend, Chris Balius, also a former VOO worker, was in a boat near Miller's on that same day out on the Gulf.\n\n\"I was hit by it too,\" Balius explained. \"Headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and now my eyesight is failing. When I was in the VOO programme, I had to let someone else run my boat after 30 days because I got so sick. Every time I go on the water I get sick, so I no longer go, and don't allow my family to go anymore.\"\n\nJoseph Yerkes, who lives on Okaloosa Island, Florida, was in BP's VOO programme for more than two months, during which time he was exposed to oil and dispersants on a regular basis.\n\n\"I worsened progressively,\" Yerkes said. \"Mid-September I caught a cold that worsened until I went to a doctor, who gave me two rounds of antibiotics for the pneumonia-like symptoms, and he did blood tests and found high levels of toxic substances in my blood that he told me came from the oil and dispersants.\"\n\nIncreasing numbers of people across the Gulf Coast are suffering from symptoms that doctors and toxicologists are linking to chemicals from the BP oil disaster that began last summer when the blowout of the Macondo well gushed at least 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf.\n\nBP responded by using at least 1.9 million gallons of toxic dispersant to sink the oil.\n\nWidespread toxic exposure\n\n\"The dispersants used in BP's draconian experiment contain solvents such as petroleum distillates and 2-butoxyethanol,\" Dr. Riki Ott, a toxicologist, marine biologist and Exxon Valdez survivor, said. \"People are being made sick in the Gulf because of the unprecedented release of oil and toxic chemicals from this past summer in response to BP's disaster.\"\n\nOtt is frank in her assessment of the ongoing health crisis residents are facing in the Gulf.\n\n\"It's clear to me there are four to five million people, from Terrebonne Parish in Louisiana, through the big bend of Florida, who are being exposed to dangerous levels of dangerous chemicals,\" she said.\n\n\"Oil and dispersants are in the air and water, that are at levels that exceeded the acute or intermediate threshold that federal agencies have declared to be safe. Just speaking of air exposure, and there are scientific papers on this, if you release one molecule of toluene, at three metres above the ground, into a six kilometre wind, that molecule, uninterrupted, will travel 34 kilometres.\"\n\nCharter plane pilots who have conducted Gulf over-flights have reported having to wipe an oily, orange film from their plane afterwards. Following this, the skin on their hands peeled off. \"The oil and dispersants are in the air and in the rain and are making people sick,\" Ott said. \"These Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are there, and at dangerous levels.\"\n\nPathways of exposure to the dispersants are inhalation, ingestion, skin and eye contact. Health impacts include headaches, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pains, chest pains, respiratory system damage, skin sensitisation, hypertension, central nervous system (CNS) depression, neurotoxic effects, cardiac arrhythmia and cardiovascular damage. The chemicals are also teratogenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic.\n\n\"People experiencing these symptoms, that is their body trying to tell them they are in a dangerous situation,\" explained Ott. \"Exposure to dispersants makes everything worse because they affect the CNS more. They act as an oil delivery system, bringing the oil deeper into the body.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist in Louisiana, tested the blood of eight BP cleanup workers and residents in Alabama and Florida. \"Ethylbenzene, m,p-Xylene and Hexane are volatile organic chemicals that are present in the BP crude oil,\" Subra said. \"The blood of all three females and five males had chemicals that are found in the BP crude oil. So the presence of these chemicals in the blood indicates exposure.\"\n\nThe BP workers and community members had shockingly high levels of toxic chemicals like Ethylbenzene and Hexanes in their bodies, with one 48-year-old male showing the highest concentrations.\n\n\"I'm that 48-year-old male,\" Gregg Hall, from Pensacola, Florida, said. \"I've been nauseas and had headaches, burning eyes and numb feet for months. The bays here are now toxic. It's all around us, yet the government keeps telling us everything is fine.\"\n\nAccording to Ott, doctors along the Gulf coast are treating the symptoms of the widespread exposure to BP's toxic chemicals with antibiotics.\n\n\"You can't take antibiotics and expect to get better,\" she explained. \"Environmental medicine is what these people need, but it is hard to find that in the Gulf, where the oil and petrochemical industry reign supreme and medical doctors there are reluctant to call a spade a spade.\"\n\nGetting treatment\n\nDr. William Rea is a thoratic and cardiovascular surgeon who specialises in the environmental aspects of health and disease. He founded the Environmental Health Center in Dallas, Texas in 1974 and has been treating people who have been exposed to toxic chemicals in crude oil and dispersants for years.\n\n\"We first try to eliminate people's symptoms, and that is organ specific,\" Rea explained at his clinic, which is one of the oldest and most advanced centres in the world for addressing health as it relates to the environment. \"We try to lower their toxic load by giving them intravenous nutrients, oral nutrients, sauna, and have them live in quarters that are less polluted, eat organic food and have them get safe drinking water.\"\n\nRea has treated many people from the Gulf that have been made sick by BP's toxic chemicals.\n\n\"I have multiple concerns now about people in the Gulf being affected by these chemicals,\" he said. \"First, they are all fatigued and not able to work. When your muscles are all fatigued and tired, it's hard to function. People are getting cloudy brains, others are having heart problems because of the chemicals. Others have broncho-spasm and asthma from this. Others bloat and get sleepy after eating, diarrhoea, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal problems.\"\n\nDonny and Angel Matsler, from Dauphin Island, Alabama, recently arrived at Rea's centre for treatment. Donny has been suffering symptoms he attributes to BP's toxic chemicals for months.\n\n\"I started to vomit brown, and my pee was brown also,\" Donny said. \"Sometimes I kept that up all day. Then I had a night of sweating and non-stop diarrhoea unlike anything I've ever experienced.\"\n\nDonny, a Vietnam veteran who had pre-existing health issues before the BP disaster began, believes his condition has worsened exponentially because of ongoing exposure to BP's chemicals as a result of living on the coast.\n\n\"We have many friends breaking out in rashes, having severe breathing problems and other symptoms,\" Angel explained.\n\n\"It would help if they had some doctors on the coast that knew about all of this, so they could do some preventive work and maybe head some of this off,\" Rea said of what he sees as a lack of expertise among doctors in the Gulf. \"And folks who are heavily affected, like Donny and Angel, you have to get them out of the area to treat them.\"\n\nLeaving the Gulf Coast\n\nLynn Ferguson lived in Palatka, Florida, with her husband Rod Norman until July, when they decided to move to Montana after suffering symptoms they attribute to the BP oil disaster.\n\n\"I lost my voice in June and my breathing got much worse,\" said Ferguson. \"I was having heart palpitations, coughing, painful lungs, shortness of breath, lethargy, and it all kept worsening. Rod flew to Montana in June and was there 10 days, and had immediate relief. But when he came back to Florida he got sick again.\"\n\nFerguson said that after learning that her symptoms were being reported by others across the Gulf, \"I took money out of my retirement and we moved to Butte, Montana. My breathing is much better and 90 per cent of my voice has come back\".\n\n\"Sinus infections, ear infections, chest congestion, burning eyes, I kept going to the doctor for these, and he put me on all kinds of antibiotics and it didn't clear anything up,\" Norman said. \"He kept trying different antibiotics but it never really worked. I got well as soon as I got out of the state.\"\n\nYerkes, the former VOO worker, said that his doctor, a general physician with a background in toxicology, instructed him to begin a nutritional detoxification programme in order to \"lower the levels of pollution in the blood\". The doctor also told Yerkes to move away from the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"He was very clear about his diagnosis, explaining how dangerous and damaging these chemicals can be to our bodies, and concluded that all of my symptoms are due to the elevated, abnormal levels of chemicals present in my system from the Gulf oil spill,\" Yerkes said. \"The doctor who did my blood work said that the results showed that I have oil in my blood. I have the solvents in my bloodstream.\"\n\nYerkes is looking for somewhere to move to as he continues his detoxification programme at his home in Florida.\n\n\"Every morning I wake up with nausea, I have blurred vision, a low grade fever comes and goes, and now I'm having anxiety attacks, which I've never experienced before,\" he said. \"I'm having symptoms unlike anything I've ever experienced, and some of them scare me to death.\"\n\nYerkes is struggling with the prospect of leaving the Gulf Coast, even though he feels that it is the only way he can regain his health.\n\n\"It deeply saddens me after living on or around the Gulf my whole life, making a living from it, and experiencing the serenity and contentedness it has always brought to me,\" he said.\n\n\"But now I have to leave and start my life over. I know I am not the only one, and there are many much worse off than me, and I pray for everyone on the Gulf Coast to be oil and dispersant free. Nobody deserves this poisoning of our bodies, it is hell feeling like you're being destroyed from the inside out from exposure every day.\"","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3357","id":"317"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.885308,30.396032]}},{"properties":{"title":"Dead Whales","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3358","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/15 18:09:00 -0500","original":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 23:08:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/15 18:08:00 -0500"},"description":"Reports from a Grand Isle citizen claim that Fish and Wildlife dept have found two dead whales in Grand Isle","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3358","id":"318"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.987294,29.236617]}},{"properties":{"title":"Rainy and stinky near Chalmette Refinery","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3395","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/15 17:45:00 -0500","original":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 22:44:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/15 17:44:00 -0500"},"description":"Its rainin hard n st. bernard and it stinks by the chalmette refinery!","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3395","id":"319"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.938873,29.934243]}},{"properties":{"title":"Smog in New Orleans makes me feel sick!","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3396","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/20 00:38:00 -0500","original":"Sat, 20 Nov 2010 05:37:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/20 00:37:00 -0500"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGlue and metal smell, heavy clouds eyes burning french quarter canal st\n\n--\nSent using SMS-to-email.

SCAT is designed to make valid assessments of damage caused by the spill and inform BP of what restitution is needed, thereby avoiding conflict of interest by removing the petroleum giant from the decision making loop.\n\nPolaris employees patrol beaches and take samples in areas that may be affected by the oil. They report oil to the operations arm of SCAT and make recommendations about how contaminates can best be removed from the environment.\n\n“We are looking for oil every day. There’s no doubt there will be more oil,” said Maddox.\n\nLt. Anthony Romero described the Coast Guard’s efforts to monitor the spread of petroleum in the Gulf of Mexico, stressing that the county’s waters are clean.\n\nRomero said only 400 pounds of product (petroleum and related chemicals from the spill) had been found in Franklin and Gulf counties combined, compared to 1,200 pounds per day in Pensacola at the height of the leak.\n\nBoudreau said that, after an oil spill or hazardous substance release, response agencies like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the, Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), collaborate to clean up the substance and eliminate or reduce risks to human health and the environment through the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) process. Cooperators conduct studies to identify the extent of resource injuries, best methods for restoring those resources, and the type and amount of restoration required.\n\nThe first public NRDA meeting relating to Deepwater Horizon, will be held Nov. 30 at the Okaloosa County Convention Center, with others to be held throughout the affected region.\n\nBoudreau said the NRDA team is fine cleaning affected beaches. Their goal is to have the shoreline in pre-spill condition by Mardi Gras, March 8, to the west and by spring break to the east. He said various agencies monitoring the spill’s aftermath have taken thousands of samples of water and seafood.\n\nThe NRDA team believes that only about half of the leaked petroleum made landfall. The rest dispersed into the water column or sank to the floor of the Gulf. So far, none of the monitoring entities has found evidence of a subsurface oil plume, and populations of organisms known to feed on petroleum have soared.\n\nBoudreau said monitoring will continue indefinitely and that BP has pledged $20 million to Florida for monitoring the Gulf and marketing seafood over the next three years.\n\nHe said of 380 subsurface samples collected by DEP along Florida’s shores, only 19 were contaminated and none exceeded public health allowances. None of the 21 samples taken off Franklin County was contaminated. Only two samples, both collected off Escambia County, contained dispersant.\n\nTaunya James, president of the Franklin County Seafood Workers’ Association (FCSWA), repeatedly insisted dispersant was being applied to the bay daily by helicopters described as black or camouflage in color. She and other seafood workers claimed to be aware of serious local contamination.\n\nBoudreau asked if anyone who witnessed the application of dispersant could provide an aircraft identification number or had taken pictures.\n\n“We’re out there to work, not take pictures,” replied James.\n\nAnother seafood worker said that, for the first time in his experience, the oysters did not spawn this year.\n\nDr. John Fruin, chief of FDAC’s Bureau of Food and Meat Inspection, said 200 samples of seafood are being tested for contamination and of 175 already completed, only a handful showed any contamination and that the level was “hundreds of times” below the level of concern.\n\nHe said NOAA and the US Food and Drug Administration have taken 1700 samples of seafood in Florida, most in the Panhandle and only 13 showed contamination with dispersant. Once again the amount contained was well below the level of concern.\n\n“We are using the best science available,” he said.\n\nJames said FCSWA had samples tested privately that showed the product was tainted.\n\nApalachicola resident Benjamin Owens displayed pictures which he said showed petroleum contamination in the bay. Romero examined them and said he believed they showed an algal bloom.\n\nRomero asked if anyone could take him to a contaminated area, and James and several others said they could do so. Romero said he would spend the night if they would take him in the morning, and James and her husband met with him after the meeting.\n\nIn a telephone interview the next day, Romero said James took his cell phone number and told him her husband’s boat was in the shop but she could find another one. He said he spent the night in Apalachicola specifically to view the contamination with James but she never contacted him the next day.\n\nIn a telephone interview, James said she was not aware Romero had spent the night in the county.\n\nBoudreau, Romero and Fruin all urged anyone with evidence of contamination to call (800) 320-0519, the state hotline, to report oil.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3398","id":"322"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.002554,29.671814]}},{"properties":{"title":"dead dolphin","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3399","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/23 22:31:00 -0500","original":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 03:30:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/23 22:30:00 -0500"},"description":"It was reported that there was a dead dolphin lying on the harbor bank in Belle Chase this morning.

The Anthracene levels were double what the FDA finds to be acceptable.\n\nThe scientist who tested the shrimp said she would not eat it based on the results, and the results may surprise consumers and shrimpers.\n\n\"There has been a lot of monitoring going on,\" said Sal Versaggi, Southern Shrimp Alliance President.\n\nSeafood sellers have depended on government monitoring to keep consumers safe, but based on our results it appears more testing needs to be done.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3402","id":"326"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.251883,28.484499]}},{"properties":{"title":"Sulfur Dioxide readings in Chalmette over new health standard","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3403","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/24 18:43:00 -0500","original":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 23:42:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/24 18:42:00 -0500"},"description":"Sulfur Dioxide spikes in Chalmette, LA over the new health sulfur dioxide standard of 75 ppb for a one hour reading.\n\nCH_Vista monitoring station readings are accessible on the La DEQ website right hand menu under ON AIR Current AQI menu.

Ultraviolet lighting causes the more toxic and persistent components of oil to flouresce, or shine, a bright yellow or orange color. What better way to document contamination from the spill?Toxin illuminations are clearly visible in the night photos of the walls of small trenches we dug. These images were taken in the Long Beach-Gulfport area (Latitude 30,21.1459N, Longitude 89,7.737W). The importance of these photos is that they show that even when oil isn’t visible, there are still toxins present. And the fact that this toxic material is lingering just below the surface should help guide cleanup crews and sampling efforts.We wanted to document as much contamination as possible during our whirlwind tour, so we had to figure out a way to make the UV lighting effective during daylight hours. We ended up using a large black tarp to create the darkness we needed to take an ultraviolet look into the multitude of 3-inch wide by 2 1/2-feet deep circular core holes we dug.Our days were spent on the beaches and islands from the Pascagula area (Round Island and Singing River) to Ocean Springs and Waveland collecting soil and water samples as well as live crabs from the Ocean Springs area (Latitude 30,23.0288N, Longitude 88,48.6751W). We also secured some live shrimp, fish and squid samples to be professionally analyzed. Ultimately, we were able to cover a seemingly insurmountable area in a relatively short time thanks to the passionate work of my Sea Shepherd friends – Rex, Brock and Bonny – and the help of some buddies in the area.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3410","id":"334"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.7737,30.211459]}},{"properties":{"title":"Commercial Fisherman Out of Work","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/36","published":{"end_time":"2010/05/03 13:23:01 -0400","original":"Mon May 03 13:23:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/05/03 13:23:00 -0400"},"description":"He gave only his first name - Gary.

Any oil that hits shore is likely to have been weathered into balls or mats of tar, or mixed with seawater in a pudding-like \"mousse,\" the agency reported.\n\nAs of late Thursday morning, no oil or tar balls had washed up, said Buck Lee, executive director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority in Pensacola Beach. Lee, who is not related to Laura Lee, said the area had just had a \"super\" Memorial Day weekend -- but now, \"We're just waiting anxiously to see what happens,\" he added.\n\nLaura Lee said a wave of hotel cancellations hit the island in late April, after the sinking of the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon uncapped an undersea oil well off Louisiana. Those tapered off soon afterward, she said -- \"But this week, there's been another wave of cancellations,\" Laura Lee said. \n\nHotels have responded to the threat by easing cancellation policies. \"Some had guarantees that they would get their money back if there was oil,\" she said.\n\n\n\nVideo: Visitors enjoy 'still-white sand' In addition, charter fishing -- another big business in the area -- has been hurt. Some skippers have gone to work for oil company BP, which has hired boats to help lay protective booms and skim oil off the surface of the Gulf.\n\nTourism pumped about $1.2 billion into the Escambia County economy in 2009, employing roughly 20,000 people and bringing about 3.5 million overnight visitors a year, according to tourism officials. Early July brings two of its biggest annual events -- the Independence Day holiday and the following weekend's Pensacola Beach air show, which features the locally based Navy aerobatic team, the Blue Angels. Faced with those concerns, the locals are trying to harness the power of technology and social media to offset the threat.\n\n\"We're encouraging our visitors who are currently here to post their vacation pictures on Facebook, and a lot of them have done that just so that visitors can see with their own eyes the oil hasn't hit,\" Laura Lee said.\n\nAnd Buck Lee said the island authority hopes to put cameras on the beach and video streaming on the internet within about two weeks, \"so they can see for themselves whether there's oil on the beach or not.\"\n\n\"And there may be,\" he said. \"But we've got to get them the facts.\"","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/577","id":"372"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.216915,30.421309]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/578","title":"Fisherman's Wife breaks the Silence","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/03 17:37:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 03 17:37:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/03 17:37:00 -0400"},"description":"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Kindra Arnesen's husband often calls while he's out on a shrimping trip, so she wasn't surprised to hear her cell phone ring the night of April 29 while he was on an overnight fishing expedition.\n\nHowever, this time, her husband, David, wasn't calling to tell her about the day's catch or to wish their children Aleena and David Jr. a good night. He was calling to tell her he was sick, and the strange thing about it, so were men on the seven other shrimping boats working near his.\n\n\"I received several calls from him saying, 'This one's hanging over the boat throwing up. This one says he's dizzy, and he's feeling faint. Everybody's loading up their stuff, tying up their rigs and going back to the docks,'\" Arnesen remembers.\n\nArnesen believes it was vapors from the oil and the dispersants from the BP Gulf oil disaster that made her husband and the other shrimpers sick. She says they were downwind of it, and the smell was \"so strong they could almost taste it.\"\n\nFor several weeks, she hesitated to talk publicly about it. Like many fishermen who can no longer fish in the Gulf, her husband has signed a contract to work with BP to clean up the oil, and she doesn't want to bite the hand that puts food on her family's table.\n\nFull coverage: Gulf Coast oil disaster\n\nBut now Arnesen, a 32-year-old \"uneducated housewife\" -- her words -- is breaking her silence and is encouraging others in her community do the same. After attending a lecture by Rikki Ott, a toxicologist who's worked with families affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, Arnesen decided to organize other wives to ask questions about the safety of working near the oil.\n\nHer cell phone rings constantly.\n\n\"Hey, Theresa, how you doing?\" she said, taking a call Tuesday morning. \"Can you come to the meeting tonight?\"\n\nPeople don't want to talk. They're scared.\n\n--Kindra Arneson\n But Theresa can't come to the meeting, and Arnesen has come to expect such a response.\n\n\"People don't want to talk. They're scared,\" she says, of repercussions and consequences from BP. \"Our financial situation lays in the palm of their hands.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidence.\"\n\nWhen David Arnesen reported that the other men were so sick they were cutting their shrimping trips short and heading home, his wife knew something strange was happening. Shrimpers work through illness, she says, because a trip cut short can cost a shrimper thousands of dollars.\n\nShe says the men had all the same symptoms at the same time -- vomiting, dizziness, headaches, shortness of breath. Could it be a coincidence?\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidence. It would be one thing if one of them got sick. It would maybe be OK if two got sick,\" she says. \"When everyone's getting sick all at the same time, that's not coincidence\"\n\nWhen asked at a news conference Sunday about people getting sick while out on the Gulf, BP CEO Tony Hayward had his own theory.\n\n\"Food poisoning is clearly a big issue,\" HE said. \"It's something we've got to be very mindful of.\"\n\nArnesen says there's no way her husband and the men on the other boats had fallen victim to food poisoning, noting the men were on eight boats and didn't eat the same food.\n\nThe night her husband became ill, Arnesen says, she tried to get him to come home like the other shrimpers, but he refused. He stayed out fishing from 6 p.m. until 9 a.m. the next morning, and came home so sick he collapsed into his recliner without eating dinner or saying hello to her or the children.\n\n\"It's a nasty cough. I literally woke him up over and over again,\" she says. \"It didn't sound like he was getting enough air.\n\nAt first, David refused to see a doctor, but after three weeks of coughing and feeling weak, he agreed to go. His wife says he was diagnosed with respiratory problems and prescribed medicines, including an antibiotic and cough medicines.\n\nShe says while he's feeling better, he still doesn't have the energy he used to have.\n\n\"Here we are over a month later and he's still not completely well,\" she says.\n\nMasks and marshes\n\nSince CNN aired a story about her Tuesday night, Kindra Arnesen says she's received phone calls from as far away as Texas from people wanting to team up with her to protect coastal communities from the oil.\n\nOne of her immediate goals is to persuade BP to give its workers masks.\n\nGraham MacEwen, a spokesman for BP, says the company isn't providing masks because their air monitoring shows there's no health threats to workers.\n\nHe denied Arnesen's accusations that BP has prevented workers from wearing their own masks, saying workers may do so as long as they read training materials on how to use a mask safely.\n\nArnesen is also working to have BP fund an effort to put sandbags along the marshes in her area to keep the oil out.\n\n(Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal announced Wednesday that the White House has ordered BP to fund Louisiana's plan to dredge up walls of sand along its coast.)\n\nArnesen says she is indeed scared that her husband will lose her job now that she's speaking out.\n\n\"Am I scared?

The state is working to put them back before the oil reaches its shores.\n\n\"Our goal is to make sure no oil goes onto the beach or into the estuary,\" says Gov. Bob Riley.\n\nBut coastal residents are bracing for the worst.\n\nNews that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed much of the Gulf to fishing came Sunday as colorfully decorated boats lined up in Bayou La Batre, Ala., for a yearly ritual in the town that calls itself the \"seafood capital of the state.\"\n\nSince 1949, the archbishop of Mobile has come down to the bayou to pray for a bountiful harvest from the sea and for the safety of the oystermen, shrimpers and commercial anglers who ply the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIt's usually a community celebration with music, fresh seafood and a party on every boat. This year, however, the mood was somber with the knowledge that a giant oil slick was just offshore.\n\n\"They really need a blessing this year,\" Darvin Barbour said. \"That oil is just going to tear us up this year.\"\n\nBarbour, 36, has lived in Bayou La Batre all his life.\n\nIt's \"getting ready to change big time for everybody,\" Barbour added. \"No more seafood. Bunch [of] people are going to be in dire need.\"\n\nBP has been offering anglers in Bayou La Batre and elsewhere payments up to $5,000 if they give up their right to sue. Alabama Attorney General Troy King has told BP to stop circulating the settlement agreements and is urging Alabamians to seek legal counsel before signing anything.\n\nBarbour, a former shrimper, says meetings so far with representatives from BP have not been helpful.\n\n\"One person says you need to do this, somebody else says you need to do that. We don't know what we need to do,\" Barbour said. \"If we knew what we need to know, then we could go out and do something. But you don't know.\"\n\nArchbishop Thomas Rodi, during his blessing, acknowledged the anxiety and prayed for the responders:\n\n\"We ask God to bless those who are working to contain and to stop the oil leak. We ask God to protect us, to protect the livelihoods of those who make their living in the seafood industry and tourism industry. And we ask God to protect our way of life which is imperiled by this danger of this oil slick.\"\n\nThen it was time for the blessing of the boats on the water. The archbishop stood on the bow of the lead boat, and a few dozen vessels followed out to the mouth of the bayou.\n\nFisherman Wilson Johnson, 35, was in his small aluminum boat, hoping to get a sprinkle of holy water as he contemplated a murky future.\n\n\"We've lived on the bayou our whole life. That's all we know. That just sad if something does happen and you gotta move away, where would we go? My daddy's daddy's daddy — that's all we ever knew was seafood.\"\n\nMelissa Bosarge Nelson also grew up here, her family working in the seafood industry. Now she's a tour operator.\n\n\"It's hard to think about,\" Nelson said. \"I can't image not being able to get in my boat to go out. We have pleasure boats. Our company, we run the sightseeing cruises from Bellingrath Gardens and already we've seen a decline because people aren't coming to Orange Beach and we're not getting the tourists during the day.\"\n\nShe says at least with a hurricane you can start rebuilding when the storm passes, but this disaster has no end in sight.\n\n\"Who would think that this would happen?\" Nelson asked. \"I'm not an engineer, but seems to me you would have five or six ways to cut that thing off.\"\n\nNelson and others here wonder whether Bayou La Batre will even have a fleet to bless come next May.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jo Bonner of Mobile says a lot is hanging in the balance. \"This may be one of those life-changing moments that an individual, a community, a region of the country is living through,\" he said.\n\nBonner says even if the well is capped today, this could still be the biggest environmental and economic crisis the Gulf Coast has ever faced.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/63","id":"407"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.248117,30.403253]}},{"properties":{"title":"tar balls on gulf shores beaches while beaches remain open","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/630","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/05 16:09:01 -0400","original":"Sat Jun 05 16:09:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/05 16:09:00 -0400"},"description":"children had oil all over there feet today around 1 pm in gulfshores as the beaches remain open and clean up crews sat around waiting for the orders to start cleaning","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/630","id":"408"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.700819,30.246036]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/631","title":"oil smell- Fort Pickens","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/07 00:20:01 -0400","original":"Mon Jun 07 00:20:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/07 00:20:00 -0400"},"description":"Strong smell of oil near Fort Pickens, Gulf Breezes, FL this morning","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/631","id":"409"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.299139,30.328811]}},{"properties":{"title":"Dead shark and Drum- Lake Coquille","guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/635","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/06 02:51:01 -0400","original":"Sun Jun 06 02:51:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/06 02:51:00 -0400"},"description":"I found two dead sharks and one dead drum floating while fishing today.

The bird was ringed with oil, and later identified by a BP Wildlife Recovery representative as a juvenile North American Gannet.\n\nThe resident, Doug Christopher called BP’s Oiled Animal Hotline and alerted the Wildlife Recovery Desk about the animal, giving them the location.

Photographed on Thursday, May 27 by Jeffrey Dubinsky, on a flyover Jeffrey and I took with Mike Tidwell, GRN advisory board member and author of \"Bayou Farewell.\"   These photos have been used by Reuters, in a story on our call for a federalized response in Mother Jones, and the front page of the Huffington Post. \n\nThey tell the tale far better than BP would like.  We had to fly at 3,000 feet due to a 'temporary flight restriction' that has been in place since the BP drilling disaster began.  For clarity's sake, we may want to refer to this as a 'media flight restriction,' no media flights have gotten approval to fly over the oil impacts, and the area that's closed has expanded exponentially, now keeping people out of the air over most of Southeast Louisiana.

Hinged, so it doesn’t interrupt present operation. (Alternately, a notched clam shell type shovel concept could be brainstormed and utilized). Close hinge with flap to loosely seal seam.  Tall enough to intercept above the oil leak with no bottom (sits on seafloor after closing and with a top with big notch for loose fit around the BOP and cap. Have port in side with variable speed pump to feed liquid to surface. Speed up pumping action to point where there is neutral or  minimal negative or positive  pressure on the containment container. Pump oil to surface to recovery vessel. Use same precautions and concepts to prevent hydride formation.\n\n\nHow To Cut The Drilling Interception Time/depth\n\n\nI believe one can shorten well drilling intercept time by a significant amount by additions to/or changes in the drilling plan. Part of the procedure will prevent further casing blowouts and reduce the depth required to inject the one million, one hundred thousand pound column of mud (actually, only the 9 5/8” diameter portion X 13,000 feet) above the reservoir to counteract hydrostatic pressure, estimated by some at 13,000 psi from the reservoir. With the use of a mud with an overall density of 5.85 instead of 1.67 as is required for a 13,000 foot column, the higher density can be achieved by using depleted uranium powder and as only a 25% component of the mix, the column can be reduced to 3,600 feet in length from 13,000 feet. Combining this with chloroform, a dense fluid, (1.489 specific gravity vs. water at 1.0)  instead of water, would further increase the mud density and required column length of mud. With lead substituted for depleted U, the column length required is still only 5,500 feet long. Again, only a static pressure head is active (~ 13,000 psi ). Change mud composition slowly as proceed with injection. Have interceptor well approach the target well at a vertical upward angle to bring into play the Venturi effect to assist in pushing mud into the well.  With the oil not moving, then an additional amount of the mud mixture designed specifically for this purpose can be injected into the well-slowly- to provide an increase in the safety margin for balancing downward pressure until cement can be added to seal the well.  \n\nFor the mud liquid carrier, Chloroform is produced in nature and is liquid at room temperature, and pressure and which by itself has a higher density than some mud’s (1.489 gm/cc) but its density characteristics with  pressure and temperature, and the earth’s thermal gradient (~+75 degrees Fahrenheit/ mile of depth) may not make it the best candidate for the carrier fluid. Identify the best one by brainstorming. Also, as noted, the solid portion should be looked at under these circumstances where cost is no object, i. e. lead, @11.83g/cc or after an initial injection of lead mud as a buffer, depleted uranium at ~ 19.07 g/cc or a combination.  All of these materials are readily available and safe to use if handled properly. Also, consider adding different chemicals to the water/chloroform that are soluble in them and heavy or may react to form purposeful hydrates, in the presence of methane etc. \n\nContinuation Of Summary\n\nThe BP oil spill is not being handled in a professional and logical manner. In addition to reducing the depth for the interceptor well, the technical problems that could have been identified early on at the blow out protector (BOP) on the sea floor to totally stop the flow of oil are described. Then, how each of these problems could have been met with proper brain-storming techniques. Next, how BP seems to have missed the boat on some of these aspects. Then an overview of some equipment or procedures to address these technical problems. Then some bells and whistles one should include on one equipment concept. Then a critique of some of the deficiencies I have identified in BP’s work based on information I have read and TV reports  and BP write-ups and videos I have seen. Then some second guessing and what might have been. Then, problems with BP’s approach to this specific problem. Next, what an oil company’s philosophy might be for moving forward and what can the US government do to more proactively work toward more quickly finding solutions to the spill.  Lastly, my credentials for making these statements. \n\n* * indicates the idea under discussion can be expanded and/or additional ideas, examples or concepts can be provided by the author.\n\n\n\n\nThe drilling depth to intercept is based on the height of the mud column needed to balance the static and dynamic oil pressure. Instead use the drilling records for drill speed, rock density etc to determine the safe depth below which there is no concern for case integrity in the event a rupture of the casing has taken place. * *\n\n One other point. If I can come up with a basis for drilling to a shallower depth (time) for interception, others may have too- with even better suggestions. Has BP started a shallow interception well as a backup and for redundancy? They need to.\n\n\n\nSome Concerns Regarding The Present Design Of The BOP.\n\nHaving heard that the well casing may have failed when mud was injected under high pressure, who can say that it might or might not have failed if the BOP had been activated and it performed as planned? Oil would be leaking into the seabed without any indication of failure. \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNeedless to say. No, maybe it does need to be said. The people who are responsible for this program to date have not exhibited the proper amount of caution when making decisions until only very recently. They apparently have taken the magnitude of the event as an indication that they must bow to public pressure and get something done- even if it turns out to be only partially effective or wrong. Use caution. Listen. Test where possible. Use actual models, not just computer ones. Brainstorm properly. In my experience as a researcher these are critical to a true understanding of what is going on.\n\nTechnical Problems.\n \n1.\tFrom before the start, BP should have had a plan. From the start BP should have been thinking about putting in place a system on the ocean floor that would be anchored and allow easy positioning of objects they brought down to the BOP, the blow-out preventer. An anchored incrementally movable cable system of some sort with sensors. Or like a frame that is like the female part of a socket so that once in place, new containment equipment could be easily positioned.  Also, samples of oil and venting gas to calculate gas fraction, determine oil density, chemical characteristics, particle content, particle hardness, friability, compressability, flow characteristics, corrosion characteristic, etc. The latter may have been done but how soon? Then when they formed, an analysis of the hydrates. More on this later. In other words, there should have been an emergency plan in place before drilling began to quickly provide direction and have in place or at least on hand material, people and assignments in the event of a disaster. There obviously wasn’t a good one.\n2.\tThe major problem should not have involved trying to siphon off part of the flow of oil. The major problem is stopping the flow.\n3.\tRe sawing off the tube, which could have ended up being a disaster. As any woodsman knows, hollow wood branches or even solid ones are going to most likely pinch the blade unless you stabilize the branch or pull it apart as you saw. A laser or welding torch approach would probably have been better. BP may have been lucky they were able to fully make the cut with the shear.* *\n4.\tOne needs to place something over/ around/ under or in the emitting tube or physically reduce the size of the opening to be able to slow and then stop the oil flow in a controlled manner. \n5.\tBP hasn’t to date totally addressed the problem of how do you get a cap on the oil when it is coming out at a pressure to produce a flow rate of  over six hundred and forty thousand gallons of oil a day (7 ½ gallons per second) from a column that is a couple of miles long/tall. Plus millions of cubic  feet of gas It is like a kid trying to place a closed nozzle on a flowing garden hose. So they ended up opening up the nozzle and managed to physically hold a  leaky “miss-threaded” cap in place but they now have to siphon a portion off. Knowing they might be successful in capturing large amounts of oil, why didn’t they have that capacity in place on standby?   Who is involved in logistics?\n6.\tThey still haven’t really put the cap on the tube, they have just moved the capping location away from the BOP head. \n7.\tThe problem here is static pressure  (momentum or dynamic pressure is minimal). One has to realize that that several mile long column of incompressible oil pressure needs to be addressed slowly. One cannot go to zero or negative velocity instantly. It has to be done slowly. An analogy is “How do you catch a speeding bullet? ”You surely don’t put your hand over it and try and stop it.” I heard on TV earlier that literally thousands of gallons of mud were forced down the tube at high pressure and rate in the “top kill” exercise. And then the procedure was quickly shut down due to something being amiss. I heard an earlier BP video where the Engineer in charge bragged about their high pressure/high volume capacity for this exercise. Under the pumping conditions described, the friction effects and the long column of uncompressible oil  and compressed gas, raised the pressure in the tube to the point apparently where it exceeded the rupture strength of the drill pipe casing along a portion of the pipe. I do not understand how this could be allowed to happen, but it apparently did. This concept is taught in freshman Statics. A basic Mechanical Engineering exercise. \n8.\tThe solution then is to fit some kind of device around or in the pipe that may leak at first and that doesn’t restrict the flow in any way and then by increments, fix the leak(s)…. \n9.\tand eventually address the main flow out of the tube in such a way that the size of the flow stream is made smaller and smaller until it is finally cut off. And monitor the pressure and don’t let it exceed the critical value. \n10.\tObviously, it is important to monitor other important factors so one can slow down or adjust procedures in the event the system becomes unstable.\n11.\tHow might it become unstable? For example, if the equipment exceeds its pressure rating or if it were to shift allowing oil to flow out of new leaks created by the shift. \n12.\tIt is important to have overkill and redundancy built into the equipment and sensors. \n13.\t It is important to have a method of capturing or reducing the size of leaks in a controlled systematic manner that the flow of oil at high pressure, velocity and volume has negligible impact on the process as it proceeds. In other words we don’t want to try and cap the oil we want the oil pressure to help, not hinder the process of slowing then stopping the oil flow if at all possible. The system needs to be stable, once it is in place, and not move. This can be done in stages.\n14.\tThe system needs to have methods of introducing “mud” and cement to the desired locations and at the proper time to eventually cap the well.\n\n\nWhat might have been proposed before BP began their poorly conceived and exercised capping concept is the following:\n\nEquipment. \n\nIf the well pipe extending out of the BOP has not been cut too short, drill small holes for inserting pressure and velocity gages. Then place a swagger over the end of the pipe and slowly swage it closed using a pointer swagger. The swagger will not interfere with the oil stream and as the tube is concentrically swaged, the flow and pressure can be monitored. Further, the wall thickness will increase as swaging proceeds so that the danger for rupture or expansion at this location will decrease as swaging proceeds.  However, it appears to be too short even for this. If longer, a conventional tube swagger might have been used. The swagger would have to be pressurized of course and pneumatically operated. Too bad this contingency wasn’t allowed for.* *\n\nBF Deficiencies.\n\nI have only watched a couple of BP’s video’s. And a couple of updates, They really don’t get it. There has been no sense of urgency. From the president on down. The words sometimes aren’t even right. The president wants everyone to see that he is on top of everything. He isn’t. The “This  is the first time this has been attempted at a mile underwater” is of no importance. If BP had had a real tested plan and had thought ahead working at these depths would be old hat. BP stated they are working with the smartest brains in America. The experts in their fields. I see several things wrong. Their list of experts is apparently outdated and they have not picked  all of the right fields of expertise. Also, their experts either have big egos and can’t work together or they have poor leadership. I assume the latter.  I have seen no evidence of their brainpower until recently when vents were discussed and a legitimate cautious tone was taken following the “Top Kill” attempt. \n\nI saw the BP video with the white box. Actually I think it had been gotten from another shallow water project. It had to be painted white I guess so it could be seen. How long does it take to find it and get it to the site? Does it take a day or more to let it dry?  Then when it failed because of hydrates plugging up the “siphon tube” it was set aside on the sea floor.  So if they decide they need it again they will have to bring it up to modify it. Hydrates. Plugging.  Isn’t this what one eventually wants to do? So, can you enhance the effect and make it happen so much it reduces the oil flow and potentially even stops it until the interceptor drilling does it’s job?  Can one use an analysis of the hydrates to add to the seawater around the box, or if they had thought to place ports in the box, inject hydrate material directly into the box so the solution is supersaturated? I also heard from the chief engineer that the seawater around the box was about 30 degrees, below freezing for fresh water, but above it for seawater and they were using methanol to reduce hydrates. Two things. What would injecting or blanketing fresh water around the box do? Would it make ice? Would pumping liquid nitrogen to or into the box freeze even seawater or make the hydrate formation even “better”? Certainly it might make the oil more viscous. I heard brainstorming was done and explained after a reporters question re golf balls and tire pieces and towels. It was acknowledged that that was what was going to be used. So they could then inject mud that would stay put. “Top Kill”. First off, that is a poor excuse for brainstorming.* * My first thoughts off the top were metallic Velcro, Velcro with both hooks and loops on every piece. Then that box that is sitting on the seafloor could have all kinds of hooky catchy things welded to the inside. So as they injected material they would get caught onto it. Then treble fish hooks. Then why release stuff into the box without holding on to it and being able to move it up and down in the oil stream. So go fishing with hooks on a cable. With bobbers and vanes in order to direct them. Then umbrellas to open up in the oil flow. All attached to cables? Then Velcro covered bucky balls.  Then a scrap yard electro-magnet attached to the box, or several and inject iron objects which would be held in the box. And on and on.\n\nAnother thing that was particularly disturbing was the answer to the question about help from people outside BP. Something like yes, we have gotten thousands of suggestions but of course we have thought of most of them. A typical NOT INVENTED HERE answer. How could anyone have a solution better than ours? We are the experts. On brainstorming one should encourage answers, not discourage them. Very poor PR too. * *\n\nSecond Guessing. What Might Have Been Done.\n\nIsn’t it criminal to have a system so complicated and expensive that you can’t afford to test it and provide instructions that TWO upper management people must “Push the Button”? And have something that could fail? And did with no backup? Even in spite of warnings? Why wasn’t management looking for a better system? A system that was simple, not costly to test periodically and had some redundancy. A non ‘all or nothing’ system? I think I know what that system is but why don’t they? * * At the least why didn’t someone think about what would happen under the conditions where a blowout could occur. As it did. How could this disaster have been minimized and lives saved?\n\nSimple.\n\nTHE REASON THE PLATFORM SANK AND PROBABLY LIVES WERE LOST IS BECAUSE THE FIRE WAS FUELED WITH OIL FROM THE WELL AND PIPE TO THE PLATFORM.  IF THAT PIPE HAD BEEN SEVERED, AUTOMATICALLY, ON RECEIVING THE SIGNAL FROM A SENSOR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO FUEL TO FEED THE FIRE. AND IF A CONTAINMENT DEVICE HAD BEEN IN PLACE AROUND THE WELL-HEAD THERE WOULD BE NO OIL SPILL TO SPEAK OF. AND, EVEN AFTER THE FIRE STARTED, THERE WERE TWO+ DAYS BEFORE THE PLATFORM  SANK * *\n\nProblems With BP’s Approach to This Specific Problem.\n\nThe main problem I find with BP’s approach is they placed no or little value on anything except money when they didn’t have to. Everything we have seen is all a façade. Image. Image. Image. No real integrity. They don’t really know what they are doing as it has nothing to do with the routine job of oil drilling but they would like our government and the public to think they do. \n\n\n\nPhilosophy.\n\nI worked at Alcoa when Paul O’Neal was President. He set as a goal for everyone in the company the goal of safety and being a good community neighbor. And he meant it. He fired a VP once who allowed a site to become polluted and he also made sure that every accident or near miss was autopsied. And a correction was made so that it couldn’t happen again. And accident rates dropped and continue to drop. I heard Rand Paul has said that the BP incident was an accident. It wasn’t With BP’s set of priorities. It was bound to happen sooner or later. It didn’t need to happen but it did. An indication it was going to, was the number of violations found in the BP Texas refinery disaster. I understand more than 50 times the next highest number recorded by a competitor. Who is to blame for all of this? In my mind the first to blame is the president of BP. The second is the board who hired him. On moving forward I would like to see every oil company held accountable to standards of safety that are moving targets and require ongoing commitments of money and resources to safety and environmental protection including research programs that address prevention and better, faster and more complete cleanup solutions. And not just mechanical devices but other off the wall approaches including dispersant development and testing, microbe testing, where the oil goes, how to recapture it and so on. And the oil company pays out of their oil profits. \n\nWhat Can The US Government Do To More Proactively Find Solutions To The Spill?  \n\nI have been in research all of my professional life. It is disappointing to me to see some aspects of basic research being conducted in an esoteric fashion such that to find a practical use is below the researcher. For example, if one is working in a high purity metal system, isn’t it more practical to work in a system that allows the results to be used by the companies production divisions who in both the short term and long term financially support the research? There is a lot of research being conducted under the sponsorship of the US government that could be pointed toward finding solutions to many of the environmental problems the gulf faces. And it might be beneficial to us all to have the government place incentives on certain area’s of effort.  \nAlso, we have a new energy resource that has just been identified to have reserves that will last decades. I believe the government should mandate use of shale natural gas in vehicles and for other energy requirements where it can be substituted for oil and oil bi-products, I have numerous other thought regarding the cleanup but this too long already.  * * Also, about a better BOP system.  * *  I’d be happy to talk about any of this.\n\nFinally as part of a restitution plan use income tax statements to determine prior income related to anything that has been curtailed by the spill and have BP fund a fraction of this money back to affected citizens.\n \nI hope this information is communicated by you and others to other people with the where-with-all to make things happen. I believe this paper identifies some of the real problems that have not been addressed and contains practical solutions that can be implemented quickly and perhaps will provide guidance to prevent further problems.\n\n\n\nCredentials.\n\nI am a retired PhD in Metallurgical Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Physics.

The lower part of the three part cylinder fits inside the cofferdam and the upper portion extends above the tube from which the oil is emitting. \n4.\tThe lower stage fits down into the cofferdam and about 2/3 the way up the BOP and is fitted with numerous hydraulic cylinders facing inward up and down and around the circumference of the lower portion of the three stage cylinder that can be activated slowly in tandem from four or more points of the compass, north, south, east, west at once. This is so that the overall cylinder can be mechanically stabilized by pushing from all sides on the BOP. \n5.\tA schematic of the BOP should be used to determine which hydraulic cylinders to active first as there are welded on pipes and flanges on the BOP. This is in order to prevent shifting of the three stage cylinder during activation of the hydraulic cylinders. \n6.\tAt the top of the lower section are baffles that directs any oil that is leaking around the tube toward the openable and closable vents that are around the periphery of stage two of the three stage cylinder. They start out open.  They are of a size to minimize any back pressure. At the juncture between section one and two there is a “rubber” gasket that prevents the majority of the oil from going down into the lower section so that this lower section is filled either with seawater or oil that is relatively stagnant. There are ports in the lower section so that first mud and then a catalytic cement can be injected at the appropriate time to fill the lower portion of the cylinder. \n7.\tOnce the cylinder is in place and the hydraulic cylinders have been activated inward, shot will be placed between the lower part of the cylinder and cofferdam to act as a partial seal. Then enough mud will be injected to complete the seal and finally the cement will be added to complete the stabilization of the three part cylinder. The shot may be mixed with small pieces of cellophane or rubber balloons etc. to enhance the seal. The cement will also provide additional stability to the cylinder as there are protrusions from the BOP and provide redundancy in the event one or more of the hydraulic cylinders fails with time. There will be stresses placed on the cylinder during the final stage of reducing flow from closing the upper portion of the tube that need to be addressed. \n8.\tOnce the cement has set and the cylinder is stable motion wise, it will be time to close the vents in the middle section of the cylinder. At this point there will be no motion of the oil although it may be under some elevated pressure due to any friction conditions that exist concerning the upper portion of the cylinder. Once the vents are closed, in the second section, a valve in the second section can be activated and the same type of cement as used before can be employed to fill stage two of the cylinder under high pressure, further stabilizing the cylinder. \n9.\tOnce this cement has set up, work can begin on the third stage of the cylinder.\n10.\tThe description of the third stage of the cylinder is simple. It is of simple design. Namely, it is a cylinder of perhaps almost no flair (remember the upper portion of stage two was tapered to provide a seated fit) then flairs out to one half to one inch clearance that extends maybe two to three inches to a foot beyond the end of the tube which is gushing oil. \n11.\tOn the end of the cylinder is a valve which is infinitely adjustable as to how open it is.  It should start fully open. When fully open it should provide no impingement on the oil flowing out of the tube. The thickness of the cylinder and welds material should provide a triple or more than usual safety factor for pressure based on fully annealed material. If possible the material should be thick enough that it won’t exceed it’s fatigue limit. If possible all material and welds should be stress relieved.  The valve(s) should be of such a design that the high pressure oil should not impede it’s operation. And it should be such that if the mechanical, hydraulic or electric closing operation should fail, it will slowly close automatically and provide a positive seal like a butterfly valve. However, if the calculated critical pressure for rupture is approached the closure should stop. For redundancy it may be desirable to have two or more of these in series in the event one were to fail. On the side of this third stage of the cylinder will again be incorporated high pressure inlet ports so that mud can be slowly pumped into the throat of the tube as needed to reduce the pressure followed by the appropriate cement to seal the well.    \n\nBells and Whistles\n\n1.\tTwo adjustable crossing cables with load cells to hang across to the other side of the BOP so that loads can be monitored by tightening the cables. These could be placed such that the protrusions on the BOP act as anchor locations for the cables as they are tightened. The load cells would then alert one to any shifting of the three stage cylinder.\n2.\tPressure gauges in each stage of the cylinder. \n3.\tStress gauges at numerous critical points on the cylinder.\n4.\tQuick snap easy release high pressure fittings. \n5.\tVelocity meters in throat of third stage and elsewhere.\n6.\tVibration meters to make sure no harmonics are set up.\n7.\tIndependent non backward flow valves for the hydraulic cylinders.\n8.\tPosition meters to positively identify the valve open amount and   position.\n9.\tTemperature sensors. \n10.\tMud sensors. \n11.\tCement sensors.

He asked the Humane Society to work with the contractors cleaning the birds to come up with a better way to enlist the help of volunteers.  Dozens of people, including experienced veterinarians coming from all over the area and the country, should be brought in to help save our wildlife. \n“We shouldn’t be turning them away, we need all the help we can get,” said President Nungesser.  “We want to improve our comfort level of knowing someone is out there looking for these birds and other animals – doing all they can to save them.”\nThe Plaquemines Parish Inland Waterways Strike Force recently discovered broken eggs and crushed chicks on Queen Bess Island.

NOAA is currently in the process of conducting thorough testing to determine the circumstances surrounding the mammal’s death, as well as collect information about its life. This is the first dead whale reported since BP’s rig exploded on April 20. It was not found in oiled waters; however, its location of death is unknown.\n\nAs soon as the whale was sighted, Pisces Field Party Chief Paul Felts called the marine mammal hotline to report the finding to the Wildlife Branch of the Unified Command and NOAA’s marine mammal experts.\n\n\nBased on the estimated size of the whale, scientists believe it is a sub-adult. Its condition suggests it may have been dead for between several days to more than a week. Although it was not found in oiled water, NOAA marine mammal experts are using hindcasting analysis to look into the location from which the whale carcass may have drifted.\n\nWhile it is impossible to confirm whether exposure to oil was the cause of death, NOAA is reviewing whether factors such as ship strikes and entanglement can be eliminated. Samples collected from this carcass will be stored under proper protocols and handed off when the Pisces comes to port on July 2, or possibly if another boat is sent to meet the Pisces. Full analysis of the samples will take several weeks.\n\nIn accordance with the Wildlife Branch protocols, NOAA’s Southeast Regional Marine Mammal Stranding Coordinator Blair Mase requested that the NOAA field crew take photographs of the approximately 25-foot whale, collect skin swab for oil analysis, collect blubber and skin samples for analysis, and measure its height in the water. Although the whale is very decomposed, the photographs and samples will help scientists better understand how long it has been dead. The blubber and skin samples will be used for genetic analysis and to determine the sex of the animal. Measurements of the whale floating in the water will be used to determine how far and how fast it might have floated from where it died. The carcass has been marked so that aerial reconnaissance teams will be able to identify the individual and will not report it as a new mortality.\n\nNOAA and the Unified Command Wildlife Branch have had numerous reports of sperm whales seen swimming in the oil, but this is the first confirmed report of a dead whale since the BP oil spill began. NOAA remains concerned about sperm whales, which are the only endangered resident cetaceans in the upper Gulf of Mexico. Sperm whales spend most of their time in the upper Gulf offshore area, live at depth in areas where subsurface dispersants and oil are present, and feed on deepwater squid, which may also be impacted by the oil and dispersants.\n\nThe NOAA Ship Gordon Gunter sailed yesterday for a multi-week cruise to do photo identification, assessments, tagging, biopsies, and prey-density studies for sperm whales and Bryde’s whales. Nearshore and offshore response efforts are continuing, and include investigations to determine cause of death or illness for dolphins that have stranded and aerial surveys for cetaceans throughout the area.  The information gained from these efforts will help assess the impacts of this event on cetaceans in the Gulf of Mexico.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/893","id":"555"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.286133,27.76133]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/894","title":"Bird nesting grounds threatened by oil overtopping booms. queen bess island","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 17:58:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 17:58:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 17:58:00 -0400"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBird nesting grounds threatened by oil overtopping booms. queen bess island","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/894","id":"556"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.957572,29.304948]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/895","title":"Excessive oil in the jetties on grand terre","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 16:52:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 16:52:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 16:52:00 -0400"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nExcessive oil in the jetties on grand terre","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/895","id":"557"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.895626,29.302447]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/896","title":"Meet up Group for Volunteer Opportunities","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/18 23:14:01 -0400","original":"Fri Jun 18 23:14:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/18 23:14:00 -0400"},"description":"We will discuss the planning and logistics of mobilizing our task force to the areas that we deem the most vulnerable, such as animal sanctuaries and hatcheries.

Morgan can be accessed) and am going to post here as well now. \n\nYesterday evening a wave of weathered crude oil washed up on the beach in front of where I live (between the 2 and 3 mile markers on the Gulf side of Ft. Morgan). Oil mats covered 2-3 feet from the low tide line by 9  pm. I am attaching pics. Though there are almost no birds on the beach now, a lone black skimmer was feeding in the oiled water last night. Coquina clams have been dying in large #s for weeks now. This morning at high tide we have lots of tarballs (last pic). \n\nI called the 1-800-424-8802  number to report the smell and oil mats, then the BP (866) 448-5816 number to report the oil mats. I asked that a cleaning crew be sent to clean last night whale the temps were down, tide was low (and thus oil exposed) and before the tide came in. They made sympathetic noises, but I have seen no clean-up crew. The regular patrol raced down the beach this morning around 7 am (as usual) so fast they could not possibly see anything. The next patrol shortly after went slower but they were driving up near the houses and so far from the water they could not possibly see the tar balls. I wonder why the \"popular\" beaches are getting cleaning crews working to clean at night, but we are ignored except for the token patrols? I have asked repeatedly that the patrols travel at the tide line, not high up on the beach where they run over protected dune recovery plantings, and that their vehicles be clearly identified (company name and vehicle ID clearly/easily visible). So far this has not happened. They do us not good riding where they can't see the beached oil. Residents are concerned since anyone can now ride up and down the beach claiming to be working with the clean-up. As happened after Ivan and Katrina, we are now having people driving the beach casing houses and a number of house and car break-ins lately.

I have been coughing up mucous and my chest feels irritated. My ears are stuffy, too. My ears are ringing, too. My skin has become oily and I rub off blackened skin from my neck to my chest and shoulders exposed to the outdoor elements. I feel lousy all over and wonder if the oil got in the rain and caused these things of late to happen. I wish I knew where to go on the internet to see what the VOC levels are for the methane being released in the Gulf from the BP oil spill on April 20. I am concerned my health has been affected by the chemicals coming from the BP Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico. I know others here have the same experiences with their plants and health. No one seems to have a website to show the monitoring levels of chemicals being released over Florida. Even the CDC does not report levels of the VOCs; only what the health risks of being exposed are to these chemicals. WHY? I am scared that we are getting exposed to poisoned chemicals here. Please help us. I want to leave this area soon. We wrote to Senator Nelson twice about these concerns last month and no response from him yet. Who can we turn to for help with these problems and concerns? Who is in charge to help the people, we need help!

Any oil that hits shore is likely to have been weathered into balls or mats of tar, or mixed with seawater in a pudding-like \"mousse,\" the agency reported.\n\nAs of late Thursday morning, no oil or tar balls had washed up, said Buck Lee, executive director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority in Pensacola Beach. Lee, who is not related to Laura Lee, said the area had just had a \"super\" Memorial Day weekend -- but now, \"We're just waiting anxiously to see what happens,\" he added.\n\nLaura Lee said a wave of hotel cancellations hit the island in late April, after the sinking of the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon uncapped an undersea oil well off Louisiana. Those tapered off soon afterward, she said -- \"But this week, there's been another wave of cancellations,\" Laura Lee said. \n\nHotels have responded to the threat by easing cancellation policies. \"Some had guarantees that they would get their money back if there was oil,\" she said.\n\n\n\nVideo: Visitors enjoy 'still-white sand' In addition, charter fishing -- another big business in the area -- has been hurt. Some skippers have gone to work for oil company BP, which has hired boats to help lay protective booms and skim oil off the surface of the Gulf.\n\nTourism pumped about $1.2 billion into the Escambia County economy in 2009, employing roughly 20,000 people and bringing about 3.5 million overnight visitors a year, according to tourism officials. Early July brings two of its biggest annual events -- the Independence Day holiday and the following weekend's Pensacola Beach air show, which features the locally based Navy aerobatic team, the Blue Angels. Faced with those concerns, the locals are trying to harness the power of technology and social media to offset the threat.\n\n\"We're encouraging our visitors who are currently here to post their vacation pictures on Facebook, and a lot of them have done that just so that visitors can see with their own eyes the oil hasn't hit,\" Laura Lee said.\n\nAnd Buck Lee said the island authority hopes to put cameras on the beach and video streaming on the internet within about two weeks, \"so they can see for themselves whether there's oil on the beach or not.\"\n\n\"And there may be,\" he said. \"But we've got to get them the facts.\"","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/577","id":"702"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.216915,30.421309]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/578","title":"Fisherman's Wife breaks the Silence","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/03 17:37:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 03 17:37:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/03 17:37:00 -0400"},"description":"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Kindra Arnesen's husband often calls while he's out on a shrimping trip, so she wasn't surprised to hear her cell phone ring the night of April 29 while he was on an overnight fishing expedition.\n\nHowever, this time, her husband, David, wasn't calling to tell her about the day's catch or to wish their children Aleena and David Jr. a good night. He was calling to tell her he was sick, and the strange thing about it, so were men on the seven other shrimping boats working near his.\n\n\"I received several calls from him saying, 'This one's hanging over the boat throwing up. This one says he's dizzy, and he's feeling faint. Everybody's loading up their stuff, tying up their rigs and going back to the docks,'\" Arnesen remembers.\n\nArnesen believes it was vapors from the oil and the dispersants from the BP Gulf oil disaster that made her husband and the other shrimpers sick. She says they were downwind of it, and the smell was \"so strong they could almost taste it.\"\n\nFor several weeks, she hesitated to talk publicly about it. Like many fishermen who can no longer fish in the Gulf, her husband has signed a contract to work with BP to clean up the oil, and she doesn't want to bite the hand that puts food on her family's table.\n\nFull coverage: Gulf Coast oil disaster\n\nBut now Arnesen, a 32-year-old \"uneducated housewife\" -- her words -- is breaking her silence and is encouraging others in her community do the same. After attending a lecture by Rikki Ott, a toxicologist who's worked with families affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, Arnesen decided to organize other wives to ask questions about the safety of working near the oil.\n\nHer cell phone rings constantly.\n\n\"Hey, Theresa, how you doing?\" she said, taking a call Tuesday morning. \"Can you come to the meeting tonight?\"\n\nPeople don't want to talk. They're scared.\n\n--Kindra Arneson\n But Theresa can't come to the meeting, and Arnesen has come to expect such a response.\n\n\"People don't want to talk. They're scared,\" she says, of repercussions and consequences from BP. \"Our financial situation lays in the palm of their hands.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidence.\"\n\nWhen David Arnesen reported that the other men were so sick they were cutting their shrimping trips short and heading home, his wife knew something strange was happening. Shrimpers work through illness, she says, because a trip cut short can cost a shrimper thousands of dollars.\n\nShe says the men had all the same symptoms at the same time -- vomiting, dizziness, headaches, shortness of breath. Could it be a coincidence?\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidence. It would be one thing if one of them got sick. It would maybe be OK if two got sick,\" she says. \"When everyone's getting sick all at the same time, that's not coincidence\"\n\nWhen asked at a news conference Sunday about people getting sick while out on the Gulf, BP CEO Tony Hayward had his own theory.\n\n\"Food poisoning is clearly a big issue,\" HE said. \"It's something we've got to be very mindful of.\"\n\nArnesen says there's no way her husband and the men on the other boats had fallen victim to food poisoning, noting the men were on eight boats and didn't eat the same food.\n\nThe night her husband became ill, Arnesen says, she tried to get him to come home like the other shrimpers, but he refused. He stayed out fishing from 6 p.m. until 9 a.m. the next morning, and came home so sick he collapsed into his recliner without eating dinner or saying hello to her or the children.\n\n\"It's a nasty cough. I literally woke him up over and over again,\" she says. \"It didn't sound like he was getting enough air.\n\nAt first, David refused to see a doctor, but after three weeks of coughing and feeling weak, he agreed to go. His wife says he was diagnosed with respiratory problems and prescribed medicines, including an antibiotic and cough medicines.\n\nShe says while he's feeling better, he still doesn't have the energy he used to have.\n\n\"Here we are over a month later and he's still not completely well,\" she says.\n\nMasks and marshes\n\nSince CNN aired a story about her Tuesday night, Kindra Arnesen says she's received phone calls from as far away as Texas from people wanting to team up with her to protect coastal communities from the oil.\n\nOne of her immediate goals is to persuade BP to give its workers masks.\n\nGraham MacEwen, a spokesman for BP, says the company isn't providing masks because their air monitoring shows there's no health threats to workers.\n\nHe denied Arnesen's accusations that BP has prevented workers from wearing their own masks, saying workers may do so as long as they read training materials on how to use a mask safely.\n\nArnesen is also working to have BP fund an effort to put sandbags along the marshes in her area to keep the oil out.\n\n(Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal announced Wednesday that the White House has ordered BP to fund Louisiana's plan to dredge up walls of sand along its coast.)\n\nArnesen says she is indeed scared that her husband will lose her job now that she's speaking out.\n\n\"Am I scared? Yes,\" she said. \"Anything that ever starts, starts with one. And if I have to be the one then I have to be the one,\" she says.","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/578","id":"703"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.367317,29.2684]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/579","title":"oil spill smell","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/03 13:42:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 03 13:42:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/03 13:42:00 -0400"},"description":"Oil spill smell in #nola medical area this morning RT Smell #oilspill ?

Hinged, so it doesn’t interrupt present operation. (Alternately, a notched clam shell type shovel concept could be brainstormed and utilized). Close hinge with flap to loosely seal seam.  Tall enough to intercept above the oil leak with no bottom (sits on seafloor after closing and with a top with big notch for loose fit around the BOP and cap. Have port in side with variable speed pump to feed liquid to surface. Speed up pumping action to point where there is neutral or  minimal negative or positive  pressure on the containment container. Pump oil to surface to recovery vessel. Use same precautions and concepts to prevent hydride formation.\n\n\nHow To Cut The Drilling Interception Time/depth\n\n\nI believe one can shorten well drilling intercept time by a significant amount by additions to/or changes in the drilling plan. Part of the procedure will prevent further casing blowouts and reduce the depth required to inject the one million, one hundred thousand pound column of mud (actually, only the 9 5/8” diameter portion X 13,000 feet) above the reservoir to counteract hydrostatic pressure, estimated by some at 13,000 psi from the reservoir. With the use of a mud with an overall density of 5.85 instead of 1.67 as is required for a 13,000 foot column, the higher density can be achieved by using depleted uranium powder and as only a 25% component of the mix, the column can be reduced to 3,600 feet in length from 13,000 feet. Combining this with chloroform, a dense fluid, (1.489 specific gravity vs. water at 1.0)  instead of water, would further increase the mud density and required column length of mud. With lead substituted for depleted U, the column length required is still only 5,500 feet long. Again, only a static pressure head is active (~ 13,000 psi ). Change mud composition slowly as proceed with injection. Have interceptor well approach the target well at a vertical upward angle to bring into play the Venturi effect to assist in pushing mud into the well.  With the oil not moving, then an additional amount of the mud mixture designed specifically for this purpose can be injected into the well-slowly- to provide an increase in the safety margin for balancing downward pressure until cement can be added to seal the well.  \n\nFor the mud liquid carrier, Chloroform is produced in nature and is liquid at room temperature, and pressure and which by itself has a higher density than some mud’s (1.489 gm/cc) but its density characteristics with  pressure and temperature, and the earth’s thermal gradient (~+75 degrees Fahrenheit/ mile of depth) may not make it the best candidate for the carrier fluid. Identify the best one by brainstorming. Also, as noted, the solid portion should be looked at under these circumstances where cost is no object, i. e. lead, @11.83g/cc or after an initial injection of lead mud as a buffer, depleted uranium at ~ 19.07 g/cc or a combination.  All of these materials are readily available and safe to use if handled properly. Also, consider adding different chemicals to the water/chloroform that are soluble in them and heavy or may react to form purposeful hydrates, in the presence of methane etc. \n\nContinuation Of Summary\n\nThe BP oil spill is not being handled in a professional and logical manner. In addition to reducing the depth for the interceptor well, the technical problems that could have been identified early on at the blow out protector (BOP) on the sea floor to totally stop the flow of oil are described. Then, how each of these problems could have been met with proper brain-storming techniques. Next, how BP seems to have missed the boat on some of these aspects. Then an overview of some equipment or procedures to address these technical problems. Then some bells and whistles one should include on one equipment concept. Then a critique of some of the deficiencies I have identified in BP’s work based on information I have read and TV reports  and BP write-ups and videos I have seen. Then some second guessing and what might have been. Then, problems with BP’s approach to this specific problem. Next, what an oil company’s philosophy might be for moving forward and what can the US government do to more proactively work toward more quickly finding solutions to the spill.  Lastly, my credentials for making these statements. \n\n* * indicates the idea under discussion can be expanded and/or additional ideas, examples or concepts can be provided by the author.\n\n\n\n\nThe drilling depth to intercept is based on the height of the mud column needed to balance the static and dynamic oil pressure. Instead use the drilling records for drill speed, rock density etc to determine the safe depth below which there is no concern for case integrity in the event a rupture of the casing has taken place. * *\n\n One other point. If I can come up with a basis for drilling to a shallower depth (time) for interception, others may have too- with even better suggestions. Has BP started a shallow interception well as a backup and for redundancy? They need to.\n\n\n\nSome Concerns Regarding The Present Design Of The BOP.\n\nHaving heard that the well casing may have failed when mud was injected under high pressure, who can say that it might or might not have failed if the BOP had been activated and it performed as planned? Oil would be leaking into the seabed without any indication of failure. \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNeedless to say. No, maybe it does need to be said. The people who are responsible for this program to date have not exhibited the proper amount of caution when making decisions until only very recently. They apparently have taken the magnitude of the event as an indication that they must bow to public pressure and get something done- even if it turns out to be only partially effective or wrong. Use caution. Listen. Test where possible. Use actual models, not just computer ones. Brainstorm properly. In my experience as a researcher these are critical to a true understanding of what is going on.\n\nTechnical Problems.\n \n1.\tFrom before the start, BP should have had a plan. From the start BP should have been thinking about putting in place a system on the ocean floor that would be anchored and allow easy positioning of objects they brought down to the BOP, the blow-out preventer. An anchored incrementally movable cable system of some sort with sensors. Or like a frame that is like the female part of a socket so that once in place, new containment equipment could be easily positioned.  Also, samples of oil and venting gas to calculate gas fraction, determine oil density, chemical characteristics, particle content, particle hardness, friability, compressability, flow characteristics, corrosion characteristic, etc. The latter may have been done but how soon? Then when they formed, an analysis of the hydrates. More on this later. In other words, there should have been an emergency plan in place before drilling began to quickly provide direction and have in place or at least on hand material, people and assignments in the event of a disaster. There obviously wasn’t a good one.\n2.\tThe major problem should not have involved trying to siphon off part of the flow of oil. The major problem is stopping the flow.\n3.\tRe sawing off the tube, which could have ended up being a disaster. As any woodsman knows, hollow wood branches or even solid ones are going to most likely pinch the blade unless you stabilize the branch or pull it apart as you saw. A laser or welding torch approach would probably have been better. BP may have been lucky they were able to fully make the cut with the shear.* *\n4.\tOne needs to place something over/ around/ under or in the emitting tube or physically reduce the size of the opening to be able to slow and then stop the oil flow in a controlled manner. \n5.\tBP hasn’t to date totally addressed the problem of how do you get a cap on the oil when it is coming out at a pressure to produce a flow rate of  over six hundred and forty thousand gallons of oil a day (7 ½ gallons per second) from a column that is a couple of miles long/tall. Plus millions of cubic  feet of gas It is like a kid trying to place a closed nozzle on a flowing garden hose. So they ended up opening up the nozzle and managed to physically hold a  leaky “miss-threaded” cap in place but they now have to siphon a portion off. Knowing they might be successful in capturing large amounts of oil, why didn’t they have that capacity in place on standby?   Who is involved in logistics?\n6.\tThey still haven’t really put the cap on the tube, they have just moved the capping location away from the BOP head. \n7.\tThe problem here is static pressure  (momentum or dynamic pressure is minimal). One has to realize that that several mile long column of incompressible oil pressure needs to be addressed slowly. One cannot go to zero or negative velocity instantly. It has to be done slowly. An analogy is “How do you catch a speeding bullet? ”You surely don’t put your hand over it and try and stop it.” I heard on TV earlier that literally thousands of gallons of mud were forced down the tube at high pressure and rate in the “top kill” exercise. And then the procedure was quickly shut down due to something being amiss. I heard an earlier BP video where the Engineer in charge bragged about their high pressure/high volume capacity for this exercise. Under the pumping conditions described, the friction effects and the long column of uncompressible oil  and compressed gas, raised the pressure in the tube to the point apparently where it exceeded the rupture strength of the drill pipe casing along a portion of the pipe. I do not understand how this could be allowed to happen, but it apparently did. This concept is taught in freshman Statics. A basic Mechanical Engineering exercise. \n8.\tThe solution then is to fit some kind of device around or in the pipe that may leak at first and that doesn’t restrict the flow in any way and then by increments, fix the leak(s)…. \n9.\tand eventually address the main flow out of the tube in such a way that the size of the flow stream is made smaller and smaller until it is finally cut off. And monitor the pressure and don’t let it exceed the critical value. \n10.\tObviously, it is important to monitor other important factors so one can slow down or adjust procedures in the event the system becomes unstable.\n11.\tHow might it become unstable? For example, if the equipment exceeds its pressure rating or if it were to shift allowing oil to flow out of new leaks created by the shift. \n12.\tIt is important to have overkill and redundancy built into the equipment and sensors. \n13.\t It is important to have a method of capturing or reducing the size of leaks in a controlled systematic manner that the flow of oil at high pressure, velocity and volume has negligible impact on the process as it proceeds. In other words we don’t want to try and cap the oil we want the oil pressure to help, not hinder the process of slowing then stopping the oil flow if at all possible. The system needs to be stable, once it is in place, and not move. This can be done in stages.\n14.\tThe system needs to have methods of introducing “mud” and cement to the desired locations and at the proper time to eventually cap the well.\n\n\nWhat might have been proposed before BP began their poorly conceived and exercised capping concept is the following:\n\nEquipment. \n\nIf the well pipe extending out of the BOP has not been cut too short, drill small holes for inserting pressure and velocity gages. Then place a swagger over the end of the pipe and slowly swage it closed using a pointer swagger. The swagger will not interfere with the oil stream and as the tube is concentrically swaged, the flow and pressure can be monitored. Further, the wall thickness will increase as swaging proceeds so that the danger for rupture or expansion at this location will decrease as swaging proceeds.  However, it appears to be too short even for this. If longer, a conventional tube swagger might have been used. The swagger would have to be pressurized of course and pneumatically operated. Too bad this contingency wasn’t allowed for.* *\n\nBF Deficiencies.\n\nI have only watched a couple of BP’s video’s. And a couple of updates, They really don’t get it. There has been no sense of urgency. From the president on down. The words sometimes aren’t even right. The president wants everyone to see that he is on top of everything. He isn’t. The “This  is the first time this has been attempted at a mile underwater” is of no importance. If BP had had a real tested plan and had thought ahead working at these depths would be old hat. BP stated they are working with the smartest brains in America. The experts in their fields. I see several things wrong. Their list of experts is apparently outdated and they have not picked  all of the right fields of expertise. Also, their experts either have big egos and can’t work together or they have poor leadership. I assume the latter.  I have seen no evidence of their brainpower until recently when vents were discussed and a legitimate cautious tone was taken following the “Top Kill” attempt. \n\nI saw the BP video with the white box. Actually I think it had been gotten from another shallow water project. It had to be painted white I guess so it could be seen. How long does it take to find it and get it to the site? Does it take a day or more to let it dry?  Then when it failed because of hydrates plugging up the “siphon tube” it was set aside on the sea floor.  So if they decide they need it again they will have to bring it up to modify it. Hydrates. Plugging.  Isn’t this what one eventually wants to do? So, can you enhance the effect and make it happen so much it reduces the oil flow and potentially even stops it until the interceptor drilling does it’s job?  Can one use an analysis of the hydrates to add to the seawater around the box, or if they had thought to place ports in the box, inject hydrate material directly into the box so the solution is supersaturated? I also heard from the chief engineer that the seawater around the box was about 30 degrees, below freezing for fresh water, but above it for seawater and they were using methanol to reduce hydrates. Two things. What would injecting or blanketing fresh water around the box do? Would it make ice? Would pumping liquid nitrogen to or into the box freeze even seawater or make the hydrate formation even “better”? Certainly it might make the oil more viscous. I heard brainstorming was done and explained after a reporters question re golf balls and tire pieces and towels. It was acknowledged that that was what was going to be used. So they could then inject mud that would stay put. “Top Kill”. First off, that is a poor excuse for brainstorming.* * My first thoughts off the top were metallic Velcro, Velcro with both hooks and loops on every piece. Then that box that is sitting on the seafloor could have all kinds of hooky catchy things welded to the inside. So as they injected material they would get caught onto it. Then treble fish hooks. Then why release stuff into the box without holding on to it and being able to move it up and down in the oil stream. So go fishing with hooks on a cable. With bobbers and vanes in order to direct them. Then umbrellas to open up in the oil flow. All attached to cables? Then Velcro covered bucky balls.  Then a scrap yard electro-magnet attached to the box, or several and inject iron objects which would be held in the box. And on and on.\n\nAnother thing that was particularly disturbing was the answer to the question about help from people outside BP. Something like yes, we have gotten thousands of suggestions but of course we have thought of most of them. A typical NOT INVENTED HERE answer. How could anyone have a solution better than ours? We are the experts. On brainstorming one should encourage answers, not discourage them. Very poor PR too. * *\n\nSecond Guessing. What Might Have Been Done.\n\nIsn’t it criminal to have a system so complicated and expensive that you can’t afford to test it and provide instructions that TWO upper management people must “Push the Button”? And have something that could fail? And did with no backup? Even in spite of warnings? Why wasn’t management looking for a better system? A system that was simple, not costly to test periodically and had some redundancy. A non ‘all or nothing’ system? I think I know what that system is but why don’t they? * * At the least why didn’t someone think about what would happen under the conditions where a blowout could occur. As it did. How could this disaster have been minimized and lives saved?\n\nSimple.\n\nTHE REASON THE PLATFORM SANK AND PROBABLY LIVES WERE LOST IS BECAUSE THE FIRE WAS FUELED WITH OIL FROM THE WELL AND PIPE TO THE PLATFORM.  IF THAT PIPE HAD BEEN SEVERED, AUTOMATICALLY, ON RECEIVING THE SIGNAL FROM A SENSOR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO FUEL TO FEED THE FIRE. AND IF A CONTAINMENT DEVICE HAD BEEN IN PLACE AROUND THE WELL-HEAD THERE WOULD BE NO OIL SPILL TO SPEAK OF. AND, EVEN AFTER THE FIRE STARTED, THERE WERE TWO+ DAYS BEFORE THE PLATFORM  SANK * *\n\nProblems With BP’s Approach to This Specific Problem.\n\nThe main problem I find with BP’s approach is they placed no or little value on anything except money when they didn’t have to. Everything we have seen is all a façade. Image. Image. Image. No real integrity. They don’t really know what they are doing as it has nothing to do with the routine job of oil drilling but they would like our government and the public to think they do. \n\n\n\nPhilosophy.\n\nI worked at Alcoa when Paul O’Neal was President. He set as a goal for everyone in the company the goal of safety and being a good community neighbor. And he meant it. He fired a VP once who allowed a site to become polluted and he also made sure that every accident or near miss was autopsied. And a correction was made so that it couldn’t happen again. And accident rates dropped and continue to drop. I heard Rand Paul has said that the BP incident was an accident. It wasn’t With BP’s set of priorities. It was bound to happen sooner or later. It didn’t need to happen but it did. An indication it was going to, was the number of violations found in the BP Texas refinery disaster. I understand more than 50 times the next highest number recorded by a competitor. Who is to blame for all of this? In my mind the first to blame is the president of BP. The second is the board who hired him. On moving forward I would like to see every oil company held accountable to standards of safety that are moving targets and require ongoing commitments of money and resources to safety and environmental protection including research programs that address prevention and better, faster and more complete cleanup solutions. And not just mechanical devices but other off the wall approaches including dispersant development and testing, microbe testing, where the oil goes, how to recapture it and so on. And the oil company pays out of their oil profits. \n\nWhat Can The US Government Do To More Proactively Find Solutions To The Spill?  \n\nI have been in research all of my professional life. It is disappointing to me to see some aspects of basic research being conducted in an esoteric fashion such that to find a practical use is below the researcher. For example, if one is working in a high purity metal system, isn’t it more practical to work in a system that allows the results to be used by the companies production divisions who in both the short term and long term financially support the research? There is a lot of research being conducted under the sponsorship of the US government that could be pointed toward finding solutions to many of the environmental problems the gulf faces. And it might be beneficial to us all to have the government place incentives on certain area’s of effort.  \nAlso, we have a new energy resource that has just been identified to have reserves that will last decades. I believe the government should mandate use of shale natural gas in vehicles and for other energy requirements where it can be substituted for oil and oil bi-products, I have numerous other thought regarding the cleanup but this too long already.  * * Also, about a better BOP system.  * *  I’d be happy to talk about any of this.\n\nFinally as part of a restitution plan use income tax statements to determine prior income related to anything that has been curtailed by the spill and have BP fund a fraction of this money back to affected citizens.\n \nI hope this information is communicated by you and others to other people with the where-with-all to make things happen. I believe this paper identifies some of the real problems that have not been addressed and contains practical solutions that can be implemented quickly and perhaps will provide guidance to prevent further problems.\n\n\n\nCredentials.\n\nI am a retired PhD in Metallurgical Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Physics.

The lower part of the three part cylinder fits inside the cofferdam and the upper portion extends above the tube from which the oil is emitting. \n4.\tThe lower stage fits down into the cofferdam and about 2/3 the way up the BOP and is fitted with numerous hydraulic cylinders facing inward up and down and around the circumference of the lower portion of the three stage cylinder that can be activated slowly in tandem from four or more points of the compass, north, south, east, west at once. This is so that the overall cylinder can be mechanically stabilized by pushing from all sides on the BOP. \n5.\tA schematic of the BOP should be used to determine which hydraulic cylinders to active first as there are welded on pipes and flanges on the BOP. This is in order to prevent shifting of the three stage cylinder during activation of the hydraulic cylinders. \n6.\tAt the top of the lower section are baffles that directs any oil that is leaking around the tube toward the openable and closable vents that are around the periphery of stage two of the three stage cylinder. They start out open.  They are of a size to minimize any back pressure. At the juncture between section one and two there is a “rubber” gasket that prevents the majority of the oil from going down into the lower section so that this lower section is filled either with seawater or oil that is relatively stagnant. There are ports in the lower section so that first mud and then a catalytic cement can be injected at the appropriate time to fill the lower portion of the cylinder. \n7.\tOnce the cylinder is in place and the hydraulic cylinders have been activated inward, shot will be placed between the lower part of the cylinder and cofferdam to act as a partial seal. Then enough mud will be injected to complete the seal and finally the cement will be added to complete the stabilization of the three part cylinder. The shot may be mixed with small pieces of cellophane or rubber balloons etc. to enhance the seal. The cement will also provide additional stability to the cylinder as there are protrusions from the BOP and provide redundancy in the event one or more of the hydraulic cylinders fails with time. There will be stresses placed on the cylinder during the final stage of reducing flow from closing the upper portion of the tube that need to be addressed. \n8.\tOnce the cement has set and the cylinder is stable motion wise, it will be time to close the vents in the middle section of the cylinder. At this point there will be no motion of the oil although it may be under some elevated pressure due to any friction conditions that exist concerning the upper portion of the cylinder. Once the vents are closed, in the second section, a valve in the second section can be activated and the same type of cement as used before can be employed to fill stage two of the cylinder under high pressure, further stabilizing the cylinder. \n9.\tOnce this cement has set up, work can begin on the third stage of the cylinder.\n10.\tThe description of the third stage of the cylinder is simple. It is of simple design. Namely, it is a cylinder of perhaps almost no flair (remember the upper portion of stage two was tapered to provide a seated fit) then flairs out to one half to one inch clearance that extends maybe two to three inches to a foot beyond the end of the tube which is gushing oil. \n11.\tOn the end of the cylinder is a valve which is infinitely adjustable as to how open it is.  It should start fully open. When fully open it should provide no impingement on the oil flowing out of the tube. The thickness of the cylinder and welds material should provide a triple or more than usual safety factor for pressure based on fully annealed material. If possible the material should be thick enough that it won’t exceed it’s fatigue limit. If possible all material and welds should be stress relieved.  The valve(s) should be of such a design that the high pressure oil should not impede it’s operation. And it should be such that if the mechanical, hydraulic or electric closing operation should fail, it will slowly close automatically and provide a positive seal like a butterfly valve. However, if the calculated critical pressure for rupture is approached the closure should stop. For redundancy it may be desirable to have two or more of these in series in the event one were to fail. On the side of this third stage of the cylinder will again be incorporated high pressure inlet ports so that mud can be slowly pumped into the throat of the tube as needed to reduce the pressure followed by the appropriate cement to seal the well.    \n\nBells and Whistles\n\n1.\tTwo adjustable crossing cables with load cells to hang across to the other side of the BOP so that loads can be monitored by tightening the cables. These could be placed such that the protrusions on the BOP act as anchor locations for the cables as they are tightened. The load cells would then alert one to any shifting of the three stage cylinder.\n2.\tPressure gauges in each stage of the cylinder. \n3.\tStress gauges at numerous critical points on the cylinder.\n4.\tQuick snap easy release high pressure fittings. \n5.\tVelocity meters in throat of third stage and elsewhere.\n6.\tVibration meters to make sure no harmonics are set up.\n7.\tIndependent non backward flow valves for the hydraulic cylinders.\n8.\tPosition meters to positively identify the valve open amount and   position.\n9.\tTemperature sensors. \n10.\tMud sensors. \n11.\tCement sensors. Ultrasound?? Resistance meters?\n12.\tFurther larger cylindrical cap to further encapsulate the total system to be filled with cement once the system is sealed.","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/863","id":"732"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.066406,30.675715]}},{"properties":{"title":"Simple methods to clean up oil slick","guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/866","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 00:57:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 00:57:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 00:57:00 -0400"},"description":"The following are some suggested methods to clean up both large and near shore oil slicks.\n \n http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AeZfEkgmBH37ZG5jNDl4el85N2ZzdG1mdGRq&amp;hl=en (New oilspill)\n\n http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AeZfEkgmBH37ZG5jNDl4el8xMDBjaHY1Mjlncw&amp;hl=en (near shore)","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/866","id":"733"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.987294,29.236617]}},{"properties":{"title":"awful  smell","guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/867","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 01:31:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 01:31:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 01:31:00 -0400"},"description":"I work in Destin and live  in  Niceville  Florida.\nThe smell  today was the  the worse day yet!\nI  could hardly stand it and worried if it was toxic or not,\nI was surprised this  smell was still in the  air in Niceville  as well,about  25 miles from the beach in Destin.\nIm really worried for my children s health playing outside.","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/867","id":"734"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.460202,30.501563]}},{"properties":{"title":"human disaster relief?/mitigation","guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/868","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/18 01:22:01 -0400","original":"Fri Jun 18 01:22:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/18 01:22:00 -0400"},"description":"Considering the likely toxicity of air,  disruption of services etc. relating to this unprecedented Chemical Spill,  it would seem that FEMA would be obligated by Presidential Directive 5(HSPD-5) to institute a N.I.M.S. response with regard to the human hazards apparent in N.O.

NOAA is currently in the process of conducting thorough testing to determine the circumstances surrounding the mammal’s death, as well as collect information about its life. This is the first dead whale reported since BP’s rig exploded on April 20. It was not found in oiled waters; however, its location of death is unknown.\n\nAs soon as the whale was sighted, Pisces Field Party Chief Paul Felts called the marine mammal hotline to report the finding to the Wildlife Branch of the Unified Command and NOAA’s marine mammal experts.\n\n\nBased on the estimated size of the whale, scientists believe it is a sub-adult. Its condition suggests it may have been dead for between several days to more than a week. Although it was not found in oiled water, NOAA marine mammal experts are using hindcasting analysis to look into the location from which the whale carcass may have drifted.\n\nWhile it is impossible to confirm whether exposure to oil was the cause of death, NOAA is reviewing whether factors such as ship strikes and entanglement can be eliminated. Samples collected from this carcass will be stored under proper protocols and handed off when the Pisces comes to port on July 2, or possibly if another boat is sent to meet the Pisces. Full analysis of the samples will take several weeks.\n\nIn accordance with the Wildlife Branch protocols, NOAA’s Southeast Regional Marine Mammal Stranding Coordinator Blair Mase requested that the NOAA field crew take photographs of the approximately 25-foot whale, collect skin swab for oil analysis, collect blubber and skin samples for analysis, and measure its height in the water. Although the whale is very decomposed, the photographs and samples will help scientists better understand how long it has been dead. The blubber and skin samples will be used for genetic analysis and to determine the sex of the animal. Measurements of the whale floating in the water will be used to determine how far and how fast it might have floated from where it died. The carcass has been marked so that aerial reconnaissance teams will be able to identify the individual and will not report it as a new mortality.\n\nNOAA and the Unified Command Wildlife Branch have had numerous reports of sperm whales seen swimming in the oil, but this is the first confirmed report of a dead whale since the BP oil spill began. NOAA remains concerned about sperm whales, which are the only endangered resident cetaceans in the upper Gulf of Mexico. Sperm whales spend most of their time in the upper Gulf offshore area, live at depth in areas where subsurface dispersants and oil are present, and feed on deepwater squid, which may also be impacted by the oil and dispersants.\n\nThe NOAA Ship Gordon Gunter sailed yesterday for a multi-week cruise to do photo identification, assessments, tagging, biopsies, and prey-density studies for sperm whales and Bryde’s whales. Nearshore and offshore response efforts are continuing, and include investigations to determine cause of death or illness for dolphins that have stranded and aerial surveys for cetaceans throughout the area.  The information gained from these efforts will help assess the impacts of this event on cetaceans in the Gulf of Mexico.","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/893","id":"738"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.286133,27.76133]}},{"properties":{"title":"Bird nesting grounds threatened by oil overtopping booms. queen bess island","guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/894","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 17:58:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 17:58:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 17:58:00 -0400"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBird nesting grounds threatened by oil overtopping booms. queen bess island","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/894","id":"739"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.957572,29.304948]}},{"properties":{"title":"Excessive oil in the jetties on grand terre","guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/895","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 16:52:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 16:52:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 16:52:00 -0400"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nExcessive oil in the jetties on grand terre","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/895","id":"740"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.895626,29.302447]}},{"properties":{"title":"Oily bird","guid":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/9","published":{"end_time":"2010/04/30 08:05:01 -0400","original":"Fri Apr 30 08:05:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/04/30 08:05:00 -0400"},"description":"Oily bird found in Fort Jackson in Plaquemines Parish","link":"http://ushahidi.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/9","id":"741"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.455,29.357778]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1126","title":"Smells like oil in mid city","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/01 16:59:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jul 01 16:59:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/01 16:59:00 -0400"},"description":"Smells like oil in mid city.

Research scientists are tagging the giant animals to study their fate in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nThe three sharks did not appear distressed and their white-spotted hides were not visibly oiled, said Steve Gittings of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who saw them on a flight Monday to locate oiled sea turtles for rescuers in boats.\n\n\"Don't get the picture that these looked like those pelicans you see photographs of,\" he said.\n6\n0\n89Share\n\nBut oil can clog their gills and suffocate them as they swim at the surface, and they will swallow oil if they feed in it, said John Carlson, fisheries biologist in NOAA's wildlife section.\n\n\"They look like skimmer boats when they're feeding,\" Carlson said.\n\nGittings said the three whale sharks he saw, which he estimated at about 25 feet long, were about four miles from the sunken Deepwater Horizon, in an area where skimmer boats were slurping the heaviest oil.\n\n\"There's no continuous area of heavy oil. But there's so many streamers they couldn't avoid swimming through those streamers,\" he said.\n\nThe question now is how many of the creatures are dying in the oil, said Eric Hoffmayer of the University of Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast Research Lab, who has studied whale sharks in the northern Gulf since 2002.\n\n\"Taking mouthfuls of thick oil is not conducive to them surviving,\" he said.\n\nHoffmayer has found that many of the northern Gulf's whale sharks feed off the mouth of the Mississippi River; the Deepwater Horizon site is about 40 miles southeast of the river.\n\n\"That basically confirms our worst fear: These animals do not know to stay away from the oil,\" Hoffmayer said.\n\nScientists on a teleconference Wednesday agreed there isn't any known way to make whale sharks swim away from oil, the way air cannon can be used to scare birds from airports, Gittings and Carlson said.\n\nAbout all that can be done to protect them is make sure heavy oil is burned and skimmed from areas they might swim into, Carlson said.\n\nThey're easy to recognize; each is up to about 40 feet long and black with rows of white spots.\n\nBut there won't be any way to tell how many die. Sharks don't float.\n\n\"If they do die from the oil, they're going to sink to the bottom,\" Hoffmayer said.\n\nwhale-sharks-oil-spill-lots.JPGUniversity of Southern Mississippi Gulf Coast Research Laboratory via APMore than 100 whale sharks surround a research vessel in the Gulf of Mexico on June 21.\n\nNews of whale sharks in the oil came less than a week after a huge group was spotted elsewhere off the Louisiana coast where oil had not yet been found. One aerial photograph showed dozens of them.\n\n\"It blew my mind. There were probably more than a hundred sharks,\" Hoffmayer said.\n\nThe group seen June 21 was about 70 miles southwest of Port Fourchon, and about 60 miles from the western edge of the spill as shown on a federal map, he said.\n\nHoffmayer said it was hard to say whether the three seen Monday were from that group because the animals can travel more than 60 miles in a day.\n\n\"I've got a feeling that until whatever the food source they found disappears, they're not going to want to go,\" he said.\n\nNobody knows just how many whale sharks exist. They're on the World Conservation Union's \"red list\" of threatened species, but not on any U.S. list of threatened or endangered species. Federal law does ban killing them for sport or commercial use, Carlson said.\n\nHoffmayer said the animals can dive a mile deep, and could escape any effort to herd them away from the oil.\n\nLast week's spotting came as part of a two-day excursion organized by the director of a documentary being filmed about marine biologist Sylvia Earle, founder of the Mission Blue Foundation.\n\nHoffmayer said four of the sharks were tagged.\n\nBy Janet McConnaughey, Associated Press writer\n\nRelated topics: oil spill gulf of mexico 2010\n\nSponsored Links\n\nShare this story\nStory tools\n\nMore stories in 2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill\nPrevious story\nHouse spending bill, including $304 million related to oil spill, clears key hurdle\nNext story\nNOAA Gulf of Mexico oil spill trajectory forecasts for Friday through Sunday\n\n6\nComments Feed\nView: Oldest first | Newest first\nOilfield2010\nPattonAU July 02, 2010 at 12:51AM\nFollow\n\nHere is the original story (with Video) from al.com\n\nhttp://blog.al.com/live/2010/06/whale_sharks_unable_to_avoid_o.html\n\nWhat does T-P do?

My skin has become oily and I rub off blackened skin from my neck to my chest and shoulders exposed to the outdoor elements.

I wish I knew where to go on the internet to see what the VOC levels are for the methane being released in the Gulf from the BP oil spill on April 20. I am concerned my health has been affected by the chemicals coming from the BP Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico. I know others here have the same experiences with their plants and health. No one seems to have a website to show the monitoring levels of chemicals being released over Florida. Even the CDC does not report levels of the VOCs; only what the health risks of being exposed are to these chemicals. WHY? I am scared that we are getting exposed to poisoned chemicals here. Please help us. I want to leave this area soon. We wrote to Senator Nelson twice about these concerns last month and no response from him yet.

By Monday, the blobs of oil had washed ashore as far west as Treasure Isle in Slidell.\n42\n0\n327Share\n\nCleanup crews used nets to scoop up the tar balls throughout the day, collecting more than 1,000 pounds of oil and waste. BP also deployed 19 manual skimming vessels and four decontamination vessels to the area, and placed 600-feet of hard and soft boom at a choke point in the Rigolets to prevent more oil from entering the lake. Cleanup efforts are expected to resume today.\n\nLopez said oil made its way into the lake because of winds from the far edges of Hurricane Alex last week as well as sustained east and southeast winds during the weekend. The winds from Alex pushed a large amount of oil into the Mississippi Sound for the first time, and the east winds during the past few days pushed oil into Lake Borgne, the Rigolets and eventually the eastern stretches of Lake Pontchartrain.\n\nWind patterns ultimately will decide the trajectory of oil, but Lopez said the general pattern of circulation in Lake Pontchartrain is counterclockwise, meaning if more oil came in the lake, it generally would travel along the north shore and then possibly loop back around to the south.\n\nAlthough he expects the impacts from oil in the lake to be \"pretty modest,\" Lopez acknowledged that there is a symbolism for the New Orleans area now that oil has reached the lake.\n\n\"It's kind of like it's coming to home now.\"\n\nCiting the new reports of oil, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries on Monday issued precautionary fishing closures in parts of Lake Pontchartrain and in Lake Borgne, Lake St. Catherine, the passes and surrounding areas. The state's Department of Health and Hospitals also closed all oyster harvesting areas east of the Mississippi River, which includes Lake Borgne.\n\nSo far, the oil that has entered the Rigolets and the lake has been in small amounts and has been weathered greatly after traveling a long distance from the well site. The geography of eastern Lake Pontchartrain also has played a role in keeping most of the oil out, with narrow passes such as the Rigolets preventing a full flow from Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound.\n\n\"It has a fairly tortuous route to get to the lake, and that's why we're at day 70-something of the spill, and we're just seeing the oil reach Lake Pontchartrain,\" Lopez said. \"This oil we're seeing probably headed east toward Alabama and Florida before it came this way. It's traveled probably at least 100-200 miles, depending on how far east it went.\"","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1251","id":"783"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.754915,30.18559]}},{"properties":{"title":"7 gallonsof tar balls collected on Bolivar Peninsula and Galveston Island","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1252","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/06 04:55:01 -0400","original":"Tue Jul 06 04:55:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/06 04:55:00 -0400"},"description":"TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) -- Tar balls from the Gulf oil spill found on a Texas beach were the first evidence that gushing crude from the Deepwater Horizon well has reached all the Gulf states.\nGULF OIL SPILLAP Photo/ Hattiesburg American, Ryan MooreOil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the beach in Pass Christian, Miss., on Sunday.\n\n \n\nA Coast Guard official said on Monday that it was possible that the oil hitched a ride on a ship and was not carried naturally by currents to the barrier islands of the eastern Texas coast, but there was no way to know for sure.\n24\n0\n26Share\n\nThe amount discovered is tiny compared to what has coated beaches so far in the hardest-hit parts of the Gulf Coast in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. It still provoked the quick dispatch of cleaning crews and a vow that BP will pay for the trouble.\n\n\"Any Texas shores impacted by the Deepwater spill will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab,\" Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said in a news release.\n\nThe oil's arrival in Texas was predicted Friday by an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which gave a 40 percent chance of crude reaching the area.\n\n\"It was just a matter of time that some of the oil would find its way to Texas,\" said Hans Graber, a marine physicist at the University of Miami and co-director of the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing.\n\nAbout five gallons of tar balls were found Saturday on the Bolivar Peninsula, northeast of Galveston, said Capt. Marcus Woodring, the Coast Guard commander for the Houston/Galveston sector. Two gallons were found Sunday on the peninsula and Galveston Island, though tests have not yet confirmed its origin.\n\nWoodring said the consistency of the tar balls indicates it's possible they could have been spread to Texas water by ships that have worked out in the spill. But there's no way to confirm the way they got there.\n\nThe largest tar balls found Saturday were the size of pingpong balls, while the ones Sunday were more like nickels and dimes.\n\nGalveston Mayor Joe Jaworski said he believed the tar balls were a fluke, rather than a sign of what's to come.\n\n\"This is good news,\" he said. \"The water looks good. We're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly.\"\n\nThe distance between the western reach of the tar balls in Texas and the most eastern reports of oil in Florida is about 550 miles. Oil was first spotted on land near the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 29.\n\nThe spill is reaching deeper into Louisiana. Strings of oil were seen Monday in the Rigolets, one of two waterways that connect the Gulf with Lake Pontchartrain, the large lake north of New Orleans.\n\n\"So far it's scattered stuff showing up, mostly tar balls,\" said Louisiana Office of Fisheries Assistant Secretary Randy Pausina. \"It will pull out with the tide, and then show back up.\"\n\nPausina said he expected the oil to clear the passes and move directly into the lake, taking a backdoor route to New Orleans.\n\nThe news of the spill's reach comes at a time that most of the offshore skimming operations in the Gulf have been halted by choppy seas and high winds. A tropical system that had been lingering off Louisiana flared up Monday afternoon, bringing heavy rain and winds.\n\nForecasters at the National Hurricane Center said there had been a 60 percent chance the system could blow into a tropical storm. But that was reduced later Monday to almost no chance because the storm had moved over land.\n\nLast week, the faraway Hurricane Alex idled the skimming fleet off Alabama, Florida and Mississippi with choppy seas and stiff winds. Now they're idled by smaller storms that could last well into this week.\n\nOfficials have plans for the worst-case scenario: a hurricane barreling up the Gulf toward the spill site. But the less-dramatic weather conditions have been met with a more makeshift response.\n\nSkimming operations across the Gulf have scooped up about 23.5 million gallons of oil-fouled water so far, but officials say it's impossible to know how much crude could have been skimmed in good weather because of the fluctuating number of vessels and other variables.\n\nThe British company has now seen its costs from the spill reach $3.12 billion, a figure that doesn't include a $20 billion fund for damages the company created last month.\n\nThe storms have not affected drilling work on a relief well that BP says is the best chance for finally plugging the leak. The company expects drilling to be finished by mid-August.\n\n___","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1252","id":"784"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.883185,29.247749]}},{"properties":{"title":"Tar balls and sheen on Cat Island south","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1253","published":{"end_time":"2010/07/06 04:17:01 -0400","original":"Tue Jul 06 04:17:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/07/06 04:17:00 -0400"},"description":"Tar balls 1-5cm &gt;1% coverage, surface sheen, light petroleum odor.  4 unoiled pelicans on buoy.

Five of these sightings were on the water and 24 were shoreline or marsh impact. Several of these sightings included impact to wildlife with either oiled or deceased birds. Cleanup task forces were deployed to the Chandeluer Islands yesterday, which had confirmed shoreline impact. Rapid Assessment vessels with U.S. Coast Guard Pollution Investigators are working in cooperation with Air Operations, who will contact these vessels directly and immediately in the event of an oil sighting. Vessels are deployed to impacted areas to fortify these areas with hard and soft absorbent boom, and recovery vessels have also been deployed to these areas to assess impact and remediation activities. Skimming will be conducted where possible in these areas.   \n \nThere was an oil sighting on Tuesday that could not be confirmed by a pollution investigator, as it had apparently disappeared and could not be verified. There is now shoreline impact in the same area, a 100-foot long oiling near Point Lydia, evidence of submerged oil in parish waters. St. Bernard Parish President Craig Taffaro directed operations personnel to institute a program to track submerged oil. Local fishermen have begun constructing and deploying “sentinel snare booms,” which are snare or “pom pom” boom stretching from a buoy to an anchor, thus covering the entire water column, in anywhere from 6-foot to 12-foot depths. These snare booms are being placed 300 feet apart just outside of the Chandeleur Islands to detect how oil is getting into parish waters.\n \nAt the direction of President Taffaro, testing is being conducted this morning on existing technology to remediate oiled marsh. If this technology proves to be successful, operations will be able to use this process to begin cleaning oiled marsh areas in parish waters. \n \n###","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/1455","id":"810"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.322695,29.879791]}},{"properties":{"title":"hammerhead shark washed up on Ft.

Two U.S. Coast Guard volunteers and a Florida Department of Environmental Protection officer were involved in the rescue attempt.\n\nTravis said the dolphin was crying as people rushed to save it. She said people scraped oil off the dolphin with their hands.\n\n“It was so sad.

Results from the tests, which were conducted in a Colorado laboratory, indicated the oil was from the Deepwater Horizon well, he said.\n\n“I consider this to be very interesting scientifically, as few samples detect dispersant, much less three of their major ingredients in the same sample,” said Kaltofen.\n\nThe material was collected by a group of scientists working for attorney Stuart Smith, who is representing the Louisiana-based United Commercial Fisherman’s Association and the Louisiana Environmental Action Network in a potential lawsuit regarding damage from the oil spill. The group found the oil about a mile north of Horn Island on Aug. 9.\n\n“EPA samples found only one indication of dispersant near shore in Louisiana. That location was sampled several times with no other detection,” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Terri White said in a Monday e-mail. “There is no authorization to apply any dispersant at this time. If anyone has information about this, they need to report it immediately so it can be investigated and referred to law enforcement.”\n\nJerry Moran, a New Orleans-based photographer who accompanied the group to document the sampling effort, said that the material looked unlike anything he’d seen during months of photographing the spill.\n\n“We saw birds diving over a patch of oil. I’d never seen it that thick before. It looked like cauliflower. I had never seen it that texture before,” Moran said. “There was a rainbow sheen around us, a really thick, colorful sheen.”\n\nPress-Register reporters encountered a similar material — strangely textured oil with a pronounced sheen — in Mobile Bay and Mississippi Sound several times in July and early August. The day before Moran’s group found the dispersant and oil mix, the Press-Register documented oil in a marsh on Horn Island.\n\nBP and federal officials said that dispersants have not been used in the Gulf since July 19.\n\nSmith, the lawyer who funded Kaltofen’s sampling expedition, discounted the notion that dispersants had not been used near shore.\n\n“I personally saw C-130s applying dispersants from my hotel room in the Florida Panhandle. They were spraying directly adjacent to the beach right at dusk,” said Smith. “Fishermen I’ve talked to say they’ve been sprayed. This idea they are not using this stuff near the coast is nonsense.”","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2251","id":"853"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.51668,30.266867]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2252","title":"Oil under the sand at Raccoon Island (link to video)","published":{"end_time":"2010/08/31 13:46:01 -0400","original":"Tue Aug 31 13:46:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/08/31 13:46:00 -0400"},"description":"In the headlines portion of LPB's weekly show last Friday (Aug. 27), Melanie Driscoll of the Audubon Society was on Raccoon Island August 20 and showed LPB's photographer hidden tar balls along the shore when you scratch just below the surface.

The leak was finally capped on July 15.\n\nThe lab posted its data today on the website of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network in a move that could fuel the debate over the status of the cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nParts of the gulf have been reopened to fishing and shrimping after the federal government declared the waters safe.\nFisherman holds up shrimp from Gulf of Mexico\nJohn Moore, Getty Images\nIn the wake of the massive oil spill, is seafood from the Gulf of Mexico safe to eat? The government says yes, but a Boston lab says its findings cast doubt on that assertion.\n\nThe lab's findings \"again point to evidence that the 'all clear' is being sounded way too early,\" said Stuart Smith, attorney for both the fishermen's union and LEAN, which is suing BP on their behalf. \"I do not believe a robust statistical sampling has occurred to prove that it's safe.\"\n\nWater samples analyzed by Boston Chemical show oil and toxins in crab. But the key finding, according to Marco Kaltofen, the lab's president, is the presence of the Corexit dispersant used to break up the oil in coastal water near Horn Island, off Biloxi.\n\nBP has said repeatedly the last day it used any dispersant was July 19. Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Alicia Johnson confirmed the agency believes that to be the case.\n\nBut Kaltofen said the time frame raises a question.\n\n\"Why on Aug. 9 did we find on a relatively concentrated pool of dispersant on the surface, well outside where the dispersant was going to be sprayed? It shouldn't have been there,\" Kaltofen told AOL News. He added that the high concentration in the sample suggested the dispersant was not carried inland from open water.\n\n\"What person or process got this dispersant with such a high concentration into inshore waters?\" Kaltofen said.\n\nFishermen working the gulf say flatly they don't believe that BP actually stopped using the dispersant. But Kaltofen said he has talked to scientists who are searching for a more scientifically sound reason. One possibility: Could the dispersant have reconstituted itself on the surface?\n\n\"We just don't know enough about this yet,\" he said.\n\nIn all, Boston Chem has taken 250 samples from western Louisiana to the Florida Keys. The EPA has taken 300 water samples near shore, and found one \"indication of a possible dispersant constituent near Louisiana,\" according to an e-mail from the agency.\n\n\"The location was sampled several other times with no other detection,\" the agency said, adding that it is continuing to monitor the region for \"any possible safety and health threats.\"\n\nBetween June 27 and July 20, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sampled 153 fish in the area reopened to fishing and is continuing to test samples of fish caught throughout the gulf. NOAA scientists have found no oil in the area reopened for fishing since early July, according to a report by the agency.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that seafood samples from reopened fishing waters have passed sensory testing for contamination with oil and dispersant.\n\nScientific data gathered by the government \"indicate that the dispersants used in the Deepwater Horizon response are unlikely to build up in the flesh of the fish,\" the FDA said. \"This is primarily based on the assessment of their physical properties, which indicate that these compounds do not penetrate the gills or bodies of fish, and will not be concentrated in edible tissues of seafood.\"\n\nThe credibility of an analysis by a firm hired by attorneys suing BP will inevitably be challenged in court by the oil giant. Yet there is so much suspicion about the government's conclusion that much of the oil had disappeared that any report justifying those fears carries added weight.\n\nAnecdotally, fishermen recount episodes where fishermen and cleanup crews have worked the same waters.\n\n\"My cousin was working in Grand Isle. He told me they had people who were shrimping alongside people who were skimming oil,\" said Louis Molero, a Louisiana oysterman.\n\n\"Everybody believes the government is sugar-coating this,\" he said. \"If we get one person sick due to oil, our business is really going to be in a mess.\"","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2265","id":"865"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.650664,30.229936]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2288","title":"New Campaign To Protect Big Oil Profits","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/02 02:44:01 -0400","original":"Thu Sep 02 02:44:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/02 02:44:00 -0400"},"description":"Please disseminate the following everywhere.

But some fishermen suspect the oil is a cause for the amount of empty oyster shells dredged up on the DMR trip.\n\nOyster dredger Minh Tran said it was the first time he’s seen a season like this. He’s been in the oyster business for 10 years.\n\nTran joked he’d be heading to the WIN Job Center or filing for unemployment. He said he has filed a claim with BP to make up for his lost income.\n\n“We all have,” he said of his fellow fishing community.\n\nWhen asked if the money he has received has been enough, he simply shook his head. Tran said he also completed five applications for the Vessels of Opportunity program, but BP used only one of his boats, for 14 days.\n\nSeafood wholesaler Darlene Kimball of Kimball’s Seafood said she has filed a claim with BP twice and has yet to see any payment to make up for her lost income. It’s become frustrating almost to the point of giving up, she said.\n\n“Of course, I can’t afford to give up,” Kimball said.\n\nThe business she runs has been passed down in her family for four generations.\n\n“After Katrina it was bad, but that was because of a hurricane,” she said. Kimball said she’s also had trouble selling the few shrimp that have come in this shrimping season, because consumers are leery of Gulf seafood.\n\n“This is very concerning for me because this is my livelihood,” she said.\n\nGordon said the public’s reluctance about Gulf seafood has been a challenge for those who make their living on the water, but he has no doubts of quality of safety of Mississippi seafood.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s oyster dredge, Gordon pointed out evidence the oysters had been feeding, and the presence of young oysters that could reach legal size by next season.\n\nHe said the dredging DMR conducted Wednesday is only a small sample of the thousands of acres of oyster reefs in Mississippi, so it’s hard to write off the season for sure.\n\nDMR will go out farther in the Sound today to take more samples from the reefs.\n\n\nRead more: http://www.sunherald.com/2010/09/01/2446838/dmr-gulf-sample-shows-abundance.html#ixzz0yUcnkXJr","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2361","id":"874"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.240051,30.354999]}},{"properties":{"title":"Fears of oil in inland waters grow after fish kill (VIDEO)","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2363","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/03 14:38:01 -0400","original":"Fri Sep 03 14:38:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/03 14:38:00 -0400"},"description":"With the Clyde B.

After our first day out on the water with Captain Lori of Dolphin Queen Cruises touring the lagoons around Orange Beach, Alabama, we all had extreme headaches. During our boat tour, dispersant was visible covering the water everywhere. That evening I developed a gagging, coughing reflex that was so intense and persistent it was impossible to speak to my daughter on the phone. The symptoms typical for high levels of chemical exposure such as burning, itching eyes, constantly runny nose, chronic coughing, burning sore throat, chest congestion, and lethargy progressively intensified. Over the next several weeks these symptoms continued to worsen until I developed chemically-induced pneumonitis. Before leaving the area I had blood tests initiated to determine if the levels of exposure were high enough to be be detected. The musical activists Sassafrass and the tireless efforts of Michelle Nix allowed myself and several local residents to have blood drawn and tested by Metametrix for chemical exposure.

We did that and they still forced us out.\"\n\nAt one point this summer there were about 500 P-2-S employees out cleaning the beaches (making between 14 and 22 bucks an hour).\n\nMarcus Hall\n\"They cut us down to 50 people a day. You can't get nothing done with 50 people a day.\"\n\nNow a BP says theyre consolidating and downgrading because of the amount of oil on the beaches.\n\nTina Marie Dwyer\n\"BP wants us to just clean the surface, make it look aesthetically clean. There's so much oil they won't let us clean up.\"\n\n\"This small sample is just a scoop of sand someone picked up here along the edge of the water. Look at what it's done in just a few minutes in the sun- oil melted inside the bag. Clean up workers say the could scoop all day every day and still find this much oil in the sand.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2369","id":"878"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.137467,30.333533]}},{"properties":{"title":"Loss of livelihood and activities","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2381","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/03 18:30:01 -0400","original":"Fri Sep 03 18:30:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/03 18:30:00 -0400"},"description":"From LABB impact survey Port Sulfur 8/5/10: Resident reports that her husband who is a fisherman in Empire was out of work for one week.

On the far side of the road, docked shrimp boats sit quietly along the banks of the bayou. It's Sunday morning, 102 degrees and 80 percent humidity. We're the only things moving.\n\nI weave my way among the labyrinth of markers, stopping here and there to read epitaphs and calculate ages. Then I cross the road to the boats. I want to honor the dead, but I'm interested in the living. The ones still holding on.\n\nOn June 15, eight weeks after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig's explosion began spilling crude into the Gulf of Mexico, Seaside-based photographer Justin Bailie and I began our attempt to face the tragedy in the only ways we knew how.\n\nOur idea was to travel to the Gulf, where we'd spend several weeks learning firsthand about the ecosystem and economy. We planned to talk to people who stood to lose everything, and then to share those conversations, those stories, with people at home. Our goal was to start additional conversations that revolved around how we live, play and work in our shared environment.\n\nWe made the assumption that along the Gulf we would find people like us. Individuals who were motivated by their love of place and unwilling to sit idly by waiting for others to come in and clean up the mess left on their doorstep. In my notes I named the project \"The Cessation of Apathy.\"\n\nIdealistic for sure. Rationally I know that much like the oil that brought us here, apathy isn't easily stopped. Lethargy is hard to beat. But I believe in people.\n\nI believe that overcoming inertia -- getting off the couch, out of the car, into the world and engaging -- is the hardest part. I believe that sometimes outrage and anger have purpose. I believe in loving my neighbor more than myself and in trusting you, him and the other guy to do the same.\n\nMost of all I believe in love. And, following my beliefs to Louisiana, I found it. Or maybe it found me.\n\nA boat feels haunted\n\nI wander near the boats, step onto the small docks where they're tethered, hold on to the pilings and lean out over the murky green water. Below me, tiny fish, maybe sculpins in huge schools, dart in one direction then another as if chased. Behind me a door opens and a man walks out. He sits heavily on the porch as if this effort alone is the limit of what he can bear.\n\nIt's his boat. The one I've been admiring. It's newly painted white with royal blue accents, but down by the waterline the paint has turned grimy with residual oil. BP had hired the man, who asked not to be named, after the spill forced the closure of the fisheries. Working as part of a cleanup crew, he said he had gotten sick from the chemicals used to contain the oil, and after being hospitalized had been forced to abandon his coveted slot. Since then his boat hasn't moved. His eyes begin to tear and spill over as he asks whether I'd like to go aboard.\n\nI would, and I do. Accompanied by his wife, I explore the cabin and decks. They're tidy and well-kept, but the boat feels haunted and sad without purpose. Stepping back on to land, Justin and I are invited to come back later in the week for dinner and a prayer meeting. We're told that no one is ready to give up, pull out, or move on.\n\nScream and be heard\n\nThe exterior of the Southern Sting Tattoo Parlor in Larose, La., is painted with images of the Grim Reaper wearing the BP logo, a portrait of Barack Obama, a dismembered human body and a giant water tower spilling oil. In front of the building, and slightly to the right, a statue of a man wearing a gas mask and holding a sign saying, \"God help us all,\" has been erected. It's the work of the parlor's owner and operator, Bobby Pitre, 33, and tattoo artist Eric Guidry, 20.\n\nPitre, with his slicked hair and charismatic personality, has received a fair amount of press and acclaim for the work. The shop's visibility along the highway, coupled with the unsettling paintings and Pitre's rockabilly style, make an easy, if slightly intimidating, target for media searching out local reactions to the oil spill and cleanup efforts.\n\n\"What happened here could have been prevented,\" says Pitre of the oil spill. \"Now what can we do? This art -- painting -- this is a way for us to scream and to be heard. Maybe it's the only thing we can do.\"\n\nBoth men grew up within 15 miles of here. Their roots run deep, but Guidry isn't sure that a future remains in Larose for him.\n\n\"Did you hear what (former BP chief executive) Tony Hayward said?\" he asked. \"He said he couldn't wait to have his life back. What about us? We're never going to have our lives back.\"\n\nGuidry has to return to a customer, but Pitre invites us fishing with his family. Their land backs up to a canal, one of the few places in the area that has not been closed to fishing. There we meet him, his mom and his 5-year-old daughter, Sailor. I stand and watch as three generations bait hooks and cast their lines.\n\n\"Last year she didn't want anything to do with fish or fishing,\" says Pitre of his daughter as he cuts several large worms with a long kitchen knife. \"This year it's all she wants to do. And now they're telling us we can't fish. Crabbing and shrimping are all closed, too.\n\n\"How do I explain that? All this water here, all this space and life, and we can't fish anymore? She's not going to get to experience what I got to experience -- what my mom got to experience and her parents.\"\n\nOther family members and friends appear, and an impromptu picnic and fishing derby develop.\n\nAs the party winds down, Bridget Broussard, one of the matriarchs of the group and the landowner, invites us to stay the night. She met us an hour earlier, yet offers us room in her house, space in her yard, whatever we need.\n\nWe ask to sleep out by the water, and though she seems perplexed by our decision to forgo air conditioning, she walks out later to share bags of garden-fresh produce and barbecue.\n\nAs the moon rises and the temperature falls below 90, the humidity drops with it. The air, heavy and thick all week, turns gentle and lovely.\n\nAt this moment, 1,600 miles from home, in the middle of one of the greatest environmental disasters in history, eating a just-picked cucumber as if it were an apple, I realize there's no place I'd rather be.\n\nOne day at a time\n\nWe continue moving up and down the bayous. In some areas people still fish and shrimp, in others they wait and explore options for survival. In Dulac, La., where shrimpers are still at work, we spend a morning at the Bluewater Shrimp Co. Tropical Storm Alex spins on the horizon, and workers in the plant talk about the additional devastation a hurricane could bring.\n\nOwner Allen Estay predicts the complete closure of the fishery within the week.\n\n\"We can hang on for a month and keep paying everybody, but if we get oil in the estuaries, we're not going to have a fall season,\" he says. \"A lot of these guys have no other way to make a living. We're just going to have to take it one day at a time.\"\n\nIt turns out the storm is not as bad as forecast, and Estay's prediction is wrong, but the fear and worry don't dissipate with the change in weather.\n\n\"One of my most devastating thoughts isn't the closure of the fisheries, or even the failure of the business,\" says Estay. \"It's that oil gets pushed all the way up here into the estuaries and onto the land. They'll condemn this whole area and we'll have to leave.\"\n\nWaiting is hardest part\n\nLouisiana was hot, sticky, buggy, sometimes scary and absolutely beautiful. In many ways it was the hardest, but also the best, trip I've ever taken.\n\nComplete strangers welcomed us with smiles and thick accents. People we'd never met were willing to share their time, their food, their stories and their homes.\n\nI was consistently impressed and surprised by the tenacity of the individuals and families living along the bayous. Though all were saddened and many were heartbroken by the spill and its potential impact on their homes, few said they would consider leaving.\n\nMany said the hardest part was simply the waiting. They were a community used to rebuilding and taking action after disaster struck. A roof can be rebuilt after a hurricane, one shrimp fisherman told me. But this, he said, this I don't know how to rebuild.\n\nWith all that, how could I not feel a connection between their coast and ours?\n\nHow could I not fall in love?\n\n-- Aimee Brown","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2403","id":"889"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.381748,29.572438]}},{"properties":{"title":"Millions of black pellets in the surf - Dauphin Island","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2404","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/06 14:29:01 -0400","original":"Mon Sep 06 14:29:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/06 14:29:00 -0400"},"description":"We are again turned away from a BP station on Dauphin Island, with no information forthcoming from security guards.

At 39 miles out in Gulf waters, divers on boat #1 jump overboard in wet suits while Chris snorkels near an oilrig. Chris and Scott Procter return with coral samples to assess at a lab. Divers report two black tip sharks, one Kemp's Ridley turtle, a large redfish, and many smaller fishes. They note that fish numbers, for this area, are down.\n\nExperienced diver Deb Castellana, of Bluewater, refuses to enter the water because she doesn't “like the look of it.” At one spot, the water is a dark olive green rather than its normal blue-green. Divers say stringy strands hang in the water — like “swimming through chicken soup.” On our return to Venice, we stop three times to observe naturally occurring “foam fractation” flecked with brown spots and oily brown strands believed to be oil. Both boats gather foam samples for analysis and we record GPS coordinates... During our exploratory tour, we see no sign of U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Coast Guard or BP.\n\nMeanwhile, Kinship Circle's Jane Allen heads to Hammond, LA to tour International Bird Rescue Research Center. A bird with “old oil” is used to demonstrate the washing process. IBRRC Executive Director Jay Holcomb says older oil never completely comes off. Many “old oiled birds” are now brought in from rookeries where earlier rescue attempts would have caused extensive damage to un-hatched eggs. Delayed captures have resulted in extraction of dead and live birds... IBBRC sees roughly 4-5 oiled birds daily, mostly fledglings, with 10 oiled birds in house. A total 220 birds are on-site, compared to over 500 birds (150 laughing gulls, young pelicans and spoonbills) two weeks ago. Oiled birds are stabilized, cleaned and released in Florida, Georgia and Texas.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2406","id":"892"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.367317,29.2684]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2407","title":"Oil On Pensacola Beach / Ft.

A special thanks to Spot.us for partial funding to cover travel expenses for reporting on this story.\nRobin_Young1b.jpg\nGlynn Wilson\n\nRobin Young of Orange Beach talks about the health problems she suffered from BP’s Gulf oil disaster (see video below).\n\nby Glynn Wilson\n\nORANGE BEACH, Ala. — Wherever disaster strikes, there’s always an associated crud.\n\nThere was the Exxon Valdez Crud. The Nine Eleven Crud. The Katrina Cough, and then the TVA coal ash cough.\n\nNow, along the entire coast of the Gulf of Mexico, there is the BP Crud, afflicting workers and the general population from Louisiana to Florida.\n\nWhen the Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew up in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, Robin Young, a 47-year-old director of guest services for a property management company in Orange Beach, Alabama, was gearing up for what promised to be the best tourist season on the coast in years. From the city of New Orleans to the Florida panhandle, communities were finally starting to feel like they were recovering from the devastation left in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Ivan.\n\nSince suffering a debilitating bout of what locals are calling the “BP Crud,” however, like thousands of other people along the coast due to their exposure to the oil and chemical dispersants, she is now part of a growing community of activists along the coast who are worried about their health.\n\nJust a few days after BP’s oil made landfall along the Alabama Gulf Coast in June, Ms. Young’s symptoms started with “a fiery, burning sore throat,” she said. Then came the horrible, constant cough, followed by an achy feeling much like a severe flu virus — and a lethargy that kept her in bed for two weeks solid. Her memory started playing tricks on her, and her motor skills and even hand-to-eye coordination went south.\n\n\nShe started communicating with other sick folks over the Internet, and attending local meetings with corporate and government officials. At one meeting early on, she asked for a show of hands in a room of maybe 400 people to see how many had suffered symptoms similar to hers.\n\n“Half the people in the room raised their hands,” she said in an interview at her cottage right next to the Intercoastal Waterway, which was polluted with oil and chemicals at the height of the disaster. Clearly, this was not some isolated event unrelated to the oil rig blowout.\n\nHer new friends, who soon started a nonprofit group called Guardians of the Gulf, tried to find a local doctor to help them. After having no luck, they eventually found an out of state toxicologist and a doctor who knew enough about a new area of occupational and environmental health to order blood tests.\n\nThey found Dr. Michael R. Harbut, a clinical professor of Internal Medicine and director of the Environmental Cancer Program at Wayne State University’s Karmanos Cancer Institute, board certified in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. And they found Metametrix, a lab to test their blood.\n\nWhat they found in the blood tests was a stew of toxic chemicals directly associated with oil and gas production and the chemical dispersant Corexit, including ethylbenzene, xylenehigh and high levels of hexane, a hydrocarbon chiefly obtained by the refining of crude oil.\n\nThe long-term toxicity of hexane in humans is extensive peripheral nervous system failure. The initial symptoms are tingling and cramps in the arms and legs, followed by general muscular weakness. In severe cases, skeletal muscles atrophy and those exposed suffer a loss of coordination and vision problems, the very symptoms Ms. Young reported.\n\nTown officials and even local doctors have tried to silence her and others who raise the health issue, worried that if news got out, it could hurt the local economy even more. But a group of local pharmacists started keeping diaries of people coming in with similar symptoms.\n\n“There’s a core group of them that finally said, ‘Holy Cow,’ something’s going on,” she said. “They started listening to what we were saying. But we still couldn’t get a lot of help. We couldn’t get help from the local doctors because they didn’t know what to do.”\n\nEarly on, Ms. Young invited a crew from Bio-Cascade, air-pollution specialists out of New Jersey and Boston, to come down and test the air. She put them up in a house right on the beach.\n\nOn the third day John Vallier of Bio-Cascade woke up with a sore throat. He put the air monitoring machine on the deck and within 15 minutes it showed 110 parts per million of Volatile Organic Compounds in the air. The crew quickly packed and said they would help from outside the vicinity of the bad air coming off the Gulf. It was striking how scared they were and how fast they got out of town, Ms. Young said, while EPA was downplaying the threat coming from its own air monitoring stations.\n\nAnother member of her group who suffered similar symptoms but does not want to be identified by name called the local schools and confirmed that there were an unusual number of children out sick with what was diagnosed as “strep throat” and a “stomach virus,” at the end of summer and long before flu season is supposed to start.\n\nAnother woman, Robyn Hill of Foley, actually passed out while working for a BP contractor cleaning up the beach. When she was taken to the hospital by ambulance, the doctor tried to make her sign a form saying she suffered a heat stroke. She refused, and has now joined the cause to save the Gulf.\n\n“It really fired us up,” Ms Young said.\n\nSo they found a chemist in Mobile to test the water, Bob Naman, an analytical chemist with nearly thirty years of experience. They have tracked the oil, natural gas and Corexit. One sample right off Dauphin Island was so full of methane that it blew up in the lab’s test tube.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Young and her friends are now being told they need a high resolution scan of their lungs, brain, liver and kidneys.\n\n“They’ve also told us that in five to 10 years — they don’t have a time frame, they’re just guessing,” she said, “that we could come down with some godawful form of cancer.”\n\nThat’s exactly what happened in the area around Prince Williams Sound, Alaska, after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in the spring of 1989 and leaked about 11 million gallons of crude into the water, according to Dr. Riki Ott, a recognized expert with a Ph.D. in marine toxicology and a specialty in oil pollution.\n\nDr. Ott’s information is so sought after in four of the five Gulf states most affected by the largest and worst environmental disaster in U.S. history that she has practically moved to the Gulf Coast. I finally caught up with her in a hotel room on my iPhone from Gulf Shores.\n\nAfter spending the past four months working to try to get a handle on the scope of the problem, and getting sick herself, she has heard similar stories first-hand now from people ranging from Terrebonne Parish Louisiana to Apalachicola Florida.\n\n“What struck me when I first started hearing these stories was how similar the symptoms were to what happened after the Exxon Valdez oil spill,” she said.\n\nThe human health effects of that spill were mostly confined to sick workers, she indicated, because that area of Alaska is not heavily populated like the Gulf Coast.\n\n“I expected the vessel of opportunity workers to get sick because they were given hard hats instead of respirators just like our guys were. So it really didn’t surprise me in early May when I heard pretty much identical health symptoms,” she said. Dizziness, sore throat, headache, nausea, burning eyes, and eventually skin rashes resistant to treatment with antibiotics.\n\n“What convinced me that we may have a really big problem here,” she said, is when she heard similar stories at community forums from people not working directly in the oil and chemical tainted water, marshes and sand, and when she talked to pharmacists who reported seeing a huge increase in respiratory illnesses and bad skin rashes.\n\n“Now that the children are back in school, there’s a series of ’strep throat,” she said. “It’s the same symptoms, the blisters in the throat, the rashes I’d heard about all summer.”\n\nThere is a new area of occupational and environmental medicine covering chemical related illnesses, and the symptoms literally mimic flu-like symptoms. Dr. Ott is launching a Gulf-wide health survey along with coastal non-profit groups including the Louisiana Bayoukeeper and Ultimate Civics, a project of Earth Island Institute. The groups are also holding community health forums and opening health centers to try to get a handle on the scope of the problem.\n\nBut there are serious gaps in the law that allows workers to be exempted from coverage by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and even under the existing workers compensation regime. Under the U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA does not recognize chemical illnesses, Dr. Ott said, although it is recognized under the American Disabilities Act.\n\n“We’ve got a safety net with two big holes in it, and the workers are falling through those holes. It’s time to close those holes, and not only for the workers, but for the public,” she said. “What’s going on in the Gulf is to pretend that we can have this release of 200 million plus gallons of oil, 2 million plus gallons of toxic chemicals, and it’s not going to have any effect? In a highly populated area? I mean, come on!”","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2465","id":"897"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.573594,30.294368]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2466","title":"Destin, FL: “Smelly black mat, hundreds of yards long” trapping marine life; “Nothing but pitch black water” with “sludge-like” waves — BP SAYS “black algae”, NOT OIL","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/08 04:46:01 -0400","original":"Wed Sep 08 04:46:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/08 04:46:00 -0400"},"description":"DESTIN - It was a smelly sludge that looked like oil and made the holiday weekend a disappointment on one Destin beach.\nBP says it was a seaweed called black algae.\nBut as Channel Three's Laura Hussey found out, some people aren't convinced.\n\nRobert Herrin\n\"You could see nothing but pitch black water.

Such consumption rates offer a built in-safety net, the FDA says, because the agency believes only 10 percent of the people in the U.S. eat that much seafood in a month.\n\nThe agency is allowing much higher PAH levels in shrimp, crabs and oysters based on the assumption that people eat more fish than the other types of seafood.\n\n“What’s really reassuring, to keep this in context, there hasn’t been a sample collected yet above Levels of Concern,” said Don Kraemer, a senior FDA official overseeing the seafood testing program.\n\nDr. Gina Solomon, a University of California toxicologist, member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's science advisory board, and senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the FDA’s approach leaves people who like shellfish more vulnerable.\n\n“The FDA’s allowable level of cancer-causing PAHs for Gulf shrimp is about four times higher than for fish, and is far higher than levels that have been allowed for human consumption after previous oil spills,” Solomon said. “These levels are not likely to cause immediate health threats, but for people who like shrimp, these contaminants could pose a significant health problem over time.”\n\nThe assumption that people eat more fish than shrimp made a difference in Florida, where all nine of the shrimp samples tested before Florida waters reopened to commercial shrimping were double the level that would have triggered more testing for fish.\n\nThe FDA’s higher “Level of Concern” for shrimp meant no further testing was done.\n\n“We don’t think there is anything we need to do to immediately ensure the safety of seafood,” Kraemer said, adding that the FDA would begin to test shrimp in the marketplace after the reopening sampling concludes. “If the levels continue to increase, we need to figure out what is going on.”\n\nFlorida officials discounted the FDA results and said their own tests showed no cause for concern.\n\nMore protective standards were issued for seafood after significant spills in Alaska, Oregon, Rhode Island, California and Maine, according to figures in a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s document titled “Managing Seafood Safety after an Oil Spill.”\n\nAfter a spill, health officials set limits based on the BaPE — benzo(a)pyrene equivalent — an estimated total of the cancer-causing PAHs present in seafood.\n\nFederal records show that after the tanker New Carissa ran aground on the Oregon coast in 1999, the state health division said that a 45 parts per billion BaPE standard in shellfish would protect the average consumer.\n\nAfter a spill in California, that state chose a standard of 34 parts per billion for shellfish.\n\nIn the Gulf, the FDA set limits between 132 parts per billion (for shrimp and crab) and 143 parts per billion (for oysters), all at least three times higher than levels in Oregon and California.\n\nThe FDA said that it came up with the higher levels based on updated cancer risk data from the EPA, and data that suggest people now weigh more and live longer than when those spills occurred.\n\nAnother difference, FDA officials said, is that the agency set its levels based on a 1-in-100,000 risk of developing cancer, while California and Oregon used a 1-in-1 million risk factor.\n\n“Basically, if more health-protective assumptions were incorporated, the allowable levels of the contaminants would go down significantly,” said Solomon, after examining the FDA’s methodology. “More samples might be within a range of concern.”\n\nIf fish had registered at even half the PAH level seen in the Florida shrimp, the fish would have been sent off for a more accurate lab analysis and the fishery would have remained closed pending those tests, according to the FDA protocol and agency officials.\n\nBut that is not what happened with the Florida shrimp.\n\nInstead, the FDA testing was cited in an Aug. 13 letter granting Florida officials permission to open state waters for shrimping.\n\nFDA officials said they were not concerned that the Florida shrimp samples tested about 30 times higher for PAHs than samples from neighboring Gulf states, because the shrimp remained well below the agency’s Level of Concern.\n\nThe “estimated total PAH” level found in nine Florida shrimp samples caught off Pensacola tested between 28 and 31 parts per million, according to the FDA. Shrimp in neighboring Alabama, by contrast, tested between 0.2 and 1.2 parts per million. Mississippi shrimp tested between 1.2 and 1.8 parts per million.\n\nKraemer said comparing samples from the different states was “not appropriate” due to factors including differences in the laboratories that conducted the testing. He also said FDA scientists do not believe the levels were actually as high as the testing suggested.\n\nIn e-mails and telephone interviews, he explained that deficiencies in the fluorescence testing method used by FDA might explain the high levels seen in Florida.\n\nFluorescence is a quicker and cheaper test than gas chromatography, which the FDA would use for re-testing any samples where initial results showed PAHs at half the Level of Concern for the given seafood type.\n\nKraemer suggested the FDA’s “estimated total PAH” in the Florida shrimp may be five to 10 times higher than the actual amount present because of “interferences” in the fluorescence tests.\n\nAs to why the Florida shrimp tested so much higher than other states, Kraemer said, “we don’t have a good explanation.”\n\nAsked if the agency would test the shrimp further, Kraemer said, “the answer is no.”\n\nAll of the FDA’s samples were caught off Pensacola, an area that received large amounts of oil during the spill.\n\nOfficials in Florida said they had tested shrimp collected from seafood dealers in Panama City and Apalachicola and found no contamination. The officials said that they did not know where those shrimp were caught, and have not tested any shrimp from Pensacola seafood dealers.\n\nFish from a Pensacola-area seafood dealer tested by the state were free of contaminants, officials said.\n\nFlorida officials dismissed the FDA shrimp results because they were done with the fluorescence technique.\n\nThe NOAA paper on seafood safety after oil spills also dismisses the fluorescence method, stating, that since it “does not quantify individual aromatic compounds, the results cannot be used to assess risk to human health from consumption of contaminated seafood.”\n\nKraemer said the agency tested the fluorescence method side by side with gas chromatography and found the results were similar.\n\nThe agency declined to release the results of that comparison testing or the full lab reports from the reopening tests to the Press-Register without a Freedom of Information Act request.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2468","id":"900"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.216915,30.421309]}},{"properties":{"title":"Two oiled pelicans found on Breton Island","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2469","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/09 16:48:01 -0400","original":"Thu Sep 09 16:48:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/09 16:48:00 -0400"},"description":"Two oiled pelicans were caught alive today on Breton Island.

An investigative team from Greenpeace also walked the beaches to see how the barrier island is faring in the wake of the Gulf oil disaster. And they have a very different assessment of how the cleanup is progressing.\n\nScience Coordinator Adam Walters and Senior Oceans Campaigner Phil Kline dug small holes in the sand and discovered layers of oiled sand less than a foot below the surface. They also found tar balls at various stages of weathering and various sizes on both the leeward and windward sides of the islands. \n\n\"BP keeps telling us that the oil has been cleaned up,\" Kline said. \"This is outrageous.  Horn Island is a habitat for birds and turtles, and BP will not be able to attempt a cleanup without risking irreparable damage to those habitats.  The oil and dispersants, plus new invasive clean up methods using bulldozers will put this sensitive ecosystem over the edge.\"\n\nThose \"invasive clean up methods\" were painted in a much different light by BP's Chief Operating Officer Mike Utsler.\n\n\"We've been able to modify that technology into its use in helping us fight this challenge of picking up these small tar balls that you've had an opportunity to see in a few places,\" Utsler told WLOX News.\n\nDr. Bill Walker, the director of the Department of Marine Resources, was impressed with the island's recovery thus far.\n\n\"I would say, if nothing else is done, the island would recover,\" Walker said.  \"What you're seeing out here is weathered oil that's going to continue to weather and go away like the typical tar balls that wash up here all the time.\" \n\nGreenpeace Science Coordinator Adam Walters disagrees with that optimistic assessment.  \n\n \"Much of the oil from this disaster will never be cleaned up,\" Walters said. \"What we see on the Gulf coast beaches is what made it to shore.  Vast amounts of the oil released into the Gulf will never reach the coast and will never be cleaned up. Instead, mixed, dissolved and dispersed into the water this oil it causing as yet unquantified and potentially highly significant effects on the Gulf's aquatic ecosystem.\"\n\nThe investigative work at Horn Island is part of a three month long Gulf impacts expedition. The Arctic Sunrise is acting as a platform for independent scientists to study the impact of the oil and dispersants on various Gulf ecosystems.  Scientists during the month of August studied blue crab larvae, marine mammals and sponges.  \n\nIn September, two scientists will be on board, representing the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center.  The scientists, using already existing baseline data, will assess the impact of the oil spill sperm whale populations using acoustic buoys.  Additional scientists will join the expedition in September and October.\n\nThe Arctic Sunrise is a 50 meter long icebreaker purchased by Greenpeace in 1995. Since then, it has peacefully protested whaling in the Southern Ocean and documented the impacts of climate change at the poles.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2476","id":"908"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.650664,30.229936]}},{"properties":{"title":"Oil cleanup continues on Mississippi barrier islands","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2477","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/10 04:24:01 -0400","original":"Fri Sep 10 04:24:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/10 04:24:00 -0400"},"description":"BP and the federal Park Service have brought in some heavy machinery to remove Gulf oil spill debris from Mississippi's barrier islands before shifting winter tides bury it too deep.\ngulf-islands-national-seashore.JPGAssociated Press archiveOn Aug. 24, Oceana's senior vice president for North America and chief scientist, MIchael Hirshfield, center, talks with actors Morgan Freeman, left, and Ted Danson as they tour West Ship Island of the Gulf Island National Seashore in Mississippi. Oceana is an international organization focused solely on ocean conservation.\n\nGulf Islands National Seashore superintendent Dan Brown said people using small sifters and hand shovels continue to work on the islands. The cleanup comes after a ruptured BP well spewed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico for several weeks before workers capped the well in July.\n3\n0\n17Share\n\n\"We're all keeping our fingers crossed that we won't have any hurricanes this year,\" Brown said.\n\nThe sand-sifting devices pulled by tractors started operating on the barrier islands in Mississippi after successful tests about two weeks ago, Brown said. Island cleanup had been limited to small crews using hand tools in an effort to tread lightly around nesting sites of shorebirds, some of which are threatened or endangered.\n\nBrown said tons of oil debris has been picked up using the crews but the Park Service realized that it was becoming necessary to remove surface oil as soon as possible.\n\n\"Preservation of the wilderness character of Horn and Petit Bois is of the utmost importance,\" Brown said. \"However, we only have a narrow window of opportunity in which to respond before the oil becomes too far embedded in the substrate to reach via mechanical means.\n\n\"These are tough choices that have to be made to ensure the islands' natural processes are allowed to continue unimpeded.\"\n\nBrown said the park had to get special permission to use the German-made Beach Techs, which weigh about 4,000 pounds each, on the fragile islands.\n\n\"It took quite a bit to get to this point, because Petit Bois and Horn islands are designated wilderness areas and, by law, you're not allowed to use vehicles and mechanized equipment in those areas,\" Brown said.\n\nBy the end of the Labor Day weekend, five machines were operating on Horn, said Greg Knox, public information officer for BP in Mississippi, which is working with the Park Service on the effort.\n\nKnox was not sure when any machines would start operating on Petit Bois.\n\nHe said that human observation combined with the machines should keep wildlife casualties to a minimum.\n\nBrown said the machines are able to cover much more ground.\n\n\"At best, crews were maybe covering a tenth of a mile a day,\" Brown said.\n\nThe sifters are able to cover at least several times that, he said.\n\nThe machines are most productive at night, when temperatures drop and the debris is less gooey, Brown said.\n\nThe Beach Techs flip sand into a screen where tarballs and debris are trapped and sand filters back onto the beach. They've also been operating in Florida for several weeks.\n\nBrown said the accelerated island cleanup efforts should continue at least for the next several months before the stormy winter season cranks up sometime in November.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2477","id":"909"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.437965,30.198737]}},{"properties":{"title":"Researchers found oil and \"marine snow\" on the seafloor causing significant harm to marine organisms","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2478","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/10 04:27:01 -0400","original":"Fri Sep 10 04:27:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/10 04:27:00 -0400"},"description":"Biogeochemist Samantha Joye, from the University of Georgia in Athens, and her colleagues have found a layer of oilburied about three centimetres deep in a canyon some 30 kilometres from the wellhead.

BP and the government would like us to believe that the problem is gone, the oil dispersed or evaporated, and the beaches clean.  Oil beneath the surface of the ocean is no less damaging than oil on the shore.  Even in small concentrations it can be harmful, and with the amount that is likely in the Gulf, I imagine there will be dramatic effects on many of the marine life populations: the delicate plankton, the whales, the fish, the sensitive deep sea corals and sponges.   \n\nToday, I saw Horn Island, off the coast of Mississippi, covered in tarballs, a painful, visual reminder that this devastating catastrophe isn't over.  Just as we had seen in the early weeks of the spill, this island showed all the signs of a delicate habitat at substantial risk.  We saw a turtle nest just a few feet away from tarballs; we dug in the sand a few feet and found layers of black sand beneath the surface.  It was clear that this small island would be changed forever.  Even though most of the oil has never even made landfall and we're just seeing the tiniest percent of the problem, still we see the absolute futility of our attempts to mitigate the effects of the spill.  It is enormous, out of control, and impossible to clean up, and it is outrageous that we are being told that the problem is solved.It makes me angry that the clean up efforts are so bad that the tarballs beside a turtles nest have not yet been cleaned, but I don't know what the answer is in terms of recovering these islands.  The laborious process of land cleanup likely won't be fast enough to spare the wildlife that call these islands their home.   \n\nWhat can we do but witness the destruction?

We were primarily in search of whale sharks to report on their current status and to possibly tag them for future monitoring.\n\nThe trip was both very troubling and incredibly uplifting in regard to the marine life we saw.\n\nFirst of all, I was thrilled to be going on this trip, hoping to see some signs of life…some signs that the Gulf was starting down its long road to recovery. According to pilot Bonny Schumaker: “The search grid was about 75 NM wide (roughly west to east) and 25 NM tall, with the western sector overlapping the Macondo rig.”\n\nPilot Schumaker: “No whale sharks were seen in the western sector…. We also did run across a lot of white foamy substance never seen before and that none of us could identify from the air.”Unfortunately, much of the day flying back and forth over the grid (roughly centered at Latitude 29.16228, Longitude -88.05911), we saw VERY little life. Sadly, that was not unexpected, as this is the area severely impacted by the spill. The “kill zone” may remain lifeless for quite some time.\n\nThe second half of the day, further east, was an entirely different story.We sighted sperm whales, whale sharks, huge schools of tuna and bonita as well as sea turtles. It was a huge relief to see signs of life in the Gulf after the devastating conditions we’ve been confronted with during the past few months.Again, this tour was extremely emotional. It was fantastic to see vibrant marine life toward the end of the day – but the nearly lifeless waters we observed from Mississippi to Louisiana continue to concern me greatly.\n\nI’ll be back soon with more visual updates.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2482","id":"913"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.05911,29.16228]}},{"properties":{"title":"Permanent Dulac resident reports livelihood threatened","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2484","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/14 00:21:01 -0400","original":"Tue Sep 14 00:21:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/14 00:21:00 -0400"},"description":"Shrimp processor reports receiving less work since the oil spill.

(Photo: Don Tillman)\n\nShirley and Don Tillman, residents of Pass Christian, Mississippi, have owned shrimp boats, an oyster boat and many pleasure boats. They spent much time on the Gulf of Mexico before working in BP’s Vessels Of Opportunity (VOO) program looking for and trying to clean up oil.\n\nDon decided to work in the VOO program in order to assist his brother, who was unable to do so due to health problems. Thus, Don worked on the boat and Shirley decided to join him as a deckhand most of the days.\n\n“We love the Gulf, our life is here and so when this oil disaster happened, we wanted to do what we could to help clean it up,” Shirley explained to Truthout.\n\nHowever, not long after they began working in BP’s response effort in June, what they saw disturbed them. “It didn’t take long for us to understand that something was very, very wrong about this whole thing,” Shirley told Truthout. “So that’s when I started keeping a diary of what we experienced and began taking a lot of pictures. We had to speak up about what we know is being done to our Gulf.”\n\nShirley logged what they saw and took hundreds of photos. The Tillmans confirm, both with what they logged in writing as well as in photos, what Truthout has reported before: BP has hired out-of-state contractors to use unregistered boats, usually of the Carolina Skiff variety, to spray toxic Corexit dispersants on oil located by VOO workers.\n\nShirley provided Truthout with key excerpts from the diary she kept of her experiences out on the water with her husband while they worked in the VOO program before they, like most of the other VOO workers in Mississippi, were laid off because the state of Mississippi, along with the US Coast Guard, has declared there is no more “recoverable oil” in their area.\n\n“The first day I went, I noticed a lot of foam on the water,” reads her entry from June 26. “My husband said he had been seeing a lot of it. At that time, we were just looking for ‘Oil.’ We would go out in groups of normally, five boats. The Coast Guard was over the VOO operation. There was always a Coast Guard on at least one of the boats. They would tell us when to leave the harbor, where to go and how fast to go. They had flags on each of the VOO boats and also a transponder. Sometimes we would have one or more National Guardsmen in our group too, as well as an occasional safety man to monitor the air quality and procedures on the boat. If we found anything, the Coast Guard in our group would call it in to ‘Seahorse’ and they would determine what action would be taken.”\n\nAlong with giving a clear description of how the Coast Guard was thus always aware of the findings of the VOO workers, her diary provides, at times, heart-wrenching descriptions of what is happening to the marine life and wildlife of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n“Before we went to work, I went down by the beach,” reads her entry from July 4. “There were dead jellyfish everywhere. Some of them were surrounded by foam. A seagull was by the waters edge, as the foamy stuff continued to wash up. There was also a crane that appeared to be sick. It didn’t look like it had any oil on it, but it just stood there, no matter how close I got.”\n\nOn the morning of August 5, Shirley describes spotting a dead young dolphin floating in the water. “As we waited for the VOO Wildlife boat to come pick it up, we noticed a pod of dolphins close by,” she writes. “Even with all the boats around, they did not leave until the dead one was removed from the water. It was very emotional, for all of us.”\n\nIt’s a crucial time to fight ignorance - help Truthout get the word out by donating here.\n\nThe next day, August 6, found her logging more death. “Last night on the news, they reported a fish kill. Before we went to work, I went to the beach by the harbor. The seagulls were everywhere. As for the dead fish, the only ones on the beach, were ones that the tide had left when it went back out. The rest of the ‘Fish Kill,’ was laying underwater, on the bottom. It was mainly flounder and crab. We only spotted two dead flounder floating that day. I can only imagine how many were on the bottom … I went back to the beach after work. The tide had gone out and the seagulls were eating all the dead fish that had been exposed. You could still see dead fish underwater, still on the bottom. Dead fish don’t float anymore?”\n\nThe Tillman’s primary concern is the rampant use of toxic dispersants by what they described as private contractors working in unregistered boats, that regularly were going out into the Gulf as they and other VOO teams were coming in from their days’ work. There was, oftentimes, so much dispersant on top of the water, their boat left a trail.\n\n“The first thing I noticed, was the ‘trail’ the boat was leaving in the water,” her log from July 10 reads. “You could see exactly where we had been, as far back as you could see. Around 11:00, we were in oil sheen and brownish clumps. We were North of Cat and Ship Island when the Coast Guard told us to drop the boom over. When you pick the boom up, you have to wear ‘protective gear.’”\n\nHer log from August 1 describes, in detail, an incident of the Coast Guard not allowing them to collect oil and his proceeding to deny what they found was even oil:\n\n    “Around 2:00 p.m., we started noticing a lot of oil sheen. We were North of the East end of Cat Island, but South of the Inter Coastal channel. There was, as usual, a Coast Guard on one of the boats in our team. He called in to report it, but we were told not to drop the boom, it was just ‘Fish Oil.’ In the beginning of the clean-up operation, if something was floating on the water and it looked like oil, it was oil or oil sheen. Later they would sometimes say it was just ‘Fish Oil.’ Also, if it was heavy foam with a brown or rust color, originally it was ‘Oil Mousse.’ Later it was called ‘Algae.’ We were then told to head Northwest. The further we went, the worse the ‘Fish Oil’ got. Then, the foam was mixed in with the oil. It was at least the size of a football field, around our boat alone. My husband got on the radio and asked if they could put the boom over.” The Coast Guard, again, told them no. “We were then headed West, back towards Pass Christian. A pleasure boat flagged one of the boats in our group down and told him that there was oil all over. The Coast Guard said to tell him that they were aware of the situation … On the way back to the Pass Harbor, I asked my husband, ‘Just exactly what are we even doing out here?’ He told me that he was beginning to think that it was all just for show. I can only imagine what the people on the pleasure boat had to say when they got back home that day. Probably, that they had seen a lot of oil on the water and the VOO boats were out there just riding around in it and not doing anything to clean it up. That is exactly what happened. We decided then to start documenting as much as we could. I believe it was the very next day, Thad Allen was on TV saying that they were scaling operations back due to the fact that, ‘No oil has been seen in the Gulf in almost two weeks.’ Now, if we had pulled boom on Sunday and unloaded a bunch of dirty boom in the Pass harbor, it might have been a problem for him later.”\n\nDispersant remnant.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nOn August 5, she describes a rare instance of their being allowed to drop boom in order to collect oil. “We had a Coast Guard and two Safety Men on our boat. We went to the West of the Pass Harbor. The water looked black in places. Lots of bubbles, not foam, just bubbles. Around 8:30, we were in oil sheen and mousse and were told to drop the boom. The more we pulled the boom, it appeared the more was coming up. The Pass [Christian] Harbor was closed because the oil was coming in so bad. We pulled boom back and forth the rest of the afternoon.”\n\nOiled Boom. August 5, 2010.\n\nOiled boom, August 5, 2010. (Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nOil sheen and dispersant remnant.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nBy early August, the total number of VOO boats operating out of Pass Christian Harbor, where Shirley and Don worked, was down to 26.\n\nOn August 8, Shirley wrote, “talk at the harbor was that airplanes were spraying dispersants on the water at night, out by the islands. There was also talk of skiffs, from Louisiana, with white tanks on them, that were spraying [dispersants] too. We had seen the skiffs before. They would pass us up in the mornings and head towards the Bay St. Louis Bridge. We were told that they were working out of an area at Henderson Point. Henderson Point has a county-owned area with a boat launch &amp; piers. It was closed to the public after the oil spill and a BP sub-contractor staging area was set up. It always appeared that these boats were finishing up their work day, just as we were going to start ours. Most of these skiffs were Carolina Skiffs.”\n\nLater that same morning, Shirley and her husband headed out of the harbor with a member of the National Guard on their boat, heading west, while a member of the Coast Guard and another member of the National Guard were on another boat in their VOO team. After boating for an hour, they turned back to the east, at which point Don spotted five of the Carolina Skiffs.\n\n“I got my camera and started taking pictures of them,” Shirley writes. “As I was zooming in as close as I could, I saw one of them spraying something onto the water. I did not get a picture of it, I was too busy telling my husband to tell the Coast Guard on the other boat. The skiffs had turned North and were scattered out, zigzagging South of the train bridge. The Coast Guard called the incident in and sent one of our boats to follow the skiffs. The skiffs immediately left. When I saw the boat spraying, it was upwind from our boat. Within a few minutes, my nose started drying out. Later my throat and eyes did the same thing. A Coast Guard helicopter was dispatched along with a Coast Guard boat. We saw the helicopter about twenty minutes later, but I never saw the Coast Guard boat.”\n\nBack at Pass Christian Harbor, her team reported the Carolina Skiffs actively spraying dispersants. She was told by the contracting company, Parson’s, that managed their VOO team, to bring in her photographs.\n\nHer entry from the next day, August 9, reads:\n\n    “I took the pictures, 8×10’s to Parson’s. A short time later, my husband called and said the Coast Guard wanted me to make a disc of the pictures. I took the disc and turned it over to the Coast Guard. I was told, in the presence of others, that the incident had been investigated and the boats in question had been located at the Henderson Point site. He said that these boats were in the VOO program as skimmer boats, but it had not yet been verified. He said that he had questioned them about spraying something on the water. They told him that if I had seen them spraying anything, they were probably just rinsing out their tanks. He also asked me, ‘Don’t you think if they were spraying dispersants, they would be wearing respirators?’ I told him, ‘You would think so, but nothing surprises me around here anymore.’ We basically left after that. I knew all they had really wanted was to see exactly what I had gotten pictures of. There is of course the question, ‘Why would a skimmer boat need to rinse out his tanks?’ If he had been skimming oil, why dump it back over? If he hadn’t been skimming oil, what was he rinsing out? I know what I saw and I know how I felt afterwards. I also know that in one of the pictures I took, you can see a helicopter over those boats. BP has spotters looking for oil. Could it be he was telling them where to ‘Touch Up’ before they called it a day? One thing I did learn from Coast Guard guy that day, evidently these so-called skimmer boats, also have the ability to spray!”\n\nThe Tillman’s curiosity drove them to investigate further, given the inconsistencies they were seeing in the Coast Guard’s actions regarding the dispersant being sprayed from contractors in the Carolina Skiffs.\n\n“My husband came home and said that they had seen the ‘Skiffs’ again today,” reads Shirley’s entry from August 10. “He took pictures of them and a jack-up-rig. The rig moves around in the sound and is suppose to be a de-contamination station. However, some Captains have said when they went there, they were told it wasn’t in operation at the time. After thinking about the tank skiffs and the Coast Guard for two days, I could not make any sense of this whole situation. The Coast Guard is supposedly over the VOO Program, but it knows nothing about the skiffs at the site, so close to the Pass Harbor. They not only tell us every move to make, but they are always with us when we make the moves. Our boats are flagged and have transponders on them. Those boats have no flags, we have not seen a transponder, nor a Coast Guard member on one of them telling them what to do.”\n\nThat afternoon, the Tillmans visited the Henderson Point staging area. Though it was guarded, what they found shocked them:\n\n    “There were probably more boats there than in the entire Pass [Christian] VOO program at the time,” reads her entry. “There were only a couple of regular skimmer boats. All appeared to have Louisiana registrations. Almost all of the skiffs had the white tanks on them. A few of the tanks looked like they could have had something in them at one time, but nothing like the oily, sticky mess we had been dealing with. If we got something on our boat, it was almost impossible to get it off. I don’t see how they could have gotten it out of the tanks and still looked like they did. Also, there was a Harrison County Sheriffs Department car, right by the boats and some large, plastic, white containers with yellow bases.”\n\nCorner of Canal Road and I-10, in Gulfport, Mississippi, at the Gulfport site used as a BP staging area.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nOn August 13, the VOO boat that Shirley and Don were running was deactivated. Still very concerned, the next day they visited the BP staging area in Hancock County.\n\n“They had evacuated this site,” she writes. “Same setup though, a guard and a Sheriff’s car. We then went to a site in Gulfport. Evidently, this is a main BP storage site. There were all kinds of boats, including the tank skiffs. The Sheriffs Department was there also and so was those large, plastic tanks with the yellow bases.”\n\nOther reports, of a very similar nature, have been reported about other BP staging areas along the Gulf of Mexico. The tanks are clearly used to store and transport Corexit dispersant. The Carolina Skiffs are clearly used to spray it atop oil.\n\nCorner of Canal Road and I-10, in Gulfport, at the Gulfport site used as a BP staging area. Corexit Tanks.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nHer August 16 entry details her discovery:\n\n    “Over the next few days, I continued to go by the Henderson Point site and the Gulfport site. The Henderson Point site brought back a few boats, but none of the tank skiffs or the large plastic tanks. The Gulfport site stayed the same, full of everything. On August 25, I received an email with a link to an article about dispersants. It had a picture of the tanks that dispersants come in, with the label ‘Nalco Corexit EC9005A.’ They were 330 gallon, large, plastic, white tanks with a yellow base. These were the same tanks that I had been seeing at the Henderson Point site and the Gulfport site. I was able to get the name of the manufacturer of the tanks, off a picture I took and compared it to the picture in the article. It was the same manufacturer. I researched this company on the internet and found the 330 gal tanks. They are marketed as: ‘The only manufacturer in the industry to offer portable tanks certified for hazardous goods transport by the United Nations and the U.S. Department of Transportation.’”\n\nDead founder amongst fish kill.

(Photo: Shirley Tillman)\n\nShirley and Don are, like tens of thousands of other VOO workers and Gulf residents, left with more questions than answers.\n\n“While working on the boats, if you pull boom back onto the boat, you not only had to wear Tyvek suits, protective glasses and gloves, you also had to put tape around the gloves and suit sleeves, as well as around your boots and the suit.” Shirley asks, “Why would it be safe for people to get into the same water that all of this hazardous stuff was coming out of?”\n\nFor the Coast Guard, she aks:\n\n    “How can you not know there are boats in the VOO program if you are in charge of the VOO program? The Coast Guard was supposedly over the VOO program, but they acted like they don’t know anything about the Carolina Skiffs. The boats were in either a task force or strike force. Every VOO boat has a flag. We all had transponders. This was VOO and Coast Guard regulations. But these skiffs didn’t have flags and we never saw transponders on them, nor did they have Coast Guard with them and supposedly every group had at least one Coast Guard in each group. Sometimes we would have two. But the Skiffs didn’t have any.”\n\nLocal media in Pass Christian and Gulfport, Mississippi, are now reporting that BP hopes to have the VOO program in that area completed by September 19.\n\nShirley is incredulous. “Why would anyone bring their children here and put them in water that has had millions of gallons of toxic chemicals dumped into it, not counting the oil itself?” she asks. “Why would you want to eat seafood that has been living and dying in the water, with all those contaminates?”\n\nTruthout has earlier reported on other fisherman in the area, James “Catfish” Miller and Mark Stewart, who have reported being eyewitnesses to the contractors in the Carolina Skiffs spraying dispersant as well.\n\nMeanwhile, local, state and federal authorities continue to claim that dispersant was only used south of Mississippi’s barrier islands and that the Carolina Skiffs and the large tanks they carry are only used to “skim” oil.\n\n“If dispersants were only being sprayed South of the islands, why would these 330 gallon hazardous goods tanks be located at two different work sites, right by the tank skiffs?” Shirley asks. “Why would the skiffs tanks be so clean if they were really skimming oil?”\n\nThe Tillmans and thousands of other fishermen and residents along the Gulf of Mexico are deeply concerned about local, state and federal government complicity in what they see as a massive cover-up of the oil disaster by using toxic dispersants to sink any and all oil that is located.\n\nDr. Riki Ott, a toxicologist and marine biologist, is a survivor of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska. She recently submitted an open letter\nto the US Environmental Protection Agency expressing many of these same concerns.\n\nOngoing government denials of this problem neither fool nor dissuade Shirley. “I know what I have seen,” she told Truthout. “I know what I have been told. I know what I have experienced. I know what I have documented. I also know that I have taken hundreds of pictures to verify what I am saying.”","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2624","id":"917"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.286989,30.308808]}},{"properties":{"title":"New wave of oil coating 16 miles of beaches in Plaquemines Parish","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/2625","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/14 16:34:01 -0400","original":"Tue Sep 14 16:34:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/14 16:34:00 -0400"},"description":"A new wave of black oil suddenly came ashore west of the Mississippi River on Friday and Saturday, coating beaches and fouling interior marshes, according to anglers' reports.

The water samples our research team took on August 10, 2010 from Mississippi Sound contain dispersant-related chemicals from the Gulf’s surface.\n\nThe samples contain the following toxic compounds: propylene glycol, 2-ethylhexanol, and di (propylene glycol) butyl ether in the seawater, all of which are markers for dispersant.\n\nOur team, headed by civil engineer Marco Kaltofen, has confirmed the presence of toxic Corexit 9500A in Mississippi Sound in August. The purpose of the experiments performed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute’s Water Quality Laboratory was to prove that we, indeed, found the chemical signature for Corexit use in Mississippi Sound. The experiments also confirmed which Corexit product had been detected. Using Gulf seawater, BP/Deepwater Horizon crude oil samples and Nalco Corexit products, we confirmed our earlier finding that Corexit 9500A dispersant was still present in Mississippi Sound in August.\n\nThese test results, obviously, have implications for the re-opening of federal waters to fishing and the safety of seafood coming out of the Gulf.\n\nSpiking Experiment Methodology\n\nTo confirm these results, four Gulf seawater samples were spiked with 100 parts per million volume to volume Corexit dispersants, in a 1:25 Corexit/BP crude oil mix. The four spiked samples were analyzed at the same certified laboratory as the field samples, and were found to contain propylene glycol, 2-ethylhexanol, 2 butoxy ethanol and di (propylene glycol) butyl ether.\n\nThe samples spiked with Corexit 9527A also contained 2 butoxy ethanol. The samples spiked with Corexit 9500A did not contain 2 butoxy ethanol.\n\nThe samples spiked with Corexit 9500A also contained di (propylene glycol) butyl ether. The samples spiked with Corexit 9527A did not contain di (propylene glycol) butyl ether.\n\nThe August 10 Mississippi Sound sample did not contain 2 butoxy ethanol, which is the expected result if the field sample contained Corexit 9500A, rather than Corexit 9527A.\n\nThe August 10 Mississippi Sound sample did contain di (propylene glycol) butyl ether, which is also the expected result if the field sample contained Corexit 9500A, rather than Corexit 9527A.\n\nThe results of this spiking experiment confirm that our team found Corexit 9500A in Mississippi Sound on August 10th.\n\n© Smith Stag, LLC 2010 – All Rights Reserved","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3101","id":"947"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.51668,30.266867]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3102","title":"Confirmed Fish Kill on Grand Isle; “Overpowering Stench of Death and Decay” Coming From BP “Death Mounds”","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 04:41:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 08:40:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 04:40:00 -0400"},"description":"For the first time in a few weeks, I headed out to Grand Isle, Louisiana – primarily to document cleanup progress that has – or has not – been made since the spill response began.\n\nEarlier in the week, I received information regarding a possible fish kill around Grand Isle, which I confirmed to be true. My first stop was the west end of the island. Upon arrival, I did not see many dead fish, but while walking along the jetties, I was hit by an overpowering stench of death and decay. Back in May, I smelled this same scent and found a mound of buried bull redfish and dolphin, so I decided to go back to that same spot to check it out.\n\nWhen I was about 10 yards from a recognizable mound of sand, I started hearing the unmistakable buzz of flies.\n\nWhat I found was truly indescribable visually, I had never seen so many flies and the smell nearly brought me to my knees. There were at least 40 to 60 large redfish, drum – and who knows what else – under a BP “death mound” of sand in the exact same spot that I found the decapitated dolphin and bull redfish in May.I find it very disturbing that BP cleanup crews are simply burying large numbers of dead fish and other marine life without letting anybody know.There was also another death mound about 20 yards away closer to the beach at Latitude 29.199 N, Longitude 90.047 W. The media continues to consistently disregard or overlook these occurrences, reporting that everything is just fine in the Gulf. I know these reports are untrue, based on what I am finding six months after the spill.\n\nAdditionally, more evidence of land farming (or burying oil) on the west end of the island is seen in the images of the levee resembling the Grand Canyon rock strata, Latitude 29.195 N, Longitude 90.055 W.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3102","id":"948"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.042,29.199]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3103","title":"Oil on Ocean Springs","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 04:48:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 08:47:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 04:47:00 -0400"},"description":"An absolute mess…\n\n    Sheen spots look a lot worse than they have in the past…\n\n    All these spots are just completely loaded with rainbow colored sheen…\n\n    Kind of speechless…","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3103","id":"949"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.754,30.389805]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3104","title":"Healthy 16 y/o goes swimming, then hospitalized with \"compromised lung\" &amp; \"enlarged heart\"","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 04:53:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 08:52:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 04:52:00 -0400"},"description":"Healthy 16 year old hospitalized after swimming in Gulf Shores public beach.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3104","id":"950"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.700819,30.246036]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3105","title":"Sulfur Dioxide over 200 ppb at Chalmette","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 22:00:00 -0400","original":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 01:00:00 GMT","granularity":"hour","time":"2010/10/25 21:00:00 -0400"},"description":"The LDEQ Chal_Vista air monitor at Bluebird neighborhood park had high sulfur dioxide readings Oct 25 2010 (add two hours to display time of \"Site Data\" for Chal_Vista at this link \n\nhttp://www.deq.louisiana.gov/portal/DIVISIONS/AirQualityAssessment/AmbientAirMonitoringProgram/AirMonitoringData.aspx   ) After 6pm the sulfur dioxide readings were well above the new health standard of 75 ppb, reaching over 200 ppb in the evening and remaining above the health standard the morning of Oct 26 2010.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3105","id":"951"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.97601,29.942552]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3108","title":"dirt spill refinery","published":{"end_time":"1969/12/31 19:00:01 -0500","original":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 19:30:00 GMT","granularity":"usec","time":"1969/12/31 19:00:00 -0500"},"description":"gas/diesel smell\ndirt tracked from refinery through streets.\ncars driving through and tracking dirt back home","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3108","id":"952"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.780099,32.470976]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3109","title":"FIre from Calumet","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/25 19:31:00 -0400","original":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 23:30:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/25 19:30:00 -0400"},"description":"bad odor\nheard roaring noise\nmade me feel congested","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3109","id":"953"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.780099,32.470976]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3111","title":"Blood samples from 5 Gulf Coast residents show contamination by hydrocarbons","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/27 15:37:00 -0400","original":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 19:36:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/27 15:36:00 -0400"},"description":"The Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN) just released a report by Wilma Subra proving that local Gulf residents have been contaminated by oil.\n\nThe blood from eight individuals, 3 women and 5 men, tested positive for ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and hexanes.  Comparing the blood samples with regular, unexposed Americans1, the BP workers and community members had shockingly high levels of toxic chemicals in their bodies.   These chemicals have been shown to have deleterious health affects in these high amounts.\n\nBreathing high levels of ethylbenzene can causes dizziness and throat and eye irritation.   In animals studies, researchers found that exposure to relatively low concentrations of ethylbenzene caused permanent damage to the inner ear and hearing after only a few days to weeks of exposure and kidney damage after several months to years of exposure.  Newborn animals whose mothers were exposed during pregnancy had minor birth defects and low birth weights.  Further, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that ethylbenzene could cause cancer in human beings.2\n\nPeople exposed to m,p-Xylene may get headaches, lose muscle coordination, and become dizzy or confused.  For just short periods of exposure, people may experience \"irritation of the skin, eyes, nose, and throat; difficulty in breathing; problems with the lungs; delayed reaction time; memory difficulties; stomach discomfort; and possibly changes in the liver and kidneys.  Children may be more sensitive to acute inhalation exposure than adults because their narrower airways would be more sensitive to swelling effects.  Studies of unborn animals indicate that high concentrations of xylene may cause increased numbers of deaths, and delayed growth and development. In many instances, these same concentrations also cause damage to the mothers.\"3\n\nWorkers who breathed hexanes reported that their feet and hands went numb followed by muscle weakness in the lower legs. Continued exposure led to paralysis of the arms and legs. The workers recovered in 6 months to a year.  In laboratory studies, animals exposed to high levels of n-hexane in air had signs of nerve damage. Some animals also had lung damage. In other studies, rats exposed to very high levels of n-hexane had damage to sperm-forming cells.4\n\nEach of these chemicals is known to be present in BP’s spilled crude oil and each was found in the blood of all eight Gulf citizens that were tested.  For these people, all the short-term and long-term impacts of having high amounts of petroleum chemicals in their blood is not known.  How many other people are walking around with toxic compounds coursing in their blood is also currently unknown.  What we do know is that the BP Gulf Petro-Chemical Experiment is continuing.\n\n \n\nCasey DeMoss Roberts is the Assistant Director of Water Resources at the Gulf Restoration Network.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3111","id":"954"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.216915,30.421309]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3112","title":"A message of solidarity","published":{"end_time":"2010/10/28 20:19:00 -0400","original":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 00:18:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/10/28 20:18:00 -0400"},"description":"We are with you.

Soto, medical doctor for the Younger You Institute in Santa Rosa Beach, recently started testing and treating patients in relation to high levels of volatile solvents in the blood stream that he says may be linked to BP's oil spill in the Gulf.\n\n\"What I am concerned most about is a long-term effect, that won’t even show up for years, but are going to have tremendous implications in human immune system and hormonal function and brain function,” Soto said.\n\nThese compounds (petroleum and dispersants) are liposoluble; meaning they have a “high affinity for fat,” Soto said.\n\nWhile the clinic specializes in \"anti-aging and aesthetic medicine,\" Soto points out that he is a medical doctor licensed in two states. He said the medical community has been monitoring the spill's impact but has failed to develop adequate treatment methods. \n\n“It is not the fat that you would think of, it is the fat tissue in your body; the brain is 70 percent fat and the glands, immune cells, the intestinal tract, thyroid, breast, prostate, the organs and systems. That is why it causes all of these disorders,” Soto said. “That is why it is so significant for children.\"\n\n\nTo read a related article, click here.\n\nChildren’s brains and reproductive organs and processes are still forming, which could potentially make their exposure to the petro chemicals even more significant.\n\nOkaloosa Island resident Joseph Yerkes says he recently tested positive for high levels of volatile solvents in his blood and is being treated for toxic exposure.\n\nHis longtime attending physician at the Immediate Care Center in Fort Walton Beach performed the test at Yerkes’ request, after he experienced multiple symptoms related to exposure of this type, such as tiredness, lethargy, headaches, blisters, non-healing sores on his elbows and head, as well as an aggravating cough and chronic body aches.\n\nYerkes was referred to a toxicologist following testing. The doctor gave him the sobering news.\n\n“He was very clear about his diagnosis, explaining how dangerous and damaging these chemicals can be to our bodies, and concluded all of my symptoms are due to the elevated, abnormal levels of chemicals present in my system from the Gulf oil spill,” the former Vessels of Opportunity operator, who was employed by BP, told The Sun in a recent e-mail.\n\nYerkes is among a growing number of people testing for high levels of volatile solvents in his blood, one watchdog group claims.\n\nAccording to Mississippi Riverkeeper of the Waterkeeper Alliance, blood samples from eight individuals from Florida (Pensacola) and Alabama, male and female, residents and BP cleanup workers “were analyzed for volatile solvents and all came back with Ethylbenzene and m,p-Xylene  in excess of 95th percentile values of 0.11 ppb for ethylbenzene and 0.34 ppb for m,p-Xylene.” The highest concentration value was four times the 95the percentile.\n\nThe report went on to say, “The blood of all three females and five males had chemicals that are found in the BP crude oil.”\n\nLocal emergency operation officials and health department personnel say they are unfamiliar with this testing.\n\nCapt. Joe Preston, chief for Walton County Emergency Management and Public Safety Division, said, “It falls under more of a public health purview but it is something that needs to be tracked closely.\"\n\nGail Allen, administrator for the Walton County Health Department, said “I have not heard of this (volatile solvents blood) testing.” \n\n“As far as air and water quality, testing, it hasn’t given any indication that it is necessary,” Allen said. “There are things in place to do long-term tracking (of BP workers), but it has not started” yet.\n\nA total of 119 water samples were taken in Walton County, which resulted in one “hit” on July 22 at Grayton Beach State Park. A hit refers to a positive indicator for oil product or dispersants.\n\nAccording to the Department of Environmental Protection website, 23 samples were taken and tested for dispersants between June 22 and Aug. 16, resulting with two “hits.”\n\nBoth “hits” were on Aug.16, one in Escambia/Santa Rosa counties and the other in Bay County, no samplings have been listed since.\n\nThe dispersant “hits” are followed by an asterisk which denotes, “trace amounts of DOSS, which is an ingredient of the Corexit dispersant and other common consumer products, such as paints, coatings and pharmaceutical products, were observed.\" It went on; \"dispersants were never used in state of Florida waters.”\n\nHealth officials such as Dr. Soto said the Exxon oil spill tragedy in Alaska showed it is important to \"provide healthcare\" for people exposed to the hazardous materials. \n\nPart of the treatment, for patients that test positive, will consist of an oral and an intravenous detoxification, said Soto.\n\n“The liver has the ability to detox these compounds efficiently until it gets overloaded or overwhelmed, then it is deposited into the fat cells,” Soto said. “The all natural intravenous agent will help detox through the stool and urine.”\n\nYerkes’ physician’s suggested treatment includes diet and his temporary relocation.\n\n“It’s very hard to accept the fact that I have to leave the Gulf of Mexico,” Yerkes said. “It deeply saddens me after living on or around it, making a living from it, and experiencing the serenity and contentedness it has always brought to me.”\n\n“I don’t know if they can ‘make this right’ anymore,” he added.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3168","id":"967"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04459,30.350783]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3297","title":"bad sulfur odors from Murphy Oil","published":{"end_time":"2010/11/07 22:31:00 -0500","original":"Mon, 08 Nov 2010 03:30:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2010/11/07 22:30:00 -0500"},"description":"bad sulfur odors around the Dollar Tree and DMV Office near Murphy Oil;

Any oil that hits shore is likely to have been weathered into balls or mats of tar, or mixed with seawater in a pudding-like \"mousse,\" the agency reported.\n\nAs of late Thursday morning, no oil or tar balls had washed up, said Buck Lee, executive director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority in Pensacola Beach. Lee, who is not related to Laura Lee, said the area had just had a \"super\" Memorial Day weekend -- but now, \"We're just waiting anxiously to see what happens,\" he added.\n\nLaura Lee said a wave of hotel cancellations hit the island in late April, after the sinking of the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon uncapped an undersea oil well off Louisiana. Those tapered off soon afterward, she said -- \"But this week, there's been another wave of cancellations,\" Laura Lee said. \n\nHotels have responded to the threat by easing cancellation policies. \"Some had guarantees that they would get their money back if there was oil,\" she said.\n\n\n\nVideo: Visitors enjoy 'still-white sand' In addition, charter fishing -- another big business in the area -- has been hurt. Some skippers have gone to work for oil company BP, which has hired boats to help lay protective booms and skim oil off the surface of the Gulf.\n\nTourism pumped about $1.2 billion into the Escambia County economy in 2009, employing roughly 20,000 people and bringing about 3.5 million overnight visitors a year, according to tourism officials. Early July brings two of its biggest annual events -- the Independence Day holiday and the following weekend's Pensacola Beach air show, which features the locally based Navy aerobatic team, the Blue Angels. Faced with those concerns, the locals are trying to harness the power of technology and social media to offset the threat.\n\n\"We're encouraging our visitors who are currently here to post their vacation pictures on Facebook, and a lot of them have done that just so that visitors can see with their own eyes the oil hasn't hit,\" Laura Lee said.\n\nAnd Buck Lee said the island authority hopes to put cameras on the beach and video streaming on the internet within about two weeks, \"so they can see for themselves whether there's oil on the beach or not.\"\n\n\"And there may be,\" he said. \"But we've got to get them the facts.\"","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/577","id":"1005"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.216915,30.421309]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/578","title":"Fisherman's Wife breaks the Silence","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/03 17:37:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 03 17:37:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/03 17:37:00 -0400"},"description":"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Kindra Arnesen's husband often calls while he's out on a shrimping trip, so she wasn't surprised to hear her cell phone ring the night of April 29 while he was on an overnight fishing expedition.\n\nHowever, this time, her husband, David, wasn't calling to tell her about the day's catch or to wish their children Aleena and David Jr. a good night. He was calling to tell her he was sick, and the strange thing about it, so were men on the seven other shrimping boats working near his.\n\n\"I received several calls from him saying, 'This one's hanging over the boat throwing up. This one says he's dizzy, and he's feeling faint. Everybody's loading up their stuff, tying up their rigs and going back to the docks,'\" Arnesen remembers.\n\nArnesen believes it was vapors from the oil and the dispersants from the BP Gulf oil disaster that made her husband and the other shrimpers sick. She says they were downwind of it, and the smell was \"so strong they could almost taste it.\"\n\nFor several weeks, she hesitated to talk publicly about it. Like many fishermen who can no longer fish in the Gulf, her husband has signed a contract to work with BP to clean up the oil, and she doesn't want to bite the hand that puts food on her family's table.\n\nFull coverage: Gulf Coast oil disaster\n\nBut now Arnesen, a 32-year-old \"uneducated housewife\" -- her words -- is breaking her silence and is encouraging others in her community do the same. After attending a lecture by Rikki Ott, a toxicologist who's worked with families affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, Arnesen decided to organize other wives to ask questions about the safety of working near the oil.\n\nHer cell phone rings constantly.\n\n\"Hey, Theresa, how you doing?\" she said, taking a call Tuesday morning. \"Can you come to the meeting tonight?\"\n\nPeople don't want to talk. They're scared.\n\n--Kindra Arneson\n But Theresa can't come to the meeting, and Arnesen has come to expect such a response.\n\n\"People don't want to talk. They're scared,\" she says, of repercussions and consequences from BP. \"Our financial situation lays in the palm of their hands.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidence.\"\n\nWhen David Arnesen reported that the other men were so sick they were cutting their shrimping trips short and heading home, his wife knew something strange was happening. Shrimpers work through illness, she says, because a trip cut short can cost a shrimper thousands of dollars.\n\nShe says the men had all the same symptoms at the same time -- vomiting, dizziness, headaches, shortness of breath. Could it be a coincidence?\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidence. It would be one thing if one of them got sick. It would maybe be OK if two got sick,\" she says. \"When everyone's getting sick all at the same time, that's not coincidence\"\n\nWhen asked at a news conference Sunday about people getting sick while out on the Gulf, BP CEO Tony Hayward had his own theory.\n\n\"Food poisoning is clearly a big issue,\" HE said. \"It's something we've got to be very mindful of.\"\n\nArnesen says there's no way her husband and the men on the other boats had fallen victim to food poisoning, noting the men were on eight boats and didn't eat the same food.\n\nThe night her husband became ill, Arnesen says, she tried to get him to come home like the other shrimpers, but he refused. He stayed out fishing from 6 p.m. until 9 a.m. the next morning, and came home so sick he collapsed into his recliner without eating dinner or saying hello to her or the children.\n\n\"It's a nasty cough. I literally woke him up over and over again,\" she says. \"It didn't sound like he was getting enough air.\n\nAt first, David refused to see a doctor, but after three weeks of coughing and feeling weak, he agreed to go. His wife says he was diagnosed with respiratory problems and prescribed medicines, including an antibiotic and cough medicines.\n\nShe says while he's feeling better, he still doesn't have the energy he used to have.\n\n\"Here we are over a month later and he's still not completely well,\" she says.\n\nMasks and marshes\n\nSince CNN aired a story about her Tuesday night, Kindra Arnesen says she's received phone calls from as far away as Texas from people wanting to team up with her to protect coastal communities from the oil.\n\nOne of her immediate goals is to persuade BP to give its workers masks.\n\nGraham MacEwen, a spokesman for BP, says the company isn't providing masks because their air monitoring shows there's no health threats to workers.\n\nHe denied Arnesen's accusations that BP has prevented workers from wearing their own masks, saying workers may do so as long as they read training materials on how to use a mask safely.\n\nArnesen is also working to have BP fund an effort to put sandbags along the marshes in her area to keep the oil out.\n\n(Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal announced Wednesday that the White House has ordered BP to fund Louisiana's plan to dredge up walls of sand along its coast.)\n\nArnesen says she is indeed scared that her husband will lose her job now that she's speaking out.\n\n\"Am I scared? Yes,\" she said. \"Anything that ever starts, starts with one. And if I have to be the one then I have to be the one,\" she says.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/578","id":"1006"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.367317,29.2684]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/579","title":"oil spill smell","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/03 13:42:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 03 13:42:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/03 13:42:00 -0400"},"description":"Oil spill smell in #nola medical area this morning RT Smell #oilspill ?

The state is working to put them back before the oil reaches its shores.\n\n\"Our goal is to make sure no oil goes onto the beach or into the estuary,\" says Gov. Bob Riley.\n\nBut coastal residents are bracing for the worst.\n\nNews that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed much of the Gulf to fishing came Sunday as colorfully decorated boats lined up in Bayou La Batre, Ala., for a yearly ritual in the town that calls itself the \"seafood capital of the state.\"\n\nSince 1949, the archbishop of Mobile has come down to the bayou to pray for a bountiful harvest from the sea and for the safety of the oystermen, shrimpers and commercial anglers who ply the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIt's usually a community celebration with music, fresh seafood and a party on every boat. This year, however, the mood was somber with the knowledge that a giant oil slick was just offshore.\n\n\"They really need a blessing this year,\" Darvin Barbour said. \"That oil is just going to tear us up this year.\"\n\nBarbour, 36, has lived in Bayou La Batre all his life.\n\nIt's \"getting ready to change big time for everybody,\" Barbour added. \"No more seafood. Bunch [of] people are going to be in dire need.\"\n\nBP has been offering anglers in Bayou La Batre and elsewhere payments up to $5,000 if they give up their right to sue. Alabama Attorney General Troy King has told BP to stop circulating the settlement agreements and is urging Alabamians to seek legal counsel before signing anything.\n\nBarbour, a former shrimper, says meetings so far with representatives from BP have not been helpful.\n\n\"One person says you need to do this, somebody else says you need to do that. We don't know what we need to do,\" Barbour said. \"If we knew what we need to know, then we could go out and do something. But you don't know.\"\n\nArchbishop Thomas Rodi, during his blessing, acknowledged the anxiety and prayed for the responders:\n\n\"We ask God to bless those who are working to contain and to stop the oil leak. We ask God to protect us, to protect the livelihoods of those who make their living in the seafood industry and tourism industry. And we ask God to protect our way of life which is imperiled by this danger of this oil slick.\"\n\nThen it was time for the blessing of the boats on the water. The archbishop stood on the bow of the lead boat, and a few dozen vessels followed out to the mouth of the bayou.\n\nFisherman Wilson Johnson, 35, was in his small aluminum boat, hoping to get a sprinkle of holy water as he contemplated a murky future.\n\n\"We've lived on the bayou our whole life. That's all we know. That just sad if something does happen and you gotta move away, where would we go? My daddy's daddy's daddy — that's all we ever knew was seafood.\"\n\nMelissa Bosarge Nelson also grew up here, her family working in the seafood industry. Now she's a tour operator.\n\n\"It's hard to think about,\" Nelson said. \"I can't image not being able to get in my boat to go out. We have pleasure boats. Our company, we run the sightseeing cruises from Bellingrath Gardens and already we've seen a decline because people aren't coming to Orange Beach and we're not getting the tourists during the day.\"\n\nShe says at least with a hurricane you can start rebuilding when the storm passes, but this disaster has no end in sight.\n\n\"Who would think that this would happen?\" Nelson asked. \"I'm not an engineer, but seems to me you would have five or six ways to cut that thing off.\"\n\nNelson and others here wonder whether Bayou La Batre will even have a fleet to bless come next May.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jo Bonner of Mobile says a lot is hanging in the balance. \"This may be one of those life-changing moments that an individual, a community, a region of the country is living through,\" he said.\n\nBonner says even if the well is capped today, this could still be the biggest environmental and economic crisis the Gulf Coast has ever faced.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/63","id":"1022"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.248117,30.403253]}},{"properties":{"title":"tar balls on gulf shores beaches while beaches remain open","guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/630","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/05 16:09:01 -0400","original":"Sat Jun 05 16:09:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/05 16:09:00 -0400"},"description":"children had oil all over there feet today around 1 pm in gulfshores as the beaches remain open and clean up crews sat around waiting for the orders to start cleaning","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/630","id":"1023"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.700819,30.246036]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/631","title":"oil smell- Fort Pickens","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/07 00:20:01 -0400","original":"Mon Jun 07 00:20:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/07 00:20:00 -0400"},"description":"Strong smell of oil near Fort Pickens, Gulf Breezes, FL this morning","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/631","id":"1024"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.299139,30.328811]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/635","title":"Dead shark and Drum- Lake Coquille","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/06 02:51:01 -0400","original":"Sun Jun 06 02:51:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/06 02:51:00 -0400"},"description":"I found two dead sharks and one dead drum floating while fishing today.

We had to fly at 3,000 feet due to a 'temporary flight restriction' that has been in place since the BP drilling disaster began.  For clarity's sake, we may want to refer to this as a 'media flight restriction,' no media flights have gotten approval to fly over the oil impacts, and the area that's closed has expanded exponentially, now keeping people out of the air over most of Southeast Louisiana. Our pilots have been told by BP representatives that we can't fly into these areas, once they find out we're with environmental groups and we have cameras.\n\nAt 3,000 feet you need an awfully long lens and an awfully clear day to get any decent shots, but our photographer really captured powerful images on this trip.  It's clear the oil has fouled a wide stretch of the bird's foot delta.  It's safe to assume this won't be the last area spoiled, though I can't guarantee we'll be able to get you the images.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/859","id":"1117"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.089567,29.095279]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/860","title":"Stench at Blue Mtn Beach","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/16 19:32:01 -0400","original":"Wed Jun 16 19:32:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/16 19:32:00 -0400"},"description":"There is a distinct odor in the air that I've never smelled prior to spill.

Part of the procedure will prevent further casing blowouts and reduce the depth required to inject the one million, one hundred thousand pound column of mud (actually, only the 9 5/8” diameter portion X 13,000 feet) above the reservoir to counteract hydrostatic pressure, estimated by some at 13,000 psi from the reservoir. With the use of a mud with an overall density of 5.85 instead of 1.67 as is required for a 13,000 foot column, the higher density can be achieved by using depleted uranium powder and as only a 25% component of the mix, the column can be reduced to 3,600 feet in length from 13,000 feet. Combining this with chloroform, a dense fluid, (1.489 specific gravity vs. water at 1.0)  instead of water, would further increase the mud density and required column length of mud. With lead substituted for depleted U, the column length required is still only 5,500 feet long. Again, only a static pressure head is active (~ 13,000 psi ). Change mud composition slowly as proceed with injection. Have interceptor well approach the target well at a vertical upward angle to bring into play the Venturi effect to assist in pushing mud into the well.  With the oil not moving, then an additional amount of the mud mixture designed specifically for this purpose can be injected into the well-slowly- to provide an increase in the safety margin for balancing downward pressure until cement can be added to seal the well.  \n\nFor the mud liquid carrier, Chloroform is produced in nature and is liquid at room temperature, and pressure and which by itself has a higher density than some mud’s (1.489 gm/cc) but its density characteristics with  pressure and temperature, and the earth’s thermal gradient (~+75 degrees Fahrenheit/ mile of depth) may not make it the best candidate for the carrier fluid. Identify the best one by brainstorming. Also, as noted, the solid portion should be looked at under these circumstances where cost is no object, i. e. lead, @11.83g/cc or after an initial injection of lead mud as a buffer, depleted uranium at ~ 19.07 g/cc or a combination.  All of these materials are readily available and safe to use if handled properly. Also, consider adding different chemicals to the water/chloroform that are soluble in them and heavy or may react to form purposeful hydrates, in the presence of methane etc. \n\nContinuation Of Summary\n\nThe BP oil spill is not being handled in a professional and logical manner. In addition to reducing the depth for the interceptor well, the technical problems that could have been identified early on at the blow out protector (BOP) on the sea floor to totally stop the flow of oil are described. Then, how each of these problems could have been met with proper brain-storming techniques. Next, how BP seems to have missed the boat on some of these aspects. Then an overview of some equipment or procedures to address these technical problems. Then some bells and whistles one should include on one equipment concept. Then a critique of some of the deficiencies I have identified in BP’s work based on information I have read and TV reports  and BP write-ups and videos I have seen. Then some second guessing and what might have been. Then, problems with BP’s approach to this specific problem. Next, what an oil company’s philosophy might be for moving forward and what can the US government do to more proactively work toward more quickly finding solutions to the spill.  Lastly, my credentials for making these statements. \n\n* * indicates the idea under discussion can be expanded and/or additional ideas, examples or concepts can be provided by the author.\n\n\n\n\nThe drilling depth to intercept is based on the height of the mud column needed to balance the static and dynamic oil pressure. Instead use the drilling records for drill speed, rock density etc to determine the safe depth below which there is no concern for case integrity in the event a rupture of the casing has taken place. * *\n\n One other point. If I can come up with a basis for drilling to a shallower depth (time) for interception, others may have too- with even better suggestions. Has BP started a shallow interception well as a backup and for redundancy? They need to.\n\n\n\nSome Concerns Regarding The Present Design Of The BOP.\n\nHaving heard that the well casing may have failed when mud was injected under high pressure, who can say that it might or might not have failed if the BOP had been activated and it performed as planned? Oil would be leaking into the seabed without any indication of failure. \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNeedless to say. No, maybe it does need to be said. The people who are responsible for this program to date have not exhibited the proper amount of caution when making decisions until only very recently. They apparently have taken the magnitude of the event as an indication that they must bow to public pressure and get something done- even if it turns out to be only partially effective or wrong. Use caution. Listen. Test where possible. Use actual models, not just computer ones. Brainstorm properly. In my experience as a researcher these are critical to a true understanding of what is going on.\n\nTechnical Problems.\n \n1.\tFrom before the start, BP should have had a plan. From the start BP should have been thinking about putting in place a system on the ocean floor that would be anchored and allow easy positioning of objects they brought down to the BOP, the blow-out preventer. An anchored incrementally movable cable system of some sort with sensors. Or like a frame that is like the female part of a socket so that once in place, new containment equipment could be easily positioned.  Also, samples of oil and venting gas to calculate gas fraction, determine oil density, chemical characteristics, particle content, particle hardness, friability, compressability, flow characteristics, corrosion characteristic, etc. The latter may have been done but how soon? Then when they formed, an analysis of the hydrates. More on this later. In other words, there should have been an emergency plan in place before drilling began to quickly provide direction and have in place or at least on hand material, people and assignments in the event of a disaster. There obviously wasn’t a good one.\n2.\tThe major problem should not have involved trying to siphon off part of the flow of oil. The major problem is stopping the flow.\n3.\tRe sawing off the tube, which could have ended up being a disaster. As any woodsman knows, hollow wood branches or even solid ones are going to most likely pinch the blade unless you stabilize the branch or pull it apart as you saw. A laser or welding torch approach would probably have been better. BP may have been lucky they were able to fully make the cut with the shear.* *\n4.\tOne needs to place something over/ around/ under or in the emitting tube or physically reduce the size of the opening to be able to slow and then stop the oil flow in a controlled manner. \n5.\tBP hasn’t to date totally addressed the problem of how do you get a cap on the oil when it is coming out at a pressure to produce a flow rate of  over six hundred and forty thousand gallons of oil a day (7 ½ gallons per second) from a column that is a couple of miles long/tall. Plus millions of cubic  feet of gas It is like a kid trying to place a closed nozzle on a flowing garden hose. So they ended up opening up the nozzle and managed to physically hold a  leaky “miss-threaded” cap in place but they now have to siphon a portion off. Knowing they might be successful in capturing large amounts of oil, why didn’t they have that capacity in place on standby?   Who is involved in logistics?\n6.\tThey still haven’t really put the cap on the tube, they have just moved the capping location away from the BOP head. \n7.\tThe problem here is static pressure  (momentum or dynamic pressure is minimal). One has to realize that that several mile long column of incompressible oil pressure needs to be addressed slowly. One cannot go to zero or negative velocity instantly. It has to be done slowly. An analogy is “How do you catch a speeding bullet? ”You surely don’t put your hand over it and try and stop it.” I heard on TV earlier that literally thousands of gallons of mud were forced down the tube at high pressure and rate in the “top kill” exercise. And then the procedure was quickly shut down due to something being amiss. I heard an earlier BP video where the Engineer in charge bragged about their high pressure/high volume capacity for this exercise. Under the pumping conditions described, the friction effects and the long column of uncompressible oil  and compressed gas, raised the pressure in the tube to the point apparently where it exceeded the rupture strength of the drill pipe casing along a portion of the pipe. I do not understand how this could be allowed to happen, but it apparently did. This concept is taught in freshman Statics. A basic Mechanical Engineering exercise. \n8.\tThe solution then is to fit some kind of device around or in the pipe that may leak at first and that doesn’t restrict the flow in any way and then by increments, fix the leak(s)…. \n9.\tand eventually address the main flow out of the tube in such a way that the size of the flow stream is made smaller and smaller until it is finally cut off. And monitor the pressure and don’t let it exceed the critical value. \n10.\tObviously, it is important to monitor other important factors so one can slow down or adjust procedures in the event the system becomes unstable.\n11.\tHow might it become unstable? For example, if the equipment exceeds its pressure rating or if it were to shift allowing oil to flow out of new leaks created by the shift. \n12.\tIt is important to have overkill and redundancy built into the equipment and sensors. \n13.\t It is important to have a method of capturing or reducing the size of leaks in a controlled systematic manner that the flow of oil at high pressure, velocity and volume has negligible impact on the process as it proceeds. In other words we don’t want to try and cap the oil we want the oil pressure to help, not hinder the process of slowing then stopping the oil flow if at all possible. The system needs to be stable, once it is in place, and not move. This can be done in stages.\n14.\tThe system needs to have methods of introducing “mud” and cement to the desired locations and at the proper time to eventually cap the well.\n\n\nWhat might have been proposed before BP began their poorly conceived and exercised capping concept is the following:\n\nEquipment. \n\nIf the well pipe extending out of the BOP has not been cut too short, drill small holes for inserting pressure and velocity gages. Then place a swagger over the end of the pipe and slowly swage it closed using a pointer swagger. The swagger will not interfere with the oil stream and as the tube is concentrically swaged, the flow and pressure can be monitored. Further, the wall thickness will increase as swaging proceeds so that the danger for rupture or expansion at this location will decrease as swaging proceeds.  However, it appears to be too short even for this. If longer, a conventional tube swagger might have been used. The swagger would have to be pressurized of course and pneumatically operated. Too bad this contingency wasn’t allowed for.* *\n\nBF Deficiencies.\n\nI have only watched a couple of BP’s video’s. And a couple of updates, They really don’t get it. There has been no sense of urgency. From the president on down. The words sometimes aren’t even right. The president wants everyone to see that he is on top of everything. He isn’t. The “This  is the first time this has been attempted at a mile underwater” is of no importance. If BP had had a real tested plan and had thought ahead working at these depths would be old hat. BP stated they are working with the smartest brains in America. The experts in their fields. I see several things wrong. Their list of experts is apparently outdated and they have not picked  all of the right fields of expertise. Also, their experts either have big egos and can’t work together or they have poor leadership. I assume the latter.  I have seen no evidence of their brainpower until recently when vents were discussed and a legitimate cautious tone was taken following the “Top Kill” attempt. \n\nI saw the BP video with the white box. Actually I think it had been gotten from another shallow water project. It had to be painted white I guess so it could be seen. How long does it take to find it and get it to the site? Does it take a day or more to let it dry?  Then when it failed because of hydrates plugging up the “siphon tube” it was set aside on the sea floor.  So if they decide they need it again they will have to bring it up to modify it. Hydrates. Plugging.  Isn’t this what one eventually wants to do? So, can you enhance the effect and make it happen so much it reduces the oil flow and potentially even stops it until the interceptor drilling does it’s job?  Can one use an analysis of the hydrates to add to the seawater around the box, or if they had thought to place ports in the box, inject hydrate material directly into the box so the solution is supersaturated? I also heard from the chief engineer that the seawater around the box was about 30 degrees, below freezing for fresh water, but above it for seawater and they were using methanol to reduce hydrates. Two things. What would injecting or blanketing fresh water around the box do? Would it make ice? Would pumping liquid nitrogen to or into the box freeze even seawater or make the hydrate formation even “better”? Certainly it might make the oil more viscous. I heard brainstorming was done and explained after a reporters question re golf balls and tire pieces and towels. It was acknowledged that that was what was going to be used. So they could then inject mud that would stay put. “Top Kill”. First off, that is a poor excuse for brainstorming.* * My first thoughts off the top were metallic Velcro, Velcro with both hooks and loops on every piece. Then that box that is sitting on the seafloor could have all kinds of hooky catchy things welded to the inside. So as they injected material they would get caught onto it. Then treble fish hooks. Then why release stuff into the box without holding on to it and being able to move it up and down in the oil stream. So go fishing with hooks on a cable. With bobbers and vanes in order to direct them. Then umbrellas to open up in the oil flow. All attached to cables? Then Velcro covered bucky balls.  Then a scrap yard electro-magnet attached to the box, or several and inject iron objects which would be held in the box. And on and on.\n\nAnother thing that was particularly disturbing was the answer to the question about help from people outside BP. Something like yes, we have gotten thousands of suggestions but of course we have thought of most of them. A typical NOT INVENTED HERE answer. How could anyone have a solution better than ours? We are the experts. On brainstorming one should encourage answers, not discourage them. Very poor PR too. * *\n\nSecond Guessing. What Might Have Been Done.\n\nIsn’t it criminal to have a system so complicated and expensive that you can’t afford to test it and provide instructions that TWO upper management people must “Push the Button”? And have something that could fail? And did with no backup? Even in spite of warnings? Why wasn’t management looking for a better system? A system that was simple, not costly to test periodically and had some redundancy. A non ‘all or nothing’ system? I think I know what that system is but why don’t they? * * At the least why didn’t someone think about what would happen under the conditions where a blowout could occur. As it did. How could this disaster have been minimized and lives saved?\n\nSimple.\n\nTHE REASON THE PLATFORM SANK AND PROBABLY LIVES WERE LOST IS BECAUSE THE FIRE WAS FUELED WITH OIL FROM THE WELL AND PIPE TO THE PLATFORM.  IF THAT PIPE HAD BEEN SEVERED, AUTOMATICALLY, ON RECEIVING THE SIGNAL FROM A SENSOR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO FUEL TO FEED THE FIRE. AND IF A CONTAINMENT DEVICE HAD BEEN IN PLACE AROUND THE WELL-HEAD THERE WOULD BE NO OIL SPILL TO SPEAK OF. AND, EVEN AFTER THE FIRE STARTED, THERE WERE TWO+ DAYS BEFORE THE PLATFORM  SANK * *\n\nProblems With BP’s Approach to This Specific Problem.\n\nThe main problem I find with BP’s approach is they placed no or little value on anything except money when they didn’t have to. Everything we have seen is all a façade. Image. Image. Image. No real integrity. They don’t really know what they are doing as it has nothing to do with the routine job of oil drilling but they would like our government and the public to think they do. \n\n\n\nPhilosophy.\n\nI worked at Alcoa when Paul O’Neal was President. He set as a goal for everyone in the company the goal of safety and being a good community neighbor. And he meant it. He fired a VP once who allowed a site to become polluted and he also made sure that every accident or near miss was autopsied. And a correction was made so that it couldn’t happen again. And accident rates dropped and continue to drop. I heard Rand Paul has said that the BP incident was an accident. It wasn’t With BP’s set of priorities. It was bound to happen sooner or later. It didn’t need to happen but it did. An indication it was going to, was the number of violations found in the BP Texas refinery disaster. I understand more than 50 times the next highest number recorded by a competitor. Who is to blame for all of this? In my mind the first to blame is the president of BP. The second is the board who hired him. On moving forward I would like to see every oil company held accountable to standards of safety that are moving targets and require ongoing commitments of money and resources to safety and environmental protection including research programs that address prevention and better, faster and more complete cleanup solutions. And not just mechanical devices but other off the wall approaches including dispersant development and testing, microbe testing, where the oil goes, how to recapture it and so on. And the oil company pays out of their oil profits. \n\nWhat Can The US Government Do To More Proactively Find Solutions To The Spill?  \n\nI have been in research all of my professional life. It is disappointing to me to see some aspects of basic research being conducted in an esoteric fashion such that to find a practical use is below the researcher. For example, if one is working in a high purity metal system, isn’t it more practical to work in a system that allows the results to be used by the companies production divisions who in both the short term and long term financially support the research? There is a lot of research being conducted under the sponsorship of the US government that could be pointed toward finding solutions to many of the environmental problems the gulf faces. And it might be beneficial to us all to have the government place incentives on certain area’s of effort.  \nAlso, we have a new energy resource that has just been identified to have reserves that will last decades. I believe the government should mandate use of shale natural gas in vehicles and for other energy requirements where it can be substituted for oil and oil bi-products, I have numerous other thought regarding the cleanup but this too long already.  * * Also, about a better BOP system.  * *  I’d be happy to talk about any of this.\n\nFinally as part of a restitution plan use income tax statements to determine prior income related to anything that has been curtailed by the spill and have BP fund a fraction of this money back to affected citizens.\n \nI hope this information is communicated by you and others to other people with the where-with-all to make things happen. I believe this paper identifies some of the real problems that have not been addressed and contains practical solutions that can be implemented quickly and perhaps will provide guidance to prevent further problems.\n\n\n\nCredentials.\n\nI am a retired PhD in Metallurgical Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Physics.

The lower part of the three part cylinder fits inside the cofferdam and the upper portion extends above the tube from which the oil is emitting. \n4.\tThe lower stage fits down into the cofferdam and about 2/3 the way up the BOP and is fitted with numerous hydraulic cylinders facing inward up and down and around the circumference of the lower portion of the three stage cylinder that can be activated slowly in tandem from four or more points of the compass, north, south, east, west at once. This is so that the overall cylinder can be mechanically stabilized by pushing from all sides on the BOP. \n5.\tA schematic of the BOP should be used to determine which hydraulic cylinders to active first as there are welded on pipes and flanges on the BOP. This is in order to prevent shifting of the three stage cylinder during activation of the hydraulic cylinders. \n6.\tAt the top of the lower section are baffles that directs any oil that is leaking around the tube toward the openable and closable vents that are around the periphery of stage two of the three stage cylinder. They start out open.  They are of a size to minimize any back pressure. At the juncture between section one and two there is a “rubber” gasket that prevents the majority of the oil from going down into the lower section so that this lower section is filled either with seawater or oil that is relatively stagnant. There are ports in the lower section so that first mud and then a catalytic cement can be injected at the appropriate time to fill the lower portion of the cylinder. \n7.\tOnce the cylinder is in place and the hydraulic cylinders have been activated inward, shot will be placed between the lower part of the cylinder and cofferdam to act as a partial seal. Then enough mud will be injected to complete the seal and finally the cement will be added to complete the stabilization of the three part cylinder. The shot may be mixed with small pieces of cellophane or rubber balloons etc. to enhance the seal. The cement will also provide additional stability to the cylinder as there are protrusions from the BOP and provide redundancy in the event one or more of the hydraulic cylinders fails with time. There will be stresses placed on the cylinder during the final stage of reducing flow from closing the upper portion of the tube that need to be addressed. \n8.\tOnce the cement has set and the cylinder is stable motion wise, it will be time to close the vents in the middle section of the cylinder. At this point there will be no motion of the oil although it may be under some elevated pressure due to any friction conditions that exist concerning the upper portion of the cylinder. Once the vents are closed, in the second section, a valve in the second section can be activated and the same type of cement as used before can be employed to fill stage two of the cylinder under high pressure, further stabilizing the cylinder. \n9.\tOnce this cement has set up, work can begin on the third stage of the cylinder.\n10.\tThe description of the third stage of the cylinder is simple. It is of simple design. Namely, it is a cylinder of perhaps almost no flair (remember the upper portion of stage two was tapered to provide a seated fit) then flairs out to one half to one inch clearance that extends maybe two to three inches to a foot beyond the end of the tube which is gushing oil. \n11.\tOn the end of the cylinder is a valve which is infinitely adjustable as to how open it is.  It should start fully open. When fully open it should provide no impingement on the oil flowing out of the tube. The thickness of the cylinder and welds material should provide a triple or more than usual safety factor for pressure based on fully annealed material. If possible the material should be thick enough that it won’t exceed it’s fatigue limit. If possible all material and welds should be stress relieved.  The valve(s) should be of such a design that the high pressure oil should not impede it’s operation. And it should be such that if the mechanical, hydraulic or electric closing operation should fail, it will slowly close automatically and provide a positive seal like a butterfly valve. However, if the calculated critical pressure for rupture is approached the closure should stop. For redundancy it may be desirable to have two or more of these in series in the event one were to fail. On the side of this third stage of the cylinder will again be incorporated high pressure inlet ports so that mud can be slowly pumped into the throat of the tube as needed to reduce the pressure followed by the appropriate cement to seal the well.    \n\nBells and Whistles\n\n1.\tTwo adjustable crossing cables with load cells to hang across to the other side of the BOP so that loads can be monitored by tightening the cables. These could be placed such that the protrusions on the BOP act as anchor locations for the cables as they are tightened. The load cells would then alert one to any shifting of the three stage cylinder.\n2.\tPressure gauges in each stage of the cylinder. \n3.\tStress gauges at numerous critical points on the cylinder.\n4.\tQuick snap easy release high pressure fittings. \n5.\tVelocity meters in throat of third stage and elsewhere.\n6.\tVibration meters to make sure no harmonics are set up.\n7.\tIndependent non backward flow valves for the hydraulic cylinders.\n8.\tPosition meters to positively identify the valve open amount and   position.\n9.\tTemperature sensors. \n10.\tMud sensors. \n11.\tCement sensors. Ultrasound?? Resistance meters?\n12.\tFurther larger cylindrical cap to further encapsulate the total system to be filled with cement once the system is sealed.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/863","id":"1120"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.066406,30.675715]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/866","title":"Simple methods to clean up oil slick","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 00:57:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 00:57:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 00:57:00 -0400"},"description":"The following are some suggested methods to clean up both large and near shore oil slicks.\n \n http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AeZfEkgmBH37ZG5jNDl4el85N2ZzdG1mdGRq&amp;hl=en (New oilspill)\n\n http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AeZfEkgmBH37ZG5jNDl4el8xMDBjaHY1Mjlncw&amp;hl=en (near shore)","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/866","id":"1121"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.987294,29.236617]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/867","title":"awful  smell","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 01:31:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 01:31:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 01:31:00 -0400"},"description":"I work in Destin and live  in  Niceville  Florida.\nThe smell  today was the  the worse day yet!\nI  could hardly stand it and worried if it was toxic or not,\nI was surprised this  smell was still in the  air in Niceville  as well,about  25 miles from the beach in Destin.\nIm really worried for my children s health playing outside.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/867","id":"1122"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.460202,30.501563]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/868","title":"human disaster relief?/mitigation","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/18 01:22:01 -0400","original":"Fri Jun 18 01:22:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/18 01:22:00 -0400"},"description":"Considering the likely toxicity of air,  disruption of services etc. relating to this unprecedented Chemical Spill,  it would seem that FEMA would be obligated by Presidential Directive 5(HSPD-5) to institute a N.I.M.S. response with regard to the human hazards apparent in N.O.

United States.  President Nungesser pleaded for a more “pro-active” approach to seeking out and rescuing the pelicans and other wildlife endangered by the oil.  He asked the Humane Society to work with the contractors cleaning the birds to come up with a better way to enlist the help of volunteers.  Dozens of people, including experienced veterinarians coming from all over the area and the country, should be brought in to help save our wildlife. \n“We shouldn’t be turning them away, we need all the help we can get,” said President Nungesser.  “We want to improve our comfort level of knowing someone is out there looking for these birds and other animals – doing all they can to save them.”\nThe Plaquemines Parish Inland Waterways Strike Force recently discovered broken eggs and crushed chicks on Queen Bess Island.  As you can see in the pictures, plastic bags containing snare boom were recklessly placed without consideration for the natural wildlife on the island.\n“The people BP sent out to clean up oil trampled the nesting grounds of Brown Pelicans and other birds.  Pelicans just came off the endangered species list in November of last year.  They already have the oil affecting their population during their reproduction time, now we have the so called clean up crews stomping eggs,” said President Nungesser.  “The lack of urgency and general disregard for Louisiana’s wetlands and wildlife is enough to make you sick.”","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/886","id":"1133"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.957572,29.304948]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/887","title":"Clean-Up Crew Destroyed Tern Colony","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 12:38:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 12:38:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 12:38:00 -0400"},"description":"Tern colony nesting area destryed by clean-up crew four-wheelers on grand\nisle\n\n--\nSent using SMS-to-email.

NOAA is currently in the process of conducting thorough testing to determine the circumstances surrounding the mammal’s death, as well as collect information about its life. This is the first dead whale reported since BP’s rig exploded on April 20. It was not found in oiled waters; however, its location of death is unknown.\n\nAs soon as the whale was sighted, Pisces Field Party Chief Paul Felts called the marine mammal hotline to report the finding to the Wildlife Branch of the Unified Command and NOAA’s marine mammal experts.\n\n\nBased on the estimated size of the whale, scientists believe it is a sub-adult. Its condition suggests it may have been dead for between several days to more than a week. Although it was not found in oiled water, NOAA marine mammal experts are using hindcasting analysis to look into the location from which the whale carcass may have drifted.\n\nWhile it is impossible to confirm whether exposure to oil was the cause of death, NOAA is reviewing whether factors such as ship strikes and entanglement can be eliminated. Samples collected from this carcass will be stored under proper protocols and handed off when the Pisces comes to port on July 2, or possibly if another boat is sent to meet the Pisces. Full analysis of the samples will take several weeks.\n\nIn accordance with the Wildlife Branch protocols, NOAA’s Southeast Regional Marine Mammal Stranding Coordinator Blair Mase requested that the NOAA field crew take photographs of the approximately 25-foot whale, collect skin swab for oil analysis, collect blubber and skin samples for analysis, and measure its height in the water. Although the whale is very decomposed, the photographs and samples will help scientists better understand how long it has been dead. The blubber and skin samples will be used for genetic analysis and to determine the sex of the animal. Measurements of the whale floating in the water will be used to determine how far and how fast it might have floated from where it died. The carcass has been marked so that aerial reconnaissance teams will be able to identify the individual and will not report it as a new mortality.\n\nNOAA and the Unified Command Wildlife Branch have had numerous reports of sperm whales seen swimming in the oil, but this is the first confirmed report of a dead whale since the BP oil spill began. NOAA remains concerned about sperm whales, which are the only endangered resident cetaceans in the upper Gulf of Mexico. Sperm whales spend most of their time in the upper Gulf offshore area, live at depth in areas where subsurface dispersants and oil are present, and feed on deepwater squid, which may also be impacted by the oil and dispersants.\n\nThe NOAA Ship Gordon Gunter sailed yesterday for a multi-week cruise to do photo identification, assessments, tagging, biopsies, and prey-density studies for sperm whales and Bryde’s whales. Nearshore and offshore response efforts are continuing, and include investigations to determine cause of death or illness for dolphins that have stranded and aerial surveys for cetaceans throughout the area.  The information gained from these efforts will help assess the impacts of this event on cetaceans in the Gulf of Mexico.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/893","id":"1137"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.286133,27.76133]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/894","title":"Bird nesting grounds threatened by oil overtopping booms. queen bess island","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 17:58:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 17:58:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 17:58:00 -0400"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBird nesting grounds threatened by oil overtopping booms. queen bess island","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/894","id":"1138"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.957572,29.304948]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/895","title":"Excessive oil in the jetties on grand terre","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/17 16:52:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 17 16:52:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/17 16:52:00 -0400"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nExcessive oil in the jetties on grand terre","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/895","id":"1139"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.895626,29.302447]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/896","title":"Meet up Group for Volunteer Opportunities","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/18 23:14:01 -0400","original":"Fri Jun 18 23:14:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/18 23:14:00 -0400"},"description":"We will discuss the planning and logistics of mobilizing our task force to the areas that we deem the most vulnerable, such as animal sanctuaries and hatcheries.

Morgan can be accessed) and am going to post here as well now. \n\nYesterday evening a wave of weathered crude oil washed up on the beach in front of where I live (between the 2 and 3 mile markers on the Gulf side of Ft. Morgan). Oil mats covered 2-3 feet from the low tide line by 9  pm. I am attaching pics. Though there are almost no birds on the beach now, a lone black skimmer was feeding in the oiled water last night. Coquina clams have been dying in large #s for weeks now. This morning at high tide we have lots of tarballs (last pic). \n\nI called the 1-800-424-8802  number to report the smell and oil mats, then the BP (866) 448-5816 number to report the oil mats. I asked that a cleaning crew be sent to clean last night whale the temps were down, tide was low (and thus oil exposed) and before the tide came in. They made sympathetic noises, but I have seen no clean-up crew. The regular patrol raced down the beach this morning around 7 am (as usual) so fast they could not possibly see anything. The next patrol shortly after went slower but they were driving up near the houses and so far from the water they could not possibly see the tar balls. I wonder why the \"popular\" beaches are getting cleaning crews working to clean at night, but we are ignored except for the token patrols? I have asked repeatedly that the patrols travel at the tide line, not high up on the beach where they run over protected dune recovery plantings, and that their vehicles be clearly identified (company name and vehicle ID clearly/easily visible). So far this has not happened. They do us not good riding where they can't see the beached oil. Residents are concerned since anyone can now ride up and down the beach claiming to be working with the clean-up. As happened after Ivan and Katrina, we are now having people driving the beach casing houses and a number of house and car break-ins lately. Please do something about these issues.","link":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/998","id":"1179"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.984695,30.228518]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/999","title":"oil is entering Mobile Bay at Dixie Bar","published":{"end_time":"2010/06/24 21:24:01 -0400","original":"Thu Jun 24 21:24:00 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/06/24 21:24:00 -0400"},"description":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe oil is entering Mobile Bay at Dixie Bar at the mouth of the bay.

Morning walks on the beach the past few days reminded me of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring”(only it isn’t DDT that is the cause this time-it is BP oil): no sanderlings are running up and down the beach, no plovers in sight, one lone skimmer plies the waves near shore for fish, one lone tern hovers above the water where once there were dozens, but there are two willets –one found a sand flea (one of the very few living creatures we have seen in the littoral zone sand lately). Where are all the gulls that normally circle noisily overhead?? Sand crab holes are absent-most sand crabs were “sifted out” or crushed during the “deep cleaning (translation grinding up and burying of the oil). A neighbor reports several dead gulls in the surf…\n\nTar balls continue to wash up on shore regularly and stain can regularly be seen at the water's edge(see pics 6-18 66 &amp; 66, &amp; 6-27). The sand in the area that was “deep cleaned” has a different texture that sand past the dunes which has little or no oil mixed in.  The “deep-cleaned” sand is no longer white. It is light brown (see pic 6-18-11\\P6183463). We continue to find oil on the soles of our shoes when we come back from the beach areas that were oiled. We no longer dare to walk barefoot in the sand, nor do we or our resident neighbors swim in the water. Tourist, who have been told the oil is all cleaned up swim, lay on the beach, walk barefoot, and allow their young children to play in the oiled sand.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3808","id":"a63a4d153sxp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.985039,30.228666]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3864","title":"SWIFT ENERGY OPERATING LLC. crude oil release","published":{"end_time":"2011/06/27 23:31:00 -0400","original":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 03:30:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2011/06/27 23:30:00 -0400"},"description":"NRC report #980977: CALLER STATED THAT THE FLOW LINE OF A STATE LEASE WELL WAS CUT FOR A RIG OPERATION  AND A SHEEN BEGAN TO SURFACE FROM THE FLOW LINE. 1 oz of crude oil was released into LAKE GRAND ECAILLE.","link":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3864","id":"a63a4cot1vn2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.795833,29.391667]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/3863","title":"BERRY BROTHERS GENERAL CONTRACTORS INC","published":{"end_time":"2011/06/27 23:31:00 -0400","original":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 03:30:00 GMT","granularity":"min","time":"2011/06/27 23:30:00 -0400"},"description":"NRC report #981015: CALLER INDICATED THAT THE STUFFING BOX PUMP HAD \"STOPPED UP\" AND ALLOWED WATER TO ENTER THE SLOP TANK UNDER THE MAIN ENGINE WHERE OIL WAS PRESENT.
