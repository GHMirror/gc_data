Available at\r\n&lt;http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf&gt;):\r\n\r\n\"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia\r\ntsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval\r\nmites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both\r\nthe vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_\r\n(rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support\r\n_O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are\r\nthus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent\r\nhosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub\r\ntyphus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific\r\nislands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and\r\neastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and\r\nAfghanistan (4,5).\r\n\r\n\"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity\r\nmay be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's\r\nimmune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in\r\nareas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions\r\nlacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops\r\nafter an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an\r\neschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache,\r\n[lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash\r\nmay also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory\r\nsymptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis,\r\nmeningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can\r\ndevelop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6).\r\nEstablishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug\r\ntherapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus\r\npatients are 1-30 per cent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated\r\nwith doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon\r\nsuspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.\"\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n1.

FDA issued a statement saying it has not and does not intend to take \"enforcement action against an individual who purchased and transported raw milk across state lines solely for his or her own personal consumption.\"  The raw milk protesters believe the FDA's statement \"leaves the door open for FDA to pursue farmers, buying clubs and individuals acting as 'distribution agents.' \"The Wisconsin to Chicago Raw Milk Freedom ride will challenge the FDA's use of force against raw milk distribution -- they are pointing out that the mothers transporting the milk will act as 'agents' on behalf of other mothers who cannot make the trip.\"  Raw milk advocates gained some support in Congress last month. Local food champion and small farmer Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-MN) wrote to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg questioning the agency's enforcement actions against raw milk producers who have distributed their dairy products across state lines.  Pingree said she believed the FDA's statement on individuals who purchase and transport is a \"step in the right direction\" but she \"continues to have concerns about some of the practices of the FDA.\"  \"For example, during tight budget times it appears that the Agency has chosen to commit scarce resources to activities like farm raids and what many believe to be overly zealous enforcement of the ban on the interstate sale of raw milk. When consumers increasingly want to know where their food comes from and that it's safe, why does the FDA choose to put so much energy into these enforcement activities aimed at small farmers?\" asked Pingree in the Nov. 18 letter.  \"It also doesn't make sense to me that, given the numerous food safety scares involving large-scale producers, resources are being diverted to prevent consumers from choosing the type of milk that they want to drink,\" she added.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatricians and the FDA deem raw milk a public health risk, pointing to a variety disease-causing pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria that can potentially contaminate raw dairy. According to FDA, between 1987 and 2010 there were 133 outbreaks, 2,659 illnesses, 269 hospitalizations, 3 deaths, 6 stillbirths and 2 miscarriages linked to raw milk and raw milk products.","description":"\r\n\r\n\r\nBCON Identification Number: 612029025\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the coattails of last month's protest at the Food and Drug Administration headquarters in Maryland, more raw milk-supporting moms are planning to defy the federal ban on distributing unpasterized milk across state lines by transporting 100 gallons from Wisconsin to Chicago on Friday.  \"What if Santa and his reindeer fly better with whole, unprocessed milk?,\" asked Kimberly Hartke, a publicist for the group, in a press email Monday. \"Lots of children (and even zoo animals) seem to do better with the farm fresh, white as snow beverage.
