We have learnt about writing as a process. For example , brainstorming,free writing, connecting with ideas and Topic. However,we needto be careful about grammar paragraph structure because we have been learning how to write a paragraph and a topic sentance , supporting ideas, conclusion sentence , linking words, and we aslo should use strong vocabulary to get excellent paragraph. As a result of writing paragraph we can move on to write an essay with introduction and conclusion paragraph to achieve a great essay. All in all, these are variety of methods we have been using to improve writing skills. Secondly, we have learnt various stepsof reading skills. Events of 2009 and 2010 in Irrawaddy magazine were the main issue for us to learn for reading lesson. Therefore, we need to learn basic reading to support our articles reading for instance, we studied pre-reading to guess topics, skim reading is for general ideas, scan reading is to know specific imformation , and comprehension is to understand the paragraph . To sum up, these are the many kinds of methods we have received from English Post-Ten School.Thirdy,we have aslo been learning different types of listening skills . The main lesson for listening is BBc Better Speaking and other News. Moreover, we have leaent how to do note taking. In summary,these are the many listening abilities we have learnt.An additional skill we have learnt from our English teacher is speaking.While we are speaking, we should care about grammer but sometime we do not need to think about that. We should speak quickly and independently . All in all, these are the ways we have done to increase speaking skills.Finally, we have also been learning many methods of critical thinking. Critical thinking is challenging for us . When we think about new topic we should look at a big picture. For example, if we see new vocabulary we need to read the context sentence. As a rescult, we can understand it without looking at dictionary . To sum up these are the many strategies we have received for our critical thinking skills.In conclusion, we have learnt the many kind of skills are very useful because after finished this Post-Ten School, we are going to be teachers thatwhy we have to use all of skills for our students and our goals.","year":2010,"longitude":97.63,"ethnic":"Mon","program":"MNEC post-10","id":"aol6yv8zcjq0","mother organization":"MNEC","location":"Mawlamyine"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[97.63,16.48]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mi Khamoon Htaw","photo":"<img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5518/14452783285_283889a8b9_m.jpg\">","accomplishments":null,"latitude":14.67,"date of birth":"10/9/92","location number":2,"place of birth":"Sangkhlaburi, Thailand","mother tongue":"Mon","religion":"Buddhist","skills":"After I finished Post-10, teaching skills, including lesson planning and teaching methods were very useful when I became a teacher.
