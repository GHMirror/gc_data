It might be under different ownership now. \n\nAnyway, this place is awesome! Wonderful boba. Wonderful food. Cheap prices. Friendly, comfortable atmosphere. You really can\\'t lose here.\n\nI got the red bean soy milk with added red beans and large boba. Best boba drink I\\'ve ever had, hands down! It was blended smooth with ice and sweetened to perfection! The boba were chewy and sweet, just like they should be.\n\nAlso got the almond soy milk with boba... not my favorite. The artificial almond flavor didn\\'t sit well with me.\n\nI got some food while I was there, too. Luckily, there were plenty of vegan options for me. The sea weed salad with bean sprouts in garlic and vinegar sauce: fantastic! And the dry bean curd (slightly stinky tofu) with Chinese parsley (a.k.a. cilantro) and peanut? Ditto! This was authentic, quality Asian food, not deep fried crap catered to American tastes.

The theater is aboard the Delta King river boat in Old Sacramento. The shows are surprisingly inexpensive for the high quality of the performances. (A subscription will let you see three shows for 36 dollars.) I\\'ve seen at least a dozen plays here. Two recent shows, \"First Person Shooter\" and \"The Scene\", blew me away particularly. The \"Playwrights\\' Revolution\" program is awesome and helps emerging playwrights get their work performed.

This venue also frequently hosts concerts, lectures, and other live events since the individual theaters within are very big and can accommodate that sort of thing. \nFilms shown in this place are generally the artsy indie type. I love going to movies here because the ticket prices are actually less expensive than any of the regular corporate theaters nearby. Totally awesome!  \n\nThe Crest Cafe is right next door.

It is just one of many large chrome creatures fashioned from car bumpers by Denver artist Sean Guerrero.\nGuerrero\\'s creations are well favored by local developer Paul Petrovich who thinks that the giant recycled-chrome animal series is \"...so cool. They\\'re so over the top.\"\nThe horse could also be called something of a death steed to the artwork of Kevin Price, whose soulful music-themed mural existed in the same vicinity for just a couple of years before being destroyed when Petrovich obtained the property. This may have been in violation of federal law, as Price was not notified and was given no chance to preserve his work.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6onke67tvdj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.485228,38.567763]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gluten Free Specialty Market","description":"Posted by Carpfish<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2612 J Street, Suite #1 Sacramento CA, 95816This is a really nice, friendly little independent store.

There was also a huge jar of this amazing all-natural artichoke tapenade that we got there for super-cheap. Unfortunately, we haven\\'t seen it since. If we did, I would buy about 10 jars of it.
