It\\'s not all beef, you can have it with just tofu as well. \nInfo from their site:\nSHABU SHABU is a traditional Japanese Cuisine.\nIt is beef fondue.  \"SHABU SHABU\" means\n\"swish-swish\", referring to the swishing action when\nyou cook a very thin slice of beef in the hot water.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gfgh2tqo5v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.078907,37.394147]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spices","description":"Posted by Jax2006291 6TH Ave, san francisco, caSpicy Szechuan food in San Francisco - Ardry and Derek took us there for my birthday weekend.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gfghgp7y9t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.464565,37.783181]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stanford University (1992-1996)","description":"Posted by Jax2006<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/6cf73b6c92e24871b836deab5b215e47.jpg\">Stanford UniversityThis is where I went to college, majored in English with Creative Writing Emphasis, and met various people that I am still friends with today. \nI lived specifically in Cardenal (Florence Moore), Toyon (two years) and Slavianskii Dom.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gfghf2j831"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.171071,37.431985]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sunset and Plane Path, Monroe and Lawrence, Santa Clara","description":"Posted by Jax2006<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/b07c55d25baaa5e465ccffb0d94eb1a3.jpg\">Lawrence Expressway, Santa Clara, CAThis is a picture taken while at the stop light of Monroe/Reed and Lawrence, about to turn right onto Lawrence.
