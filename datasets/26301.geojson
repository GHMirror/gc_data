I have mentioned some great walks in my book \"Impressions of Paradise\". Walking is my favorite way to feel the country, slow down to its pace, and get to those small villages with glimpses of rural Bali. It is usually good to get an early start, as the sun rises fast and it gets hot. I find that when in Bali, I usually wake up at 5:30 a.m.\n\nIt is possible to take a walking tour of all of Bali, using the back roads and trails that many of the villagers have used for centuries. These by-way passages take you out of modern-day life and into the Balinese culture, which is still very much intact. Whether you intend to walk your way through Bali, or just stroll for an hour, I recommend foot power to truly imbibe the spirit of this island.

Immaculately carved demons and mythical beings decorate pillars, door panels, lintels and window shutters with the aim of protecting the buildings from evil intruders. Scenes of legendary figures placed within floral decor set a more pleasant and educational tone.\n\nWhen producing tools and objects for everyday use, sculptors had a much freer hand in choosing subject matter. With the arrival of European influences, wood carving started to develop along more innovative and commercial lines. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ao8wasbp0f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.236968994,-8.67651960986]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bali Yoga Shala","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://isinbali.com\" href=\"http://isinbali.com\">Isinbali</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/05/3/PGD_610.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> BALI YOGA SHALA came into being in 2005 when PATRICIA WIDAYAT returned from 7 years teaching and studying in Australia and joined with WAHYU WIDAYAT (Mas Kelik) in creating this oasis of tranquility in the middle of the frantic beach area.\nPATRICIA and WAHYU\\'s journey with Yoga started many years ago in the 70\\'s and Yoga has been a source of joy and support through life\\'s journey.

He was accompanied by his war commander, Arya Damar and several assistants. In this great war, the King of Bedahulu was defeated.

The south east side of the larger 10×13 km caldera contains a caldera lake. The inner 7.5-kilometer-wide caldera, which was formed during emplacement of the Bali (or Ubud) ignimbrite, has been dated at about 23,670 and 28,500 years ago [1]\n\nThe SE wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Historical eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur in historical time. The caldera contains an active, 700-metre-tall stratovolcano rising above the surface of Lake Batur. The first historically documented eruption of Batur was in 1804, and it has been frequently active since then.\n\nThe caldera is populated and includes the two main villages of Kedisan and Toya Bungkah. The locals largely rely on agriculture for income but tourism has become increasingly popular due to the relatively straightforward trek to the summit of the central crater.

Collections of artwork and the social history of the nation, which the future younger generations can inherit, are preserved in this Museum. The invaluable collections are intrinsically a historical inheritance, which becomes a source of information and educational media. These are all most important for the development and transformation of culture and civilization from one generation to the next. This museum is also intended for artists and people of interest in this area to gather. Here they can exchange experiences and ideas on their respective fields of interest. The Collection was established through the purchase by Nyoman Rudana and Ni Wayan Olastini, who have exhibited tremendous dedication in their twenty-one years of work promoting Indonesian, especially Balinese, arts and artists.The three floors of the Museum represent Balinese architectural philosophical concept of the Tri Angga, namely, the three parts of the human body: head, trunk, and legs. This concept, in the development of plastic art, represents the golden link of artists of the past and the present. The third floor of the Museum houses works of Balinese fine arts from classical to the Ubud and Batuan styles. Among the works in this collection are such outstanding names as I Gusti Nyoman Lempad and Ida Bagus Made.On the second and first floors, works of modern Indonesian fine arts are displayed, covering such widely-known names as: Affandi, Gunarsa, Wianta, and also the works of young and talented artists, such as Boyke Aditya, Nyoman Erawan, and Made Budhiana. The Museum also has a great collection from renowned expatriates such as Antonio Blanco who have made Bali their physical and artistic home.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ao8wi1u2vv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.268447399,-8.52084370819]}},{"properties":{"name":"Musro Bali","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://isinbali.com\" href=\"http://isinbali.com\">Isinbali</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/05/3/1222.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> For years, Musro Bali has been popular place in Bali, located in the heart of Kuta, open 7 days a week featuring varieties of entertainment from Cabaret, Line Up, DJ\\'s, Live band, Disco and many special theme parties.\n\nWe also provide many KTV for you to relax and sing along with charming hostesses in private room and dont forget about the capacious venue for private parties.

The cape was fully covered by stone and wild bush and watching at the distance where the open sea extended, suddenly He saw a traditional canoe (\"perahu\") washed ashore. He then hurried to help and soon the \"perahu-man\" got conscious and extended their gratefulness for the magic help of the Holy priest.\n\nSince the sea was calm, it was the best time to sail according to Danghyang Nirartha, so they then set sail to Lombok.\n\nSoon, after the Holy High priest left the beach there were some miracles taking-place at that location. The stones, on which He stood on before, flamed up and some springs suddenly came up around the site, so that the locals then came in through to do mass prayer.\n\nFinally, a temple was then built on the site with the main shrine called \"Sanggar Agung\" and the whole temple functioned as \"Kahyangan\" temple with regional adherents.\\'\n\nThe temple was later called \"Ponjok Batu Temple\". <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ao8w4sqz99"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.272223949,-8.09351881122]}},{"properties":{"name":"Prosurf School","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://isinbali.com\" href=\"http://isinbali.com\">Isinbali</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/05/4/1_6_.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Learn to surf with the top surf school in Bali - voted \"Best Surf School in Bali\" for 3 consecutive years by Magic Wave Surf Community Magazine.

During his travels along the south coast he saw the rock-island\\'s beautiful setting and rested there. Some fishermen saw him, and bought him gifts. Nirartha then spent the night on the little island. Later he spoke to the fishermen and told them to build a shrine on the rock for he felt it to be a holy place to worship the Balinese sea gods.\n\nThe Tanah Lot temple was built and has been a part of Balinese mythology for centuries. The temple is one of seven sea temples around the Balinese coast. Each of the sea temples were established within eyesight of the next to form a chain along the south-western coast.\n\nAt the base of the rocky island, poisonous sea snakes are believed to guard the temple from evil spirits and intruders.

Children learn their skills sitting at their parents\\' knee, absorbing the techniques while watching painters as they paint, listening to musicians as they play. Artistic expression becomes part of life.For over 20 years Uluwatu has drawn upon these natural skills to produce lace of a unique quality.This lace work, known in English as cutwork, is called krawang in Balinese. Uluwatu krawang is made in the traditional way: Lace is stretched on bamboo hoops and sewn by hand on foot-powered machines identical to the old Singer machines now seen only as antiques in the rest of the world.\n\nJl.
