They formed the foundation for the most successful and powerful ship to shore and land station on the Pacific Rim.\"\n\nNow I visited this site in the early 90\\'s. Beautiful area, Point Reyes; I highly recommend a visit. However, there is a story here. Isn\\'t there always?\n\nFirst of all, understand that when you are out on Point Reyes, you get the distinct feeling that you are completely removed from the modern world. You are geographically isolated from society. It was also rumored at the time that there was an abandoned mental asylum somewhere nearby and the way the lonely wind cries in your ears out there makes you want to believe it. It\\'s vaguely unsettling.\n\nThe day I stopped in at the old Marconi site for a visit was overcast and a bit windy, as usual. The mood was already set, so it is no suprise that, after the fact, I felt as if I had just walked through some kind of creepy Bugs Bunny cartoon gone bad. Upon knocking, the heavy wooden door creaked open at the hand of this tiny older gentleman who looked like a miniature cross between an Lon Chaney and Hannibal Lechter, but with a smile. And a Bow tie. Behind him in the shadows was his exotic, towering assistant, obviously imported from Northern Africa somewhere. The two figures together were reminiscent of an old black an white movie featuring a mad scientist and his mute, hulking assistant. The words, \"Won\\'t you please come in?\" will haunt my ears forever. Although I\\'m sure that both of these men were just as normal as you or I, it was just wierd.\n\nAdd to this the ancient and gigantic electrical components scattered around and throughout the massive decaying structure, like the remnants of a Frankenstein experiment from ages past, and you\\'ll understand why this location sticks in my mind. I was just waiting for a bolt of lightning to strike and bring everything to horrible life. It was the perfect setting for a Hitchcock film starring Anthony Hopkins.\n\nAll in all, a very interesting place to visit, if you don\\'t mind the vague unsettling feeling that you may end up as someones dinner.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6i3wo3by90l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.724752,37.914138]}},{"properties":{"name":"Teller, AK - Here there be Mookies....","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.concentriconline.com\" href=\"http://www.concentriconline.com\">Jasonbackus</a><img src=\"http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdmg21/image/2808.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.baiki.org/images/exhibit/pix_tellerstat.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.senstad.com/htmls/eskimo5.jpg\">teller, akWhile serving ar Port Clarence, I volunteered to fly over to Teller and teach the students (all 100 of them) about US Military history.
