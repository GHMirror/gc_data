You will attend because you are interested in leadership. You are a leader – or you aspire to lead! In everything you do at this conference we ask you to do it “wearing a leader’s hat”.\n\nThe focus is on digital technology, and importantly, from “a leadership perspective”.\nThe conference will give you one of your best chances of reflecting on and making sense of the possibilities on offer using digital technology in your school, for your students. \nNot all students will reap the benefits of what is possible in this digital age. If you get it right what a tremendous thing you have done for your students.\nWe are teaching a digital generation. The three critical areas of learning, teaching and leadership have changed for this generation. We must embrace this or run the risk of failing our students.\n\nIs student learning being adequately supported with digital technology?\nIs teaching being supported adequately with digital technology?\nIs leadership enabled by digital technology?\nThese are serious questions and serious challenges! You will get the opportunity to reflect on these things over the three days of the conference.","date":"13/09/2012","presenter first and last name":"","geo_score":0.0,"link to resources":"","address of event (united states)":"","id":"a9bpejie0gqs","address of event (not-united states)":"7 Staghorn Avenue, Surfers Paradise, QLD, 4217","event tags":"leadership, google, education","sponsoring company":"IWBNet","geo_precision":""},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"link to conference website":"sxswedu.com","title of professional development event":"SXSW","timestamp":{"end_time":"2012/09/14 22:12:46 -0400","original":"9/14/2012 22:12:45","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/09/14 22:12:45 -0400"},"type of event":"Conference","description of event":"This is the ultimate Edu Event!","date":{"end_time":"2013/03/21 00:00:00 -0400","original":"3/20/2013","granularity":"day","time":"2013/03/20 00:00:00 -0400"},"presenter first and last name":"Dan Rezac","geo_score":0.0,"link to resources":null,"address of event (united states)":"Phoenix, AZ","id":"a9bpejqu4q0t","address of event (not-united states)":null,"event tags":"policy, creativity","sponsoring company":"EdReach.us","geo_precision":""},"type":"Feature","geometry":null}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"conferences,education,pd","published":"2012-09-02T16:00:00Z","id":272067}
