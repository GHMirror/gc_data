The bar serves up clever drinks like the Prell, made with Midori, pineapple and vodka, and the Platinum Blonde, which has vodka, Malibu rum and pineapple. The vintage blow-dryers are great to sit under while gossiping over cosmos in the early evening.

The \"Twin Peaks\" feeling carries over to the drink menu, which includes selections like the minty Girl Scout cookie, the flaming toasted marshmallow and the mighty Sasquatch (served in a very tall glass, of course).
