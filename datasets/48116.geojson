Some examples are The Temptation of Christ, Scenes From the Life of Moses, and The Last Judgment.  The Sistine Chapel is probably most famous for it\\'s ceiling painting by Michelangelo Buonarroti.  The ceiling originally had gold stars, but Michelangelo painted more than 300 biblical characters and symbols on the ceiling.  It took him four years to complete the task.
