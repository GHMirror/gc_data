There are three components to the project. The first component is the strengthening public financial management and public service management at central government level, including establishing a functioning system of intergovernmental fiscal relations. The second component is the building public sector and financial management systems at provincial level. This component provides effective and transparent public financial management and public service management capacity at provincial level (including the provision of equipment, etc.) is recognized as one of the most urgent elements of the governance agenda in the DRC. This will pose serious challenges. Apart from addressing weak existing capacities in the 11 provinces, additional efforts will be required to build new public management systems in the new provinces that will be created in the next stage of territorial-administrative reform. It is therefore proposed for this component to absorb a significant portion of the resources allocated to the project. Finally, the third component is the Governance reform implementation capacity.

There are three components to the project. The first component is the strengthening public financial management and public service management at central government level, including establishing a functioning system of intergovernmental fiscal relations. The second component is the building public sector and financial management systems at provincial level. This component provides effective and transparent public financial management and public service management capacity at provincial level (including the provision of equipment, etc.) is recognized as one of the most urgent elements of the governance agenda in the DRC. This will pose serious challenges. Apart from addressing weak existing capacities in the 11 provinces, additional efforts will be required to build new public management systems in the new provinces that will be created in the next stage of territorial-administrative reform.

the Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project. This additional grant will help finance the costs of the originally envisaged program, which the project is supporting. No changes to the objectives or general design and implementation modalities of the project are proposed. A portion pf this financing will be used to implement activities in provinces that are now accessible, as a result of successful efforts to establish and maintain peace.

The Grant is designed to support key policy measures aiming at: (1) in creasing the impact on the poor o f public spending in key priority areas, education and health; (2) strengthening public expenditure and civil service management; and (3) improving governance in forestry and mining sectors. The project addresses poverty reduction in two important ways at a critical time in the country's transition from post-conflict phase to peaceful elections. First, the Grant directly contributes to maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework conducive to economic growth by helping to bridge the financing gap associated with implementing the Government's Economic Program. Second, reforms which the Grant is designed to support will have positive impacts on poverty reduction. Improved efficiency and transparency in public expenditure management will ensure that the Government's budget priorities are increasingly in line with the priorities defined in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and result in actual releases of resources to public service providers. In particular, better budget execution of health and education ministries will help improve access by the poor to public services provided by these ministries, by reducing user fees which are currently collected. Strengthening civil service management will help restore motivations for civil servants to provide quality public service on which the poor depends. Finally, improving governance in two of the key productive sectors, forestry and mining, will help the population share the country's natural resources in a more equitable manner and enhance sustainability of policies governing the sectors.","first10":null,"crs_rio_marker":null,"long1":15.315,"repaynum":null,"data_source_id":1545,"second10":null,"first11":null,"desert":null,"long2":null,"second1":null,"usd_localcost":null,"precision10":null,"second11":null,"plaid_sn":null,"plaid_ta":0,"disbursement_amt_current_usd":null,"long3":null,"second2":null,"interest":null,"precision11":null,"repayd1":null,"long4":null,"second3":null,"finag":null,"repayd2":null,"long5":null,"donor_id":41,"borrower":5854,"disb":null,"contactr":"Bank

The specific objectives of the program will be a) to demobilize up to an estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and to help support their return into civilian life b) to promote the reallocation of Government expenditure from military to social and economic sectors. The project is expected to have a significant impact o n reducing poverty in the DRC by: establishing more secure conditions in the rural areas that will encourage the general population and internally displaced persons to resume productive lives in the rural economy; freeing up additional national resources for investment in social and economic sectors; and investing in the human capital of ex-combatants. The project consists of the following activities: (i) Sensitization; (ii) Orientation/ demobilization; (iii) Transition; (iv) Reinsertion; (v) Special groups; and (vi) Institutional development and Program implementation support. The following demobilization activities are envisaged: (i) the establishment of orientation centers; (ii) verification of ex-combatant status; (iii) provision of identity cards; (iv) collection of socio-economic data; (v) pre-demobilization orientation about civilian life and program benefits; and (vi) medical screening (including HIV/AIDS counseling and voluntary testing). Demobilization activities will be guided by the Joint Operations Plan, which coordinates the military restructuring with the demobilization process.

The BNK would provide the following assistance to facilitate the initial transition to civilian life of ex-combatants: (i) transport and food allowance, most probably in the form of a $30 cash grant; (ii) basic household items kit. A transitional subsistence allowance will be provided in cash in installments.  Reintegration assistance will be provided to help ex-combatants re-introduce themselves into their communities and establish sustainable livelihoods.

The specific objectives of the program will be a) to demobilize up to an estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and to help support their return into civilian life b) to promote the reallocation of Government expenditure from military to social and economic sectors. The project is expected to have a significant impact o n reducing poverty in the DRC by: establishing more secure conditions in the rural areas that will encourage the general population and internally displaced persons to resume productive lives in the rural economy; freeing up additional national resources for investment in social and economic sectors; and investing in the human capital of ex-combatants. The project consists of the following activities: (i) Sensitization; (ii) Orientation/ demobilization; (iii) Transition; (iv) Reinsertion; (v) Special groups; and (vi) Institutional development and Program implementation support. The following demobilization activities are envisaged: (i) the establishment of orientation centers; (ii) verification of ex-combatant status; (iii) provision of identity cards; (iv) collection of socio-economic data; (v) pre-demobilization orientation about civilian life and program benefits; and (vi) medical screening (including HIV/AIDS counseling and voluntary testing).

The project has the following four components: Component 1) the project will assist and support the mobilization of public institutions in the fight against this epidemic by mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities in their regular work program. Activities by public sector institutions on behalf of their staff and families, as well as their clients will be financed on a competitive basis. Component 2) The project will support HIV/AIDS activities proposed by the HIV/AIDS Inter-Enterprise Committee (CIELS). CIELS is an umbrella organization for private sector entities and public enterprises and will serve as an interface and coordinate the preparation and submission of proposals by member enterprises at the national, provincial, and local levels. Non-governmental and faith-based organizations will be mobilized and supported to help implement the national strategic plan supported by this project. Component 3) A 'community' will be understood as any human group mobilized around a common interest. A community may be a village, a neighborhood, a school or any local association. The component's objective is to increase the impact of HIV/AIDS activities by transferring the responsibility for identifying priorities, and preparing and implementing micro-projects directly to the beneficiaries in rural and urban areas. Component 4) The National Coordination Unit (NCU) will be responsible for coordinating the overall implementation of the program.

The Credit will support policies that stabilize the economy and pave the way to environmentally and socially sustainable growth and poverty reduction through a number of interventions. The primary risks-and associated mitigating measures-are (i) renewed internal and or regional conflict, which is reduced by UN intervention and by a Bank-led multinational regional demobilization and reintegration program; (ii) the DRC's accruing new arrears on external debt because of the increased debt service burden in the short run, even though the overall debt burden in net present value terms has been reduced greatly; (iii) the DRC losing international financial support, with consequences in the country's ability to service debt as well as in financing necessary spending on social and economic rehabilitation, which is mitigated by the International Development Association (IDA's) working with other donors to assure a continued high level of donor financing and providing guidance for the measures, including the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process, that will make permanent the debt service reduction that followed the HIPC Decision Point;

for Democratic Republic of Congo is to: (i) assist the Borrower in its efforts to economically and socially reunify the Eastern provinces to the rest of the country; and (ii) increase access to and use by the local population of basic infrastructure and social services in the provinces of Orientale, Maniema, Nord Kivu, Sud Kivu, Nord Equateur, Nord Katanga, Nord Kasai Oriental. As revised, this PDO is in line with the government strategy of creating an environment for an economic and social reunification of the country. The project changes will concern: 1) reformulating the PDO. The original PDO was too general and it was difficult to directly correlate project results and its objectives; 2) adapting a new results framework to the new changed PDO in order to better capture achievements on the ground. In the revised results framework, particular focus is given to providing a baseline and targeted value for each outcome. This aspect was not taken into account in the original results framework where baselines and targets were not clearly established and where most of the indicators measured outputs; and 3) Cancelling the forest concessions sub-component. The Government and the Bank have agreed to cancel the forest zoning sub-component and instead provide support to the Ministry of Environment in the forestry reforms. The original activities involved a complex set of issues that would be better addressed in a comprehensive way and not through an emergency operation which cannot allocate the resources needed. Based on the above, the government and the Bank have concluded that this sub-component fits better in a specific operation and should be considered under the forest project under preparation. The restructuring measures are to: (i) reduce the scope of works on the RN2 (Bukavu-Mbuji-Mayi) road; (ii) cancel the forest zoning sub-component; (iii) reformulate the PDO and the results framework; (iv) reallocate the Project Grant proceeds; and (v) extend the project closing date from September 30,2008, to September 30, 2010.","first10":null,"crs_rio_marker":null,"long1":27.0,"repaynum":null,"data_source_id":2439,"second10":null,"first11":null,"desert":null,"long2":null,"second1":null,"usd_localcost":null,"precision10":null,"second11":null,"plaid_sn":null,"plaid_ta":0,"disbursement_amt_current_usd":null,"long3":null,"second2":null,"interest":null,"precision11":null,"repayd1":null,"long4":null,"second3":null,"finag":null,"repayd2":null,"long5":null,"donor_id":41,"borrower":11302,"disb":null,"contactr":"Bank Team Lead","pdgg":null,"othero":null,"long6":null,"second4":null,"grace":null,"long7":null,"usdco":200276087,"second5":null,"rname":"CONGO, DEMOCRACTIC REPBULIC OF","comtorig":214000000,"region_code":null,"title":"Emergency Economic and Social Reunification Suport Project","crs_channel_of_delivery_code":null,"long8":null,"second6":null,"srcd":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P081850","plaid_sn2":"Multisector aid","flowc":null,"src":"World Bank","long9":null,"precision1":4,"second7":null,"contact":"Diop, Mahine"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"crspcode":31220,"cofinancer_amount":null,"second8":null,"precision2":null,"usdcr":null,"sector_code":null,"second9":null,"precision3":null,"precision4":null,"policy_objective":null,"first1":"Kinshasa","gender":null,"location":null,"cofinancer_currency":null,"type_of_aid":null,"precision5":null,"first2":null,"precision6":null,"first3":null,"precision7":null,"first4":null,"status":null,"id":837201,"precision8":null,"grant":null,"first5":null,"eia":null,"precision9":null,"first6":null,"lat10":null,"oecd_id":null,"disbcr":null,"plaid_ac":"15150.02|16010.05|31210.01|31210.02|31210.03|31220.01|31220.02|31220.03|41030.01|41030.02","first7":null,"lat11":null,"long10":null,"invest":null,"plaid_ad":"Community participation and development|Support for vulnerable groups|Forestry policy and administrative management, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in group|Forestry sector policy, planning and programs|Institution capacity building, Forestry|Forestry development, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in group|Afforestation |Exploitation and utilization|Bio-diversity, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in group|Natural reserves","first8":null,"titleo":null,"long11":null,"desco":null,"freetc":null,"first9":null,"endd":null,"climate":null,"shortd":null,"line2":null,"loctext":"6 and 8","env_impact":null,"startd":null,"line3":null,"climate_code":null,"transaction":null,"sector_programme":null,"plaid_ac2":31220,"dprojid":"P100620","tcost":79000000,"comdat":null,"plaid_fs":1,"techcoop_amount":null,"srctyp":"Website","usdut":null,"usd_amount_tied":null,"line4":null,"sector":null,"crs_channel_of_delivery_name":null,"line5":null,"nature_of_submission":null,"original_title":null,"lat1":0.0,"line6":null,"numbloc":2,"lat2":null,"disbursement_constant":null,"crspname":null,"line7":null,"flowt":null,"repaytyp":null,"lat3":null,"plaid_sc":null,"line8":null,"ben":null,"repayment_amount":null,"lat4":null,"line9":null,"lat5":null,"year":null,"lat6":null,"biodiversity_code":null,"financing_agency_id":null,"tcosttyp":"USD","usdcopercoord":32000000.0,"lat7":null,"line10":null,"usdpt":null,"total_donor_commitments":null,"env_type":null,"lat8":null,"biodev":null,"impag":"THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT","implementing_agency_id":11015,"lat9":null,"usd_techcoop":null,"recipient_id":554,"cancelled":null,"additional_information":null,"origtyp":"USD","dname":"WORLD BANK IDA","cofinancers":null,"disbursement_amt_constant_usd":null,"beneficiary_id":null,"desc":"3. Preliminary description \\n\\n10. Components.The project would include 4 components aimed at helping implement reforms in key areas of governance, poverty reduction, and environmental protection. These components would combine institutional strengthening, technical assistance, and support to local initiatives. Given the resources available and the limited capacities, the project design will have to be selective and to focus on critical functions and reforms. The likely sub-components and areas of intervention of the project are listed below: \\n\\nComponent 1 - Sustainable Forest Management  ·Enforcement of forest management plans ·Tax collection enhancement ·Third-party forest monitoring, log tracking system Component 2 - Local Livelihoods and Community Development  ·Monitoring of poverty-oriented sector reforms (cahier des charges, sharing of revenues) ·Support to community forests and community reserves ·Support for indigenous peoples' equal access to innovations of the code ·Support to small scale family (timber/non-timber based) enterprises ·Fuel-wood management in savannas and highlands Component 3 - Biodiversity and Environmental Services ·Promotion of environmental services and innovative forest uses ·Biodiversity conservation, management of protected areas ·Monitoring of the program's socio-environmental management plan Component 4 - Transversal Supports ·Participatory multi-purpose land use planning/Local consultations ·Outreach, dissemination of the forest code, and consultations on decrees ·Administrative and financial management, planning and monitoring-evaluation ·Rehabilitation of forest/ICCN field offices and teams in selected areas \\n\\n11. The project would help implement the recommendations of a Forest Sector Review finalized in co-authorship with research centers and national and international NGOs. It would also help implement the conclusions of two international forest forums held in Kinshasa in 2004 and 2006. These exercises helped gradually build a consensus around the sector strategy and the reform agenda. \\n\\n12. The proposed operation would support a national, multi-donor, sector-wide program, and be articulated with other donors' interventions. A draft Forest and Nature Conservation Sector Program (PNFoCo) was prepared by the Ministry of Environment and the ICCN in 2003. This framework document would be finalized in a participatory manner so as to provide a strategic framework for all interventions in the sector. \\n\\n13. The proposed operation would constitute the central piece of a package of Bank assistance to the sector, which includes a Forest sector review completed in partnership with research centers and national and international NGOs, support to governance reforms through the Transitional Support for Economic Recovery (TSERO), a GEF grant for national parks ($7 million), and a possible Bio-Carbon Purchase Agreement for a carbon sink/afforestation program ($4 million). It would also complement a Bank-administered multi-donor trust fund for forest governance. \\n\\n14. If the project is successful, it will: \\n\\n·enable the Ministry of Environment/Institute for Nature Conservation to fulfill their core-regulatory functions in the field. The problem that the project is expected to solve is that these technical institutions do not have capacity to implement their new policies in the field. If the project is successful, these institutions will be controlling logging operations and enforcing sustainable management plans, rehabilitating national parks, conducting participatory processes; and running basic administrative functions (financial management, annual planning and monitoring-evaluation). \\n\\n·enable local communities to engage in the decision-making, management, and benefit-sharing mechanisms created by the new forest code. The problem that the project is expected to solve is that local communities do not have adequate instruments and capacities to claim their rights and their benefits, and to participate in forest management. If the project is successful, local communities will be participating in forest land use planning, developing community forests, and benefiting from social responsibility contracts and retrocession of revenues. Local communities include Indigenous People for whom an additional challenge is to ensure equal access to the benefits of the reforms, and to avoid marginalization.  \\n\\n·enable civil society to engage in dialogue with the government and in partnerships with the public institutions, especially for the monitoring of the new code in the field. The problem that the project is expected to solve is that adequate instruments and frameworks for civil society involvement do not exist, or exist on an informal and ad-hoc basis, and there is limited accountability. If the project is successful, local civil society organizations will be conducting awareness-raising campaigns, monitoring illegal logging, and monitoring the use of forest revenues at local level and social responsibility contracts. \\n\\n15. The project will be implemented throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project will not be able to cover the entire country with the same intensity. While some activities are nationwide by nature, others will focus on selected/pilot areas. These regions will be determined during project preparation or through the annual planning process during project implementation. \\n\\n16. The project would be implemented through the Ministry of Environment and ICCN, with the view to promote ownership by the technical institutions, and with an emphasis on enhancing their own administrative and financial management capacity. As much as possible, planning, administration, and monitoring-evaluation would follow and improve the country systems. \\n\\n17. Institutional support will be a key dimension of the project. However, the way this support is delivered will have to take into account the overall collapse of institutions in the country. Also, the current level of salary and incentive framework for civil servants is discouraging and hardly compatible with good management of forests as a public asset. The project will coordinate with other reconstruction strategies and other sector projects to address these issues.

Preliminary description \\n\\n10. Components.The project would include 4 components aimed at helping implement reforms in key areas of governance, poverty reduction, and environmental protection. These components would combine institutional strengthening, technical assistance, and support to local initiatives. Given the resources available and the limited capacities, the project design will have to be selective and to focus on critical functions and reforms. The likely sub-components and areas of intervention of the project are listed below: \\n\\nComponent 1 - Sustainable Forest Management  ·Enforcement of forest management plans ·Tax collection enhancement ·Third-party forest monitoring, log tracking system Component 2 - Local Livelihoods and Community Development  ·Monitoring of poverty-oriented sector reforms (cahier des charges, sharing of revenues) ·Support to community forests and community reserves ·Support for indigenous peoples' equal access to innovations of the code ·Support to small scale family (timber/non-timber based) enterprises ·Fuel-wood management in savannas and highlands Component 3 - Biodiversity and Environmental Services ·Promotion of environmental services and innovative forest uses ·Biodiversity conservation, management of protected areas ·Monitoring of the program's socio-environmental management plan Component 4 - Transversal Supports ·Participatory multi-purpose land use planning/Local consultations ·Outreach, dissemination of the forest code, and consultations on decrees ·Administrative and financial management, planning and monitoring-evaluation ·Rehabilitation of forest/ICCN field offices and teams in selected areas \\n\\n11. The project would help implement the recommendations of a Forest Sector Review finalized in co-authorship with research centers and national and international NGOs. It would also help implement the conclusions of two international forest forums held in Kinshasa in 2004 and 2006. These exercises helped gradually build a consensus around the sector strategy and the reform agenda. \\n\\n12. The proposed operation would support a national, multi-donor, sector-wide program, and be articulated with other donors' interventions. A draft Forest and Nature Conservation Sector Program (PNFoCo) was prepared by the Ministry of Environment and the ICCN in 2003. This framework document would be finalized in a participatory manner so as to provide a strategic framework for all interventions in the sector. \\n\\n13. The proposed operation would constitute the central piece of a package of Bank assistance to the sector, which includes a Forest sector review completed in partnership with research centers and national and international NGOs, support to governance reforms through the Transitional Support for Economic Recovery (TSERO), a GEF grant for national parks ($7 million), and a possible Bio-Carbon Purchase Agreement for a carbon sink/afforestation program ($4 million). It would also complement a Bank-administered multi-donor trust fund for forest governance. \\n\\n14. If the project is successful, it will: \\n\\n·enable the Ministry of Environment/Institute for Nature Conservation to fulfill their core-regulatory functions in the field. The problem that the project is expected to solve is that these technical institutions do not have capacity to implement their new policies in the field. If the project is successful, these institutions will be controlling logging operations and enforcing sustainable management plans, rehabilitating national parks, conducting participatory processes; and running basic administrative functions (financial management, annual planning and monitoring-evaluation). \\n\\n·enable local communities to engage in the decision-making, management, and benefit-sharing mechanisms created by the new forest code. The problem that the project is expected to solve is that local communities do not have adequate instruments and capacities to claim their rights and their benefits, and to participate in forest management. If the project is successful, local communities will be participating in forest land use planning, developing community forests, and benefiting from social responsibility contracts and retrocession of revenues. Local communities include Indigenous People for whom an additional challenge is to ensure equal access to the benefits of the reforms, and to avoid marginalization.  \\n\\n·enable civil society to engage in dialogue with the government and in partnerships with the public institutions, especially for the monitoring of the new code in the field. The problem that the project is expected to solve is that adequate instruments and frameworks for civil society involvement do not exist, or exist on an informal and ad-hoc basis, and there is limited accountability. If the project is successful, local civil society organizations will be conducting awareness-raising campaigns, monitoring illegal logging, and monitoring the use of forest revenues at local level and social responsibility contracts. \\n\\n15. The project will be implemented throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project will not be able to cover the entire country with the same intensity. While some activities are nationwide by nature, others will focus on selected/pilot areas. These regions will be determined during project preparation or through the annual planning process during project implementation. \\n\\n16. The project would be implemented through the Ministry of Environment and ICCN, with the view to promote ownership by the technical institutions, and with an emphasis on enhancing their own administrative and financial management capacity. As much as possible, planning, administration, and monitoring-evaluation would follow and improve the country systems. \\n\\n17. Institutional support will be a key dimension of the project. However, the way this support is delivered will have to take into account the overall collapse of institutions in the country. Also, the current level of salary and incentive framework for civil servants is discouraging and hardly compatible with good management of forests as a public asset. The project will coordinate with other reconstruction strategies and other sector projects to address these issues.

As revised, this PDO is in line with the government strategy of creating an environment for an economic and social reunification of the country. The project changes will concern: 1) reformulating the PDO. The original PDO was too general and it was difficult to directly correlate project results and its objectives; 2) adapting a new results framework to the new changed PDO in order to better capture achievements on the ground. In the revised results framework, particular focus is given to providing a baseline and targeted value for each outcome. This aspect was not taken into account in the original results framework where baselines and targets were not clearly established and where most of the indicators measured outputs; and 3) Cancelling the forest concessions sub-component. The Government and the Bank have agreed to cancel the forest zoning sub-component and instead provide support to the Ministry of Environment in the forestry reforms.

As revised, this PDO is in line with the government strategy of creating an environment for an economic and social reunification of the country. The project changes will concern: 1) reformulating the PDO. The original PDO was too general and it was difficult to directly correlate project results and its objectives; 2) adapting a new results framework to the new changed PDO in order to better capture achievements on the ground. In the revised results framework, particular focus is given to providing a baseline and targeted value for each outcome. This aspect was not taken into account in the original results framework where baselines and targets were not clearly established and where most of the indicators measured outputs; and 3) Cancelling the forest concessions sub-component. The Government and the Bank have agreed to cancel the forest zoning sub-component and instead provide support to the Ministry of Environment in the forestry reforms. The original activities involved a complex set of issues that would be better addressed in a comprehensive way and not through an emergency operation which cannot allocate the resources needed.
