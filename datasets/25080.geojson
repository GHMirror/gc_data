Acid House Kings was started by the teenagers Joakim Ödlund {also in Poprace, Starlet and Doubledan}, brothers Niklas {also in Red Sleeping Beauty} and Johan Angergård {also in Club 8, Poprace and The Legends}\nback in 1991 inspired by the English anorak scene {most bands on labels like Sarah, Subway and Heaven would be considered as favorites at this time}. The band recorded their first songs and sent them only to one label, the German pop label Marsh-Marigold. A few months later their debut single »Play pop! EP« was released.\n\nIn 1992, Acid House Kings set up a 10 year plan: a trilogy of albums with one album released exactly every 5th year. Each album was to be filled with catchy guitar pop songs but with new themes and a growing maturity from album to album. The first album in trilogy was the twee »Pop, look &amp; listen«\nreleased on Marsh-Marigold in 1992. The album was followed by the 6-track ep »Monaco G.P.« and a European tour in 1994.\n\nWith the 2nd part of Acid House Kings album trilogy the band wanted to create catchy quality pop {a bit like The Smiths for summer days instead of lonely autumn nights looked up in your room}. That album was »Advantage Acid House Kings«.\nThe band changed labels for this album to Shelflife in the US and Harmony in Japan. On this album the singer Julia Lannerheim was introduced in the band as a guest singer on a couple of songs. The album was released in rather small quantities and sold out quickly. It\\'s now been re-released by Labrador Records.\n\nIn 2001 Acid House Kings built a studio of their own,\nSummersound Studios, in order to make a perfectly\nsophisticated pop production for the 3rd installment in the trilogy. Joakim was unable to make it to the recording studio because of the fact that he was living too far from it. But on the other hand Julia became a full-time member of the band.\n\nThe year was a creative burst for the Kings. The result was »Mondays are like Tuesdays and Tuesdays are like Wednesdays«. It\\'s an easy, breezy, beautiful album with more lasting qualities than any of the other albums in the trilogy. It was released in 2002 on Parasol (US), Quince (Japan), Magnum (South East Asia) and Labrador (Europe).\n\nALL MUSIC described ‘Mondays...« as “…yet more proof of the emerging, Swedish indie pop scene. “ and gave it Rolling Stone praised it as regal and “full of sugary, yet bittersweet hooks”.\n\nSpurred by the wide acclaim for »Mondays... « Acid House Kings immediately begun working on the plan for the second 10 year period and on what was to become »Sing along with Acid House Kings”. The new album also saw the return of founding member Joakim Ödlund on guitar.\n\nCombining the aesthetics of Kraftwerk with Motown girl groups from the 60’s and musical influences from Burt Bucharach to The Smiths, Acid House Kings have created a classic album of timeless pop perfection. True to their Swedish origin, the Kings cannot hide a certain debt to the stylish arrangements and crystal clear melodies of ABBA.\n\nThough the »Mondays...« album sounds just as great today as when it was first heard, there’s no doubt the new album is a big step forward. The vocal duties are charmingly shared between the two singers, Niklas and Julia, the melodies direct and timeless and the arrangements multifaceted and rich in\ndetail.\n\n»Sing along with Acid House Kings« is not only a proof of the emerging Swedish pop scene, it’s the cream of the lot. And yes, you can sing along. They’ll even include a free karaoke DVD with the album {the very first in musical history} to help you do so. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3ni8pd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[17.637777,62.199734]}},{"properties":{"name":"Adele's Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/Copy_(2)_of_photo1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/break_adele.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 111 Avenida Palizada, San Clemente, CA\\'50s-style café in historic Old City Plaza with patio tables set around a beautiful Spanish fountain.

Their sound, a variant of the classic disco sound coaxed into a relaxing Prozac vision of the late \\'70s, looked back to a variety of phenomena from the period -- synthesizer maestros Tomita, Jean-Michel Jarre, and Vangelis, new wave music of the nonspiky variety, and obscure Italian film soundtracks. Despite gaining quick entrance into the dance community (through releases for Source and Mo\\' Wax), Air\\'s 1998 debut album, Moon Safari, charted a light -- well, airy -- course along soundscapes composed with melody lines by Moog and Rhodes, not Roland and Yamaha. The presence of several female vocalists, an equipment list whose number of pieces stretched into the dozens, and a baroque tuba solo on one track -- all of this conspired to make Air more of a happening in the living room than the dancefloor.\n\nThough Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel both grew up in Versailles, the two didn\\'t meet until they began studying at the same college. Dunckel, who had studied at the Conservatoire in Paris, played in an alternative band named Orange. One of Dunckel\\'s bandmates, Alex Gopher, introduced Godin into the lineup. While Gopher himself departed (later to record for the Solid label), Dunckel and Godin continued on, becoming Air by 1995. During 1996-1997, the duo released singles on Britain\\'s Mo\\' Wax (\"Modular\") and the domestic Source label (\"Casanova 70,\" \"Le Soleil Est Prés de Moi\"). Though Air often evinced the same \\'60s Continental charm as Dimitri From Paris -- due no doubt to the influence of Serge Gainsbourg -- the duo had little in common musically with other acts (Daft Punk) in the wave of French electronica lapping at the shores of Britain and America during 1997. That same year, Air remixed Depeche Mode and Neneh Cherry and joined French musique concrète popster Jean-Jacques Perrey for a track on the Source compilation Sourcelab, Vol. 3. Signed to Virgin, Air released their debut album, Moon Safari, in early 1998. The singles \"Sexy Boy\" and \"Kelly Watch the Stars\" became moderate hits in Britain and earned airplay on MTV. Later that year, Godin and Dunckel mounted an ambitious tour throughout Europe and America, though they had originally decided to forego live appearances. Their early singles were collected in 1999 under the title Premiers Symptomes; the duo\\'s soundtrack to the Sofia Coppola film The Virgin Suicides followed in early 2000. Air\\'s second studio effort, 10,000 Hz Legend, appeared in spring 2001 with a subsequent tour of the U.S., but critics and fans alike didn\\'t appreciate the darker, more experimental direction. They bridged the gap between the pop of Moon Safari and the experimentalism of 10,000 Hz Legend with their 2004 release Talkie Walkie.\n\n-allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiy0euqc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.213749,46.227638]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aki Nursery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 6900 Alton Parkway, Irvine, CABoxed trees, shrubs, sod, roses<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj52hypa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.707156,33.663153]}},{"properties":{"name":"Al Amir Bakery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/sm47food_alamirbakery4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/2219896_scaled_175x117.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 518 S Brookhurst #3, Anaheim, CA 92804-2447From OC Weekly:\n\nAl Amir Bakery in Anaheim’s Little Arabia enclave attracts all sorts of eaters, but it works best as an old-style pizzeria, a place where young people step in for a quick bite and flirt. And you get them all—and more—here: Arab B-boys in white hats and untucked long-sleeved shirts crunking Usher from their Lincoln Navigators; little boys and girls darting around their hijab-bedecked mommy, fighting over the last drops of dough, the Middle Eastern yogurt drink; students poring over textbooks, waiting for their study buddy; men in suits stopping in for a snack before walking across the way to smoke at one of the shopping plaza’s two hookah lounges.\n\nThere’s not much yet in the way of lean-to counters and jukeboxes, but it’s no big deal: Al Amir’s primary draw is its extraordinary sphihas, what clueless food critics—me—describe as Lebanese pizza. In my defense, sphihas appear like New York-style pies, thanks to their thin, toasty, wonderfully crunchy crust. And the preparation is identical: cooks roll flat a ball of pita-bread flour in the backroom kitchen, layer it with the ingredients of your choice, and then shove the proto-sphiha into the small brick oven near the cash register. It’s ready in about four minutes.\n\nSphihas are about all Al Amir produces—no baklava, no hummus, no grape leaves and just one type of sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, charred beef and nutty tahini sauce. Unlike so many pizzas, though, the flavors in these sphihas are intense and quite rare—this is only the second sphiha shop in the county after the esteemed Al-Sanabel Bakery. The cheese is Akawi, a slightly tough Palestinian strain that confuses at first with a salty coating but eventually reveals a luscious, sweet milk flavor inside your mouth. You can eat an all-Akawi sphiha, but it’s best when combined with meats—say, soujouk, the spicy beef sausage that’s the pepperoni of the Middle East, or the tart minced-meat spread lahmbaajin. Vegetarians can relish a sphiha sprinkled with zaatar, a zesty pesto of thyme with olive oil and sesame seeds that will pucker your palate. And there are more sphihas—seven in total. They’re the size of an individual pizza, yet impossibly cheap—the most expensive tops out at .50, while a fresh spinach sphiha is an obscene 99 cents.

Following a lifelong passion for food and agriculture, she graduated from the University of California in 1967 with a degree in French Cultural Studies. Alice then trained at the Montessori School in London, followed by a seminal year traveling in France. Her appreciation for classical French technique coupled with\n\nAlice opened her signature restaurant, Chez Panisse, in 1971. The Berkeley restaurant featured a five-course, fixed-price menu that changed daily. To this day, the set menu format remains at the heart of Alice\\'s philosophy of serving the highest quality products according to the season. Over two decades, she has discovered and encouraged a network of farmers and ranchers who now ensure Chez Panisse a steady supply of pure and fresh ingredients, almost all organically grown. The upstairs cafe opened in 1980, and features an a la carte menu--with an open kitchen and a wood-burning pizza oven. In 1984, Cafe Fanny, named for her daughter, opened a few miles from the restaurant.\n\nOver the years Alice has garnered countless awards and accolades, including James Beard Foundation awards for best chef and best restaurant, lifetime achievement awards from Bon Appetit and The Ritz-Carlton Corporation, and even awards from the United States Senate.\n\nA nationally recognized and prized humanitarian, Alice is currently involved with developing a food-based curriculum at Berkeley\\'s Martin Luther Kings Junior High School. This project seeks to involve children directly in planting, gardening, harvesting, cooking, and eating, with the goal of illuminating the vital relationship of food to their lives and teaching them respect for each other and for the planet. It is intended to be a significant part of the school\\'s curriculum, and to help resuscitate its lunch program. This King Junior High Edible Schoolyard is being conceived as a pilot project to serve as a model for schools across the country.\n\nAlice also has ongoing extensive involvement with the Horticulture Project at the San Francisco County Jail and its related program, the Garden Project, a job- training organization and market garden. These programs teach organic gardening to prisoners and parolees in order to renew their self-esteem and install community responsibility.\n\nAlice is married to Stephen Singer, a wine and olive oil merchant and a painter, and has a daughter, Fanny.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiyw6s44"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.271667,37.871667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alice's Breakfast in the Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/3ed5702235eb1cab4a4e1ae3bf779b2f.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 6622 Lakeview, Huntington BeachA charming restaurant by the lake which offers indoor or outdoor dining with breakfast and lunch served till the afternoon.

There, she met with drummer Shawn Rios to form her new band.\n\nRios, a veteran of the Chicago music scene, had already become familiar with the record through various friends and musical contacts that had been talking up her 2004 album, \"The Game\". Hearing that Ms. Breitman was going to start up a backing band in support of the album (and wishing to write new material), Rios called upon Griffin Baron, a trusted session musician with whom he\\'d worked previously. With Griffin on bass, Alison playing piano, guitar and holding court on the microphone, the lineup finally filled out with the addition of Shawn\\'s former band mate and childhood friend Dave Jakalski on guitar.\n\nWith the first show being only a week and a half away, the new lineup (under the moniker of \"Now Now\") worked to the core to get the first set sounding like a professional, polished band who\\'d spent years playing in a room together. The sold out set at Chicago\\'s Hideout was a smashing success, and the grins across the faces of the members of Now Now proved that this was in fact a band to stick around and watch grow.\n\nThe band, now working on new material and gigging around the Chicago and outer lying area, have already started to put their name on the musical map while receiving airplay on WKQX (Q101), WLUW (88.7) among various podcasts and college stations. \n\n-myspace.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxjapb5x0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"All American Party Rentals","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/196893288_386ef33d8f.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/196898583_166bdaae3b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2199 N Batavia St Ste B, Orange, CA 92865Highly recommended by friends who\\'ve have used them for movie projectors.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiv5u6dz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.862127,33.824566]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alto","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/alto1_002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 520 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10022At his latest Midtown restaurant, a stylish, quiet, gray space tucked behind a slab of the Berlin Wall, Scott Conant introduces the food and wines of the Alto Adige, a mountainous area in northern Italy, across the border from Austria.

To transform Amsterdam Bos into the breathtaking park that it is today, park architects planted a vast forest. Although the forest is basically man-made, it appears to be a perfectly natural setting. Beside the forest, one of the fantastic draws to Amsterdam Bos is its sports park, which is constantly in use. \r\n\r\nVondel was built over 140 years ago. Real estate developers wanted to build homes on the outskirts of Amsterdam, but city officials put a condition on their development. The real estate developers would also be required to provide the city with an impressive park; Vondel is the result of this endeavor.

The script is written with beautiful dialogues and the language is stimulating.  The production and acting are superb with Al Pacino and Meryl Streep being extremely powerful and moving.

He is also a talented businessman whose wealth ranks him in the lower part of the Fortune 500 list.\n\nArchangel has fully feathered wings that span 16\\' and have a very flexible skeletal structure. He can fly by flapping his wings, and can reach speeds of up to 150 mph. Though he generally flies below the height of clouds at 6,500 feet, Archangel can reach a height of 10,000 feet with little effort. His wings are strong enough to carry aloft at least 200 pounds in addition to his own body weight. Archangel\\'s entire anatomy is adapted for flight, having hollow bones; a body virtually devoid of fat, granting him enhanced proportionate muscle strength; eyes that can withstand high-speed winds; enhanced eyesight enabling him to see at distances far greater than the average human; and a special respiratory membrane that extracts oxygen from the air at extreme velocities and altitudes. Since his secondary mutation, Archangel can heal fatal injuries and cure most known diseases at an accelerated speed by mixing his blood with that of the victims, so long as they have a compatible blood type.\n\nAfter genetic alteration by Apocalypse, Archangel\\'s feathers were composed of a razor-sharp organic steel-like material. He could expel these feathers at great speed and with tremendous force, enabling them to pierce even steel. The feathers were tipped with a paralyzing chemical generated by his body to which he was immune. He also briefly possessed the ability to convert his life-force into solid light to form a pair of energy wings. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxixucvwo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Architecture in Helsinki","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/c9b731b038f26ee160b2978dc6244648.jpg\">Melbourne, Australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj6b1yto"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.960006,-37.810001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Art Institute of Southern California","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/aboutus_5_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiwp0z66"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.78002,33.550208]}},{"properties":{"name":"Art Murmur","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://www.artmurmur.com/images/logo.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 129 E. 6th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90014<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj14zce6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.249541,34.045143]}},{"properties":{"name":"Arthur's","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/100719591_135.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 240 N.

Today the park includes nine public gardens, an arboretum, the Old Globe Theater, the Starlight Amphitheater, a children\\'s theater, 15 museums and art galleries, and the world-renowned San Diego Zoo.\n\nNearly a century ago, the Panama-California Exposition took place at San Diego\\'s Balboa Park. To mark the opening of the exposition, sugar magnate John D. Spreckels financed the construction of a huge outdoor organ to be housed at the Spreckels Pavilion in the park. Ever since this 1915 exposition, the Spreckels Pavilion has been a community gathering place for residents from all over San Diego. To this date, they have a tradition of regular organ recitals, which are free to the public. Anyone who has ever attended a concert at the pavilion can tell you just how special it is. With its 4,518 pipes this organ can mimic many orchestral sounds, including brass, strings and percussion. On a clear night, the organ\\'s music can be heard far beyond the park\\'s boundaries. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj2wj85g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.149974,32.73145]}},{"properties":{"name":"Balboa Pier","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/20818579_ce0c7e453d_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/12737520_846404a905_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/106689616_270f7a75d3_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/18526459_12a050cfd7_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/106151504_e4aec9a154_o.jpg\">Balboa Pier, Newport Beach, CA\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxix96y1n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.901068,33.598499]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bar Marmont","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/71994732_639f785793.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/barmarmont_030571b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 8171 W Sunset Blvd, West Hollywood, CA 90046-2415It\\'s closed now - what a bummer.\n\nWe came here to get drunk after Kiet\\'s birthday dinner.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj95g9cv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.367242,34.098037]}},{"properties":{"name":"Barnes &amp; Noble","description":"Posted by Heatherh<img src=\"http://makezine.com/images/newsstand/barnesandnoble.gif\">13712 Jamboree Rd, Irvine, CA, 92602, USA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiy3gl2n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.789177,33.726504]}},{"properties":{"name":"Batavia Gardens","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 1730 N.

Stuart Murdoch (singer/songwriter) and Stuart David (bass guitar) met on a government-training scheme and recorded some demos, which were picked up by a Jeepster scout who was taking part in the Stow College Music Business Course. The course, run by ex-Associate Alan Rankine, produces and releases one record every year on the college label Electric Honey Records, usually a single. However in the case of Belle and Sebastian they had enough songs to record a whole album, and so the elusive Tigermilk was born. Recorded in three days and one thousand copies released on vinyl only, it now changes hands for up to £400 per copy.\n\nBelle and Sebastian then signed to Jeepster in August and the critically acclaimed LP \"If You\\'re Feeling Sinister\" (JPRCD/LP/MC001) was released November 18th. The Support slot for the Tindersticks ICA Gigs, Followed by a headline show at the Borderline in early November brought the joys of Belle and Sebastian live to the south for the first time. The band then set about with the plan of spending the summer of 1997 releasing EP\\'s, the first of these being \"Dog On Wheels\" on 28th April. This release contained early demos of the band, previous to all the current members joining, including the demo version of \"The State I Am In\". Mark Radcliffe had played the mastered Tigermilk version of this track relentlessly and for those without a copy of the vinyl masterpiece, the Dog On Wheels EP (JPRCDS/12/7001) appeased the fans thirst enough to put the single in at Number 59 on the singles chart.\n\nThe second EP \"Lazy Line Painter Jane\", was released on July 28th, the Week of the seminal Union Chapel gig in Islington, London. Despite the poor sound, the band had the crowd dancing in the aisles (and pews) of the chapel. For most, this gig was their first B&amp;S gig and a religious experience was shared by all. The \"Lazy Jane\" EP narrowly missed the top 40, crashing in at number 41, much to Chris Geddes (keyboards) amusement, as he had made bets with Jeepster boss Mark Jones that it would not get in. The band played two more gigs on their mini tour of the south-west in Oxford and Colchester, preparing them for their American debut.\n\nThe \"Sinister\" LP had been licensed in North America by Virgin subsidiary label the enclave since February. Belle and Sebastian journeyed over to New York in September to take part in the CMJ (College Music Journal) festival. They played two gigs at the Angel Oransanz Foundation Centre For The Arts, an old chapel in Greenwich Village. The excitement levels were so high, parts of the ceiling decided to join the band onstage, as Belle and Sebastian - literally - brought the house down.\n\nThe band were also invited to play at the Barcelona BAM festival in late September. This time their venue was an ancient courtyard at the Plaza Del Rei, and under a starry moonlit sky, beneath the gaze of a thousand gargoyles they captivated, yet again, another audience.\n\n\"3..6..9 Seconds Of Light\" was the last of the summer EP\\'s released on October 13th, and the music press finally realised just how important B&amp;S are, when both the Melody Maker and the NME made it their single of the Week. Despite the lack of radio play, it became the bands\\' first top 40 hit, debuting at number 32 on the charts.\n\n1998 saw the release of \"The Boy With The Arab Strap\", which became the biggest hit yet, hitting the charts at number 12, before disappearing without trace. The band disappeared too, but fortunately left a trace which led to the US and Europe on their first overseas tour.\n\nOh, and the band won \"Best Newcomer\" at The Brit Awards, much to the chagrin of Dennis Waterman, whose re-mix of \"I Could Be So Good For You (Theme From Minder)\" was deemed ineligible on grounds of being shit. However, Waterman\\'s tears turned to cheers the next year when he was presented with an honorary award for \"Best Thing To Happen To Rula Lenska\".\n\nThe fourth single \"This Is Just A Modern Rock Song\" was released, backed by the sublime \"Slow Graffiti\".\n\n1999 was a reasonably quiet year for the band. The only highlights were the re-release of \"Tigermilk\" and The Bowlie Weekender, Belle &amp; Sebastian\\'s own festival. Held at Pontin\\'s Holiday Camp in Camber Sands, the festival featured Mercury Rev, Teenage Fanclub, Flaming Lips, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Mogwai and Broadcast among others, and spawned All Tomorrows Parties.\n\nThe rest of the year, and the first half of 2000 saw the band locked up in CaVa with Tony Doogan, recording the songs that would eventually make up B&amp;S\\' first Top Ten LP \"Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like A Peasant\". The accompanying single \"Legal Man\" was a Top 15 hit, and gave the band their first \"Top Of The Pops\" appearance, and their first brush with the law. It was a riotous appearance that degenerated into a blur of monkey butlers and roses.\n\nThe ever-expanding B&amp;S line-up had a bit of a blow when Stuart David departed to concentrate on Looper and writing books. But it\\'s alright. Playing the bass isn\\'t exactly rocket science.\n\nThe members of the band took the rest of the year off to concentrate on other projects; Bel\\'s Gentle Waves; Mick with The Amphetameanies; Beans and Stevie with V-Twin and Richard with Snow Patrol.\n\nThey reconvened in January 2001 to record some new songs, again with Doogan. The first of these, \"Jonathan David\", was released as a single on June 18th 2001, becoming a minor hit in the UK and a major hit in Brazil. The band celebrated by playing a 13-date tour of the UK, as well as sell-out trips to the USA, Spain, Japan and Brazil. Having survived various gruesome tour initiation tests, \"Belfast\" Bobby Kildea was poached from V-Twin, joining the band as full-time bassist. He lacks the boy David\\'s dry, cutting wit, but is somewhat easier on the eye.\n\nThe second and final single of the year was called \"I\\'m Waking Up To Us\", and was released in November 2002. It was the first time the band had collaborated with a producer; the producer in question being Mike Hurst, the man behind several great \\'60s hits, and loads of dodgy \\'80s stuff.\n\nLarge chunks of 2002 were also spent recording \"Storytelling\", the soundtrack album to Todd Solenz\\'s film of the same name. As it turns out, a lot of the album doesn\\'t feature in the film, but the film at the very least, inspired all the music. Alright?\n\nThe rest of 2002 was spent on the road, or so it seemed, performing shows in the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Belgium, France, Italy, the USA, Canada, Norway, Germany, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Sadly there was another casualty along the way; Isobel was the next to falter, returning home midway through the US tour. She’d never tried to pretend the rock’n’roll life suited her, and the cons had started to outweigh the pros. So that was that.\n\nAnother significant change occurred, with the band leaving Jeepster Records. Times had changed for both parties and there was a mutual understanding that everyone would be better off trying something new. As far as B&amp;S were concerned, that something new was Rough Trade Records. For Jeepster it was ceasing to release B&amp;S records, in favour of a long-planned B&amp;S DVD compilation.\n\nOne of the highlights of the year was in December, when B&amp;S went to London to play at John Peel’s Christmas party. Some new songs were aired, and a drunken choir joined the band for some carols. For many though, the climax was a unique take on “The Twelve Days Of Christmas” where Richard finally got to do his bird impressions.\n\nIn 2003, Belle &amp; Sebastian completed their 6th studio album. Recorded in palatial splendor in Sussex and London with ‘80s maestro Trevor Horn (Buggles, Yes, ABC, TATU, Frankie Goes To Hollywood), “Dear Catastrophe Waitress” was the first album to feature Bobby and not Isobel and was released worldwide on October 6th. The band played their biggest ever headline shows in NYC, LA and San Fran in August 2003. They weren’t sure whether Neil Diamond’s “Love at The Greek” was recorded in the LA or San Fran Greek Theater, so they did both to be on the safe side.\n\nThe Jeepster “Fans Only” DVD was released in October 2003, and it tells the story of B&amp;S 1996 – 2003 in a far more eloquent and entertaining way than this. There’s loads of unreleased and unseen footage – as well as a few dodgy haircuts – on there which should hopefully make you giggle as much as it did us.\n\nIn November 2003, the band released their first ever single from an album in the form of “Step Into My Office, Baby”. The video is in the style of the seventies “Confessions…” films and stars Richard as the Window Cleaner come Office Piece of Fluff. Graham Linehan – he of Father Ted fame – graciously accepted B&amp;S’s request to write and direct the video, which instigated the biggest amount of back-slapping “Love your work” you could imagine.\n\nThe next 9 months were spent on the road, taking in two trips to Japan, two to America, the first visit to Australia plus the usual UK and mainland Europe jaunts.  After playing some amazing outdoor venues around the world, the band desperately wanted to replicate the success of these shows in the UK and set about organizing a free show in the Botanic Gardens in Glasgow and two nights at Somerset House in London.  Anticipating the usual Glasgow rain for a mid-summer June’s day, B&amp;S branded Rain Mac’s were manufactured.  This was duly noted by a higher power and Glasgow had it’s hottest day of the year, bringing 10,000 people out of the tenements to enjoy the sunshine.  The Somerset House shows in July were just as special, the setting within a beautiful London courtyard and a fabulous light show rivaling the best headline performances at the festivals.\n\nThe release of “I’m A Cuckoo” from DCW in February 2004 saw B&amp;S enjoying unprecedented radio play, and their biggest UK hit to date with a number 14 smash. The EP was also memorable for the first-ever B&amp;S remix; Australian mavericks’ Avalanches unique take on “I’m A Cuckoo” which has to be heard to be believed. “Wrapped Up In Books” was released as a AA-side with new track, the epic “Your Cover’s Blown”, as the final album single in June, netting the group their 3rd Top 20 hit.\n\nThe success of the “Dear Catastrophe Waitress” album and singles led to B&amp;S being nominated for both the Mercury Music Prize and the Ivor Novello Award, but failing to win either.  More oddness was to be experienced in November when Trevor Horn threw a party/concert to celebrate his 25 years in the business and asked B&amp;S to perform.  The band finally threw off their indie shackles and shared a stage with Pet Shop Boys, ABC, Grace Jones, Seal, Yes and Frankie Goes To Hollywood! Highlight? Probably Stuart inadvertently addressing the “I’ve got no claims to your crown” line of “I’m A Cuckoo” to Prince Charles, who was watching from sidestage. And catching Camilla stealing the rider when we were watching Yes.\n\n2004 ended with the band back in Glasgow, ensconced in the studio, writing the next album, which will be recorded in California in Summer 2005.  Before then however, a double-CD, triple-LP compilation of all the Jeepster EP’s and singles called “Push Barman To Open Old Wounds” is released on May 23rd 2005. \n\n-belleandsebastian.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj40l359"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.257224,55.865627]}},{"properties":{"name":"Belmont Shore Pier","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/49408889_0b7eae3e04_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/49408709_547a881198_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/151933953_f8e306fe2c_o.jpg\">Ocean and 39th, Belmont Shore, CABelmont Shore is a distinct area of Long Beach, stretching along 2nd Street and Ocean Avenue on the southern most end of the city. It has its own shopping district, business association, pier and recreation center with the landmark Belmont Pool where an Olympic gold medalist has taught swim lessons for years.  Several thousand residents consider this quaint and quirky community a city unto itself and at one time, it actually was a separate city.\n\n      In 1906, it took shape as the fastest growing subdivision in Long Beach and was called Belmont Heights. Originally designed as an Italian-styled city running along canals, developers Frank Shaw &amp; George C. Flint scrapped plans because of cost and logistics. Another nearby community, Naples, did become the Italian styled village, offering houses on canals, a promenade with a large fountain and even gondoliers.\n\nAll Belmont wanted was a pier. In 1908, angry residents of Belmont Heights voted to become the City of Belmont. Fed up over high taxes imposed by the City of Long Beach, they decided they could do better on their own. During its brief period as a city, Belmont determined that its residents could not afford what they wanted even more than tax reductions. So just one year later they voted to rejoin Long Beach with the understanding a pier would be built. Belmont got its pier in 1915 and the charming community built its lifestyle around its prized possession and sandy beaches surrounding it.\n\nThe current pier was built in 1966, replacing a wooden pier that stood for over 50 years. The 1,620 foot-long concrete pier has experienced structural damage and needs revamping. New restrooms will be added to the mid section of the pier and enhancements such as lighting and electrical updating is expected to bring more activity to the region.\n\nThe pier is located at Ocean and 39th Place. It offers free public fishing with no license  required as long as you stay on the pier to fish. Pay parking is available in a public lot near the base of the pier.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3uvn91"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.148882,33.755441]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bench at the top of Chaparral Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> There\\'s a trail behind Bonita Canyon School, in Chaparral Park, that leads to the top of the hill.

There must be something special about Beth Orton that makes people attempt poetry. Ever since her debut solo album Trailer Park was released to critical acclaim in October \\'96, people have been enchanted by the tall Norfolk broad with the acoustic guitar.\n\n1997 was good to Beth. From working with her all time hero, folk-jazz legend Terry Callier, to singing on the Chemical Brother\\'s number one album Dig Your Own Hole, to touring America with Sheryl Crow and Emmy Lou Harris as part of the Lilith Fair, to performing to a packed-out tent of 10,000 muddy Glastonbury-goers. Not to mention scoring her first Top 40 single with \"She Cries Your Name,\" selling-out her UK tour, and experiencing the perfect movie moment of driving down a sun-soaked Hollywood Boulevard in an open-top convertible and hearing her cover version of The Ronette\\'s \"I Wish I Never Saw The Sunshine\" played on KROQ - then heading home to celebrate a Mercury Music Prize nomination for Album Of The Year!\n\nAt six foot tall and disarmingly sharp, Beth Orton is not exactly what you\\'d expect. With an ability to reduce grown men (and women) to tears with her songs, Beth is more likely to steal your last cigarette than cry on your shoulder. As she says, \"I don\\'t think my songs are as miserable as people make out. There\\'s a lot of hope in there as well. It depends if you\\'re a half-empty or half-full person.\"\n\nBorn in Norfolk, England in 1970, Beth moved to London with her mother at the age of 14 where they settled in Dalston. Her older brothers being punk rockers, the most rebellious thing the teenage Beth could do was \"get into folk.\" She spent her late teen years immersed in everything from Nick Drake to Dexy\\'s, The Stone Roses to Rickie Lee Jones, before toying with the idea of acting and a drama course at the LSU. After a couple of years in fringe theater she hooked up with dance producer William Orbit for her first musical project, a cover of John Martyn\\'s \"Don\\'t Wanna Know About Evil.\" Having worked with Mr. Orbit for two years she co-wrote the first two Red Snapper singles and teamed up with the (little known at the time) Chemical Brothers on \"Alive: Alone,\" the haunting final track from the Brothers\\' ace debut album.\n\nSigned to Heavenly Recordings, Beth blended her guitars with samples and beats on an album of starkly personal songs of breathtaking beauty. Working with producers Victor Van Vught (Tindersticks, Nick Cave) and Andrew Weatherall (producer of the classic Screamadelica) she created her own brand of rhythm-infused folk. Trailer Park struck a chord with everyone from seasoned folkies, country aficionados, teenage clubbers and the brokenhearted, earning her the title (her favorite yet) of \"The Comedown Queen.\" Happiest in charge, she led her new band on a year-long road trek supporting The Beautiful South, John Martyn, John Cale, Mark Eitzel and Everything But The Girl before selling out her own headline tours.\n\nThe Best Bit EP - released in December 1997 - was Beth\\'s biggest chart success yet and saw her hooking up with her musical hero Terry Callier. It\\'s success won Beth two Brit Award nominations (\"Best British Female Artist\" and \"Best British Newcomer\") and the e.p. went on to sell over 40,000 copies. Trailer Park soon went gold and it seemed that suddenly the whole world was talking about the intriguing English girl with the spine-tingling voice and pocketful of heartache.\n\nFrom virtual unknown to magazine front cover star by whispered word of mouth in under two years seems an unprecedented feat, and Beth\\'s latest album Central Reservation will only help cement her growing reputation. She has recorded her second album with producers Victor Van Vught (producer of Trailer Park) and David Roback (from eerie US duo Mazzy Star). Central Reservation features guest appearances from jazz hero Terry Callier, Ben Watt (of Everything But The Girl), Ben Harper and Dr. John. An album of starkly beautiful songs, including the Modern Rock radio hits \"Central Reservation\" and \"Stolen Car,\" Entertainment Weekly perhaps summed the collection up best by simply calling it \"stunning.\" \n\n-artista.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiznbxhz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"Big J's Frozen Custard","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/icecream4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 2094 North Tustin St, Orange, CA714-921-2932\n\nWhat kind of ice cream establishment can exist and thrive on only four flavors?\n\nBig J\\'s can.

Campers are invited to use the group barbecue (charcoal provided), participate in evening and morning hikes, create a craft, enjoy an Open Space slide show, and make S’mores by the campfire while singing campfire songs,” Litton said.\r\n\r\nAnd if campers don’t want to do any of the above, they may sit back and listen to the birds or play horseshoes or volleyball.\r\n\r\nFamilies may begin pitching their tents at 3 p.m. Saturday for an overnight adventure, complete with campfire songs and stories, docent-led nature walks, and a slideshow featuring native wildlife, plants and history of the camp.\r\n\r\nFor more info, call (949) 724-6738. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj1zrgxs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.79236,33.60871]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bommer Canyon","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/bommer.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/card_boomer.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 1 Bommer Canyon Road, Irvine, CA 92603Rich in both Irvine Ranch lore and nature\\'s bounty, Bommer Canyon beckons walkers and hikers to stroll past centuries-old oak and sycamore groves and craggy rock outcroppings.

An order of 3 hearty rolls runs about .75. Also recommended: The roasted duck salad (.95), numerous versions of bun (another salad-like dish of rice noodles, lettuce and carrots topped with meat or seafood and tangy sauce), and banh xeo, a pan-fried crispy rice-flour crepe flavored with coconut milk and stuffed with shrimp, sliced pork and bean sprouts (.25). <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj9f8j4r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.956965,33.759455]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brywood Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/fields12.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 15 Westwood, Irvine, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj7dfxec"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.768603,33.715306]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bug under the rug","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/4/surfingdonuts.jpg\">12350 Se Division St, Portland, ORtest\ntest 2\ntest 3\ntest 4<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiujpil9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.53619,45.503963]}},{"properties":{"name":"Burning Hearts by My Favorite","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/andrea_text.jpg\">34.385278,132.455278One of my heroes--My Favorite.\n\n\"Burning Hearts\", mournfully mid-tempo, opens with \"We met first in cafes, and later in ruins / My best friend and I are saying goodbye in Hiroshima\".

Beginning as a gardening experiment on the grounds of a former limestone quarry, the gardens have transformed into a world-class park over the past century.\n\nIn 1888, Robert Pim Butchart started manufacturing cement, drawing much of the necessary limestone from the land around his factory on Vancouver Island. When the limestone quarry was mined out, Robert Pim Butchart’s wife, Jennie, had an idea to transform the empty pit into something more aesthetically pleasing. She had rich topsoil brought in from the neighboring farmland and planted what has become known as the Sunken Garden. Over the coming decades, the Butcharts added a Japanese Garden, an Italian Garden, a Rose Garden, and even a large vegetable patch. By 1920, over fifty thousand people came every year to see the remarkable landscapes that the Butcharts had created.\n\nToday, Butchart Gardens is considered a world-class attraction. In the next year, they anticipate the welcome of their fifty millionth visitor. In addition to the many gardens, there are seasonal attractions including fireworks, concerts, strolling Christmas carolers, and the summertime “Night Illuminations.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiwxwcsq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.463162,48.563683]}},{"properties":{"name":"Byblos Café","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/nightoutorg3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/sm51food1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 129 W.

Perhaps the best example of this on their debut release, Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi, is Eighties Fan. If you haven\\'t heard it (and you undoubtedly have), it is probably the best pop song ever. The aforementioned melancholy runs through its string veins with the lightest of bobbing flows. An impossibly pretty and well-recorded string section (arranged by Stuart Murdoch of Belle and Sebastian) provides the soul here, in a way that Tompaulin have surely learnt from and replicated. This song could mean something to everyone, such is its grace and deftness of craft. You too will think that \\'life will be the death of you\\'. Unfortunately, having Eighties Fan as the second track on the album means that the listener is consistently under-whelmed by everything that follows it. This isn\\'t to say that any of the material is spectacularly bad, but it inevitably fails in comparison to the glory of that one song. The album does enough to suggest that Eighties Fan wasn\\'t a fluke (the terribly sad tale of a Smiths-obsessed boyfriend in Pen and Notebook probably comes closest), but there is a definite lack of the extreme coherence that would catapult them into the indie-pop superleagues. There are flashes of arch-knowing that take them steps closer to that special kind of personal relationship between band and listener, but there is also the feeling that they are capable of so much more. The sullen beauty of Tracy-Ann Campbell\\'s voice could be the charm that wins the day with the casual listener, but the longevity really needs to come from the songs. A fine testament to the influence of Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura could be something pretty special if they get out of first gear.\n\n-TweeNet\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3pe8a8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.257224,55.865627]}},{"properties":{"name":"Campanile","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/LARES00112.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 624 S La Brea Ave, Los Angeles, CACampanile (323) 938-1447<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj2x62p9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.343833,34.064196]}},{"properties":{"name":"Campitelli Cookies","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/4/306868_135.jpg\">924 E Imperial Hwy, Brea, CA 92821This small bakery features a gallery of fresh-baked cookies and various packaging should you want to present a batch as a gift.

Steve Rogers was given another chance to serve his country though, as a General overheard his rejection and offers Steve a chance to fight the Nazi’s by being a part of a top-secret experiment. Steve agrees. Steve was given a super-solider serum and was blasted by radiation. After the process, Steve’s body was no longer sickly and frail but the pinnacle of human perfection. Unfortunately, the plans for the super-soldier serum were lost when a Nazi spy killed the scientist who kept the plans secreted away in his mind. Steve underwent extensive training and was soon put into action as Captain America, fighting Hitler and the Nazi oppressors. But his work was soon cut short when fighting Baron Zemo. Tied to a rocket with his sidekick, Bucky, Captain America was too late in freeing the two and the rocket exploded, killing Bucky and sending Captain America to what seemed to be an icy grave in the harsh Atlantic Ocean. His frozen body was found decades later by the Sub-Mariner, and somehow, Captain America survived.

Olmstead\\'s plan, known as the Greensward Plan, was submitted to the Central Park design competition in 1857. The Greensward Plan created a green haven in the center of what was becoming a noisy and hectic city. The park\\'s design was built around areas of tufted trees, rolling lawns, meandering pathways and placid lakes. Fredrick Law Olmstead\\'s plan for New York\\'s Central Park still serves as a model for park planners today. His vision set the standard for the pastoral urban park.\nToday, with the aid of the Central Park Conservancy, New York\\'s Central Park has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Every day, thousands of residents and tourists traverse the park, enjoying an expanse of green in the middle of one of America\\'s largest cities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiutca0v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9727,40.77341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Central Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/53/110797246_a11d8a769c_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Northpark - Central ParkThis paseo run through the heart of the village where I live.

These people don\\'t seem to mind that they\\'re not at the Haagen-Dazs store just around the corner.\n\nWhat we loved above all at Chantilly were the cotton candy and strawberry cheesecake flavors. The cotton candy is a fun, almost bubble gum flavor with bright, colorful bursts of candy.

Chapultepec Park, located in El Distrito Federal, or Mexico City, constitutes one of the largest open spaces in this densely urban area. In the Aztec language, “Chapultepec” literally means “grasshopper hill.” This park is the largest in Mexico City, stretching three times as long as New York’s Central Park. Because of Chapultepec Park’s central location, it serves as an excellent “jumping-off” point for many of Mexico City’s other attractions. Chapultepec Park is a popular spot for both the residents of Mexico City, as well as tourists.\n\nSurrounding Chapultepec Park, which is east of the city center, are a centuries-old forest and beautiful, historical neighborhoods. Inside the park, there are a wide variety of amenities and venues including: an amusement park, the only genuine castle in North America, Mexico\\'s largest zoo, a lake, a water park, and Los Pinos, the residence of the President of Mexico. The park is also home to numerous museums, such as the Anthropology Museum (Museo Nacional de Antropologia), the Modern Art Museum (Museo de Arte Moderno), and the Contemporary Art Museum (Museo de Arte Contemporaneo Internacional Rufino Tamayo).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj0hozfp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-99.184613,19.421768]}},{"properties":{"name":"Charles Chocolates Test Store","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/home_romance_yellow_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/home_romance_green.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/home_romance_red_2_.jpg\">3527 California Street, San Francisco, CA 94118A temporary Laurel Heights confectionery.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiwz4uhv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.452133,37.786576]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chased by cops for trespassing","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://k43.pbase.com/v3/35/379435/1/46320355.hbhs2.jpg\">1905 Main Street, Huntington Beach, CA 92648Huntington Beach High School was one of the best places to skate when there were no skate parks in the area.

But his size is not why he is known as, “Colossus.” Colossus can change his body into an organic steel composition. While in this state, he grows in size and tremendously in mass.\n\nWhen covered in the living steel, Colossus is nearly impervious to damage. He can survive explosions, extreme heat and cold, falls from great height, and is resistant to magic. Colossus will not rust.\n\nColossus also has super strength while in his metal form. He can lift in excess of 100 tons and can go toe to toe with many of the heavy hitters of the Marvel Universe.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men, Ultimate X-Men\nCurrently Seen In:\nVarious X-Men, Ultimate X-Men\n\nInteresting Fact: \nColossus\\' metal body has adverse reactions to magical beings and can cause damage to them on contact.\n\nOrigin: \nPiotr, “Peter,” Rasputin grew up on a farm in Siberia, of the former Soviet Union. He was content to live there with his family, most importantly his sister Illyana, whom he loved and protected dearly. It was there that Professor X found Colossus and convinced him to join The X-Men. Peter grew to feel at home with The X-Men. In particular, he developed a relationship with Kitty Pryde, Shadow Cat.\n\nHis devotion to Illyana would come to a head when she died to the Legacy Virus, a Virus that was designed to kill mutants. Stricken with grief, Colossus left The X-Men to join Magneto and his Acolytes, but later rejoined The X-Men. Dr. Hank McCoy – The Beast – found a cure for the Legacy Virus, but would need a mutant to give up their life to disperse the cure quickly. Colossus injected himself with the cure and appeared to die, saving the mutant population.\n\nInstead, an alien by the name of Ord had abducted the nearly dead Colossus and revived him. Colossus was rescued by Kitty Pryde and the rest of The X-Men and now works with them to pursue Xavier’s dream of mutants and humans coexisting peacefully.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxjavlu29"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Come Back from San Francisco by The Magnetic Fields","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/d633507n708.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/merritt.jpg\">San Francisco, CA\n\n\nCome back from San Francisco. \nIt can\\'t be all that pretty, \nwhen all of New York City misses you. \nShould pretty boys in discos distract you from your novel, \nremember I\\'m awful in love with you. \n\n**You need me like the wind needs the trees to blow in. \nLike the moon needs poetry, you need me. **\n\nCome back from San Francisco and kiss me; I\\'ve quit smoking. \nI miss doing the wild thing with you. \nWill you stay?

Although many may thing they are laser blasts, they are actually blasts of pure force, capable of killing a human being and even blasting through walls, steel, and more.\n\nScott’s energy comes from the sun. He is constantly soaking in solar energy and converting it into the energy that comes out of his eyes.\n\nScott uses a pair of ruby quartz sunglasses to prevent the force blasts from randomly shooting out as he lost the ability to control his optic blasts in a plane crash long ago. In combat, Cyclops uses a visor to control his blasts. He must push a button on the left or right sides to rotate the ruby quartz plates and allow the energy to come out.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men\n\nCurrently Seen In:\nAstonishing X-Men, Ultimate X-Men\n\nInteresting Fact: \nScott’s father did not die in the plane crash in his youth. Instead, Scott’s father Major Christopher Summers was captured by Shi’ar aliens and later became Corsair of the Starjammers.\n\nOrigin: \nAs a boy, Scott Summers lost his parents in a tragic plane crash. His mother pushed Scott and his brother Alex (Havok) out of the plane with the only parachute. Unfortunately, the parachute caught on fire and Scott hit his head, putting him into a coma and caused brain damage. Alex was adopted and Scott spent months in a coma, only to be sent to an orphanage when he awoke.\n\nLater, Scott’s mutant powers awoke to devastating effect. It would seem that the brain damage he suffered from the plane crash affected his ability to control his mutant powers. Scott unleashed a torrent of energy and blasted a crane apart and onto a crowd. A subsequent blast from Scott saved the crowd, but instead of praise, Scott suffered their anger and fear as they tried to pursue him. Scott fled and was eventually approached by Charles Xavier.\n\nCharles asked Scott to become the first in his new school for gifted youngsters. Scott accepted and as Xavier has said, “You will be the nucleus—around which I shall build the group!” Since that time, Scott has proven himself to be that nucleus and leader for the X-Men.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj074g5k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Daffodil Hill","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/DaffodilHill1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Shake Ridge Rd., Sutter Creek, CAEach spring, from mid-March through mid-April, Daffodil Hill explodes with thousands of blooms, attracting visitors from around the world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxizgcpm4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.70611,38.44195]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dahlia (Portland, Oregon)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/7b9746a0_bdb4_4bde_8c49_bcb76f9876e0.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/95ef37fc_cd51_4ed0_9634_0ea9ad0053e8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/07/1/Bangkok.jpg\">Portland, OregonDahlia - Pedro\n\nBefore they became the buzz of Portland, OR, as the duo Dahlia, Jennifer Folker and Keith Schreiner were semi-successful artists on their own, the former as a vocalist-for-hire and the latter as an ambient producer. Folker had laid down vocals for Banco de Gaia (the club hit \"Obsidian\"), Tweaker, and King Black Acid; Schreiner had released an album as Auditory Sculpture. Yet while the success they garnered on their own was modest at best, when the two teamed up for Dahlia -- Folker handling vocals, Schreiner crafting soundscapes -- they suddenly became the trendiest act in Portland. It was the duo\\'s weekly gig at the club Ohm that drew a crowd -- each week more and more people showing up to see what all the fuss was about. Local publications such as the Portland Tribune, the Oregonian, and even the Rocket in Seattle wrote flattering and mystique-building stories on the duo, setting the stage for Emotional Cycles, Dahlia\\'s recording debut.\n\n-allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3x7e6a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675,45.523611]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dahlia Bakery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/bakery_interior2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2001 4th Ave, Seattle, WADahlia Bakery (206) 441-4540\n\nThe Dahlia Bakery is located right next to the Dahlia Lounge, along 4th Avenue between Virginia and Lenora.\n\nThis tiny store front bakery allows you to take home the delicious desserts and breads served in Douglas\\' four restaurants.

Following two years in Copenhagen where Daniel worked as a chef in some of the city’s finest kitchens, he made his way to the United States. His first position here was as chef to The European Commission in Washington, DC. Next, Daniel opened the Polo Lounge at The Westbury Hotel and later Le Régence at the Hotel Plaza Athenée in New York City. From 1986 to 1992, Daniel served as Executive Chef at New York’s Le Cirque. During his tenure there, the restaurant was regularly chosen as one of the most highly rated in the country.\n\nIn 1993, Daniel Boulud opened his own much-heralded restaurant DANIEL on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Here his inspiration remained the seasonal ingredients drawn from the best local purveyors. In just a year after opening, the restaurant was rated “one of the ten best restaurants in the world” by the International Herald Tribune.\n\nIn September 1998 Daniel Boulud opened Café Boulud, named for the gathering place his great grandparents tended on their farm outside Lyon at the turn of the century. The contemporary Café Boulud is a French restaurant with an international accent welcoming Manhattan’s café society to a spot with the cosmopolitan chic of a Parisian rendez-vous. In December of the same year the chef-restaurateur relocated DANIEL to its new Venetian renaissance inspired setting in the former Mayfair Hotel on Park Avenue and 65th Street. Since the restaurant’s re-opening, Daniel Boulud has been named “Chef of the Year” by Bon Appétit Magazine and the restaurant has received Gourmet Magazine’s coveted “Top Table” award. On March 14, 2001 the New York Times awarded DANIEL a coveted four-stars, while in the fall of 2003, DANIEL received both Wine Spectator’s “Grand Award” and New York City’s top ratings for cuisine, service and decor in the Zagat Survey.\n\nIn June 2001 the Chef opened DB Bistro Moderne in the City Club Hotel on West 44th Street. \"DB\" is a casual and contemporary restaurant in the heart of midtown, just steps from the theater district. Here, Daniel Boulud\\'s latest menu offers updated bistro cooking rooted in French tradition.\n\nThe chef opened a second Café Boulud in July 2003 at Palm Beach’s legendary Brazilian Court hotel. The menu parallels that of its sister restaurant in Manhattan. The new restaurant accommodates 130 guests, offers a lounge and bar as well as two elegant private dining rooms.\n\nDaniel’s other endeavors include Feast &amp; Fêtes, the exclusive catering department of DANIEL and his “Daniel Boulud CONNOISSEUR” line of Caspian caviar and smoked Scottish salmon offered via direct mail. Daniel was one of the founding partners of Payard Patisserie &amp; Bistro and sold his interest in the business to François Payard in September 2000.\n\nIn September 2003 Daniel launched his own line of professional quality kitchenware, aptly called Daniel Boulud Kitchen (DBK), including knives, enameled cast iron cookware, stainless steel cookware and tools, and kitchen textiles such as oven mitts, aprons and kitchen towels.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj6l4pg7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.980278,40.759167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Daughter Darling (Philadelphia, USA)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/19.jpg\">PhiladelphiaDaughter Darling - Shatter\r\n\r\nVideos:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.daughterdarling.com/colorblindsmall.html\">Colorblind</a> (Quicktime / stream)\r\n\r\nIf you can imagine Portishead, with more accsessible vocals, rich harmonies, classical style piano playing, gorgeous string sections and the most amazing beats ever programmed, then you have Daughter Darling.

The underground success of the cassette You Can Play These Songs\\' Chords inspired Gibbard to recruit a full-time band including guitarist/organist Christopher Walla (who recorded the early DCFC sessions as well), bassist Nick Harmer, and drummer Nathan Good, and in the summer of 1998, Death Cab for Cutie issued their debut LP, Something About Airplanes, to much acclaim from indie circles. Just prior to completion of the 2000 follow-up We Have the Facts and We\\'re Voting Yes, Good left the group and was replaced by drummer Michael Schorr. In fall 2000, the band released the Forbidden Love EP. A solid selection of new cuts were found on The Photo Album the next year. In 2003, Eureka Farm\\'s Jason McGerr joined the group and the band\\'s stunning fourth album Transatlanticism appeared in October. While touring in support of that album in spring 2004, Death Cab For Cutie recorded seven brand new tracks. The John Byrd E.P., which was named for the band\\'s touring sound engineer John Byrd, was issued on Barsuk in March 2005. After a lengthy courtship with Barsuk, the group inked a deal with Atlantic and released their label debut, Plans, in August of 2005. It sold nearly 90,000 copies during its first week of release, entering the US album chart at number four.\n\n-allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj7e7t3g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.486944,48.759722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delicias de Mexico","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/icecream11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/icecream13.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 13466 Harbor Blvd, Garden Grove, CA714-636-7163\n\nWhile we\\'re used to ice cream flavors like the standard vanilla and chocolate, it\\'s at Delicias de Mexico in Garden Grove where the brave can really venture out and try a surprising array of flavors, from a scoop made from the tropical Mamay fruit, to a corn flavored \"paleta de leche,\" or ice cream bar.\n\nA standout in this store is the Chongos ice cream, which is like tried and true vanilla ice cream with a twist: There\\'s a hint of cinnamon in each spoonful, along with tiny, chewy flecks of sweet curded milk candy.

I was wandering around Ueno Park, leaving the crowd of people and Hanami parties behind, when you tapped my shoulder and asked me to take a photo of you standing in front of a temple, on top of the hill. You spoke charmingly with a British accent, Chinese-born and living in London. You were amazingly backpacking through Japan on your own for a month. We shared stories of our trips, and then you showed a map of your adventure plans. We swapped emails and addresses. We took pictures of ourselves. When I got back home I received a postcard from you in Nagoya - and later, stories of a dodgy hotel in Osaka, the peril of riding bikes in Kyoto, among other life\\'s off-kilter experiences. I sent winded emails of little things about me, hoping you\\'ll get in touch with me when you get home, but somehow you didn\\'t. Now it\\'s springtime again and I\\'m thinking of going to London.

The German park, which was built between 1991 and 2000, is constructed on grounds that were once highly industrialized. What makes this park different from so many other exercises in reuse, however, is that the skeletons of industry are the main attraction at the park.\n\nNewly fitted for safety and public exploration, the former industrial mountains, machines and structures have become a permanent exhibit of German history. But they are only half of the spectacle. Duisburg’s lush landscaping has been melded into the heavily industrialized backdrop and is comprised of what may be called experimental vegetation. Because of the nature of the site, the park’s designers were unsure what plants would flourish. They planted a large variety of flora species and let nature decide how the final landscape would look. The result is a menagerie of unexpected greenery growing in very unexpected places: trails of vines climbing water towers, groundcover wading into rain-filled pools and trees sprouting up between vast metal towers.\n\nPark-goers are constantly surprised and enchanted with their surroundings at Duisburg Nord, one of Europe’s more intriguing feats in park reuse.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiyu5l7u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[6.784253,51.47984]}},{"properties":{"name":"Durango Mexican Grill","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 730 E.

Back in 1999, when the singer released the critically acclaimed Love In The Time Of Science, Emiliana came out with a gorgeous, electronic trippoppinâ vision of endless summer and moonlit nights out. Following her departure from One Little Indian, thereâs a new introspection, closer to Nick Drake or Jolie Holland than Portishead or Goldfrapp.\n\n\"This whole record is about these four years I was away,\" explains Emiliana \" Very life-changing times. A lot of things happened. I just couldn\"t at this stage go back to writing a record like I did before.\" Indie HQ Rough Trade clearly approved of her new direction: they signed Emiliana immediately after hearing the first demos from Fisherman\\'s Woman.\n\nThe 27-year-old singer and writer has nonetheless been busy since Love In The Time Of Science. She moved to Brighton, joined the cast of Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers to perform the enchanting âGollum Songâ wrote and toured with Thievery Corporation, and wrote a Number One Hit for Kylie Minogue in the shape of huge-selling pop smash \\'slow\". \"It was a very fun thing to do,\" she says. \"It was an opportunity to dust off my dancing shoes and write music that I don\"t normally write but love, and then keep the smokey-little-bar-music to my self.\" \\'slow\" was written and produced with Brixton-based producer Mr Dan, midway through the sessions that became Fisherman\\'s Woman. After writing with a number of different artists, Emiliana was introduced to Mr Dan â and they clicked immediately. \"it had been so long since the last album, and I was in two minds of doing it again,\" she says. \"I was very nervous about going back, but we had so much fun doing it. It is just one of those collaborations I have been waiting for all my life.\"\n\nEmiliana decided to go back to basics and write with just a guitar and no electronics or programming. The pair jammed out the songs in Dan\\'s dark Brixton basement with Dan on guitar and Emiliana conjuring up the lyrics and melodies. After that they recorded the record in The Exchange in Camden, \" well one thing I knew very well is that I wanted a very intimate vocal sound,\" she says. \"This album was recorded with candles, laughing fits and my duvet. We were sad leaving Brixton. I love it there,\" she says. \"It can suck the life out of you and then blow you full again. Depends what mood it\\'s in. Brixton is like a huge \"me me me show\".\"\n\nIntimate. It sounds like it: opening gambit \"Nothing Brings Me Down\" gradually builds from sparse beginnings; Dan\\'s acoustic guitar, light touches of piano - to a textured, gentle circle. Album highlight \\'sunny Road\" sounds as if it could have leaped out of a dusty, lost Leonard Cohen session, while \"Lifesaver\" floats along a mysterious, fairy-tale accordion melody, accompanied by the ambient creak of boats on water. \"Thinking Out Loud\" whispers of Eastern Europe and the Appalachians before album closer, \\'serenade\" multi-tracks the listener into a moonlit dream which references clouds, dark vines, temptations and new tomorrows. It\\'s evocative and heart-felt â a handcrafted jewel of a record. Fisherman\\'s Woman also includes a song, \"Honeymoon Child\" written by smog\\'s Bill Callahan, who Emiliana spent some time writing with in America.\n\nEmiliana Torrini is half Icelandic, half Italian. She grew up in Iceland in a town outside Reykjavik and spent her childhood summers with her grandmother in the far east of Iceland out in the wild, spacious countryside. Her teen summers were spent in Germany with her Italian uncle. She joined a choir aged seven and sang soprano till she was 15, when she went to opera school. \"I got into other music rather late because we didn\"t have any records, well except lots of classical, my mum\\'s Greatest Love Songs compilation from the TV and Leonard Cohen whom I love. Then we got MTV. We were the first people in our town to have it and I would stay up all night to record from the late night alternative shows, making tapes to take to school to brag about my musical findings.\"\n\nShe recorded a few jazz and blues songs for her father\\'s 50tth birthday which then became an album that sold 15,000 copies in Iceland and remained at number one for many months. She followed this with an equally successful album of which 50% was co-written by her and hence the beginnings of her writing career. \"I spent this period singing in restaurants, bars and hotels all over Iceland,\" and that is how she was discovered by One Little Indian where their MD happened to be eating. Emiliana consequently moved to England where Roland Orzabal from Tears For Fears co-produced her worldwide debut. \" I wanted to move to India, learn the classical techniques there, then move to Bulgaria, be a gypsy, and learn the techniques, and keep moving and learning new ways of singing - but instead I came to England and made a pop record.\"\n\nFisherman\\'s Woman is a very different beast. It is themed around loss, and how it feels to lose people; sometimes it\\'s dripping with sadness but more frequently imbued with almost magical optimism. \"Fisherman\\'s Woman is a letter I wrote to a person that I lost at that time. I coped by thinking I was with a fisherman. They can go on sea for months like my friend\\'s dad. Her mum saw him twice a year maybe for a fortnight at a time,\" she says. \"It was a little bit like Alice in Wonderland. The falling into a hole, the madness of it all.\" Despite the sadness, Emiliana remains positive. \"I could never write a wholly sad album,\" she says laughing. \"There are too many moon rivers to see and life to live. Fisherman\\'s woman has been a way of making things whole again.\"\n\nThis album is sincerely honest and as endearing as they come. And it\\'s lovely, too.\n\n-emilianatorrini.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxja89eux"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-19.020835,64.963051]}},{"properties":{"name":"Equinox - DC","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 818 Connecticut Ave Nw, Washington, DCEquinox - DC (202) 331-8118<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj8o6rjl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.038293,38.900438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Escort Crash on Marston Street by Heavenly","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/heavenly.jpg\">Marston St. Lawrence, Northamptonshire, OX17, UKThe line \"Escort crash on Marston Street\" refers to a road in Northamptonshire.\n\n\nOh, hey Robert, you\\'re driving much too fucking fast\nI think you ought to go a lot slower\nIt\\'s a residential zone.

She moved to Toronto in 1996, and quickly became a fixture at the city\\'s open mikes. There she met Doc (real name: Martin McKinney), an engineer and producer, and the two began working on a demo featuring his programming and her vocals. Sony eventually took interest, and suddenly Esthero went from a fledgling idea to a duo with Esthero\\'s name as their own and a record, Breath from Another, issued in spring 1998 on the label\\'s Work imprint. Breath\\'s mix of beats, lush vocals, and fractured bits of programmed samples caught on perfectly with the trip-hop trend of the time, and Esthero had success with singles like Heaven Sent and the hip-hop-flavored title track.\n\nHowever, it would take nearly seven years for a follow-up to appear. In the interim Esthero parted ways with Doc and struck out on her own, contributing vocals to projects like Black Eyed Peas\\' \"Weekends\" (2000).

The head of Marvel came back to work and told Stan Lee and Jack Kirby to do the same, and the Fantastic Four was born.\n\nOrigin: \nReed Richards, a brilliant scientist, took his crew on an unregistered space ship launch to become the first to do interstellar travel. An accident occurred, and the crew was bathed in cosmic rays and was forced to return to earth. When they got back to earth, the realized that through the cosmic rays, they were changed on the most basic molecular level. They each had super powers, some with great abilities and little change to their physical appearance, but in the case of The Thing, the side effects were very noticeable and monstrous.\n\nThe four had a choice, to hide their powers and shy away from society, or to embrace their newfound abilities and use them to help the very people that might consider them freaks. Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben all decided to face their fears and as The Fantastic Four, they have become more powerful than they would be as individuals and their bonds have made them a family of sorts, ready to take on any challenge. Now, they are adventurers of a new kind, and have traveled to places and domains humanity has never thought even existed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj6ff53s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fargo","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/46/26/70m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Fargo, North DakotaA homespun murder story.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj5cwru6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.789444,46.877222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fashion Island","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://www.uclc.net/100_cal_fashion%20Island4.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 401 Newport Center Drive Newport Beach CA, 92660<img src=\"http://www.dailypilot.com/content/articles/2007/04/18/shopping/fashionisland/store/fashionisland01.gif\">\n\nIn the heart of Newport Beach is Fashion Island, offering unique shopping and dining in a beautiful open-air atmosphere.

Beginning as an instrumental and sampled vocal project, they were signed for a track on a compilation by Beatservice Records in winter 2001. On hearing the finished track, label manager Vidar Hanssen signed the unnamed band for a full album.\n\nDuring early summer 2001, Ulf and Jo recorded most of the album and Anja improvised the vocals. After their vocals, Jo layered the guitars, but it would be a year before the album would be completed and released.\n\nIn spring 2002, the band was known as Flunk and they released their first single, a cover of New Order\\'s Blue Monday in April. The track was well received in the UK and was included on numerous compilations in North America and Europe. Later in April, their debut album For Sleepyheads Only was released which garnered great reviews in Norway. With the success of their album, BBC invited them to do a recording session for the Radio 1 show The Blue Room in London. Shortly after Notting Hill Art\\'s Club would become the location to their live debut. In the United States, they became signed to Guidance Recordings.\n\nBy summer 2002, raving reviews were being returned by British electronica magazines and in July they played Norway\\'s finest rock festival. In October For Sleepyheads Only was released in the US through Guidance Recordings. By November they played the London Jazz Festival.\n\nThroughout 2003 their debut, For Sleepyheads Only was still being echoed across the globe in staggered releases with special editions released to Russia and Greece. Beatservice Records then went on to release Treat Me Like You Do - For Sleepyheads Only Remixed in June. While their debut continued to make it\\'s way around, the band wasted no time and began work on their second album for the majority of the year, which was recorded in Paris in October.\n\nTheir sophomore album, Morning Star was finished in March 2004 and saw a Norwegian release in May while the rest of the world received it in June. In 2005, Play America was released on Beatservice Records which included bonus tracks from the US version of Morning Star along with remixes.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj9d0135"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[9.667969,62.186014]}},{"properties":{"name":"Food Court at the Market Place","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/a_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/c_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> A nice lunch spot for semi-fast food.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj91z3mh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.786806,33.727873]}},{"properties":{"name":"Forest Ave","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/2161832_Forest_Street_Shops_of_Laguna_Laguna_Beach.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxixvy1c0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.78331,33.5422]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fountain at University Center","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/bent_water_uci_tokina_1224.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 4101 Campus Drive,  Irvine, CA 92612This fountain is located near the center of University Center.

In 1942 she was arrested for drunk driving and made the mistake of going to Mexico, which violated her parole. When she returned, she was put in a mental institution where she reportedly underwent shock treatments and a lobotomy. She was released in 1949 and began a comeback in 1957, eventually getting her own TV show called Frances Farmer Presents. In 1970, Farmer died of cancer at age 56.\r\n\r\nIn this song it appears Kurt Cobain is likening himself to Frances Farmer. While Frances was almost infamous for her difficulty to work with and her battle with her movie studio, which forced her into bad roles. She demanded much and later all she got for it was a series of mental collapses and a failed battle with alcoholism. Kurt related Farmer\\'s battles against her contracts with corporate Hollywood with his difficulty with his record label, which he felt was holding him back and stifling his art, making him release poppy stuff he was never satisfied with. Farmer was born in Seattle, but Kurt had a lot more to do with the city than she did. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt\\'s so relieving to know that you\\'re leaving \r\nAs soon as you get paid\r\nIt\\'s so relaxing to hear you\\'re asking \r\nWherever you get your way\r\nIt\\'s so soothing to know that you\\'ll sue me \r\nThis is starting to sound the same\r\n\r\nI must seek comfort in being sad (x3)\r\n\r\nIn a false witness, we hope you\\'re still with us \r\nTo see if they float or drown\r\nOur favorite patient, a display of patience \r\nShe\\'s gonna prove herself\r\nShe\\'ll come back as fire, to burn all the liars, \r\nAnd leave a blanket of ash on the ground \r\n\r\nI must seek comfort in being sad (x3)\r\n\r\nIt\\'s so relieving to know that you\\'re leaving \r\nAs soon as you get paid\r\nIt\\'s so relaxing to hear you\\'re asking \r\nWherever you get your way\r\nIt\\'s so soothing to know that you\\'ll sue me \r\nThis is starting to sound the same\r\n\r\nI must seek comfort in being sad (x3)    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxjab15or"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.330833,47.606389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Franco's Pasta Cucina","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/francos_clam_pasta.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2222 Michelson Dr Ste 206, Irvine, CA 92612Franco\\'s is located inside a busy food court serving the lunch crowd.

It sounds almost too good to be true.\n\nBut thank heavens, it\\'s not. At Gelato Classico in Corona Del Mar, flavors are rich and vibrant. The difference between gelato and ice cream is that gelato is made with milk, ice cream is made with cream. Ice cream also has air added into it to achieve it\\'s consistency, while gelato has no air added at all, making it more dense.\n\nHere, one of the flavors to try is Coppa Mista, a blend of vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut and pistachio. Each flavor is impressive enough to stand alone, but when layered together, the final product has amazing depth. Also worth trying are a sinful burgundy cherry that made us feel regal when eating it, and the raspberry sorbetto, almost as romantic as the Italian language itself.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj5nufbi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.872788,33.601584]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gelato Paradiso","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 952 Avocado Ave, Newport Beach, CAGelato Paradiso (949) 640-9256<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj8wfr0j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.87469,33.606615]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gelato Paridiso Authentic","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/gelato_nb.jpg\">401 Newport Center Dr, Newport Beach, CAGelato Paridiso Authentic (949) 718-9800<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj1fhlb7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.873184,33.614184]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gelson's","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/e4f0847b6f58142223b68b32d884d81a.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 5521 Alton Parkway, IrvineGelson\\'s store is all about cleanliness, convenience, and service.

While she was still in college, she appeared on her friend Tricky\\'s 1995 debut Maxinquaye, which led to appearances on albums from other cutting-edge electronic artists, including Orbital\\'s Snivilisation and Add N to X\\'s Avant Hard. By the late \\'90s, Goldfrapp began honing her own compositions; one of her friends passed some of her demos on to composer Will Gregory. Finding much in common in their musical tastes and approaches, the duo took Allison\\'s surname as the name for their collaboration. After signing to Mute in 1999, Goldfrapp delivered their debut album, Felt Mountain, in fall 2000. Felt Mountain went on to nealry universal acclaim and spawned several singles, including the Utopia Genetically Enriched EP, which arrived in early 2001. After spending most of that year touring, Goldfrapp spent most of 2002 recording and returned with Black Cherry in spring 2003. 2005 saw the release of the Ooh La La single and the full-length Supernature, both of which continued the disco and glam-rock influences of the duo\\'s previous album.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiutvs7q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.357483,51.381443]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grace Cathedral Park by Red House Painters","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/p02119q5d93.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/home_leftcol_image.jpg\">1100 California St, San Francisco, CAGrace Cathedral is located on Nob Hill in San Francisco, California.

This energy can be used to do just about anything the wielder can imagine, from blasting a ray of energy like a laser, protecting the user with a force field, allowing them to fly, and even create solid objects.\n\nMost wielders bring their own personality into the projection of their power such as John Stewart an architect whose green creations are extremely detailed to the smallest rivet of a structure. Others, like Kyle Rayner are through the eyes of an artist and are highly creative. In Hal Jordan’s case, his tend to be more forceful and less streamlined, but by no means less powerful. In fact, Hal is considered to be the greatest Green Lantern that has ever wielded a ring.\n\nThe downside to the rings is that they are not unlimited in power. The rings must be recharged up to full power. They do these with a device called, “The Green Lantern”. This is a lantern that is, of course, green and when the wielder puts the ring in the lantern and says,” In brightest day, in darkest night, No evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil\\'s might, BEWARE MY POWER ... Green Lantern\\'s Light! ,“ the ring is restored to full power.\n\nAt the beginning of the Green Lantern comics, the rings were inactive against the color yellow. This was because an entity known as Parallax was imprisoned in the Central Battery. Parallax is a creature that feeds off of fear, and that fear comes across as the color yellow. During the “Green Lantern Rebirth” mini-series, the lanterns learned to overcome this flaw in the rings. In overcoming fear, the color yellow holds no bar to them.\n\nInteresting Fact\nWhen Hal Jordan was removed as the current Green Lantern. A group of fans got together and formed the organization H.E.A.T., which stands for Hal\\'s Emerald Advancement Team.\n\nOrigin\nHal Jordan was a fighter test pilot for the Air Force. That all changed when on one day, he was mysteriously transported to a crashed spaceship. There he met Abin Sur, a Green Lantern. Abin Sur was dying and offered Hal the opportunity to succeed him. Hal Jordan accepted.\n\nWith the ring in his possession, Hal Jordan became the greatest member of the Green Lantern Corps. He became a founding member of the Justice League and has helped save the world countless times.That changed when Hal couldn’t save his hometown, Coast City, and it was destroyed by the villains Mongul and a Cyborg Superman, killing millions. This event shattered Hal and sent him on a dizzying course of destruction.\n\nHal tried to use the power of his ring to bring back Coast City and its citizens. But the Guardians of Oa, the leaders of the Green Lanterns, forbade him to do it. This sent Hal on a mission to get the full power of the ring from the Central Battery on the planet Oa. Hal seemingly went mad, when a parasite creature entered his body and Hal stopped calling himself Green Lantern, and emerged as Parallax.\n\nHis mission to restore Coast City destroyed most of the Green Lanterns and Guardians of Oa. Parallax was set to redo history as he saw it with the full power of the Green Lantern Central Battery, but the heroes of the DC universe stopped him. Alongside those heroes was the last of the Green Lanterns, newly appointed Kyle Rayner, who was given the power ring by Ganthet the last of the Guardians.\n\nIn the end, Hal, as Parallax, sacrificed himself when a giant alien was devouring the sun. Hal used his powers to reignite the sun and in doing so sacrificed his life as well. His spirit went and became one with the Spectre. An avenging spirit of God who righted wrongs and persecuted the guilty. Hal’s penance had begun.\n\nBut this was not Hal’s end. It was discovered that Parallax was an ancient enemy of the Green Lanterns and was imprisoned in the Central Battery for eons. This entity was still with Hal, but with the joined effort of the remaining Green Lanterns, (by this time there was John Stewart, an alien named Kilowog, current GL Kyle Raynerand onetime Lantern Guy Gardner), they reinstated Hal’s spirit into his body and defeated Parallax, sealing him again into the Central Battery, and restoring the Guardians to oversee the Green Lanterns. Hal is now the core Green Lantern of the DC universe.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3odceu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.156389,32.715278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Green Mart","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 400 W.

Progressively becomes difficult with low tree canopies and multiple stream crossings via stepping stones and large branches traversing the water. Be prepared, also, to climb over roots and large rocks.\n\nCaution: The canyon is a thriving habitat that includes mountain lions, snakes and patches of poison oak. Long pants are suggested.\n\nTrailhead: At the end of Trabuco Creek Road, 4.7 miles east of Live Oak Canyon Road in Trabuco Canyon.\n\n Adventurer’s Pass for parking available at the trailhead.\n\nNote: Trabuco Creek Road is a very rough dirt path resembling uncharted moon territory more than a road. Large rocks, potholes and washboard-like dips are common.\n\nWhy we like it: Short hike with a moderate grade through a lush canyon to Holy Jim Falls, a secluded, 17-foot waterfall.\n\nDetails:  The adventure begins as you turn off Live Oak Canyon Road onto Trabuco Creek Road, which doesn’t receive much maintenance. The 4.7 miles to the trailhead may be the longest and bumpiest drive you’ve experienced.\n\nThe road is barely driveable in a small car or other low-lying vehicles; you’ll have to drive very slow. I recommend using a lunar rover for this stretch of road, but an off-road truck or SUV will suffice.\n\nThe 4-wheel adventure ends at a parking lot on your left. Park here and obtain an Adventurer’s Pass at the kiosk.\n\nProceed north on foot up a small hill and into the canyon, where small cabins appear. These cabins sprouted in the late 1800s when beekeepers made a living here.\n\nOne of the beekeepers was James T. Smith, who had a nasty swearing habit. He earned the name \"Cussin’ Jim\" until government cartographers renamed him \"Holy Jim\" – the name of the canyon today.\n\nYou’ll come to a steel gate after .5 miles. The vegetation quickly thickens as you trek deeper into the canyon.\n\nThere are seven stream crossings in the next mile; some are very easy to traverse while others are difficult thanks to large boulders, overhanging tree limbs or loose stepping stones.\n\nNatural canopies create tunnels along the way and the steep canyon walls and trees provide shade.\n\nFollow the sign toward the falls when you meet the Holy Jim Trail after the last stream crossing. The falls await you about 400 yards away.\n\nThis is probably the trickiest part of the hike: trekking very close to the creek bed in the canyon, which is now significantly narrower.\n\nYou can hear Holy Jim Falls just ahead, with water falling into the small pond below. It’s no Niagara Falls, but the tranquility of this hideaway with its riparian habitat enclosed by towering canyon walls is certainly special.\n\nEat a sandwich or take a quick dunk in the chilly pond before heading back.\n\nAlso consider a car wash after driving out of the canyon. Your vehicle will be filthy! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj2xki6u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.585125,33.659389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Homestead Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 8 Cliffwood, Irvine, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiyi3f5e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.783529,33.73257]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hoover Dam","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2a744b2fa6b737f11d37de6b017f03ce.jpg\">Nevada Hwy, Boulder City, NVI\\'m not sure if it\\'s still open for tour after 9/11.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiycezds"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.84619,35.97421]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hope Sandoval (Los Angeles, California)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/hope19.jpg\">Los Angeles, CaliforniaMazzy Star - Halah\n\nVideos:\n<a href=\"http://www.hopesandoval.com/media/Suzanne.mpg\">Suzanne</a> (MPEG / 36Mb)\n\nAfter the breakup of Mazzy Star, vocalist Hope Sandoval joined with Colm O\\'Ciosoig (formerly of My Bloody Valentine) to form Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions.

This is where the California Least Tern, a rare and endangered species of bird, makes its nesting grounds. Although a fence separates the sanctuary from the beach, you can still sneak a peak at these rare birds during the nesting season.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj7vooct"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.988183,33.648306]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hush","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/latedine_hush.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/134375577_ec104a4178.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 858 S Coast Hwy, Laguna Beach, CAHours: Bar menu until 1 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe ambience: Heavy glass doors lead the way to impeccably modern decor inside that feels more L.A. than Laguna Beach.

Often, when he was first with the X-Men, Bobby spent more of his time honing his comedic skills rather than his mutant abilities. At first, Bobby could only cover his body in snow. Early on in the X-Men comic book, he learned how to encase his body in a hard ice shell. Now, Bobby Drake can turn his entire body into living ice.\n\nIn this form, he is nearly indestructible. If he were to shatter or break apart, he can quickly reform himself with the help of a water source, or even using the moisture in the air. It has only been in recent years that he has been able to do this.\n\nIceman can also lower the temperature around him to extreme degrees, can fire ice missiles, and can use water and moisture to form just many different objects such as shields, walls, and an ice slide he uses for transportation. He can also create detailed items like ice sculptures, and other snow items like snowballs. Lately, he has learned how to add mass to his body to increase his size and strength.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men, Ultimate X-Men, X-Factor(1st Series)\nCurrently Seen In:\nVarious X-Men Titles\n\nInteresting Fact: \n\nMany consider Iceman to be one of the most powerful mutants in the world. The problem is that due to Bobby’s poor self image, he holds himself back from his true potential.\n\nOrigin: \n\nRobert “Bobby” Drake was raised by his parents to be a fun-loving and caring son. They lived a quiet life in Long Island, but that soon changed. His mutant powers developed early, and Bobby’s parents had him keep his powers secret to avoid retaliation from the many people who fear and hate mutants.\n\nHe was unable to do so when he was forced to use his powers and show himself as a mutant. A mob formed and Bobby was rescued by Cyclops and Professor X. Bobby joined the X-Men and became the youngest member of the original team.\n\nBobby has always been known as a jokester and is a very loved and enjoyed member of the team. His joking, however, has often been a mask for his poor self image. He even left the X-Men for a short time to pursue a normal life as an accountant, but that was not to be.\n\nLately, Bobby has truly come into his own, expanding his powers and growing as a member of the X-Men. After the recent House of M events, it appeared that Bobby’s days as Iceman were over, as his powers seemed to have disappeared. It came out though, that Bobby had deactivated them subconsciously. Another indicator of what Bobby truly feels about himself. However, he remains a vital part of The X-Men and continues to fight for Xavier’s dream of peace between mutant and human.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxixyw2m4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.94917,40.74472]}},{"properties":{"name":"Imogen Heap (London, United Kingdom)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/41/113960128_57cd1cb148_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/1f489bf5cdc4faa896be34cc8910bc93.jpg\">London, UKFrou Frou - The Dumbing Down of Love\n\nVideos:\n<a href=\"http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/deliverMedia.asp?id=04fcc477-8a7f-4ec4-bed6-181e8bbc7f48&amp;delivery=stream\">Breath In</a> (WMV / stream)\n<a href=\"http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/deliverMedia.asp?id=1c3d979b-471e-4535-81dc-b42456b87d58&amp;delivery=stream\">Must Be Dreaming</a> (WMV / stream)\n<a href=\"http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/deliverMedia.asp?id=4d7007b9-22fa-4930-bdeb-33c366146e8b&amp;delivery=stream\">It\\'s Good To Be In Love</a> (WMV / stream)\n\nPart cool \\'n\\' collected statuesque beauty, part thrilled eight year old, Imogen Heap is struggling to contain her excitement. \"For the last year, I\\'ve had a mission to accomplish,\" says the former Frou Frou lass, kicking her pink stiletto-ed heels with joy. From the pride glowing from the songwriter\\'s grin, it\\'s clear \"Operation Imogen\" has been a resounding success. After twelve months of graft in her studio, the bubbly twenty-seven year-old is finally poised to release the glorious \\'Speak For Yourself\\'\\'. Filled with grace and passion, and loaded with hooks, it\\'s a captivating Bjork meets pop-Squarepusher gem of a record and the thoroughly deserving source of her exhilaration.\n\nFollowing on from her 1998 debut \\'I Megaphone\\' and her 2002 Frou Frou collaboration with Guy Sigsworth, \\'Details\\', this is Heap\\'s second release in her own name. But it is her first truly solo album. Out on Heap\\'s own label, Megaphonic, \\'Speak For Yourself\\' has an almighty cast of just one, but it is a triumph of Oscar-winning proportions. Startling lead single \"Hide And Seek\" is already taking the States by storm. One week after it was played-out in the closing sequence to the season (2) finale of cult drama series \\'The O.C.\\', in a prize slot which last season used Jeff Buckley\\'s heart-rending version of the Leonard Cohen-penned \\'Hallelujah\\', \\'Hide And Seek\\' leapt from No. 98 to No.32 in the Official Billboard Hot 100 Download Chart, making Imogen the No.1 Electronic Act on the chart. Impressively, the track â which was only available on iTunes as oppose to the many music sites which make up the Download Chart â sold 9,700 copies as a download in one week alone, and more impressively, gave Megaphonic the only independently-released track in the entire Hot 100 chart that week.\n\nSitting among the chiffon curtains and butterfly fairy lights of her Bermondsey studio â the very same one in which Dizzee Rascal recorded \\'Showtime\\', though now significantly girlied-up â Heap is the picture of satisfaction. Armed with Pro-Tools, some geeky toys and a room full of instruments ranging from a cello to carpet tubes, she wrote, recorded and produced every glistening note of her remarkable electro-poprecord herself, fulfilling a life-long dream. \"I always wanted to find out what I was capable of,\" she says smiling broadly.\n\n\nIn 2003 Heap parted ways with Island records, who released Frou Frou\\'s \"Details\", though they were keen to put out the next solo album she felt it was \"time for a change of scenery\". Imogen recalls \"I signed my first deal when I was just 17 and I\\'ve been on one label or another since then. I didn\\'t think I\\'d end up releasing it on a label of my very own but once I\\'d finished I didn\\'t want to give it all away again, specially as I\\'d put everything I had into it\".\n\nWorking with Frou Frou partner, Madonna and Britney producer Guy Sigsworth had been \"an apprenticeship in making amazing records,\" says Heap. But Heap was adamant that with her next project, she should get the recognition she deserved. \"It\\'s not Guy\\'s fault, but with Frou Frou, everyone assumed the man did all the production and engineering, mixing and programming and that the girl â me â just sang,\" explains Heap. \"And I have to say that really irritated me. We did everything together. I\\'d been programming on Macs since I was twelve and that was more of a love to me than singing ever was.\" After her break-up with Universal/Island, Heap felt the time had come for change. \"I loved working with Guy,\" she says. \"I\\'d learnt so much from him and all the other various collaborations I\\'d done over the years. Now I was bursting with ideas and just wanted to get my hands really dirty!\"\n\nWriting, recording and owning your own music is a noble aspiration. But as Heap discovered, record labels do have their uses and summoning together vital funds was proving a tad problematic. \"I traipsed my way round every bank but I couldn\\'t get a loan,\" she says. \"I had Â£10,000 on my credit card and I couldn\\'t pay my bills\" but just before despair could stick in its claws, Heap\\'s luck changed. Clocking a \"For Sale\" sign outside her block of flats was, she says, like a little light bulb going on: \"I couldn\\'t help wondering just how much I could sell my flat to myself for.\"\n\nFrom that moment on, it seemed as though Fate was smiling on Heap. The artist set about re-mortgaging her flat and thanks to a sympathetic surveyor (\"I couldn\\'t believe it,\" says Heap, \"but he turned out to be a Frou Frou fan!\") she got exactly the valuation she needed. The value of her humble flat had grown by a hundred grand, and with money to burn, Heap kick-started her year-long mission on her 26 th birthday, December 9, 2003 . \"I had all my new gear delivered as a birthday present to myself,\" remembers Heap, \"then I booked my mastering for December 7 a year later. That was my deadline â I was going to make sure I had my new album done in time to celebrate on my next birthday!\"\n\nThe songwriter set about experimenting. \"I just wanted to see what kinds of sounds were coming out of me,\" she says reliving her excitement. Alone with her new toys, the singer found a voice she didn\\'t know she had. And it was a discovery that was to unexpectedly shape the new album. Halfway through the album she set up an online blog www.imogenheap.com to help keep herself in check. \"Somedays I wouldn\\'t get much done as I didn\\'t have anyone to answer to,\" says Heap, \"so I thought if I wrote a diary on-line people could see if I\\'d been crap in the studio and it would keep me from slacking. If I got really stuck on something, just seeing the problem up there would help me tackle it better and one time I even asked those reading the blog to choose a lyrical direction from a poll I set up on my website!\"\n\nThe soundtrack to Heap\\'s cycle rides between her Waterloo home and her studio may partly explain the cross-pollination of genres that is \\'Speak For Yourself\\'. Pedaling to the glitchy electro-sparks of Avril, Squarepusher and Cursor Minor, to contemporary classical composers Arvo Part and Ryuichi Sakamoto to the pop/punk/rock of Cornelius and the Foo Fighters. And though the album\\'s dominant personality is electronic, Heap says, it\\'s also intrinsically vocally-lead. The lyric-based songs are accompanied by vocal segments, layered over each other and treated just like the pianos, strings, guitars, and harps are. And like all the other live instruments, her voice is tweaked, compressed or put through harmonisers to achieve the perfect sound. \"I write in terms of the voice being a part of the score more than one vocal line hovering over a backing track,\" she explains. \"I\\'m so lucky I\\'ve ended up with such a bizarre voice. It\\'s distinctive enough to hold itself in whatever music I throw at it.\"\n\nHowever the real emphasis here is on the minutiae; the fluctuating dynamics beneath the soaring sounds. Aside from textured incidental noises, like trains rumbling past the tracks outside Heap\\'s studio, breaths, sighs, whispers and intimate vocal quirks make this electronic wonder sound human again. And this warmth compliments the intensely personal nature of Heap\\'s songs.\n\n\\'Speak For Yourself\\' is vulnerable, exposed and flooded with emotion. So what\\'s it all about? Heap pauses for thoughtâ¦\"It\\'s quite tricky writing lyrics for \"love\" songs when you are happy and content with your man,\" she laughs. \"The subject matter can get pretty repetitive, so sometimes I found myself running away with a naughty thought or stealing a friend\\'s situation and eventually the song would turn itself into something all by itself\". And yet Heap\\'s cinematic vignettes are remarkably vivid. Elusive little fantasies or based on real life? For example, epic closer, \"The Moment I Said It\" is a tumultuous scene of badly-broken news; stark electro-a cappella \"Hide And Seek\\' a hymn to disbelief, betrayal and grief awhile \"Goodnight And Go\", which features Heap fan, Jeff Beck on guitars, is a wistful ode to forbidden love.\n\nWith the album done and dusted, Heap can\\'t help but revel in her serendipity. \"Ever since I decided to do this on my own, great things have come my way,\" she says sitting back in her fluffy studio chair. Not withstanding her star-struck surveyor, other factors have also seemingly conspired in her favour. Last year, Scrubs-star Zach Braff personally selected the Frou Frou track \\'Let Go\\' for the soundtrack to his critically acclaimed indie-hit and directorial debut, \\'Garden State\\', helping fuel the Imogen Heap fire. Musical directors across a variety of television outlets have clamoured for her tracks; in addition to \\'The OC\\', \\'CSI\\' and \\'Six Feet Under\\' have also featured her music and LA\\'s influential KCRW station is already spot-playing album tracks. For a couple of months before release \"Speak For Yourself\" has been floating in and around the music business and a few household names have been in touch with Heap since hearing \\'Speak For Yourself\", hoping to book her for knob-twiddling duties. \"I thought I might like to get into producing other artists records one day but it seems one day is already here and I\\'m really enjoying it\".\n\nIt\\'s no surprise Heap emanates a burning self-belief. \\'Speak For Yourself\\' has been a test of her abilities; a test she\\'s passed with glowing colours: \"In the past there were times when I wished I had been listened to,\" she says, \"but I\\'ve never really known if I was right. This time, from the start I\\'ve done things my way.\" Part cool \\'n\\' collected statuesque beauty, part thrilled eight year old, Imogen Heap is struggling to contain her excitement. \"I feel nothing can stop me,\" she says through a huge grin. \"This is just the beginning and I can\\'t sit still with excitement to see how things are going to pan out.\" \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxizfm63s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"Imperial Beach Pier","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/133865454_a3b4025e59.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/89981454_a766663455.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Seacoast Dr. and Evergreen Ave, Imperial Beach, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxjaupldk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.137218,32.579564]}},{"properties":{"name":"Inca's Fine Peruvian Cuisine","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/12432024_4ab9643753_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/190597710_31dcf51280.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 16277 Laguna Cyn Rd A, Irving, CAInca\\'s (949) 753-1276\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiwox2xa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.7405,33.6664]}},{"properties":{"name":"India Cook House","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/indiancookhouse.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 14130 Culver Dr., Irvine, CA, 92620Recommended: The garlic naan, and roti and mango lassi drink.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxixk2ua3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.784067,33.708061]}},{"properties":{"name":"Infusion Gallery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://www.infusiongallery.com/images/logo_300w.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 828 South Main Street, Los Angeles, CA 90014<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj9zvjlj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.253629,34.042278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Inkwells Paperie","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/shop_cdm2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 3411 E.

It grew out of the 185 square mile (479 km²) ranch founded by James Irvine I and two other partners in 1864 from Mexican and Spanish land grants. The ranch covers a fifth of Orange County and spans from the Pacific Ocean from Newport Bay to Laguna Beach up to Santa Ana Canyon and the boundary of the Cleveland National Forest. The first parcel of land to be purchased by Irvine, Flint and Bixby was the Rancho San Joaquin, which constitutes the coastal half of the present-day ranch. It was purchased from the Mexican aristocrat Jose Antonio Sepulveda shortly after California entered the United States. Sepulveda had to foreclose his ranch due to a terrible drought that killed all his prized livestock. The second half to be purchased was the Rancho Lomas de Santiago, which was largely unfarmable due to its steep, hilly terrain. It was being used largely as a sheep ranch by the Santa Ana-based agricultural entrepreneur William Wolfskill.\n\nToday, the company is known in Orange County as the developer of master-planned communities throughout Central and Southern Orange County. A partial list of cities within the boundaries of the Irvine Ranch:\n\nIrvine, California\nTustin, California \nNewport Beach, California \nNewport Coast, California \n\nThe communities are marked with a suburban feel and attract relatively affluent residents. Despite the large population of the cities, public transportation remains undeveloped, with most residents choosing to drive private cars and commuting.\n\nThe Irvine Company owns a large number of popular commercial areas such as the Irvine Spectrum Center and Fashion Island which is surrounded by Newport Center.\n\nThe company donated a part of its ranch near Newport Beach to the University of California for construction of a new UC campus. The university named the new campus UC Irvine after the company, and the city of Irvine, officially incorporated in 1971, grew around it.\n\nThe company is currently led by chairman Donald Bren.\n\n-wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj77rpvv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.872151,33.616326]}},{"properties":{"name":"Irvine Farmer's Market","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/marketinIrvine.jpg\"><img src=\"http://nada.ics.uci.edu/annie/photos/farmersmarket-anniehaggling1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Campus Dr, IrvineFarmer\\'s market I go to is at the University Center on the corner of Bridge and Campus (across from UCI).

Musician/songwriter Adam Schlesinger answered Chase, for the two had mutual musical tastes -- both liked Prefab Sprout and the Go-Betweens. Within months, the two met Parisian-born Dominique Durand. Durand had come to New York in 1989 to learn English, not join a band. Ironically enough, Durand was a massive music fan and adored the sounds of the Smiths, the Pastels, and House of Love. This allowed her to click with Chase and Schlesinger. She\\'d never sung before, but Chase and Schlesinger encouraged her to sing on the demo for \"Can\\'t Even Fake It.\" It was a pleasant surprise -- Durand had found her voice -- one that would become one of indie rock\\'s finest and most artistically well-regarded voices of the decade -- and Ivy was born.\n\nIvy inked a deal with local label Seed Records in 1994 and issued the \"Get Enough/Drag You Down\" single. Melody Maker in the U.K. jumped on it immediately and Ivy\\'s debut earned props as the Single of the Week. Several months later, the trio released the Lately EP. Their rendition of Orange Juice\\'s \"I Guess I\\'m Just a Little Too Sensitive\" was a moderate hit among the indie rock circuit. Ex-Orange Juice frontman Edwyn Collins also enjoyed the track and asked Ivy to be the opening act on his North American tour in 1995. Ivy\\'s first studio full-length, Realistic, appeared that same year. Tours with fellow indie darlings -- Saint Etienne, Lloyd Cole, and Madder Rose -- allowed Ivy\\'s name began to soar.\n\nBy the time the band readied for a sophomore effort, they\\'d signed to a major label. In 1997, Ivy issued Apartment Life on Atlantic. This particular album highlighted Chase and Schlesinger\\'s impressive studio skills. Ivy was winning critics over with their sugary, sweet sound and Apartment Life was regarded as one of the year\\'s standout albums. Their star power was unstoppable, but gracefully so. \"I Get the Message\" and \"This Is the Day\" were featured on the soundtrack to the Farrelly Brothers\\' comedy There\\'s Something About Mary. Their cover of Steely Dan\\'s \"Only a Fool Would Say That\" was also included in the Farrelly Brothers\\' soundtrack for Me, Myself and Irene. Fashionistas got a taste of Ivy, too. A worldwide Volkswagen campaign catapulted the band\\'s name into stardom. Ivy never lost face, though. What made them so impressive was how they kept things simple and followed their own formula. It would work against them in the majors, but it wouldn\\'t break up the band.\n\nIvy founded Stratosphere Sound, their studio with Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, before the \\'90s came to a close. Chase and Durand had also married; Ivy was focused on the band\\'s musical atmosphere and the texture of their sound, and this space allowed them to focus. Sony let them go, so they had complete creative control. Unfortunately, things didn\\'t go so smoothly. Stratosphere Sound was subject to arson while the band was recording a third album in 2000. Countless dollars and valuable recording equipment were lost in the fire, but this didn\\'t delay the completion of the record. Long Distance arrived in fall 2001, four years after Apartment Life. This marked Ivy\\'s first release with Nettwerk and the trio\\'s classic pop sensibility was at its finest. Durand and Chase became parents of daughter, Justine, while also finding a new home with the Nettwerk label. That same year, the band composed the film score for the Farrelly Brothers\\' Jack Black comedy Shallow Hal. In fall 2002, Ivy returned with an all-cover album, Guestroom. On December 17, Chase and Durand welcomed their second child, Julien. Over the next few years, Schlesinger released another album with Fountains of Wayne, 2003\\'s Welcome Interstate Managers. Durand and Chase collaborated on a trip-hop album in 2004 under the Paco moniker. A year later, Ivy issued In the Clear.\n\n- allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiz3qztm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ivy Day Spa","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/where_the_latest_gossip_takes_place.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> 1100 S.

Jacques Torres, the artist/chef, was on his way.\n\nIn 1980, on a bet with a friend, Jacques approached the Michelin two-star chef Jacques Maximin at the Hotel Negresco and asked for a job. Maximin gave him an hour to return with a chef\\'s coat. An eight-year association with the Negresco began which took him around the globe. At the Negresco, he refined the skills and nurtured an intuitive sense of confectionary artistry, which has been the cornerstone of his career.\n\nFrom 1980-83, Jacques studied for the degree of Master Pastry Chef after which he taught at a local culinary school in Cannes. During this time, he honed his skills and, in 1986, was awarded the prestigious Meilleur Ouvrier de France medal, the youngest chef to earn the distinction.\n\nThe list of culinary awards and achievements grew from there including the 1986 French Championship of Desserts and a gold medal from the Japanese Pastry Chef Association. Jacques served as a consultant to Cointreau and Valrhona chocolate, participated in the rededication ceremonies of the Statue of Liberty with Presidents Mitterand and Reagan and spent culinary weeks in Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne and Spain. In 1988, Chef Torres moved to the United States where he opened The Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage. Soon thereafter, Sirio Maccioni invited him to join Le Cirque where he would oversee an impressive custom-built pastry kitchen. At Le Cirque, Jacques\\' creations delighted guests from around the world including presidents, kings and celebrities.\n\nIn addition to his role as chocolatier and business owner, Jacques serves as Dean of Pastry Studies at New York\\'s French Culinary Institute. He has also opened his kitchen to aspiring students and generously donated his time to many national charities including Meals on Wheels, the American Red Cross and God\\'s Love We Deliver. Chef Torres has participated in Julia Child\\'s Master Chef television series, Pierre Franey\\'s Birthday Celebrations and \"Merci Julia\", a salute by the world\\'s top culinary professionals to Julia Child. In recent years, he has been named the James Beard Pastry Chef of the Year, the Chef\\'s of America Pastry Chef of the Year and one of Chocolatier Magazine\\'s 10 Best Pastry Chefs. His shows on the Food Network and his two cookbooks have been great commercial successes, testaments to his never waning popularity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxja5ffme"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.95,40.65]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jamboree Exit (I-405)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/143045867_c18d481e7a.jpg\">A regular sight of my commute when exiting on Jamboree.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiydjde3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.845042,33.675961]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jamillah Garden","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/100685081_135.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/jamillah03.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/jamillah04.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2512 Walnut Ave, Tustin, CAIslamic Chinese cooking is a rarity in Southern California, eclipsed by  combo plates, fried rice and a nice side of MSG. But there it is in Tustin: Jamillah Garden, an expansive, always-crowded oasis where customers speak Arabic as often as Chinese, where bread is king. Inside, photos of Mecca and bamboo paintings recall a time when 7th-century Arab traders obsessed with meat (but terrified of pork) brought the rigid-but-refreshing halal guidelines to the Chinese anything’s-edible, noodles-and-rice worldview. Chinese converts to Islam went on to concoct a culinary truce famous across Asia—hearty, greasy but nuanced grub that seems like the product of a single continent before continental drift, a time when maybe the deserts of Arabia baked beneath China’s Tien Shan Mountains. And then everything was covered in soy sauce.\n\nA Jamillah Garden meal starts as it does in most Chinese restaurants—complimentary green tea, egg flower soup, and egg rolls sparkling with freshness. The service can be a bit forgetful, but forgive: Jamillah Garden runs in an industrial park, and nearby businesses provide a constant stream of customers throughout the day, all of whom try the patience of the restaurant’s waiters while deciding which of the 200-plus items they’ll order. Servers will brusquely recommend that you join everyone else in beginning the feast with a cold appetizer per the customs of Islamic Chinese cuisine. The chilly aperitifs cleanse the palate for the fiery entrées but are also delightful on their own. Eating a small bowl of beef tendon—like Jell-O in consistency and shrieking with garlic—is like slurping down frosty vermicelli noodles. Spicy beef is almost never on the menu, but it’s worth asking for—served in tender slices, as cold as a Big Stick, and spicy enough to incinerate an Aztec. Hot sauce turns the chewy bits of honeycomb tripe a pale red; the results are the best use of offal outside of menudo.\n\nThere are some vegetarian choices. One noteworthy offering subsumes half an eggplant in a soy-derived brown sauce that would make a French cook envious. But Jamillah Garden and its patrons come mostly for the meat. Lamb is prepared in about 15 different styles, from a spicy Hunan-style stir-fry (that becomes butter in your mouth and might be the greatest meat dish from China since won ton soup) to a hot pot as big as a beach pail steaming with salty broth and pungent, soft mutton. Sliced curry chicken seems to have come by way of an Indian restaurant on its way to the wok, a giant mass of bird tinted yellow with a thin but walloping curry. The braised shrimp’s tangerine-and-lemon tones, meanwhile, would easily be the next sweet-and-sour chicken of fast food Chinese joints if it didn’t involve such an elaborate cooking process. Any meat dish should be accompanied by hand-pulled wheat noodles, thick as your belt and almost as long; Jamillah presents the noodles in portions that guarantee leftovers for your next six meals.\n\nPlease don’t overlook the sesame bread. \"It takes 15 minutes to make,\" the waitress will warn you. But it’ll be worth the quarter hour. It’s a sesame-speckled loaf about the size of a manhole, two inches thick and as toasty as a pizza; regulars stuff meat, rice, noodles, everything into the layers inside the bread. The many slivers of green onion give the bread a verdant, sharp taste, and after nibbling on a slice, you’ll never want to eat anything else again.\n\n-Orange County Weekly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiydvgdw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.808791,33.717457]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jasmine Blue Flowers Plants","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/jasmineblue_2_.jpg\">13826 Ventura Blvd, Sherman Oaks, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiy2oqde"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.434288,34.148388]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jean C by Pipas","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/pipas1.jpg\">5 Leicester Place, London, WC2H 7BX, United Kingdom\"Meet me at the Jean Cocteau on Leicester Square\" refers to the church of Notre Dame de France, which is located on the northeast corner in Leicester Place, with a wonderful mural by Jean Cocteau in one of its side chapels.\n\n\nand all my best friends\\' bicycles were stolen the other night\nand all the tickets you couldn\\'t sell you had to burn them into their light\nand it was all my fault all the good things and the bad\nand all the ropes that could have fallen\nin front of your arms\n\nmeet me at the meet me at the\nget rid of them get rid of them\nmeet me at the meet me at the\nget rid of them get rid of them\nmeet me at the meet me at the\n\nmeet me at the Jean Cocteau on leicester square\ndid you know it was there I fell in love with you\nin the wooden shade where it comes from again I tried not to borrow\nmeet me at the Jean Cocteau oh I fell in love\n\nand all the times you were counting\nthe raindrops were falling on me\nI couldn\\'t even look back to remember how many it had been\nit was one of those nights when I couldn\\'t really justify my resentment\n\nmeet me at the meet me at the\n\nmeet me at the Jean Cocteau on leicester square did you know it was there I \nfell in love with you\nin the wooden shade where it comes from a can I can\\'t be there tomorrow\n\nmeet me at the Jean Cocteau\nI fell in Love <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj48q718"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.130033,51.511287]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jean Grey, New York City","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/Jean_Grey.jpg\">New York CityReal Name: Jean Grey\n\nFirst Appearance: The Uncanny X-Men #1 (1963)\n\nCreated By: Stan Lee and Jack Kirby\n\nPowers: \nJean Grey is a powerful picnic with the powers of telepathy and telekinesis. In her earlier years, she could only lift as much with her mind as she could lift physically, but she would blossom to become a key member of the X-Men with the development of her powers. She could lift great amounts of weight, project telekinetic Shields to protect her and her friends, and also influence other\\'s minds.\n\nLater, with the arrival of the Phoenix, Jean\\'s powers would increase dramatically. At first, the Phoenix took the form of Jean Grey and absorbed part of her personality, while the real Jean Grey was in suspended animation. After the Phoenix was destroyed, it appeared to, \"rebirth,\" itself into Jean Grey.\n\nAs the Phoenix, Jean\\'s powers are greatly amplified. She can fly, even in space, and even sense and change things at a molecular level. Even though it appears that Jean has died many times, she always seems to rise again as the Phoenix. The unfortunate side effect is that the Phoenix is very unstable and only until recently has Jean been able to fully control the Phoenix.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men, Ultimate X-Men\nCurrently Seen In:\nVarious X-Men Titles\n\nInteresting Fact: \nJean Grey was the first student of Professor Charles Xavier.\n\nOrigin: \nJean Grey first discovered her abilities when she saw a childhood friend die in a car crash. Jean linked telepathically with her friend as she died and the shock sent her into a coma. For years, her family tried to find a way to help her and it was only until Professor Charles Xavier blocked her mutant powers was she able to awaken.\n\nIt seemed her body and mind was unable to compensate with her newborn telepathic powers. Xavier helped to allow Jean to develop at a natural rate and met with her to help her develop and control her powers. She later joined Xavier\\'s Institute and became the first female member of The X-Men.\n\nHer fate was ultimately changed forever by the Phoenix force, made up of the sum of all life force in the universe. The Phoenix has merged with Jean Grey, giving her extraordinary abilities, far beyond that of any human or mutant. Even though the Phoenix has been destroyed, like the fable of history, it rises again and again. The two seem to be linked on a level far above host and parasite. As Jean has said herself, \"I\\'m always Jean and I\\'m always Phoenix.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj68ri17"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Vong","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/vongerichten.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> New York<b>Restaurants:</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/99791\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/07/1/106966322_135w128h128.jpg\" alt=\"Vong\" height=\"77\"></a>\n\nInternationally reputed for his innovative, groundbreaking cuisine, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has emerged as one of the country\\'s leading chefs. Acclaimed by critics as \\'formidably gifted,\\' a \\'residential genius\\' and the \\'enfant terrible of modern French cooking\\', his culinary vision has consistently set new standards and helped define today\\'s generation of cooking.\n\nIn 1986, Jean-Georges Vongerichten burst onto the New York dining scene at the Lafayette in the Drake Swissotel, dazzling diners with his innovative interpretation of classic French cuisine and earning four stars from The New York Times at the age of 29. In the first of many bold moves that has established him as a culinary trendsetter, Jean-Georges traded in this formal 4-star dining room for paper-clothed tables and opened his charming bistro Jo Jo in 1991.\n\nAt Jo Jo, he introduced us to his \\'vibrant and spare cuisine\\' whose intense flavors and satisfying textures he created by eschewing traditional meat stocks for vegetables juices and fruit essences, light broths and herbal vinaigrettes. Jo Jo was named Best New Restaurant of the Year by John Mariani in Esquire and earned three-stars from The New York Times, which summed up his contemporary French cuisine in the sentence \"His food took my breath away.\"\n\nJean-Georges\\' next venture, Vong, paid homage to the spices and flavors of the East, a passion he developed during the three and a half years he lived and worked in the Orient. Using over 150 different herbs and spices to create his unique take on Thai- inspired French cuisine, the menu at Vong wowed both critics and patrons, earning yet another three-star review from The New York Times for his \"explosively flavorful food.\" In an adjacent space to Vong, Vongerichten also opened The Lipstick Cafe, a stylish cafe that caters to the midtown business crowd and serves breakfast and lunch in a casual, upscale setting.\n\nA year and a half later in November of 1995, Vongerichten opened a second Vong in the Knightsbridge area of London, earning a three star review and the 1996 vote for the London Evening Standard\\'s Newcomer of the Year. In September 1997, he opened Vong in The Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong, where he has already received accolades from local media. A fourth Vong opened in April 1999 in Chicago.\n\nIn March of 1997 Jean-Georges opened restaurant Jean Georges in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, earning a 4-star review from The New York Times less than three months after opening; he was also awarded the coveted Chef of the Year award from John Mariani at Esquire magazine and the Best New Restaurant award by the James Beard Foundation.\n\nHis most recent New York City project (July 1998), The Mercer Kitchen at the stylish Mercer Hotel in SoHo, features an American-Provencal menu and Ecommunal style tables in the open kitchen area where hotel guests and diners may choose to eat, converse and watch the kitchen\\'s activities.

Wales is renowned for its magnificent coastline, for its patriotic rugby, and for bringing the world such talented performers as Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, and Jem, of course! From the age of thirteen she was singing and writing songs, basic recording equipment was ever-present and she decided that one day she would be a singer. Keeping her dreams of this future career mostly to herself however, after finishing school she headed to Sussex University.\n\nWhilst in Brighton, Jem\\'s great passion for music drew her into the music industry, but at this point it was the behind-the-scenes side that attracted her. She hurled her energies into club and festival promotion, became a DJ agent and finally helped set-up and run the specialist breaks label \\'Marine Parade\\'. After a time however, it became clear something was missing. She realized that she\\'d been circling her own artistic instincts and it was time to take a leap of faith. But that great leap forward first required a small step back.\n\nIn November of 1999 Jem surprised her colleagues by leaving everything behind and retreating to the creatively inspired air of Wales and a lifestyle of sofa surfing. Moving from the limits of her dictaphone, she assembled a mobile studio and got cracking on her songwriting and music production craft. This turned out to be a fruitful time. She completed a strong collection of 4 demos and things began to move quickly from there.\n\nJem moved to London where she continued her nomadic existence and started collaborating with other writers/producers. Two days into her first writing session with acclaimed electronic producer Guy Sigsworth (Bjork, Frou Frou), the song \\'Nothing Fails\\' was born. This collaboration between Guy, Jem and subsequently Madonna, appears as track 6 on Madonna\\'s \\'American Life\\' album. Her love of beats and bass also lead her to Brooklyn where she teamed up with NY hip-hop producer Ge-ology (Mos Def, Talib Kweli) and in autumn 2002 she met her now co-producer Yoad Nevo. Together they have succeeded in fusing her many musical influences to create a fresh and distinctive new sound. Jem\\'s music is a combination of bright melodies, soul searching lyrics and diverse rhythms that grab you from the first listen. Her seemingly innocent lyrics contain those closely observed details that are as much about optimism as they are about discovery.\n\nThe aptly titled song \\'Finally Woken\\' found its way to influential Los Angeles radio station KCRW 89.9 FM. Music Director Nic Harcourt began spinning Jem\\'s demo on the nationally acclaimed program \"Morning Becomes Eclectic\" and it created a proper stir. \"As soon as I heard the demo from this Welsh songstress I had no choice but to put her on our playlist,\" said Nic Harcourt, and the beautiful \\'Finally Woken\\' first made its way across our airwaves in March 2002 and \\'Flying High\\' has become one of my favorites.\" With each play causing an assault on the station\\'s telephones, her demo tracks quickly made her one of the most listener-requested artists at the station and landed her in their coveted top 5 played artists, and all prior to any record label being attached.\n\nAs fate would have it, A&amp;R Bruce Flohr was one of those listeners and he wooed her to sign onto Dave Matthews\\' ATO record label, which has enjoyed successes with David Gray, My Morning Jacket and Ben Kweller. Jem\\'s EP \\'It All Starts Here...\\' was released by ATO Records in Autumn 2003 and her full-length debut CD \\'Finally Woken\\' followed in March 2004. After a long and winding road to becoming a full-fledged and working artist, Jem has finally woken, indeed.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxizm4qep"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jody Adams, Rialto Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/jody3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Somerville, Massachusetts<b>Restaurants:</b> \n<a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/65032\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/04/2/partyw128h128.jpg\" alt=\"Rialto NYC\" height=\"77\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.platial.com/place/66068\"><img src=\"http://www.platial.com/img/2006/04/2/default_photow128h128.jpg\" alt=\"blue restaurant\" height=\"77\"></a>\n\nJody Adams\\' passion for food began at her family\\'s dinner table. Her mother relied on traditional New England staples during the holidays, such as standing rib roast with Yorkshire pudding at Christmas and baked salmon with peas on the Fourth of July. But, for other special celebrations her mother would make soufflés, curries, gnocchi or a favorite dish from Elizabeth David, like Daube of Beef with Oil-Cured Olives. When Jody\\'s father took the entire family to England for a sabbatical year, Mrs. Adams made a point of locating and visiting local markets for new and unusual ingredients. \"If she came across a batch of fresh, wild mushrooms, then that\\'s what we\\'d have for dinner,\" recalls Jody. \n\nJody inherited her mother\\'s fondness for cooking, but it wasn\\'t until she was a college student at Brown University that her interest in food took a professional turn. \"I had a part-time job with Nancy Verde Barr, a professional food writer and teacher. After a while, I learned I was much happier in Nancy\\'s kitchen learning French and Italian cooking techniques than I was in anthropology class.\" Jody became Nancy\\'s apprentice and, eventually, her class assistant. She also helped Nancy test the recipes for her book on Italian immigrant cooking, We Called It Macaroni (Knopf, 1991). \n\nJody\\'s culinary career in Boston began in 1983 at Seasons restaurant under Chef Lydia Shire. Three years later, at Hamersley\\'s Bistro, she became Gordon Hamersley\\'s Sous Chef. She moved to Michela\\'s in 1990, and was executive chef there until 1994. While at Michela\\'s, Jody reputation grew for her carefully researched regional menus that combined New England ingredients with Italian culinary traditions. \"I have an enormous amount of respect for local cooking traditions. Regional cuisine has had time on its side - it\\'s taken centuries to figure out how to make the best of what\\'s available nearby. Technique, on its own, doesn\\'t count for much. A new technique or personal interpretation only becomes part of the tradition when it enhances the taste of the dish\\'s ingredients.\" In September 1994, Adams opened Rialto with restaurateur and partners Michela Larson and Karen Haskell. The new restaurant allowed Jody the freedom to expand her culinary expertise. Four months after the new restaurant\\'s opening, the Boston Globe awarded Rialto four stars, the newspaper\\'s highest rating, proclaiming that, \"eating Jody Adams\\' food at the stunning new Rialto is like stepping into a winter greenhouse just at the moment a spectacular hothouse orchid bursts into bloom, filling the senses\" \n\nJody opened her latest venture, blu, in November of 2001 with Larson, Haskell and Gary Sullivan - all partners in The Sapphire Restaurant Group. Located in The Sports Club/LA in downtown Boston, blu is set 100 feet in the air, looks down on a brilliant urban street scene and up to a beautiful expanse of Boston sky. The restaurant serves sophisticated American classics based on traditional European cuisine. \n\nIn addition to opening another restaurant, Adams recently published her first cookbook, titled In the Hands of a Chef: Cooking with Jody Adams of Rialto Restaurant (HarperCollinsPublishers; January 2002). She co-wrote the book with her husband, Ken Rivard. It is a collection of recipes that she describes as \"artisanal home food,\" which follows her passions and palate as she cooks for family and friends. \n\nOf her success, Jody says, \"If you\\'re going to work in the restaurant business, you have to love it. The stress is high, the hours are long and the pay is nominal. The reward is in the culture. It\\'s full of interesting, creative people who excel in the art of performance and making people happy. I can\\'t imagine doing anything else.\" \n\nJody Adams resides in Somerville, Massachusetts with her husband Ken Rivard and their two children, Oliver and Roxanne. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiydpqsg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1,42.3875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Joe's Italian Ice","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/JoesSmall.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 12302 Harbor Blvd, Garden Grove, CAFor years, Philadelphia residents have flocked to Joe\\'s Italian Ice in midst of summer heat waves, and in 2002, a Joe\\'s opened in Garden Grove at a place that looks like it used to be a taco stand.

Perhaps it’s the smelling, tasting and living with perfection that has influenced her cooking today. Or, perhaps it was training at Chez Panisse, or cooking in France, Italy or Thailand. But, most likely, her signature style reflects her own desire for perfection. She believes in purity of the food. French food is French Food, not French mixed with Italian or Thai. She’s said to make the perfect roasted chicken. After graduating from Stanford with an art degree, Rodgers went straight to work at Chez Panisse, cooked and traveled around the world, then in 1987 became a partner in Zuni Café.

However, his strength in his current weakened state has been likened to roughly the same as the X-Man Colossus.\n\nThe Juggernaut\\'s body is completely invulnerable. His skin cannot be broken and he is incapable of feeling pain or sustaining any form of injury from any conventional physical attack,regardless of the amount of force or energy exerted against him. He can however be jarred or dazed and has some susceptibility to sensory attacks though he is affected considerably less than a normal human being and will recover completely almost as soon as the attack is over. The Juggernaut can generate at will a personal forcefield around himself extending to about 1 foot from his body. This forcefield appears to be completely impenetrable to any level of concussive force or any form of energy blasts regardless of their intensity. The Juggernaut is resistant to all toxins,poisons,gases and disease. He is self-contained by his magic and does not need to eat,drink,breathe,and cannot tire or become exhausted. The Juggernaut possesses untold power which enhances his strength to an as yet unknown degree and makes him a seemingly irresistible,unstoppable being. Once he begins to walk in a certain direction,no obstacle or natural force on Earth has been observed to be able to stop him. Apparently only he can stop himself. Some obstacles(many tons of rocks,for example) or forces(such as plasma-discharge cannons) may slow his pace considerably,but nothing purely physical has yet stopped him permanently from advancing.\n\nJuggernaut Equipment\n\nThe Juggernaut wears a helmet fashioned from an unknown mystical metal found in the dimension of Cyttorak that protects him from all forms of psionic attack. After several occasions where his helmet had been removed, Juggernaut made a skullcap of the same material.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3qe28x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.271667,37.871667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Julian's Pie Company","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/2024720_The_Julian_PIe_Company_Julian.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2225 Main St., Julian, CA 92036 You can get apple pie (and several other kinds) here all year round, but in October, this place is a madhouse.

Six of the 11 songs are sung in English; the rest, including the graceful yet urgent album opener \"Que n\\'ai-je?\" (\"What Don\\'t I Have?\"), in French. Recorded in Paris and New York, the CD, both beautiful and mysterious, pays homage to New York, her adopted home where she spent much of last year.\n\n2004 was a pivotal year for Keren Ann, whose full name is Keren Ann Zeidel and is the daughter of a Javanese-Dutch mother and a Russian-Israeli father. In the late summer, she made her U.S. debut with the release of Not Going Anywhere (the English-language CD was her first album to be released overseas, the first two comprising originals sung in French). Self-described as her \"very soft folk record,\" it made an immediate impact with critics and fans. The New Yorker noted: \"Not Going Anywhere is well and truly written-a generosity at a time when technology makes it easy to release an album that is more wish than actâ¦Like a series of epigrams, the music has a masterly brevityâ¦The singing is quiet but drives the arrangements. It\\'s the work of someone who has learned what she\\'s good at.\"\n\nPrior to its release, Keren Ann created a buzz in New York with an extended residency, beginning in May, at the Lower East Side boutique club The Living Room and showcases at Joe\\'s Pub, where she unveiled her songs described by scribes as \"luminous,\" \"precise, not wispy\" and \"captivating.\" Her whisper-like voice was characterized as \"refreshingly unadorned, lacking any studied vibrato or artsy phrasing\" and full of \"serene mystery and subtle melancholy: cool but never detached.\"\n\nConcurrently Keren Ann was already working on Nolita. Earlier in the year, she spent February and March in the city. She returned to Paris and in her studio recorded pre-productions for each tune-guitar, drums, bass and some vocals. \"But I had to get back to New York to fully record the songs,\" she says. \"I had to get back to that atmosphere.\"\n\nSo, with her residency on the horizon, Keren Ann set up shop in the lower Manhattan neighborhood of Nolita (North of Little Italy), renting a studio and loft. \"When I record, I need to feel a familiarity with the space,\" she says. \"So I hung some of my things on the wall and recreated a home space for myself. I like the idea of having a calm, quiet room to work on my music while knowing that outside there\\'s noise and a lot happening. It\\'s reassuring to know the \"everyday\" continues even though inside the studio you feel so disconnected from it.\"\n\nA few weeks into her residency, Keren Ann injured her hand, tearing ligaments in her thumb that required her to wear a cast. Initially she felt dismayed by the prospect of delaying the recording. \"But a friend told me, \\'It\\'s not a big deal; it\\'s just a change of plans,\\'\" she says. \"So I went out and bought keyboards and programming equipment that I probably wouldn\\'t have used if I hadn\\'t injured my hand. Naturally, I\\'d just play my guitars.\" While the original guitar parts remain, they are embellished with layers of colors and textures as well as cello, violin, guitar and trumpet parts contributed by new acquaintances on the New York scene. Keren Ann cites two examples: electric guitarist Jack Pettruzzelli on the longing \"One Day Without\" and jazz trumpeter Avishai Cohen on the quietly fingerpicked beauty \"L\\'onde amÃ¨re\" (\"Bitter Wave\").\n\nWhen asked about the melancholic vein in her music, Keren Ann hastens to note that it\\'s not necessarily sadness. \"I don\\'t think the two have a direct relationship,\" she says, emphasizing instead a reflective sensibility. \"When I think of melancholy, I\\'m thinking of vocalists like Caetano Veloso, Chet Baker, Billie Holiday. It\\'s there with rock artists too, like Tom Waits, Blur, Velvet Underground. It\\'s true, I\\'m doing melancholic music, but it\\'s not down.\"\n\nKeren Ann says that Nolita thematically returns to the feel of one of her earlier albums, 2002\\'s La Disparition (The Disappearance): \"The themes come back,\" she says. \"I guess I get obsessed with certain things like absence, lust, longing. They come back through different stories and different characters. But I also like how it stays mysterious.\"\n\nNolita opens with \"Que n\\'ai-je,\" a tune about a woman who is being stalked, according to Keren Ann, \"either by someone she loved in the past or by who she herself was 20 years ago. The song is about that fantasy where people want to erase all the evidence of their existence.\"\n\nThe English-language numbers include the slow-smoldering \"Chelsea Burns\" with a country tinge (violin, mandolin and harmonica); the haunting title track about suffocation and burial; the optimistic pop melody \"Roses &amp; Hips,\" with its sweet sense of longing; the dreamy and indelible \"For You and I,\" a collaboration with longtime writing partner Bardi Johansson (of Icelandic pop band Bang Gang, and Keren Ann\\'s side project band \"Lady &amp; Bird\"); and the fascinating end piece, \"Song Of Alice,\" where actor/film director Sean Gullette gives a dramatic narration of a Keren Ann story about a disturbed resident of 23rd Street in Chelsea.\n\nThe tunes on Nolita add up to another remarkable outing for Keren Ann, still a Parisian and now also a New Yorker. \"I like to capture moments,\" she says. \"It\\'s like a photograph. Ten years from now you look at the photograph and you don\\'t remember it but rather the whole week or month around the photo. That\\'s what this record is like. Thirty years from now, I\\'ll look back at Nolita and remember that it came from the atmosphere I was longing for in New York.\"\n\n-EMI Music\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3co2zb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.339999,48.86]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kid Robot","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://edshepp.blogspot.com\" href=\"http://edshepp.blogspot.com\">Edshepp</a><img src=\"http://www.kidrobot.com/images/nycstore-sm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 126 Prince St., New York, NY 10012Store that sells cool Japanesish figurines and stuff<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiykqc8f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.000038,40.725201]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kill Bill fight scene, Mario style","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/2.jpg\">San Mateo, CAI don\\'t know who the author is, so I\\'m mapping it to uTube HQ. \r\n\r\nBefore you decide whether to watch the video below, picture the combination of a Kill Bill fight scene with the sound effects from Super Mario Bros.

The sleepy market is pungent with the aroma of curry, turmeric, fenugreek and cardamom, all draping around you like six yards of a sari.\n\nLaxmi has been around for 16 years and exists as a small temple of cluttered, unmanicured hominess stocked with English teas, sacks of jasmine rice, frozen meals of curry and a thriving selection of Indian movies and CDs.\n\nPass all this by and walk to the back where a short buffet is ready every day around 11 a.m. The lamb curry is tender, vegetable meatballs sit in a creamy yellow gravy, rolled chickpea crackers are wonderful snacks. Maybe the lentil soup is too watery, but the naan, charred in spots, is never insipid.\n\nThere are battered and fried potatoes that are perfectly creamy inside. And the pakoras, lentil fritters, are smooth and spicy.\n\nAll this requires a sweet ending. The rice pudding is milky and flavored with cinnamon and cardamom and fat raisins. The gulab jamun are deep-fried dumplings tasting vaguely of sweetened condensed milk soaking in simple syrup. You can also fill up on plain lassi or mango lassi, both are thick, creamy slushies made from yogurt.\n\nThere\\'s also a vast menu of Indian specialties, including parathas (stuffed pan-roasted wheat breads), outstanding biryanis (a pile of saffron-yellow rice flecked with spices and mixed with tender lamb or chicken), and vegetarian dishes such as baingan bharta (lucious eggplant simmered with onions and cinnamon) and aloo-poori (spicy potatoes served with deep-fried whole wheat bread).\n\nYou\\'ll be shocked by the length of dosas - they\\'ll seem like baseball bats. The large, diaphanous crepe is rolled around a filling of spicy potato and served with two sauces, one is made of coconut, the other tart and bright red from tomato. On the same plate is a dark pickle that\\'s as assaulting as anything you\\'ve evertasted.\n\nThe tika masala is one of a few dishes where spices take a back seat to a sweet, creamy gravy. It\\'s excellent with either lamb or chicken.\n\nSomeone in the kitchen here is making this soul food with imprecision, and yet, it\\'ll sink permanently into your psyche.\n\n-ocregister<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj544k7f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.823544,33.739661]}},{"properties":{"name":"Le Casio by Athlete","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/athlete.jpg\">Mexico\r\n\r\nGive it up another time never meant to overstep the line\r\nskip across to mexico to get away from all you know \r\ngive it up another time never meant to overstep the line\r\nskip across to mexico to get away from all you know\r\n\r\ngive it up another time never meant to overstep the line\r\nskip across to mexico to get away from all you know<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiy2a3n0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-102.552784,23.634501]}},{"properties":{"name":"Le Diplomate Café","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/201300962_4f602c825c.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 4237 Campus Dr #B161, Irvine, CA 92612A mom-and-pop shop that has catered to swarms of regulars over the last 15 years.

Gilbreath constructed the chapel around an old oak tree after the completion of Jamestown Village in 1962. Gilbreath had razed a magnificent Victorian home for the center, and wanted to save the oak tree in the parking lot. The chapel is a miniature version of a Tennessee church that his grandmother used to visit. The companion tree died years ago, so nowadays, the church stands alone. One day\\'s rental costs just 00, but you have to clean and decorate the chapel yourself. \n\nIf interested, call Gerda Brucks of Gerda\\'s Antiques: (714) 832-4932.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj22sa5h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.82433,33.740808]}},{"properties":{"name":"Livie on the arcade machine","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/9fda9ca86bf25b164c2587b75f3027e6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Aliso Viejo, CALivie taking her turn on the Magical Drop game.

Lucca serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner in an upscale yet casual setting with art-inspired decor. Lucca uses only fresh, quality ingredients, including local, seasonal produce and many organic products. They serve bread from La Brea and Buona Forchetta Bakeries, as well as Lavazza Coffee. The restaurant also has more than 30 wines by the glass. \n\nThe lunch menu has a selection of pasta, including Penne with Grilled Asparagus and Leeks, and Linguine with Shrimp Diavolo. Lucca\\'s house specialties, include Ravioloni Aperti (a large, single open ravioli stuffed with grilled chicken and spinach in a pesto sauce with a light touch of bechamel, and dusted with Parmesano Reggiano), Lasagne Vegetale (Vegetarian Lasagna filled with Zucchini, Eggplant and Spinach, light fresh herbed ricotta filling and marinara sauce), and Lasagne Bolognese (the chef\\'s family recipe; a traditional Meat Lasagna with a light bechamel sauce.) \n\nDinner is more European-bistro like, where they serve small plates (about half the portion you\\'d get in another restaurant) that you can share with others. The food is high-quality and simple. The salmon is wild, the tri-tip is certified Angus, most of the fruits and vegetables are organic and the scallops are from New England. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj2hc6t2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.780527,33.654498]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lucky Bamboo &amp; Flowers","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers426 E 8TH St, los angeles, ca 90014Many Angelenos know that the best place to go for flowers is the flower district downtown.

There\\'s also a sweet version filled with red bean paste.\n\nThe restaurant stands in an industrial section near Fullerton, and with its indoor fountain, large chandelier hanging inside a domed ceiling, red walls and the presence of owner Jamilla Ma in white headdress, it feels as though it dropped down from the sky.\n\nMa owned the other Islamic Chinese restaurant in Orange County, Jamillah Garden in Tustin, which she sold two years ago. The menu is essentially the same. Plenty of familiar Chinese dishes, all prepared in the Halal way, according to Muslim dietary rules. Pork and alcohol are verboten ingredients.\n\nThere\\'s a stronger-than-usual emphasis on lamb and tripe. She serves handmade, nicely chewy noodles. And of course, there\\'s the bread, which doesn\\'t appear too much in Islamic restaurants in China where it\\'s so commonplace in homes no one orders it outside.\n\nOther than that, though, the menu is very familiar to anybody who\\'s ever ordered an egg roll, a pot sticker or kung pao anything. There\\'s a very nice shredded chicken with dry bean curd that\\'s at once mildly sweet and spicy. The hot-braised shrimp is forgettable, but the salt-and-pepper shrimp is worth fighting over, each little pink curl crispy from a coating of its two seasonings and a toss into a sizzling hot pan.\n\nI was underwhelmed by the steamed dumplings and pot stickers (even though the dough draping both was pleasantly toothsome) and the fried calamari, which looked like onion rings, was unremarkable even if its crust was as crispy as it gets.\n\nBut the sautéed pea-pod leaves, while tasting very familiar, seemed refreshing: bright green leaves still attached to crispy stalks, flecked with garlic and glistening with a touch of sesame oil. The dry sautéed string beans were crunchy and nicely charred in spots and the eggplant with curry, practically a savory pudding, was very good.\n\nThe homemade noodles show up in both brothy dishes and chow meins. They\\'re irregular cuts, thick and chewy in spots, more tender at different points along the strands. The lamb stew warm pot is a bracing dish, the broth tinged with anise and other ingredients in Chinese five-spice powder. Big chunks of supremely tender lamb still on the bone float about, although you must negotiate the clinging bits of white fat.\n\nMost beef dishes are worth your time. The stir-fry leek with beef is brazen in its embrace of five-spice powder, the beef deeply red, fully cooked and supple.\n\nMas\\' is the place where you want to start with the familiar and then tiptoe over to the cold spicy beef, the cold spicy tripe and the ox tongue in brown sauce. One day, the cold jellyfish might be a weekly necessity.\n\n-ocregister<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxivgma8a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.862315,33.865036]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mason Regional Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/card_mason.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/mason.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/mason_park.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 18712 University Dr., Irvine, CA 92612At 345 acres, one of Orange County\\'s most popular regional parks…a wonderful blend of nature and recreational opportunities, including walking paths, picnic area and a Frisbee course. \n\nOperated by the County of Orange Harbors, Beaches &amp; Parks.

Formica Blues was released in America in February 1998, six months after its British appearance.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj6gs0cg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"Montage Resort and Spa","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/140734_03.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/140734_02_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/2/justimages.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 30801 Coast Hwy, Laguna Beach, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj96e6p3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.758192,33.516874]}},{"properties":{"name":"Montana by Venus Hum","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/71535_Full.jpg\">St Mary Lake, MontanaThe line \"Throw a bright pink dress over my red head /\nGo to Saint Mary\\'s Lake\" refers to a lake located in Montana.\n\nPanic start-\nIt\\'s 8 o\\'clock\nMach 10 to get to the school on time\nThrow a dress on over my head\nJump in my freedom ride\nFill me up with sound\nThe world sings with me a million smiles an hour\n\nI can see me dancing on my radio\nI can hear you singing in the blades of grass\nYellow dandelions on my way to school\nBig beautiful sky!\n\nPanic start-\nIt\\'s just enough, a little, too late\nPark calls!\nI\\'ll not go to school today\nThrow a bright pink dress over my red head\nGo to Saint Mary\\'s Lake\nFill me up with sound\nThe world sings with me a million smiles an hour\n\nI can see me dancing on my radio\nI can hear you singing in the blades of grass\nYellow dandelions on my way to school\nBig beautiful sky!\n\nI can see me dancing on my radio\nI can hear you singing in the blades of grass\nYellow dandelions on my way to school\nBig beautiful sky!\n\nFill me up with sound\nThe world sings with me a million smiles an hour\n\nI can see me dancing on my radio\nI can hear you singing in the blades of grass\nYellow dandelions on my way to school\nBig beautiful sky!\n\nI can see me dancing on my radio\nI can hear you singing in the blades of grass\nYellow dandelions on my way to school\n\nBig beautiful sky!\nBig beautiful sky!\nBig beautiful sky!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiwfybot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.527908,48.687334]}},{"properties":{"name":"Montreal by Of Montreal","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/0/click_mum.jpg\">Montreal, Canada\n\n\nMontreal is\nWhere I began to feel inside\nthe gray sadness of winter.\nWhen you told me that this isn\\'t it,\nAnd I drove away.\n\n\nWalking to the statue in the park,\nThrough snow drifts up over our knees,\nAnd every street sign written in French.\nWe sat by the statue.\nYou looked in my eyes,\nThen said, \"I\\'m so sorry.\"\n\n\nLater, laying on your bed,\nWondering what\\'s going wrong.\nEvery time I\\'d ask you\\'d start crying,\nAnd whisper, \"I don\\'t know why,\nI only know what I feel,\nwhat a voice says to me\"\n\n\nI may be here now\nbut I\\'ve never left Montreal <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj6owl1a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.675627,45.512363]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mooi (North East Wales, UK)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/113946358_523850dd2c.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/e88589460185cc9b2c099a212ab528be.jpg\">North East Wales, United KingdomMooi - Sway\n\nMooi are Welsh duo Rachel Lloyd and Laura Dickinson.

He stole a city picnic table. For lovesick Stefan Robichaux, it all made sense. Nothing would keep the 24-yearold international sales coordinator for Oakley from popping the question to his longtime “Lady Faire,” Naomi Goetz, 23, whom he met nearly 12 years earlier. Not even a little larceny. So, on a recent early Saturday morning – Robichaux would say “under the cover of a moonless night” – the former Marine and lover of all things poetic hit Deerfield Community Park. With the help of two friends, he unbolted the picnic table where he and Goetz first kissed, on Nov. 4, 2000. The three put the 00 aluminum bench in Robichaux’s truck and drove off. “This bench will be returned no later than 23:59 hours (PST) on June 30, 2006,” Robichaux wrote in an e-mail to city officials the next day. “Operation Purple Steel,” as he had dubbed it, had begun without a hitch. “If you’re not gonna propose in Paris, you’ve got to do it in style,” Robichaux said. He jotted down a few lines to mark his elaborate engagement scheme:\nA bench will be stolen, A question will be asked, A ring will be given, And eternity will begin …\nHe forgot one line:\nThe police will be asking questions.\nA TALE OF ROMANCE\nRobichaux and Goetz met in 1994 during a five-day church camp in Anaheim. Both were in the sixth grade. “We shamelessly flirted,” Goetz said. Their paths wouldn’t cross again until they both ended up as juniors at a small private high school in Anaheim. They became good friends. After graduating, Robichaux joined the Marines. She wrote to him and sent him cookies.\n    While stationed at Camp Pendleton, Robichaux and Goetz frequently got together on weekends. They’d go to dinner, see movies.\n    Still friends.\n    One night, while taking Goetz home to her parents’ home in Irvine, Robichaux suggested a walk through Deerfield Park. They sat on a bench and exchanged their first kiss.\n    More than friends.\n    Circumstances would keep them apart for the next several years as Goetz went to Cal State Poly in Pomona and Robichaux was sent to Texas. The two lost touch until last fall when Goetz sent her old flame an e-mail.\n    Robichaux was no longer in the Marines and had moved to Anaheim. Goetz was finishing up her last year as an architectural major.\n    The two hooked up. “Everything clicked. The timing was just right,” Goetz said.\n    The romance led to talk of marriage, but how to propose?\n    It had to be with the bench, Robichaux decided.\n    After he stole the picnic table, Robichaux painted it purple – Goetz’s favorite color – and placed in on a hilltop overlooking Mission Viejo.\n    On the big night, a friend dropped Goetz off at Deerfield Community Park. Robichaux was standing where the bench once stood, holding a bouquet of white calla lilies, grinning widely.\n    He drove her to the picnic bench. It was dark. Candles flickered on the table. A bottle of champagne chilled. Music played from a boom box. Tiki torches danced in the wind.\n    Right away, Goetz recognized the bench.\n    “I quickly put it all together,” she said.\n    Robichaux proposed.\n    She said yes.\n    “Every proposal is special,” Goetz said. “But the lengths he went to was amazing.”\n    Robichaux whisked his fiancée to a nearby friend’s house, where family and friends congratulated the couple and laughed about the picnic table.\n    The theft of that table is a misdemeanor and is punishable by six months in jail or a fine up to ,000, or both.\n    Showing no mercy for the romance tale, Irvine Police Commander Dave Freedland says he’d like to “have a chat with the suspect.”\n    Goetz said she isn’t bothered by the theft because her fiancé notified authorities right away. He plans to accept any fines or penalties for the misdemeanor.\n    “He’s truly a prince among men,” Goetz said.\n    Her prince plans to return the table after he removes the purple paint and buffs the table to a high shine. He also might donate money to the park.\n    “My most sincere hope is that cleaning and restoring the bench will make it possible for some other young couple to enjoy a childhood kiss similar to the one I once shared,” he said.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxixfpl23"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.793503,33.691003]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mosquitos","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/cb1be43e3bee30b5f2fcbc0f511725d5.jpg\">Ipanema, Brazil<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3mwdpw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-41.709999,-19.799999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mosun Sushi - Club M","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/4/oc_japan_mosun.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 680 South Coast Highway, Laguna Beach CA, 92651 Laguna hot spot with sleek décor offers sushi, 25 kinds of sake, fine Pacific Rim cuisine.

It\\'s got a new attitude and a catchy new name, but most important, it\\'s got a brand-new dining concept to introduce to the world.     Chef Azmin Ghahreman has assembled a seemingly endless menu of small plates from around the world. It\\'s not tapas per se, more like appetizers and half-portions of dishes that make you go \"Mmmm.\" Signature plates include the foie gras BLT, the miniature steak Diane, the fried green tomatoes and the piri piri Portuguese pork. Small-plate dining, while undeniably fun, does not qualify as a brand-new dining concept, so Motif has taken it a few steps further, offering wine flights and by-the-glass selections to complement each plate. Then the coup de grace: 50 mineral waters from every corner of the world. It\\'s a bit gimmicky, yes, but if you\\'re in the mood for a dab of fondue, a lobster martini, a glass of Chablis and a bottle of Villa del Sur con gas, Motif is perfect. -- Lena Katz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj8bsbae"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.715156,33.483046]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Fuji","description":"Posted by Pilsb<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Fuji_From_An_Airplane.JPG/800px-Fuji_From_An_Airplane.JPG\">Japan<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj5qwqxx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[138.731918,35.362736]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mulholland Drive","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/87/84/60m.jpg\">Mulholland Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90046A Love Story In The City Of Dreams.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiw7yq6s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.37337,34.131]}},{"properties":{"name":"Muse","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/where_taylor_works.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 300 Forest Ave, Laguna Beach, CA 92651-2116<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj6iwj55"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.782388,33.543525]}},{"properties":{"name":"Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/sculpture_moca.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 250 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90012The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles is home to one of the country\\'s finest collections of American and European art created since 1940.

When a strange but knowing voice whispers into his sleeping ears: “By the way, King Kong is not dead!“, he feels so happy and relieved that right the next day he writes a song about it. This touching and witty piece of Electropop is typical for the second Naomi album \"Pappelallee\". Sometimes bizarre but always catchy. Serious but never downcast. Melancholic but comforting. Full of drama but with ease. Everything’s gonna be alright..\nWhile “Pappelallee“is highly accessible and feels familiar at first contact, repetitive listening reveals an amazing abundance of details. The warm and profound songs on the album cross electronic structures with acoustic guitar, vocoder vocals with playful melodeon, beatbox House with Jazz broom ballads and computerised Reggae with singer/songwriter appeal.\nA whole sound universe. Dinosaurs of the glorious 1970s and 80s Pop/Rock era have left their traces. Obscure voice samples in “Exit Song“ evoke comparisons with British cult bands Lemonjelly and Bent, while the sinister lackadaisical shuffle of \"Paravent\" bears resemblance with Mogwai. On “Three Stars No Match“, singer Selda Kaya (known from the band’s first album and the much acclaimed Naomi song „Go“ from the Amnesty International movie and TV spot) lends her graceful voice. The song radiates a romantic serenity which so far could only be ascribed to Air’s classic \"Moon Safari\". But at the end of the day, all comparisons crumble. All songs on \"Pappelallee\" sound exactly like Naomi. This time even more elaborate and intense than on their smashing debut „Everyone Loves You“.\nA closer look at the lyrics is rewarding. “Rainfall“ connects seven city names with a single word and still reveals a telling story. \"October\" leads us through a storm of images into apocalyptic cinema. The philosophical and danceable \"Option\" while dealing with the spell of indecision delivers the great lines “I can’t say no and I can’t say yes - it\\'s just another way of saying no, I guess.“ It’s worth to listen.\n\nTune in once more to “King Kong Is Not Dead“, smile, and sing along. “Pappelallee“ is pop music how it is supposed to be: heartfelt, witty and consoling.\n-mole.de\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxivj4wmk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.38,52.52]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nature's Creation Topiary Nursery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 2726 W.

In addition, Newport Harbor and its surrounding shoreline is a place of beauty and scenic wonder... wind blown bluffs, sandy beaches, rocky coves and numerous islands from the harbor outline. Two jetties stand as sentries against the encroaching sea. Two main channels join and converge towards the harbor mouth. Over 9,000 boats are berthed in this well protected harbor. Quiet bay beaches line the length of the inside channel while endless surf pounds the oceanfront.\n\nNewport Harbor is as functional as it is beautiful. Boat slips line much of the shoreline and midchannel anchorage is also available. All size recreational and commercial boats can be accommodated, from the smallest of rowboats to large luxury yachts. Private homes, from beach houses to estates, follow the harbor\\'s contour.

He can move himself and what he\\'s carrying to nearly any location that he has seen. The farther he tries to teleport though, the more the risk he has of teleporting into a solid object. Nightcrawler teleports through an unknown dimension and leaves behind the smell of brimstone. This ability allows Nightcrawler to teleport in and out to attack his foes or make a speedy retreat.\n\nKurt is also extremely agile and is a trained acrobat and gymnast. He has a prehensile tail that is extremely strong as it can lift a human being and support Nightcrawler\\'s weight in his acrobatics. His feet also have a prehensile quality which he can use to hold himself up and cling to walls.\n\nNightcrawler\\'s blue fur allows him to blend into the shadows. This ability has also been tied to the dimension he travels to when he teleports. He can even appear to be in the shadows in broad daylight.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men, Ultimate X-Men\nCurrently Seen In:\nUncanny X-Men, Ultimate X-Men\n\nInteresting Fact: \nNightcrawler\\'s prehensile tail is so agile it can wield a sword, which Nightcrawler uses to great effect.\n\nOrigin: \nDemon, Evil, Spawn of the Devil. These are the things Kurt Wagner has been called since his birth. Kurt was born with blue hair, fanged teeth, and glowing yellow eyes in Germany. His mother, the mutant Mystique had the ability to change her appearance at will, but Kurt did not inherit those abilities. The people of the village feared Kurt, and to save her own life, Mystique threw Kurt over a waterfall.\n\nBut Kurt did not die, he survived and was found by the gypsy sorceress Margali Szardos, who raised Kurt as her own in a traveling circus. There, Kurt learned about acrobatics and gymnastics, performing with the circus. Fate would have this joyful time cut short.\n\nKurt was forced to kill his half-brother Stefan, who had gone mad and was killing children. The villagers of the area found out about Kurt and attributed the killings to him and tried to kill him. It was then that Professor X intervened and offered him a chance to learn more about his abilities, and more importantly, a place where Kurt could be himself and free from hate.\n\nKurt has been an integral part of the X-Men since Giant Size X-Men debuted in 1975. His joyful attitude and playful spirit brings a much needed heart to the X-Men. As Nightcrawler, Kurt is the swashbuckling hero with a pure heart and lightning quick wit and reflexes.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiuvs0mo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Niguel Botanical Preserve","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/mo_ln2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 29751 Crown Valley Parkway, Laguna Niguel, CA 92677An 18-acre botanical garden located within Crown Valley\nCommunity Park where you can walk along a maze of paved and wooded trails, or simply sit and enjoy the views on benches shaded by hearty sycamore, pine and oak trees.

It\\'s a 275-acre community with 1600 homes, 11 private parks, 6 swimming pools, tennis courts, clubhouse, and other amenities. There are a variety of architecture styles reminiscent of \"Classic California\" neighborhoods such as Pasadena, San Marino, Santa Monica, and so on. You\\'ll find that all the streets are named after different places in California...and the pools...and the parks. Hicks Canyon Elementary School is adjacent to the community so kids can actually walk to school without going outside the neighborhoods. Right outside is Hicks Canyon public park where parents usually watch baseball and soccer games; there are biking trails that lead to the foothills on both sides; and a local shopping center. The community is also very pedestrian and dog-friendly - residents like to walk to the grocery store, or their dogs, or kids in strollers at anytime of the day. 1/2 block away is my favorite coffee shop, Champagne Bakery, and 1 1/2 block away is my favorite bookstore.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3mam4b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.769972,33.728337]}},{"properties":{"name":"Notting Hill","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/53/75/43m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> Notting Hill, London, England, UKCan the most famous film star in the world fall for just an ordinary guy?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiuowq7c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.201445,51.520333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nouvelle Vague (France)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/nouvelle_vague_m.jpg\">FranceNouvelle Vague - I Melt With You\n\nWith a name that means \"new wave\" in English and \"bossa nova\" in Portuguese, Nouvelle Vague\\'s moniker neatly sums up the group\\'s concept: remaking classic new wave singles with a Brazilian pop twist. Nouvelle Vague is the brainchild of French producers Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux. Prior to this collaboration, Collin played with the trip-hop outfit Ollano; composed film soundtracks such as The Kidnapper\\'s Theme; and released electronic music ranging from club-oriented material for Paper Recordings to more eclectic fare for Fcom and Output Records (under the aliases Avril and Volga Select, respectively). Libaux played with various French pop bands during the \\'90s and began working with Collin in 1998. For Nouvelle Vague, Collin and Libaux recruited half a dozen French and Brazilian vocalists who were unfamiliar with the original versions of songs like Joy Division\\'s \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" and XTC\\'s \"Making Plans for Nigel\" to ensure that their renditions had their own identity. Nouvelle Vague was released in Europe in 2004 and received U.S. distribution in spring 2005, which coincided with tour dates in locales as far-flung as Shanghai, New York, Los Angeles, and Rio de Janeiro.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxixkkf02"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.213749,46.227638]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nouvelle Vague (France)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/fe740d3d866238e474eb187bb8249334.jpg\">FranceNouvelle Vague - Making Plans For Nigel\n\n\"Nouvelle Vague\" is a french project initialized by Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux.\n\nMarc Collin was a genuine \"french touch\" figure (with his band Ollano).he moved from movie soundtrack (\"the kidnapper\\'s theme\") to club music (he recorded for Paper recordings) until becoming a creative and eclectic producer (Avril on Fcom ,Volga select on Output records)\n\nOlivier Libaux was involved in many french pop acts all along the nineties and started working with Marc in 1998.

Kellett connected with Boyle while playing keyboards for a live incarnation of the Durutti Column (he manipulated her tape-looped vocals while on stage), and asked her to join him in a new recording project. With Kellett writing lyrics and the addition of Taylor-Firth, the trio recorded three songs and found plenty of labels ready to bid for their services. RCA Records won out and released \"You\\'re Not Alone\" in 1995. Though it took almost a year to catch on with British audiences, the single eventually hit number one and sold half a million copies. America proved passingly fond of the track as well, making a home near the Top 40 for it.

We would spend our summer days and nights bathed in chlorine - lit by the pure blue lights installed underneath diving boards. I used to think that the heat would suck every last drop from your swimming pool or redden our skins until it had the hue of raw flesh. I remembered you saying... And some people like summer. \"Have a great summer,\" their yearbook inscriptions bellow happily, as if they actually want me to enjoy myself, as if they actually would notice if I imploded in front of them.

Built on the former site of the Citroen Automotive factory, the park incorporates diverse landscapes into one cohesive natural tapestry.\n\nOn the northern end of Andre Citroen, park-goers can enjoy the White Garden, which is landscaped entirely with plants bearing white flowers, and the Black Garden, which houses only black-flowering plants. Between these opposite gardens are two botanical greenhouses, a bubbling fountain, and two magnolia groves, one planted on land and one floating in water.\n\nIn the middle of Parc Andre Citroen, there is a great lawn surrounded by a shallow moat. The lawn is a lovely place to play soccer or just rest and take a break from urban life. To the west of the lawn lie a series of small garden “rooms,” each designed by a different landscape architect and displaying a unique theme. Although these “rooms” are actually outside, they provide the illusion of privacy and intimacy.\n\nTo the south of Andre Citroen, the gardens are freeform, planted with wildflowers and bamboo. This end of the park edges against a business complex, yet there is little division between the park and the city beyond. The two blend into one another, drawing the urban-dwellers into Andre Citroen and park-goers back into Paris. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj8vfa40"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.274942,48.840854]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris (Texas)","description":"Posted by BaostarParis, TexasTheir slogan is \"Second Largest Paris in the World\", and they also have a smaller duplicate of the Eiffel Tower.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxizj018o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.555278,33.660833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris to the Moon","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/shop_cm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 1720 D Santa Ana Ave., Costa Mesa, CA 92627There\\'s an erratic charm in this gift shop\\'s selection.

If Charlie Hallowell, an eight-year veteran of Chez Panisse, served his thin-crust Neapolitan-style pizzas in a truck stop, there\\'d still be a line. But add a hot locale and stylish decor—Hallowell designed the interior himself, teaming up with his father-in-law to construct tables and benches from 120-year-old reclaimed Douglas fir and exposing some of the original brick—and the wait to be seated usually lasts an hour. Not than anyone\\'s complaining. His pizzas, artfully scattered with innovative toppings (think arugula salad or truffled brandade), emerge from the 750-degree wood-burning oven blackened at the edges and perfectly chewy. Non-pizza dishes—such as farro with shrimp, arugula, and tomatoes; pork with polenta and broccoli rabe; and clams with homemade sausage, chickpeas, and kale—are equally impressive (entrées, 0–8).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj4jdu8b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.262414,37.836619]}},{"properties":{"name":"Plant Depot","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 33413 San Juan Creek Road, San Juan Capistrano, CABasic landscape trees and shrubs, shade plants, Japanese maples, perennials, succulents, vegetables, herbs, cycads<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj8x2kve"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.629142,33.512027]}},{"properties":{"name":"Plant Stand","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 2972-A Century Place, Costa Mesa, CAHouseplants, orchids, hanging baskets<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxizuvoq3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.889548,33.679527]}},{"properties":{"name":"Playing with fire","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/fire_300web.jpg\">Garden Grove, CAI lit our garage and backyard on fire one day in summer. My cousin and I found gasoline in the garage and decided to light it. Fire is such a rare thing. The only times we ever see fire is when we light candles and when we\\'re involved in a disaster. While other kids are attracted insects or swimming pools, I was fascinated with fire. I find amusements in sitting on the sidewalk on a hot summer day and watching my spit sizzles on the hot asphalt, burning anything with a magnifying glass, or using a cigarette lighter and a hairspray can as a torch. On this day, we first poured a small amount in the garage and lit it with the garage door down. That wasn\\'t very smart, because it got all fumy real quick and we had to hosed it down right away. We later moved to the backyard and poured a large ring of gasoline on the grass and lit it!  It was awesome!!!  We jumped up and down for while as the flames grew bigger. I don\\'t remembered who yelled out first to put the fire out but we did put it out with garden hose, leaving a burnt circle the middle our backyard. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj47dcwh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.940556,33.773889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Plaza Irvine (under construction)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/irvine_big.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/roof_pool_deck_at_Plaza_irvine.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Acreage: 3.5 for the first two towers \r\nScope: Three 15-story towers \r\nNumber of units: 307 \r\nUnit size, first two towers: 1,175-4,300 sq. ft. \r\nUnit size, third tower: 1,375-3,025 sq. ft. \r\nPrice range, first two towers: 50,000 to .8 million \r\nPrice range, third tower: 50,000 to .4 million \r\nLocation: Jamboree and Campus SE corner \r\nDeveloper: Opus West \r\nArchitect: MVE &amp; Partners \r\nGroundbreaking: March 2005 \r\nPlanned completion, first two towers: January 2007 \r\nPlanned completion, third tower: Summer 2008 \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj31vkkv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.853860855,33.6647108596]}},{"properties":{"name":"Plaza Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/fields10.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 610 Paseo Westpark, Irvine, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj90wkhn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.808917,33.691318]}},{"properties":{"name":"Plum's Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/DSC00712.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/DSC00720.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/DSC00713.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 369 E 17th, Costa Mesa, CA 92627A trendy breakfast place in the corner of a non-descript shopping mall.

Riding high on good reviews for her debut album \\'Scissors In My Pocket\\' and after a summer of festivals, she was about to embark on her first tour of America, and would land support slots with Jamie Cullum, Divine Comedy and Joseph Arthur. Eighteen months on, it\\'s an unbelievable treat to see her back, playing solo in the kind of small, cold, candle-lit acoustic club that she started out in. It\\'s a conspicuously low-profile gig, showcasing all new material, but there is standing room only at the back and you get the sense that quite a few people have been turned away.\nThe basement of the Slaughtered Lamb has an understated cool, far removed from the clatter of the city clientele rattling their jewellery upstairs. Down below it\\'s a black brick-walled affair with an eclectic assortment of bohemian seating (when was the last time you saw a chaise longue at a gig?) It reminds me of the River Bar on Tower Bridge before they tarted it up and took its soul. The setting suits the sophisticated and intimate nature of Paulusma\\'s poetic and often dark songs. Weaving smart rhymes like \\'bathroom / half-gloom\\' and \\'extinguish / unencumbered English\\' against complex-but-not-in-the-least-bit-jazzy chord progressions is evidently (still) what Polly does well. Her secret weapon though has to be her exquisitely English singing voice, which when pushed is on the verge of \\'60s singer Melanie; and when soft, is as sultry as Suzanne Vega.\nBut back to basements and gloom... This is Paulusma\\'s first gig in six months and she has pre-warned us that her second album - which has already been some time in the making - will have a darker, louder edge. Although there is (deep breath) an electric guitar on stage, I\\'m glad to discover that the new material does not reveal any Cradle of Filth or similar influences. And aside from the gloriously discordant moments in a song about killing babies, which features the aforementioned electric axe, there is seemingly little change in her style. That is not to say that there is no evidence of evolution, because Paulusma is the kind of songwriter that will challenge herself as a matter of course. Anyone who brings out three guitars and a piano to play a solo half-hour set is someone who has constant development on their mind. Likewise the subject matter veers far and wide from identity, love and quarter-life crises; to being invisible, hide-and-seek and yes, you did read it right the first time, killing babies.\nIt\\'s nice to see the rawness of an artist grappling with new, freshly arranged songs, especially as none of these are basic three-chord wonders. One of the songs has been in Polly\\'s live set for a while, but in the others you can just catch the concentration of a performer whose music so often seems effortless. These have a vitality to them that will inevitably be diminished after another two years of hard touring gets its hands on them. You can tell that this crowd, myself included, feel lucky to be here at their inception.\n \nUNCUT Magazine Dec 2004\n01 November 2004\nNever mind all the fuss about Joss Stone and Amy Winehouse. As far as Uncut is concerned, the finest young British female singer-songwriter to emerge over the last 12 months is the brainy Cambridge graduate Polly Paulusma, with a debut album of mature and literate songs brimful of emotional resonance, potent melodies and meltingly heartfelt vocals.\n \nROLLING STONE Magazine (USA)\n10 October 2004\nPolly Paulusma Scissors in My Pocket (One Little Indian)\nby Leslie Hermelin\nFrom the charming opener Dark Side, Polly Paulusma declares herself in league with articulate folk-pop contemporaries such as Paula Cole and Shawn Colvin. And while these comparisons, as well as those to Joni Mitchell and Carole King, are well deserved, Paulusma\\'s talent is strong enough to stand on its own. Scissors in My Pocket is an enchanting debut of understated, intelligent folk pop from a promising newcomer. Holding true to the singer-songwriter ethos, Paulusma opts for authenticity over production wizardry. Many of the album cuts were recorded in only one take, and some, including Dark Side and the stunning One Day, are the original demo recordings. She Moves in Secret Ways is an intimate, softly spun bit of folk poetry as is the bittersweet Anywhere From Here. This Cambridge educated songstress proves once again that a well-penned ballad trumps an over-produced pop song any day.\n \nPHILADELPHIA INQUIRER Online (USA)\n26 September 2004\n* * * *\nPolly Paulusma Scissors in My Pocket (One Little Indian)\nby A D Amorosi\nGiven her arcane sound, you could easily assume that Polly Paulusma is part of the dark British folk revival. But she is lighter. She\\'s also sexy and spare.\nThe quiet psychedelia and queer optimism of her gauziest vocal melodies are touched by faint curlicues of jazzy interplay. She weathers the impending storm of Dark Side with a whispery voice, promising \"golden lips\" for her lover\\'s final approach.\nThrough rushes of acoustic guitar, bubbling double bass, or cosmopolitan chamber-jazz arrangements (I Was Made to Love You), Paulusma\\'s smoky yet vivid voice is so alive that the sadness of Perfect 4/4 resounds through your head. She cries on your shoulder without playing to your sympathies.\n \nPHILADELPHIA INQUIRER\n26 September 2004\nPolly Paulusma fits the bill as ideal singer-songwriter\nby Jonathan Takiff\nI\\'ll gladly admit it. I\\'m a sucker for a smart, poetic, darkly melancholic and slightly unhinged female singer-songwriter. For an artist with a smokey, soulful sadness in her voice and a rejuvenating melody in her heart, with a vibrant vision for how she wants her life to soar and the will to make it so - at least within the context of a four-minute song.\nJoni Mitchell set the mold for me with her classic album \"Blue.\" Young disciples like Dar Williams, Beth Orton and the late Kirsty MacColl have kept the fires burning. Now I bow in supplication to another English export by the name of Polly Paulusma (pronounced pallsma) who\\'ll be popping up Sunday at the Point to showcase material from her altogether compelling album \"Scissors in My Pocket.\"\nOne of my favorite debuts of the year, the disc is chock full of feather-light, but delicately filigreed songs that are at once literate and emotional, tender and tough-minded, like \"She Moves in Secret Ways,\" a song about not giving up her willful nature, personifying herself as a hoof-stomping horse.\nAt other extremes are spritely entreaties for gentlemen friends to explore her \"Dark Side\" and take her \"Over the Hill,\" blessed with super catchy choruses you can\\'t get out of your head.\nAnd the set caps with haunting, bittersweet ruminations about life\\'s brief passages (this from a 28-year-old!) like the riveting hospital bedside refrain in \"Perfect 4/4.\"\nDaughter of a noted portrait artist (who did all the highly evocative pen sketch illustrations for the album package) and a Cambridge University professor dad who specializes in crusading (ecclesiastical) history, Polly Paulusma has gleaned from both sides, she allowed in a recent chat.\nShe\\'s been making music since she was 10 - first \"improving\" on a classic Paul McCartney song with new lyrics, later singing in college in a soul cover band that was \"a bit like the Commitments,\" before discovering her own, more pensive voice while singing backing vocals for an album by her friends Ben &amp; Jason.\nAnd yet, Polly was also being her father\\'s daughter by majoring in English lit at Cambridge, pursuing a career in journalism with the BBC, writing a novel and then returning briefly to university for a Ph.D program, before giving it all up to pursue music full time.\n\"I spent a lot of time denying I should do this, but it wouldn\\'t let me run away. It kept coming back and biting me in the ass, so I eventually gave in,\" she shared with a laugh.\nWhen Paulusma started the writing and recordings that would turn into her album, \"trashy pop\" was still all the rage in Britain, while like-minded singer-songwriters such as the long-suffering David Gray were just starting to make a belated breakthrough.\n\"Now there\\'s a whole scene going, with lots of clubs to play and buzz artists like Tom Baxter and Adem. But four years ago, no one would fund my project, so (as Gray did)] I set up a recording studio in the shed at the end of my garden and started doing it all myself. I wasn\\'t trying to make it sound low-fi, just the music I could hear in my head with the equipment I had available - basically one good microphone feeding into a computer hard drive. I played almost all the the guitars, did all the vocals and also added funny litle things like shakers and tambourine, mandolin and the sound of tinkling wine glasses.\"\nFriends came in to dress up the works with brush-tapped drumming, jazzy acoustic double bass, a hammered dulcimer flourish, and chamber music styled strings and brass evoking the likes of Damien Rice (a major Polly fave) and vintage Beatles recordings.\nThe origin of the album\\'s title \"Scissors in My Pocket\" relates to an incident that happened when Polly was just 8, and \"obsessed with sailing,\" (a theme that\\'s still showing up in her lyrics). \"I wanted a boat, so I decided to build a raft in our back garden on a piece of old, flat fencing. My parents could see it wouldn\\'t float, but I didn\\'t believe them. After decorating it with a cabin and putting on lights, I somehow persuaded my mom to take me to the river to launch it. She was great, I was adamant. I tied a piece of rope to the raft and gave her the other end to hold, ostensibly so she could pull me back when I got to the middle of the river, to calm her nerves. But I didn\\'t tell her I\\'d put scissors in my pocket. I was going to cut the rope and run away to London. But of course, the boat sank instantly as soon as I pushed it into the water.\n\"When I started making this record, I felt a similar kind of condescension,\" Polly added. \"A lot of people saying \\'That\\'s very nice dear, but you can\\'t really make your own record.\\' You have to stick fingers up to people like that. \\'I know this will float, so up yours.\\' And luckily, this time it worked.\"\n \nLA DAILY NEWS\n21 September 2004\nby Rob Lowman, Entertainment Editor\nPolly Paulusma took a novel approach to becoming a heralded up-and-coming singer-songwriter.\nOK, maybe that\\'s a bad joke.\nAfter graduating from Cambridge University, the 28-year-old British singer-songwriter began a Ph.D program and turned her attention to writing fiction.\nBut that novel was packed up and put in the attic about a month ago. \"I hadn\\'t touched it in four years, and I was quite curious to see what it was like ... so I peeked at it. It was really bad,\\' says Paulusma, being her own worse critic.\nLuckily, music critics are raving about \"Scissors in My Pocket,\\' Paulusma\\'s self-produced album that was released early in the year in the U.K. and last week in the U.S. When talking about the album, with its winning acoustic sound and clever lyrics, heavy hitters like Joni Mitchell and Nick Drake are often evoked -- and with good reason. There are many colors on Paulusma\\'s palette as she moves from the intensity of \"One Day,\\' with her voice nearly cracking with emotion, to the dreamy \"She Moves in Secret Ways.\"\nNic Harcourt of KCRW-FM (89.9) has been featuring songs from \"Scissors\\' on his show, \"Morning Becomes Eclectic,\\' for a while now, calling it \"the best thing I\\'ve heard from a songwriter out of the U.K.\\'\nA Brit himself, Harcourt says, \"I hear a lot of music from everywhere, and most of it I don\\'t like, but once in a while a record like this comes along that grabs you. ... (Paulusma\\'s) songs have depth to them, and she has a singing style that\\'s very engaging.\\'\n(Paulusma will be at the Troubadour on Monday night as well as on Harcourt\\'s show that day during the 11 o\\'clock hour.)\nSince \"Scissors\\' had \"such humble beginnings,\\' Paulusma, who has been into music since the age of 10, says she is amazed at its reception. \"I have this little shed at the end of my garden, and that\\'s where I made most of the record. So it seems incredible, thinking there I was last summer, without a record deal, just really making it for myself. I knew I could sell it at shows. I was doing a lot of gigs and selling a lot of records to people who came around the stage. I could see I could make a little living out of it. That\\'s all I ever thought it would be.\\'\nNow \"Scissors,\\' which is on Bjork\\'s record label, One Little Indian, is the hottest acoustic album in Britain since Damien Rice\\'s \"O.\\'\n\"I think what happened was the music industry became so closed that there was a backlog,\\' says Paulusma about why she and artists like Rice are gaining popularity. \"It\\'s like there was a dam put up, and it\\'s suddenly bursting now. But in fact, that sound never went away -- it was always there. It\\'s just because it was ignored for so long and unnurtured.\\'\nThat sound is the sound of people like music legends Mitchell and Drake.\n\"There was a real purity to what they were doing then. And you can see almost a family tree down to various people now like Wilco that I find inspiring. ... I\\'ve always really loved recordings where the instruments are all acoustic. ... I think there is something that doesn\\'t date about music like that.\\'\nBut it isn\\'t easy to pigeonhole Paulusma, and it\\'s clear she wants to keep it that way. She says she was looking forward to visiting the U.S., because a woman with a guitar in England is \"often typecast as a folk artist, which is rubbish. They don\\'t do that to men like Van Morrison. It\\'s acoustic music; it\\'s pop music on the guitar. I get the feeling there is a deeper understanding over here.\\'\nSo here she is, guitar in hand, touring America, which she doesn\\'t mind at all. (\"It helps your understanding of your own material.\\') It\\'s also something she\\'s used to. The daughter of a college professor, Paulusma moved around a lot as a kid before going off to a boarding school at a convent.\n\"My closest friends are the ones from that school still. It\\'s amazing when you live with 500 people. It was all-girls school, so you have a lot of sisters.\\'\nBut she\\'s not writing more songs here (and certainly not a novel), saying she finds it hard to write when she\\'s away from her friends, who she calls her \"motivation.\\' In the meantime, \"I know when I\\'m traveling I pick up lots of bits that end up coloring things in my songs. I\\'ll just let things sink in for now.\"\n \nBOSTON GLOBE\n09 September 2004\nPolly Paulusma\\'s acoustic appeal\nby Christopher Muther\nYou can\\'t blame Polly Paulusma for holing up in the garden shed.\nAfter all, she performs in a style of acoustic pop that can\\'t be easily contained in a single category. It\\'s not exactly folk, and it\\'s not at all rock. As a result, record labels weren\\'t exactly queuing up to offer the 28-year-old fame and fortune after she dropped a journalism career in favor of music. So she did what any reasonable musician would do: set up a make-shift studio in the shed at the back of her garden and started recording an album herself.\nJust as she finished the disc, \"Scissors in My Pocket,\" she landed a deal with Bjork\\'s record label, One Little Indian. Now, the album recorded in the garden shed is becoming one of the most buzzed-about acoustic discs in Britain since Damien Rice\\'s \"O.\" On Saturday, Paulusma brings her hard-to-categorize sound to T.T. the Bear\\'s in Cambridge, opening for the Divine Comedy.\nSound Bites: Because your music doesn\\'t fit neatly into a single category, has it been difficult for you to find an audience?\nPaulusma: Not exactly. I\\'m very lucky that I can dip my toe in all these musical swimming pools. I can kind of jump around between them. In some ways it has been an advantage. People still put labels on my music, which I actually think can be useful. It can be useful for people to have comparisons, but some of the comparisons have been quite wide of the mark. I hear endless Norah Jones comparisons, which I find very odd. I think she\\'s got a beautiful voice. But as far as I can make out she\\'s doing jazz, which is something completely different from me. As long as people are saying something, even if the comparison is a bit weird, I\\'m happy.\nSound Bites: Does your audience tend to be a younger, Damien Rice-type of crowd, or more hippie holdouts trying to catch the next Joni Mitchell?\nPaulusma: It\\'s a real cross section. I just did this gig in London on Wednesday, it was for about 200 people. Over the summer I had been gathering more and more people who are loyal and want to come along to hear my music. There are people in the front row who know all the words to my songs, which is quite terrifying. They almost know them better than I do. I was looking at the front row at this gig, and I was just really gobsmacked at the range. There were two young girls, one with dreadlocks and one with dyed bright red hair, very punk. There was an older guy, and there were some younger guys in their 20s.\nSound Bites: Careerwise, you did many things before you settled on music. Were you hesitant to make singing a full-time job?\nPaulusma: Music has been not easy. Well, making [music] has been easy, but making it a full-time job was a really big hurdle for me to overcome. I think I was led to believe that acoustic-y pop music was not really a worthwhile calling. It just took me a bit of time to work out that it was really important to me. Because I had no formal training in it, I felt that I just wouldn\\'t be good enough. Now I feel like I have plenty of support.\nEmail Christopher Muther at muther@globe.com.\n© Copyright 2004 Globe Newspaper Company\n \nNOW (Toronto)\n09 September 2004\nGloss-free Polly - Cambridge grad Polly Paulusma takes a stand against superficial pop\nby Sarah Liss\nThere\\'s a sudden renaissance in the softer end of the pop spectrum happening across the pond of late.\nFrom the tinkly piano stylings of Jamie Cullum to the soulful crooning of Katie Melua to the baroque acoustic ballads of Damien Rice, the UK\\'s cultivating a slew of singer-songwriters who, while not slick enough to give Sir Elton a run for his money, appeal to more, er, \\'mature\\' crowds than to those with art-school haircuts and ironic t-shirts.\nThe interesting thing about this current crop of soft-rockers is that they\\'re barely into their 20s. Like me, they\\'re the kids of the 80s who spent their formative years listening to their parents\\' Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez LPs.\nThe latest edition to the new acoustic generation is Polly Paulusma, a wickedly wordy guitar-toting belter whose debut disc, Scissors In My Pocket, recently dropped on One Little Indian (home to Bjork and Greg Dulli) and who\\'s already opened for Dylan (!). Similarly raised on passionate, intelligent strummers (Nick Drake is her hero), Paulusma claims she and her peers are reacting to Britain\\'s lamentable tradition of pre-fab pop.\n\"When I was making my record, the music industry, especially in the UK, was all about Pop Idol,\" she says ruefully over her mobile, en route to check out the Edward Hopper exhibition at London\\'s Tate Modern. \"It was so depressing - they just wanted glorified karaoke and had no interest in anyone who played their own music and wrote their own songs. All these talented people washing about in London, and nobody was signing them.\n\"What came out of it were loads of self-sufficient people. Katie Melua went through the same thing. Necessity has forced us back to basics, because the industry let us down. It gave us a chance to explore things by ourselves and find a whole different voice that we wouldn\\'t necessarily have found if we\\'d been scooped up by a label after the second gig.\"\nThe result is a record that, like Paulusma herself, doesn\\'t pander to trends. Scissors In My Pocket is charmingly quaint, with none of the saccharine overproduction that makes folks like Jamie Cullum hard to stomach. Recorded in a shed in Paulusma\\'s backyard, the album homes in on gently strummed acoustic guitar and quiet piano, with periodic flourishes of Hammond and dulcimer alongside the singer\\'s terribly sweet girlish coo.\nSeveral tracks are fleshed out by string and horn sections, but unlike the high-drama orchestration on, say, Damien Rice\\'s O, Paulusma ... keeps them low-key, which works well with the disc\\'s intimate folkiness.\nIt may not be the most efficient way to work, but Paulusma insists on keeping a \\'wobbly\\' homespun aesthetic.\n\"All of the songs are done in one take,\" she crows proudly. \"I worked with a producer recently and watched him clumping a track together - he\\'d do five takes and then take the best bits of each one and hack it all together like a patchwork quilt. I\\'d rather have a full performance, cuz even if there\\'s a little blemish in it, it\\'s real.\"\nPaulusma\\'s also mastered a subtly spiky wordplay - lead track Dark Side nods to Pink Floyd with a chorus about \"the dark side of my moon\" - which is no surprise, considering she graduated from Cambridge with a degree in English lit.\nWith the horror stories I\\'ve heard about the icily snotty profs peppering UK academia, I figure the experience must\\'ve been good preparation for dealing with cranky critics.\n\"Um, no,\" she states matter-of-factly. \"I think a lot of gigging in London did, actually. London crowds are so standoffish - they just fold their arms and stare at you with these blank looks on their faces.\n\"But you know, out of all my friends, I\\'m the only one who uses my degree every day,\" she continues. \"Alll these people studied these obscurely wonderful things, like medieval history, or some proper academic subject, and then they end up becoming accountants.\"\n \nAllMusic.com\n11 August 2004\n* * * *\nNearly 35 years on, and the folk and twining soft rock of the early \\'70s is being birthed again in a stylized new version. Suddenly young women with unruly mops of dark hair and a flair for dusky vocal phrasing are handily making their way in pop music. They\\'re clad in comfy boat-neck sweaters, dainty scarves, and those boots Emmylou Harris wore on the cover of Elite Hotel; their antidote to plastic club/dance divadom is a holistic amalgam of Joni Mitchell, Carole King, James Taylor, and Tim Buckley. Englishwoman Polly Paulusma joins their ranks with Scissors in My Pocket, her charming debut for One Little Indian. It always starts with the voice, and Paulusma\\'s never disappoints. Mitchell is a significant influence in both vocal style and phrasing, but there\\'s a bit of Edie Brickell\\'s reedy grace in there, too. Accompanied principally by subtle acoustic guitars or piano, she doesn\\'t need to prove how strong her voice is, and doesn\\'t skip through styles on the whim of a marketing director. This means Scissors lacks the pretentiousness that tinges some of its contemporaries\\' work. \"Perfect 4/4\" is a gorgeous piece that had to be recorded live -- you can hear Paulusma\\'s voice echoing off the walls, almost see her hand resting on the piano\\'s lacquered finish. Opener \"Dark Side\" unfolds one of the album\\'s prettiest melodies, its bed of robust acoustic instruments supported with slight vocal overdubs and clever Pink Floyd lyrical references. Conversely, the powerful, string-tinged \"One Day\" moves toward some smoky cabaret. Rich acoustic bass and softly brushed percussion appear for \"She Moves in Secret Ways,\" and stick around for the quietly confessional \"Carry Me Home.\" Though it\\'s nearly flawless, that very trait can also make Scissors in My Pocket lack sharpness and threaten to become one long nap in the sunlight. Luckily, Paulusma inserts a track like the rousing \"Give It Back\" just in time, getting carried away in its horns and the keening organ of its overture; she sounds like Phoebe Snow covering the Stones\\' \"You Can\\'t Always Get What You Want.\" All in all, Scissors in My Pocket is a spectacular debut. It\\'s a child of past masters, no question. But Polly Paulusma knows what\\'s what, and how to make the sky come tumbling down again.\n \nRIP IT UP (Australia)\n04 July 2004\nFrom the first moment I placed this debut release called Scissors In My Pocket from London-based singer-songwriter into my CD player, I was captivated. A sweet love song, Dark Side, boasting a moving Celtic feel, is the opening gambit and the album continued to impress me. Recorded independently before joining the ranks of Indian Records in the UK, 28-year-old Polly has created an impressive collection of hook-laden melodies wrapped around insightful lyrics and her own distinctive vocals. From Celtic to jazz through to pop and folk.\nScissors In My Pocket highlights Polly\\'s talent for blending word and music to create some very sweet listening.\nPolly plays most of the instruments on the album, which include acoustic guitars, piano, mandolin and wine glasses, while Oli Hayhurst plays double bass with Rastko Rasic on drums.\nMea Culpa is delightful and you could almost hear Norah Jones singing her own rendition of it one day. Anywhere frmo Here is thought-provoking while Dark Side is my favourite. Polly possesses great imagination that has allowed her to create some enchanting songs. Musically she can be compared to Joni Mitchell, The Corrs and The Waifs and vocally she\\'s a blend of Ani Di Franco, Macy Gray, Norah Jones and even Bjork.\nThe pencilled artwork on the album booklet was drawn by Polly\\'s mother, an artist by trade, and has really helped to capture the naturalness and simplicity with which Scissors In My Pocket was recorded.\nLovers of the female voice are really going to enjoy this quirky, self-produced album.\n \nBirmingham 101.com review\n21 June 2004\nThe latest slightly skewed girl singer-songwriter to challenge for a place on the scene, Cambridge grad Paulusma\\'s made a strong start with her debut album, Scissors In My Pocket (One Little Indian).\nConfessional stuff built around strong melodies, literate wordplay and breathy vocals, she draws on such influences as Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Sheryl Crow, Victoria Williams, and even Stephen Duffy while injecting the occasional jazz inflections into the arrangements. There\\'s brass and strings too, giving extra rich textures and emotional resonance to such breezy, sometimes dark tinted English pastoral songs as I Was Made To Love You, Over The Hill, She Moves In Secret Ways and Something To Remember Me By.\nPoignant shivers can be felt on Perfect 4/4 as she details someone hooked up to drips and monitors in a hospital bed while fragile insecurity ripples through the bluesy Anywhere From Here but it\\'s the way she captures the giddy whirl of being caught up in love and life on the acoustic strummed Carry Me Home and gloriously folk pop waltzing debut single Dark Side (shades of Fairground Attraction here) that really shows you just how brightly her star is beginning to glow.\n \nAmazon.co.uk review\n25 May 2004\nby Kevin Maidmen\nRecorded in the floricultural intimacy of a Clapham garden shed and warmly etched with breezy acoustic guitar, fathomless double-bass, light string arrangements, recorders, brass ensembles and even wine glasses, Scissors In My Pocket is the lovely debut album from Cambridge University English literature graduate Nick Drake-afficionado and former Ben &amp; Jason backing singer Polly Paulusma. Scholarly rock analysts, much taken with Paulusma\\'s vocal style and folk-jazz idiom, are already drawing flattering parallels with deities such as Joni Mitchell, while also suggesting that Alanis Morrisette and Norah Jones ought to be glancing over their chick-pop shoulders. While none of these comparisons are discreditable, Polly Paulusma is patently not hanging onto anyone else\\'s petticoat tails. Yes, there\\'s something about her kittenish voice, which recalls Rickie Lee Jones or a more effervescent Beth Orton, and at times her technique suggests that the world may have found Damien Rice\\'s lost spiritual sister. However, the songs - bustling pictorial narratives which unpeel with every listen to reveal an intuitive personal core - are fragrantly fresh pleasures. One Day finds our heroine jettisoning a bottle of negative thought processes from a hot air balloon in an act of pyschotherapeutic detoxification while Something to Remember Me By nods at Percy Bysshe Shelley and ponders the viability of artistic expression as a means of immortality.\n \nBlueYonder.co.uk review\n13 May 2004\nThey say that the UK\\'s music scene is currently in retrograde. That the new zeitgeist is in an easy listening mood, demurely reclining in a comfy armchair, quietly dozing off into middle of the road territory. Thankfully, it seems we\\'re slowly edging away from cheap, manufactured \\'music\\' for the lowest common denominator - you\\'ve only to look at the album charts as it\\'s a veritable hotbed of precocious, seminal twenty somethings setting a different spin on the way records are made.\nEnter Polly Paulusma, who looks set to follow Katie Melua and Norah Jones into modern easy listening legend when the world gets to hear \\'Scissors In My Pocket\\'. Like Melua and Jones, Paulusma\\'s music is delicately interwoven with warm, sensual vocals that suggest a talent that has been around for decades. Her first single \\'Dark Side\\' opened proceedings with a rich melody that nags relentlessly at your pleasure zones and is joined by another ten tracks of equally affecting beauty. \\'I Was Made To Love You\\', \\'She Moves In Secret Ways\\' and \\'Give It Back\\' also standout, but this isn\\'t an album about individual tunes, rather it is a fully complete work of true genius that will mark Paulusma out as one of the finest singer-songwriters of her generation.\nPolly recently showcased her album at a packed out Bush Hall, London. With only a smattering of songs to perform, you\\'d be inclined to think she couldn\\'t carry the gig alone, but this lyrical impresario had other ideas.\nCharacterised by hook-laden melodies, insightful lyrics and distinctive vocals, Polly ploughed her way through her repertoire with consummate ease and style - leading many to draw comparison with Joni Mitchell or Norah Jones. Anybody would be flattered by the comparison. Yet Polly is also an unique voice.\nWhilst belting out her new single, Give It Back, Paulusma grabbed hold of her acoustic guitar, tossed back her curly mane and threw herself into the music. Witnessed by a crowd of enthusiastic listeners, she seemed to be having the time of her life; giggling and chatting to the audience between songs.\nAs with any great artist, Polly is very much about the lyrics. A Cambridge graduate who got a first in English, it\\'s easy to understand her ability to craft sophisticated lyrics where every word has resonance. Combine this with hook-laden melodies and lush vocals, and you have the makings of a great singer who is already winning over music taste-lovers.\n \nDAILY TELEGRAPH\n12 May 2004\nNo clone of voice\nby Nick Cowen\nA little more than half way through her performance at Bush Hall, Polly Paulusma tells her rapt audience a white lie.\nAs the lights dim on her backing band, the young London-based folk singer says, \"this is the part where they abandon me,\" and begins picking out the opening chords to the sombre Mea Culpa.\nAs anyone with a set of ears in the venue knows by now, Paulusma\\'s band isn\\'t so much abandoning her, as much as getting out of the way. This is to take nothing away from the talent of her ensemble of musicians, but the fact is that the finest instrument up on that stage is Paulusma\\'s voice.\nOver the last year or so, thanks largely to Norah Jones\\'s sweep at the Grammies, any folk album released by a new female artist seems to creak under the weight of comparisons to the North American chanteuse. In the case of Polly Paulusma, this comparison is less deserved than most.\nUnlike a great deal of what\\'s on offer from most folk-jazz crossover divas currently being shovelled onto mainstream radio, Paulusma has two outstanding qualities that set her apart.\nThe first is that her music contains enough varying moods and catchy hooks to keep you interested. The second is her aforementioned voice, which in a live setting stamps authority on every song far more thoroughly than was managed her debut album, Scissors In My Pocket.\nThe music in some numbers - most notably the haunting, jazzy She Moves In Secret Ways, and the breathy single Dark Side - seems to act like an anchor for Paulusma\\'s vocal acrobatics, turning her voice into an extra instrument. Other songs, including the searing One Day and the mournful Anywhere From Here, derive their power from her passionate delivery.\nWhether Paulusma\\'s vocals on her debut album have been deliberately pressed into the mix to stop them overriding the musicianship on display, or whether they turned out that way because the album was recorded in the shed at the bottom of her garden is hard to say.\nWhat is clear is that her talents would probably have been enough to gain her a sizable following even without the likes of Norah Jones hitting the jackpot.\n \nTHE TIMES\n07 May 2004\nA couple of years ago, Polly Paulusma might have been stuck to playing folk clubs and festivals. With female singer songwriters back in fashion, however, the 28-year-old South Londoner has a pretty good chance at the pop charts.\nHer debut single, Dark Side, was a near miss recently, while her album Scissors In My Pocket, released a fortnight ago, has been picked up by Radio 2, received rave reviews and won the singer a prestigious slot supporting Bob Dylan in Belfast next month.\nThere have been other tour supports already – notably with Jamie Cullum and Gary Jules – and it’s live that Paulusma’s songs really come to life. Rather than appealing to the cosy, middle-aged masses like Katie Melua’s, her songs, at a well-attended Bush Hall, were raw, sparsely accompanied and surprisingly sassy.\nDuring the show’s opener and forthcoming single, Give it Back, Paulusma attacked her acoustic guitar, shook her dark curly hair and jumped about on the spot. Wearing an odd combo of trousers and shiny, knee-length dress, she was certainly no wallflower, chatting to the audience between songs, giggling at what a good time she was having, constantly switching guitars and taking a turn on the electric piano and introducing a band who, to be honest, didn’t get much of a look-in otherwise.\nPart of Paulusma’s strength is her lyrics. Admittedly it was hard to know what the Cambridge graduate and one-time novelist was on about a lot of the time, but there was clearly some clever thinking behind what were never traditionally love songs, On the sweet, slightly jazzy She Moves in Secret Ways Paulusma sang of girls who move with grace and guys in choirboys’ attire: on the striking, stripped down, country-tinged One Day she crammed on lines about sailing boats and whiskey bottles: and on the stand out song Mea Culpa, skirted around a friend’s suicide.\nAlthough she has been compared to Norah Jones, Paulusma’s poetic lyrics – and, at times, her vocals – had mush more in common with Joni Mitchell. Then again, a couple of her numbers recalled Aimee Mann, you could hear Sophie B Hawkins in her ballads and you wouldn’t go far wrong calling her a female David Gray. Presumably, she just wants to be Polly, and it’s fair to say that she could certainly have carried the gig alone.\nAs it was, she had a bass and double-bass player and a drummer crammed in a corner, and a trio of songs brought out a string quartet. She should have used the strings players more, but no doubt there will be other opportunities. Paulusma has the potential to be a huge word-of-mouth success.\n \nRockfeedback.com\n06 May 2004\nBush Hall, 5th May 2004\nThe ground beneath your feet is shaking, your pint visibly disturbed on the table. And you’re a little confused, given that your line of sight encompasses only audience members sat, similarly, at their tables, and a rather pretty girl on the stage with an acoustic guitar. For a moment you wonder if, as Carole King so famously sang, you’re feeling the earth move under your feet… but in fact this curly-haired songstress is merely stamping with such forceful enjoyment in her simple chords, you can feel it three rows back.\nThe smile on her face, the rhythmic strumming and her exemplary stomping already have most tapping their feet, but it’s now that it kicks in: her voice has been slowly turning attention from the bar with its palpable honesty and melody, but it suddenly breaks into full flight, along with the drums and double-bass you hadn’t noticed before… and it’s indefinably breathtaking.\nWhat it might be is the contrast. Polly Paulusma’s been blessed with many talents… superb songsmithery and lyrics, the looks and locks of a Greek goddess, and angelic tone. But she also laughs as abrasively as a cockney cab-driver, screws her face up like a leprechaun when she’s enjoying herself, and describes having her own guitar technician as ‘like wiping your ass with silk’. Her outfit is a shimmering display of flawless wardrobe, until rockfeedback catch a glimpse of her trainers as she walks to the piano.\nThese attractive contradictions are not in such evidence in her songs, however. Every number Polly sings is simultaneously heart-rendingly and heart-warmingly sincere. In ‘Mea Culpa’, a song of rail-track suicide, she’s practically in tears, emotion welling in her voice. It’s a mood she revisits later, but elsewhere she’s vibrant and grinning, singing of love for old loves with infectious happiness.\nIt is, in fact, a string-quartet, hired in for the night’s performance, which provides the most captivating moment. Abandoning both guitar and piano for the encore, we’re left with an exquisite rendering of ‘Perfect 4/4’, with but the quartet and Polly’s tortured vocals echoing the agonies of the song’s hospitalised subject. But, best of all, even with such an unfathomable well of empathy and a beneficent muse, she still can’t help but introduce the song by exclaiming, ‘Ah bollocks, it’s the last one’.\nThe gig ends as it should: Polly’s debut album, Scissors In My Pocket sells out, and those who already own it are left with the pang of desire for more material, despite it only having been released last month. The girl is certainly on the train to acclaim. But there’s that feeling in your stomach, as if something internally has been challenged and changed during the course of the night, that leaves you confident that Polly Paulusma could soon move on to become groundbreaking, not long to be content with merely moving the earth beneath our feet.\n \nUNCUT Magazine (UK)\n01 May 2004\nAstonishingly mature debut from Britain\\'s brainiest new singer-songwriter\n* * * *\nby Nigel Williamson\nFrighteningly clever with her first in English from Cambridge, Polly Paulusma might have become and academic or a novelist. Fortunately, she turned instead to music. Scissors In My Pocket is an album for connoisseurs of grown-up songwriting, littered with arresting references, both literary and musical.\nSomething To Remember Me By is inspired by Shelley\\'s Ozymandias. The lovely string arrangement on One Day subtly acknowledges Eleanor Rigby. Yet Paulusma\\'s songs are also strikingly original, and full to the brim with potent melodies, unusual chords, meltingly heartfelt vocals and sharp emotional resonance.\nJoni Mitchell gave up songwriting after 1994\\'s Turbulent Indigo. A decade on, we may finally have found a worthy successor.\n \nMOJO Magazine (UK)\n01 May 2004\nBen &amp; Jason/Beth Orton associate steps out alone\n* * * *\nby Martin Aston\nWith chart-topping Katie Melua reaping all that Radio 2 support, by rights, Polly Paulusma should join her. Parkie\\'s a fan, and you\\'d imagine R2\\'s DJs should concur, given that she belongs more to the John Martyn-Nick Drake school of folk-jazz intimacy than Melua\\'s Mike Batt-created MOR. Polly\\'s extra arranging, producing and engineering skills explain why this debut feels complete, pure and personal. Give It Back swings while Over The Hill is as carefree as larks, but the girl\\'s a born troubadour. Buoyed by elastic bass and the lightest of strings, the album\\'s four key ballads One Day, Mea Culpa, Perfect 4/4 and Anywhere From Here are irresistible. Lyrically an unashamed romantic but rarely too florid (\"wires fan before you, they draw you/In deep troughs and sharp peaks of green\" is a gorgeous image) and vocally a smokier, breathier Melanie, she\\'s got the tools for scaling giddy chart heights.\n \nINDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY\n30 April 2004\nShe’s just finished touring with Jamie Cullum (“He’s so brilliant at what he does – a real fire cracker!”) and Michael Parkinson loves her (these days, a sure sign of success), but it was a while before singer songwriter Polly Paulusma realised her future lay in music. “For ages I was convinced I’d be a journalist,” she admits. “Then I started an MPhil, hated it and started writing a novel in between playing gigs at a pub, I got an agent and was on draft seven when I realised that I hated that too and had to do music.” So the 28-year-old Cambridge graduate swapped dusty libraries for her garden shed, where she wrote and recorded the folk-pop album Scissors In My Pocket. Paulusma (pronounced “Pole-sma”) is hoping it will be well received: “My parents have always been a bit funny about me doing music,” she says. “I had to upset a lot of people to do it.” Still, at least if it goes horribly wrong, at least she has a career plan C to fall back on. “Although,” she whispers, “I had a look at the novel the other day and it was awful.” The same, luckily, cannot be said for her debut album, out this month.\n \nLogo-magazine.com\n26 April 2004\nThere’s something disconcertingly familiar about Polly Paulusma, and it’s immediately obvious. Though her voice is unique, it bears the hallmarks of every female singer-songwriter of note to have emerged in the last thirty years: Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Suzanne Vega, even Alanis Morissette. It’s disconcerting because she’s adept at summoning the spirits of all of them, yet never quite descends into homage, pastiche or parody. Far from it, her poetic lyrics are the result of a good education (a first in English at Cambridge), her presence the result of an apprenticeship served as backing singer for Ben &amp; Jason, and her impact the result of that charismatic, chameleonic voice. Jason and The Argonauts were warned about the Sirens whose irresistible songs would lure them onto the rocks; it seems one of them has been reborn.\n \nMSN.co.uk\n26 April 2004\nThe singer-songwriter is something of a resurrected breed for the 21st Century. Particularly the laid-back female variety. Polly Paulusma is the UK\\'s latest and fits firmly into the old school bracket with cryptically poetic lyrics (she has a first in English from Cambridge and knows how to use it!) and gently lilting melodies.\nHer voice is decidedly distinctive. Inevitable Norah Jones comparisons aside, this is a girl with a south London accent, giving her songs such as Dark Side and One Day an endearing naivety with an underlying sense of experience and passion. Musically she\\'s closer to many a female vocalists icon, the young Joni Mitchell rather than the jazz and country greats often referenced by other singers. She\\'s adventurous enough to incorporate elements of Latin (Mea Culpa) and rock (Perfect 4/4).\nAn enchanting debut from a very bright British talent.\n \nUNCUT Magazine (UK)\n01 February 2004\nAlso, listen out for the forthcoming debut album on One Little Indian from an extraordinary new British singer-songwriter called Polly Paulusma. And remember you read the name here first.\n \nPolly Paulusma: The Making of Scissors In My Pocket\n01 January 2004\nPolly\\'s first album, released on One Little Indian in April 2004, was recorded largely in Polly\\'s garden shed during the glorious summer of 2003.\nPolly had sung backing vocals on Ben &amp; Jason’s 2001 album ‘Ten Songs About You’. “It was meant to be one last hurrah in my musical career before I got a proper job,” she recalls. “Instead, after singing with them it became blindingly obvious to me that I had to do music. Everything else felt wrong. I realised I wasn’t facing up to the truth.” It wasn\\'t long before she was making her first album by herself.\nAs chance would have it, while she was making the record, One Little Indian heard an earlier demo and approached her. “It was ironic, really,” she says. “It was only once I’d decided to make the album on my own that a record label came along.” By the time the deal was done, the recording had already been finished, entirely on Polly’s own terms.\nOli Hayhurst on double bass and Rastko Rasic on drums came in “to colour in all the black and white parts”. And thanks to some tolerant neighbours, organ, dulcimer, trumpet and a variety of other textures were added in the garden shed during the summer of 2003.\nThere are 11 songs on the album, and all are characterised by hook-laden melodies, insightful lyrics and Polly’s distinctive vocals. Scissors In My Pocket is a record that has led many to describe her as a modern-day Joni Mitchell.\nOn some of the tracks Polly, who produced most of the album herself, went back to her original demos. Dark Side, the album’s captivating opener, is the original recording from her first demo three years ago, produced by Ben Parker (Ben &amp; Jason). One Day and Over The Hill are also the original demos. “There was such a vibe to them that it seemed ridiculous to try and redo them,” she explains.\nTogether with newer songs such as the lyrical She Moves In Secret Ways, Mea Culpa and the intoxicating Anywhere From Here, the result is a debut album of extraordinary craft and imagination from a naturally gifted storyteller.\nWhere do these enchanting, insightful, beautiful songs come from? She really isn’t sure. “I’m mystified by it. I’ve no idea how it works. You have to make a window of time every day and hope something comes in. And you can\\'t allow life to get in the way.” But mystery or not, you surely won’t hear a better new singer-songwriter in the whole of 2004.\n \nPolly Paulusma: Biography\n01 January 2004\n“When I was eight, I built a raft at the bottom of the garden from a bit of old fence,” Polly recalls. “I nagged my mum to take it down to the river. She eventually gave in but she insisted it had to be attached to a rope and she would hold on to it. So I hid a pair of scissors in my pocket. I was planning to cut the rope and sail off to London. I didn’t get very far. But I had the same feeling towards making this record. It was about defiance and taking your life in your own hands. I was a real handful, I can tell you.”\nWhich perhaps explains why soon after the raft incident, Polly was packed off to an all-girl\\'s convent school. But if the sisters entertained hopes of taming her maverick spirit, their ministrations had a different effect. \"They taught me how to be self-contained, how to stand on my own two feet. I also had a pretty wild time,\" she recalls.\nShe also began to find her musical voice. Polly rebelled against formal piano lessons at an early age and wrote her first song at ten (actually a re-write of a Paul McCartney track - “I liked the tune but I decided he’d written the wrong words, so I wrote my own. Something about swans. Much better than his”).\nThe onset of her teens coincided with the rise of \\'baggy\\' – the musical scene that grew out of the clubs in Manchester, England. She loved everything about it, learned guitar and was soon \"entertaining everyone at school and showing off,\" as she puts it. Baggy didn\\'t last long. But it was the starting point of a musical journey. \"I began to work my way back through the annals and I came upon people like Joni Mitchell and Nick Drake. That moment of discovery is amazing. It\\'s something you can never recapture,\" she recalls.\nIt inspired her own songwriting, although when she left school and went up to Cambridge she joined a ten-piece soul-funk covers band, “a bit like the Commitments,” and suffered regular bouts of laryngitis shouting herself hoarse doing Janis Joplin impressions.\nAfter graduating, she moved to London and formed a new band doing original material. But music was still only a hobby. “I convinced myself I had to have a proper grown-up respectable career,” she remembers. She considered becoming an academic and began a PhD, only to abandon it after a term. She could have been a journalist, and briefly took a job at the BBC World Service as a researcher. She also considered a career as a novelist, and even got as far as placing her manuscript with a literary agent.\nBy the time she was asked to sing backing vocals on Ben &amp; Jason’s 2001 album ‘Ten Songs About You’, she had quit the band. “It was meant to be one last hurrah in my musical career before I got a proper job,” she recalls. “Instead singing with them it became blindingly obvious I had to do music,” she recalls. “Everything else felt wrong. I realized I wasn’t facing up to the truth. I was like a moth going round a flame and I had to plunge in.”\nThe novel was cast aside and she began playing solo gigs at acoustic venues such as the late-lamented Kashmir Klub. Two years of gigging and selling hand-made recordings from the stage meant that when she came to record her first album, she had 40 songs to draw upon.\nOli Hayhurst on double bass and Rastko Rasic on drums came in “to color in all the black and white parts”. And thanks to some tolerant neighbours, organ, dulcimer, trumpet and a variety of other textures were added in the garden shed during the summer of 2003. The basic philosophy was no click tracks, as few edits as possible and as much playing live as was feasible. On several tracks, Polly, who produced the album herself, went back to her original demos. Dark Side, the album’s captivating opener, is the original recording of the song from her first demo three years ago, produced by Ben Parker (Ben &amp; Jason). One Day and Over The Hill are also the original demos. “There was such a vibe to them that it seemed ridiculous to try and redo them,” she explains.\nWhere do these enchanting, insightful, beautiful songs come from? She really isn’t sure. “I’m mystified by it. I’ve no idea how it works. You have to make a window of time every day and hope something comes and not allow life to get in the way.”\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiv8e7sq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.1493,52.955073]}},{"properties":{"name":"Polly's Cafe and Bakery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/4/benter.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/4/166324922_100def4974.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 9791 Adams Avenue, Huntington Beach, CA 92646-4804I like the salt water taffies from here - 16 assorted flavors!

It was a lot harder to skate because you have to use you weight to push yourself up and down the rough concrete terrain. Later, we went to Rancho Alamitos High School where there are manholes by the football field bleachers. These manholes are perfect for ollie grabs and other combos. I pulled an ollie impossible over a trash can here (if I remembered correctly) while Mike was doing Japan grabs (pictured).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj1wagwx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.986555,33.799477]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ray's Pizza - Irvine","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/201301982_d340e88ba5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/201325327_4c8c08dd4b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/3/201324121_95c169a7cc.jpg\">4199 Campus Dr, Irvine, CARay\\'s Pizza - Irvine (949) 854-5044<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxjaupudr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.840197,33.649465]}},{"properties":{"name":"Really Bad Slam on a Handrail","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/c334df15b38774877aae67614df6451f.jpg\">Back of Home Depot warehouseMy friend Christian (pictured) was a \"fast\" and \"hardcore\" street skater. When ever you go skating with him, you better do a maintenance check on your board because you\\'ll be sliding down a freeway bridge, underground mall parking lot, or the damaged sidewalks of Westminster. We were skating through the back of Home Depot one day where there was this long, chest-height, flat-level handrail by the loading area. That\\'s when he decided to rail slide it without giving it a second thought. We were traveling pretty fast when he suddenly kicked up his board, grabbed it, and jump up onto the hand rail, but he didn\\'t slide far because there were no slant to the hand rail at all. This is where it got bad...his board hung up, came to a halt, and he flew off it and landed on his crotch and busted his nuts on the handrail. I mean his legs didn\\'t even touch ground and it has hard.

The pair, Torbjørn Brundtland and Svein Berge, both grew up in Tromsø and began recording in the early \\'90s. Local-made-good Geir Jenssen (aka Biosphere) provided tutelage and almost convinced the duo to record for R&amp;S sublabel Apollo. After a few years apart, Brundtland and Berge met up again in Bergen and re-formed Röyksopp in 1998.\n\nThe group released a few singles on Tellé, then signed up to the big beat label Wall of Sound. The Röyksopp debut was 2001\\'s Eple single; both \"Eple\" and another track (\"Poor Leno\") earned slots on over a dozen chillout compilations that year or the next. Their first full-length, Melody A.M., appeared in late 2001. After spending a few years performing live and remixing artists including Beck and Annie, Röyksopp returned with new material in 2005: the single Only This Moment heralded the summer release of the duo\\'s second album, The Understanding, which featured more traditionally structured songs than their earlier work.

The canyon was a major thoroughfare for early settlers who settled in its scenic side canyons—Baker, Black Star, Silverado and Modjeska. \r\nTraces of Orange County\\'s earliest residents were discovered at nearby Black Star Canyon. Arrowheads and rocks pockmarked with grinder holes—signs that the Indians ground acorns to produce an edible gruel—have been found on the plateau high above the canyon, where a large Indian village once existed. \r\n\r\nBlack Star Canyon got its name in the 1870s, when Black Star Mining Company began mining for coal that recently had been discovered there.

Ghahreman has worked around the world, including stints as the executive chef at Four Seasons properties in Malaysia, Hawaii, Turkey, Singapore and Maui.\n\nDetails: The star of the new center at Coast Highway and Brooks Street is the 120-seat restaurant and bar Sapphire Laguna. It’s reminiscent of an Indonesian beach resort — distressed wood floor, a ceiling framed with wood beams, and a view of the ocean; with Laguna artistic touches like glasswork by John Barber and plein art paintings.\n\nThe menu is an eclectic collection of international comfort food, inspired by Ghahreman’s love for fresh street food. The Malaysian black pepper shrimp, for example, is an uncomplicated but exhilarating concoction of crustaceans tossed in a sauce with fiery, dry-fried black pepper. The outdoor tables are perfect for crowd watching.\n\nNext door, Ghahreman has set up Sapphire Pantry, a 930-square foot gourmet shop with fine wines, artisan cheeses, and produce like the chef’s homemade preserved lemons, apricot preserve from Napa, and black truffle oil from France.

Born in the San Fernando Valley and inspired by her grandmother, who would play ukulele around town, Parsley\\'s first gig was singing with a 99-piece senior-citizen banjo band at a local pizza place. At the age of 13, she left home, traveling the country and pursuing her love of music. She met guitarist Duke McVinnie, whom had worked with Exene Cervenka, Johnny Otis, and J.J. Cale, at a recording studio where Parsley was tracking, and he began to work with her after making some suggestions. When keyboardist Danny McGough, who had toured with Tom Waits, heard Parsley\\'s music at a party, he introduced himself, completing the trio which was initially known as Junebug. With their name changed to Shivaree (Parsley came across the word in a Jesse James bio), they recorded a debut which was promptly discarded. Enlisting singer/songwriter Joe Henry as a producer, they recorded I Oughtta Give You a Shot in the Head for Making Me Live in This Dump in Henry\\'s backyard. Released in 1999, the album was well-received, with Parsley\\'s striking looks and their quirky take on Americana and alt-country drawing comparisons ranging from Tom Waits to Cowboy Junkies to Billie Holiday. The band spent a lengthy stint on the road where Parsley, overcoming stage fright, captivated crowds, particularly in Europe where they were drawing enthusiastic praise. Shivaree returned with Rough Dreams, which bowed on Capitol in September 2002. 2004 saw the realese of an EP, Breach, featuring two originals as well as covers of songs by Brian Eno, the Waterboys and John Cale. Later that same year, the group put out the full-length Who\\'s Got Trouble?\n\n- allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj3x5ffm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.438056,34.281944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shore House Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 520 Main St., Huntington Beach, CABreakfast served all hours: Great fluffy omelettes, yummy potatoes.

Boasting a powerful, soulful voice, she worked the Adelaide jazz circuit during the \\'90s as a vocalist for the band Crisp. However, the blonde, blue-eyed antipodean\\'s big break came only after she followed in the footsteps of many other Aussie artists and hopped on a plane to the U.K. While in London, Sia landed a gig as a backup singer for the very popular and extremely hip English outfit Jamiroquai. In early 2000, she released her first solo single, the alternative pop tune \"Taken for Granted,\" which debuted at number ten on the busy U.K. singles chart.\r\n\r\nSoon after, a string of big names in the British music scene were asking for Sia\\'s services; projects with Massive Attack, Zero 7, and William Orbit ensued. In mid-2001, Sia once again made a splash on the U.K. singles chart with the moody offering \"Drink to Get Drunk,\" a track that would appear on her 2002 full-length debut, Healing Is Difficult. Ironically, it was only after her considerable success abroad that she began to make a real impact down under. Colour the Small One appeared a year later. The track \"Breathe Me\" from the album gained attention when it was used in the elaborate final scene of the Six Feet Under series that aired in 2005.\r\n\r\n-allmusic.com\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj0ejos5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.435973,55.378051]}},{"properties":{"name":"Side Street Cafe","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/159464011_48027085f6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/2/159464569_74e3f254a1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/breakfastlist1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1799 Newport Blvd Ste A105, Costa Mesa, CAThe banana pancakes are yummilicious.

The new album features the vocal talents of Andrea Britton and UK hip-hop MC Bobby Whiskers among others. It will be released later this year.

After experimenting with alternative food items, he opened three Taco-Tia stands between 1954 and 1955, which he later sold to his partners. He then opened the first Taco Bell in Downey, California on March 21, 1962.\n\nThe first Taco Bell franchise was sold in 1964 and the company went public in 1969. In 1978, Bell sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain was spun off along with Pepsi\\'s other fast food restaurant holdings as Tricon Global Restaurants in October 1997. Tricon became Yum! Brands, Inc. in May 2002.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Taco Bell changed its menu due to pressure concerning the nutritional value of items labeled \"Lite\". It was believed the term lite was vague or possibly deceptive. Many of the items were dropped entirely from the menu; one such item was the \"Taco Lite\", a fried flour tortilla shell with beef, sour cream, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. Some items were altered to change the nutritional values, such as the removal of black olives from the list of ingredients, in an effort to reduce sodium.\n\nIn early 1995, Taco Bell transformed the familiar rainbow logo, in favor of a simpler pink/purple combo logo in an effort to revitalize their almost 20 year old logo.\n\nOn April 1, 1996, Taco Bell took out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times announcing that they had purchased the Liberty Bell to \"reduce the country\\'s debt\" and renamed it to \"the Taco Liberty Bell.\" Thousands of people who did not immediately get the April Fool\\'s Day hoax protested.\n\nIn 2003, Costa Rican Taco Bell franchises temporary marketed their tacos as \"Tacos ticos,\" because for Costa Ricans, the word \"taco\" refers to what is known in Mexico as a flauta. (\"Tico\" and \"Costarrican\" are colloqial terms for natives of Costa Rica.)\n\nIn 2004, Taco Bell bought the naming rights to the Boise State Pavilion in Boise, Idaho and renamed the stadium the Taco Bell Arena.\n\nIn 2004, PepsiCo and Taco Bell introduced Mountain Dew Baja Blast. The tropical-lime flavored drink is exclusive to Taco Bell stores. Along with this, Taco Bell introduced its Mountain Dew Viva Variety! promotional campaign, where a sign shows three cups of Mountain Dew, one normal, one Code Red and one Baja Blast.\n\nAdded to the official menu in early 2006, the Crunchwrap Supreme is Taco Bell\\'s latest permanent product. Their most recent \"limited time only\" item was the Chicken Caesar Grilled Stuft Burrito.\n\nIn Canada, there were no Taco Bells in the province of Quebec before 2006. Priszm Brandz announced in April of that year that their first Quebec Taco Bell would open in suburban Montreal during the summer with 20 to 30 more to follow across the province.\n\n-wikipedia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj81yu4p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.850298,33.68305]}},{"properties":{"name":"Taco Loco","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/Lag_TacoLoco.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 640 S.

He only sang one of the tracks, however, giving all of the remaining lead vocal slots to alternative rock faves like Barbara Manning, Dean Wareham (Luna), Georgia Hubley (Yo La Tengo), Chris Knox, Lou Barlow, Robert Scott (the Bats), Chris Knox, and Mary Timony (Helium). Brighter and poppier than his contemporaneous efforts with Magnetic Fields, it demonstrated (intentionally or inadvertently) that his principal talents are as a producer and composer, rather than a performer. Hot on the heels of the well-received Magnetic Fields project 69 Love Songs, Merritt released his second 6ths album, Hyacinths and Thistles, with vocal help from Marc Almond, Bob Mould, Gary Numan, and Sarah Cracknell, among others.\n\n- allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxiuv0qc5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Arches Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://www.thearchesrestaurant.com/images/champagnes.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3334 W.

He has superhuman strength and agility and can perform amazing acrobatic feats. His feet are as agile as his hands and can be used to perform any action his hands are able to. He is also able to rapidly heal himself from injuries.\n\nThe Beast is also extremely intelligent, and is considered to have an intellect that rivals many of the elite thinkers in the Marvel universe. He has a doctorate from the Xavier Institute and is well versed in the areas of genetics and biochemistry.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\nX-Men, Ultimate X-Men\nCurrently Seen In:\nAstonishing X-Men, Ultimate X-Men\n\nInteresting Fact: \nThe Beast’s blue fur and animalistic features are because Hank McCoy tested an unknown chemical on himself.\n\nOrigin: \nHank McCoy grew up with over-sized hands and feet that were early proof that he was a mutant. He made up for these deformities by becoming a star athlete, but as his mutant powers emerged and became known, he was asked to leave his school. Even his parents were cold to him and regarded him with suspicion and fear since his father worked at a local nuclear power plant and it was assumed that Hank’s mutations were because of this.\n\nProfessor X approached Hank and asked him to come as a student to the Xavier Institute where he would be free from prejudice, have an advanced education, and could work out in a highly advanced danger room. Hank quickly agreed. He became one of the first to graduate the school.\n\nLater, Hank worked for the Brand Corporation and there discovered a chemical that induced mutations. He found that his invention was going to be stolen and used it on himself to prevent this. The results truly make Hank McCoy a beast, with gray fur that later became blue, fangs, claws, and pointed ears. Despite this setback, Hank kept a happy-go-lucky outlook on life. He even worked with the Avengers, led the super hero team The Defenders, and helped to start X-Factor. Hank eventually returned to The X-Men.\n\nIt wasn’t until later that a second mutation brought about a more catlike appearance, and completely shook Hank’s belief in himself. Hank could feel his feral instincts wanting to come forth and he worries that he is becoming more beast than man. Even through all of this Hank McCoy continues to be easygoing and joyful around his teammates, often using his rapier wit to mask his fears.\n\nHanks is the current scientist in residence at the Xavier Institute. No matter what the future holds for him, Hank knows that he will always have an accepting home with The X-Men as they continue to fight to make the world a safe place for both mutants and humans.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj95hwdn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Bluebird Bakery","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/cake_bluebirds.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/3t_choc_rasp_wed.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/f64d7f0db2deb02c65e3889aa1f09ee8.jpg\">8572 National Boulevard, Culver City, California 90232Bluebird bakery offers some homey cakes, pies, and petits fours in an Italy-meets-Vermont cafe in an industrial section of Culver City.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj7v9ost"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.380667,34.026883]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Bluffs","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/the_bluffs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/9_04_f6a.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 1302-1380 Bison Avenue, Newport Beach, CA 92660\"A mother and her teen-age son share a laugh in front of the fireplace.

After making a glorious racket for a few years, they were joined by Martin Hansson, Daniel Varjo, Ulrik Karlsson, Per Nystrom and Ludvig Rylander to become The Concretes we know today. (more Honoury Concretes appear from time to time in the studio and onstage)... The Licking Fingers label is set-up by the band to release a series of EPs (a US collection of them, Boyoubetterunow, was released but is no longer available)... The Concretes first album proper was recorded in 2003 in a wood cabin in the countryside with Swedish producer/musician Jari Haapalainen. After a frantic label scramble, the band signed to EMI Records and toured the world... 2005 was mainly a quiet year, although a few Concretes related spottings have been made first up, Layourbattleaxedown, an American-only compilation of B sides and studio outtakes was released in the Summer; their cover of The Rolling Stones Miss You was picked up by UK DJ Erol Alkan for his Bugged Out! Mix album; Lisa &amp; Maria promoted their own club night in Stockholm called Ooh La La and Victoria starred in a video for the New Order classic Temptation (as seen on the recent DVD release, Item). All the while though, the band were busy writing and recording new album In Colour in Stockholm and Omaha with Nebraskan producer Mike Mogis (Conor Obersts longtime co-conspirator and live musical director and producer for Bright Eyes and Rilo Kiley)... 2006: The Concretes are now now officially on manoeuvres...\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj0fwrx9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.831055,63.134503]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Corrs (Dundalk, Ireland)","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/ab8b643047d1f50db6042693d47fb7eb.jpg\">Dundalk, IrelandThe Corrs - Summer Wine (live w/ Bono)\n\nComprising three sisters and one brother of the Corr family -- vocalist Andrea, drummer Caroline, violinist Sharon and guitarist/keyboard player Jim -- the Corrs blend the music of their Irish background with contemporary pop/rock and occasional use of synthesizers. The quartet formed in 1991, and was confined to regional popularity in Ireland until 1994, when the American ambassador to the country invited the Corrs to perform at the 1994 World Cup in Boston. The attraction led to a support slot on Celine Dion\\'s 1996 tour, which the group joined just after an appearance at that year\\'s Olympic Games in Atlanta. The Corrs\\' debut album Forgiven, Not Forgotten (released on Lava/Atlantic in America) became internationally popular, but nowhere more so than their homeland, where the LP\\'s four-times-platinum status made it one of the most popular debuts by an Irish group. Talk on Corners followed in 1998, and was reissued in expanded form early the following year. Andrea Corr, who had made a small appearance in the 1991 film The Commitments, returned to acting five years later with a role in Evita. The group returned to the studio and produced a fourth album in 2000, In Blue. VH1 Presents the Corrs: Live in Dublin was released in 2002 while the band took a break. Caroline had a baby and Andrea appeared on the In America soundtrack, performing vocals on the Bono/Gavin Friday-penned \"Time Enough for Tears.\" A new version of the Oscar-nominated song appeared on the Corrs\\' 2004 return, Borrowed Heaven.

Citing Serge Gainsbourg as a major influence, the band combines cabaret-style vocals with a moody, intense brand of orchestral pop/rock. Lightburn\\'s vision for the band is to create music out of real emotions, often giving his performances the feel of a musical therapy session. Given the level of intensity that this vision can require, it\\'s not surprising that the Dears have endured numerous member defections, including a guitarist, drummer, and two bass players. The Dears released their debut CD, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, on Grenadine Records in 2000. In early 2001, the band entered the studio to record the follow-up, tentatively titled Deuxième Partie.

Merritt writes, produces, and (generally) sings all of their material, as well as plays many of the instruments, concocting a sort of indie pop synth rock. While the Magnetic Fields may draw upon the electronic textures of vintage acts like ABBA, Kraftwerk, Roxy Music with Eno, Joy Division, and Gary Numan, Merritt\\'s vision is far more pointed toward the alternative rock underground. His songs are also far warmer and more pure pop-oriented than the above reference points might lead you to believe, sounding at times like late-20th century equivalents to Phil Spector or Brian Wilson.\n\nMerritt had been recording on his own four-track from a very young age, but didn\\'t issue the first Magnetic Fields album until 1990, when he was well into his twenties. The first pair of discs featured the choirgirl vocals of Susan Amway, and are probably the most accessible offerings for general listeners wary of electro-rock. On subsequent releases, Merritt handled the vocals himself in a deep croon not far removed from his European influences. The synth pop quotient also became heavier, although Merritt has always taken care to mix in quite a few natural instruments with the electronic ones, often with the help of Claudia Gonson (percussion) and Sam Davol (cello, flute). The emphasis has always remained on the pop hooks and eccentric, romantically reflective lyrics rather than the bedrock synthetic rhythms and textures.\n\nIn addition to his work with Magnetic Fields, Merritt has involved himself in several side projects, the most notable being the 6ths\\' Wasps\\' Nests album (1995). Merritt sang only one track himself on this disc, for which he acted as composer/producer/multi-instrumentalist, employing well-known alternative rock singers like Barbara Manning, Dean Wareham (Luna), Lou Barlow, Georgia Hubley (Yo La Tengo), Chris Knox, and Robert Scott (the Bats) to handle the lead vocals. After releasing 1997\\'s New Despair as the Gothic Archies, Merritt finally returned to the Magnetic Fields aegis for 1999\\'s 69 Love Songs, released as both a trio of separate discs as well as a limited edition three-CD box set. Merritt spent the next few years releasing more side projects, including records from the Gothic Archies, Future Bible Heroes, the 6ths, as well as numerous soundtracks. It wasn\\'t until May 2004 that Merritt and his Magnetic Fields finally got around to making i, a collection of songs that begin with the aforementioned vowel.\n\n- allmusic.com\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxj7vs3n0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Melting Pot","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/Irvine,_CAIrvine1.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2646 Dupont Dr. Ste.

Upon relocating from Sacramento, CA, to Portland, OR, Melberg first established the trio Go Sailor, still a going concern when she teamed with Pretty Face alum (and publisher of the fanzine Sparkly Kitty Sticker) Jen Sbragia to found the Softies. The indie-pop duo bowed in early 1995 with \"Loveseat,\" a single issued on the Slumberland label; their gorgeous debut LP It\\'s Love followed later in the year on Calvin Johnson\\'s K label. After a self-titled 1996 Slumberland 10\", the Softies returned to K in early 1997 to issue their sophomore effort, Winter Pageant; at the same time, both Melberg and Sbragia also teamed with Class\\' Peter Green in the Three Peeps.

Born in Southern California and later moving to Florida, Keller began his culinary career, as a teenager, working in a Palm Beach restaurant managed by his mother.\n\nHis passion for cooking took him to France in 1983, to apprentice in the kitchens of Guy Savoy, Michael Pasquet, Gerard Besson, Taillevent, Le Toit de Passey, Chiberta and Le Pré Catelan.\n\n  \t\n\nReturning to New York City in 1984, he gained recognition at La Reserve and Restaurant Raphael, before opening his first restaurant, Rakel, in 1986. He received rave reviews for five years until he moved to Los Angeles as executive chef of Checkers Hotel.\n\nKeller purchased The French Laundry in 1994, with the goal of creating a three-star country French restaurant in the heart of the Napa Valley. Keller credits his staff for the many accolades and awards that the restaurant has received. The French Laundry Cookbook, authored by Keller, was awarded three 1999 International Association of Culinary Professionals awards, including Cookbook of the Year, as well as the 1999 Versailles Cookbook Award in Paris.\n\nIn 1998, Keller opened Bouchon, also located in Yountville. The casual French bistro, designed by Adam Tihany, has been a favorite for locals and a destination as well. More recently, he opened Bouchon Bakery next door. Keller also collaborated with Raynaud and the design firm Level on a collection of simple yet sophisticated white porcelain dinnerware called Point (in homage to the great French chef and restaurateur, Fernand Point). Keller has also delved into the world of wines. Modicum, a Napa Valley Cabernet, has been developed with French Laundry General Manager Laura Cunningham. In 2004, he opened Bouchon at the Venetian Resort-Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas as well as the highly anticipated Per Se in the Time Warner Building in New York City.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"abelxivji555"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thousand Steps Beach","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/0022.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/763845_Travel_Picture_1000_Steps_Beach_looking_down_the_stairs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> A pristine beach with the infamous stairway.

Coming down was the hardest part of our nurtured youth. 1/2 mile into town, I pulled over on the side of the road and asked you to take the wheels. You drove us out of town and through a passageway between firm canyons and shadowy skies. I turned my vision towards the vastness of the universe. The constellations of heavenly bodies above look like chandeliers of shining stars. Do so yet again; and everytime my gaze will fall back upon you, dazzled and tired. You asked me if I was okay; smiled at me when I said \"Yes\".

I feel my astral body getting loose from my physical one. I am half floating. The experience is so real. I am not dreaming. The landscape begins to blur and wash out into a blinding white; what felt like inbetween (the universe); an idle play or drug overdose.\n\nThe sun will overtake the moon. Eventually the two will be back to their original positions.\n\nDo so yet again, and my gaze fall back upon you. You asked me if I was okay. I told you I will be when we get home.
