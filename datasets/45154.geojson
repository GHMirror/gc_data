Some sources list his date of birth as February 14, 1819. Although he had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented. Norton also wrote to Queen Victoria, and he was referred to as His Imperial Majesty by local citizens and in the newspaper obituaries announcing his death.\r\n\r\nThough he was generally considered insane, or at least highly eccentric, the citizens of San Francisco (and the world at large) in the mid-to-late 19th century celebrated his presence, his humor, and his deeds—among the most notorious being his \"order\" that the U.S. Congress be dissolved by force, and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge to be built across San Francisco Bay. The King in Mark Twain\\'s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is reportedly modeled after him.\r\n\r\nHe is considered a saint by the followers of Discordianism and is referenced repeatedly in the seminal work of the religion, the Principia Discordia.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nNorton was born in England. Records vary as to the date and place of birth. His obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle, \"following the best information obtainable,\" cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was \"aged about 65.\" This suggests 1814 as his year of birth. Other, non-primary sources have his birth on February 14, 1819 in London. According to Drury (1986), immigration records indicate that he was two years old in 1820 when his parents emigrated to South Africa. Southern African genealogies suggest that his father was John Norton (d. August 1848) and his mother was Sarah Norden. Sarah was the daughter of Abraham Norden and niece of Benjamin Norden, a successful Jewish merchant, who displayed his eccentric side by frequently suing family members. This is supported by Cowan (1923) who stated that Emperor Norton I \"was of Hebrew [Jewish] parentage.\"\r\n\r\nNorton emigrated from South Africa to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a gift of 0,000 from his father (possibly his inheritance after his father\\'s death). He accumulated a fortune of 50,000 by 1853 (Cowan 1923). He enjoyed some highly impressive initial success in the real estate market when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice. The price of rice in San Francisco skyrocketed from 4¢ per pound to 36¢ per pound (9¢/kg to 79¢/kg). When Norton heard that a ship holding 200,000 pounds (100 tons) of rice was coming from Peru, he bought all the rice, hoping to corner the rice market. Unfortunately, shipload after shipload of rice came from Peru, and the price of rice plummeted. There was extensive litigation over the incident amongst Norton and his financial partners between 1853 and 1857. Although resulting in a victory for Norton in the lower courts, the cases eventually resulted in a defeat for Norton in the Supreme Court (Cowan 1923). Norton declared bankruptcy in 1858. He then left the city for a time, and shortly after returning announced his title to the offices of the Bulletin.\r\n\r\nThere are no known documents noting an eccentric personality or unusual behavior of Norton prior to the loss of his fortune, so it is not known whether his pronounced eccentricity was a permanent aspect of his psychology, or arose as a result of the stressful financial events of the 1850s. Nonetheless, after his sudden loss of financial stability, Norton seemed to become (in the absence of a proper diagnosis) somewhat \"odd,\" and began exhibiting delusions of grandeur, but it is entirely likely that all his declarations and behavior were the result of successful creative response to the pressure of poverty.\r\n\r\nSelf-proclamation\r\nHaving become fully disgruntled with the inadequacies of the political structure and state and federal governments of the United States, Norton took matters into his own hands on September 17, 1859, when, in letters to the various newspapers of the area, he summarily proclaimed himself \"Emperor of These United States\":\r\n\r\nAt the pre-emptory request of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last nine years and ten months past of San Francisco, California, declare and proclaim myself the Emperor of These United States.\r\n\r\nHe would, on occasion, add \"Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year \"reign\" over America.\r\n\r\nDecrees\r\nIn accordance with his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of state. Deeming that he had assumed power, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree that formally \"dissolved\" the United States Congress. He also observed that\r\n\r\n\"…fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Emperor ordered that \"all interested parties\" gather at Platt\\'s Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 so as to \"remedy the evil complained of.\"\r\n\r\nIn another imperial \"decree\" of January 1860, Emperor Norton I summoned the army to depose the elected officials of Congress:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished; \r\nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with; \r\nNOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress. \r\nNorton\\'s \"orders\" had no effect on the army, and the Congress likewise continued in its activities unperturbed. Norton issued further \"decrees\" in 1860 that purported to dissolve the republic and to forbid the assembly of any members of the Congress. These, like all of Norton\\'s decrees, passed unnoticed by the government in Washington, and by the nation at large. Norton\\'s battle against the elected leaders of America was to persist throughout his \"reign,\" though it appears that Norton eventually, if somewhat grudgingly, accepted that Congress would continue to exist without his permission.\r\n\r\nHis attempts to overthrow the elected government of America by force having been frustrated, Norton turned his attention and his proclamations to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, \"being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm,\" he \"abolished\" both the Democratic and Republican parties. On another occasion, the failure to refer to his adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:\r\n\r\nWhoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable word \"Frisco,\" which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nWhile it is unknown if he intended it as a formal decree, Norton called Minnie Rae, a preteen prostitute who worked in the city, \"the little countess.\" She apparently credited his pronouncement with saving her life in her \"autobiography\" (it is believed the book, which is now lost, was actually written by a journalist who interviewed her between 1871 to 1872).\r\n\r\nAfter examining a number of his \"Imperial Edicts,\" it is tempting to conjecture on the mental condition of America\\'s only sovereign monarch. Unfortunately, diagnosing the precise psychological condition of Norton is an impossibility, due to the anecdotal nature of all the documents that relate his behavior. It has been suggested that he may have been schizophrenic, as \"delusions of grandeur\" is a symptom frequently associated with that condition. However, it is also possible that he suffered from some other mental illness, or even that he was merely eccentric.\r\n\r\nFor all of his quirks and regardless of the precise nature of his psychological condition, it cannot be denied that Norton was, on some occasions, a visionary, and a number of his \"Imperial Decrees\" exhibited a profound wisdom. Among his many edicts were instructions to form a League of Nations, and he explicitly forbade any form of discord or conflict between religions or their sects. The Emperor also saw fit on a number of occasions to decree the construction of a suspension bridge connecting Oakland and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience being exhibited by the authorities:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees. \r\nGiven under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872. \r\nThis decree, unlike most, concerned events that eventually came to pass. Construction of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge began in 1933 and was completed in 1936. BART\\'s Transbay Tube was completed in 1969 and opened in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zpub.com/sf/history/nort.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63309ifm803"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.461759,37.679851]}},{"properties":{"name":"Find Your Niche at ze Neptune Society Columbarium","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/home_pic.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 1 Loraine Court San Francisco CA Creepy gothy rotunda wif ze olde ashes from San Francisco\\'s friendliest ghosties! arrrrroooooooo!

Anything a visitor may seek, San Francisco can provide. Echoes of fun and amusement ring throughout the city from the cable cars atop Nob Hill to the sea lions barking at the wharf. \r\n\r\nTurning back the clock to the Depression, we find San Francisco bubbling as a haven of fun even then. \r\n\r\nThe place to go was a now-vanished amusement park, Playland-at-the-Beach. During the Depression and World War II, Playland thrived. Adults and children, families and couples on dates, sailors from all over the world went to Playland to ride bumper cars and roller coasters and explore the thrills of the Funhouse. For many San Franciscans, Playland was and still is their childhood, 33 years after its demolition. \r\n\r\nPlayland was located at Ocean Beach, just north of Golden Gate Park, below the point where the land rises to Sutro Heights. The attractions in this corner of the city had the added novelty of being where Western civilization meets the Pacific Ocean -- in a way, at the end of the world. \r\n\r\nFrom the mural-bedecked Beach Chalet at the western end of the park to Playland to the Cliff House and Sutro Baths, the recreational options lined up in a long row. Much of this ended up as part of the pleasure empire of the man called the Barnum of the Golden Gate, George Whitney. \r\n\r\nA little amusement area named Ocean Beach Pavilion had existed since 1884. In 1912, Arthur Looff and his partner, John Friedle, built Looff\\'s Hippodrome, housing a grand carousel built by Looff\\'s father. In 1922, the two added the Big Dipper roller coaster and the Chutes-at-the-Beach water ride. Whitney and his brother Leo came to town and opened a photofinishing concession booth in a smaller version of Playland. \r\n\r\nIn 1926, Whitney became general manager, and the park became Whitney\\'s Playland-at-the-Beach. He bought out shaky concessionaires during the Depression. By 1942, he owned everything from Sutro Baths to Fulton Street. \r\n\r\nWhitney\\'s Playland grew to more than three blocks of amusements next to the Great Highway. It included Topsy\\'s Roost Restaurant, which later became Skateland; a midway of games and vendors; a diving bell; and, of course, the Funhouse with long wooden slides, a human turntable that spun and threw people off if they didn\\'t hang on, distorting mirrors and air jets that blew women\\'s skirts up. \r\n\r\nPlayland was also the birthplace of the It\\'s-It, Whitney\\'s invention of ice cream sandwiched by two oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate. \r\n\r\nOnly the newly remodeled and now far more upscale Cliff House and Beach Chalet still stand. A condominium development erased any trace of Playland. \r\n\r\nBlue-collar times \r\n\r\nAnyone who remembers Playland is wistful, or maybe just nostalgic, for the gritty, blue-collar San Francisco. \"It wasn\\'t just toys for the rich. It was toys for everyone,\" said Dan Fontes, a muralist working in El Cerrito on a large rendering of Playland and the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nSan Francisco has changed. The blue-collar neighborhoods are mostly gone, and amusement is often more solitary than when the Playland fun house rang with screams and laughter. Still, Playland has not been lost. Anyone can find it. Its fragments are scattered all over the city. \r\n\r\nPlayland is best remembered by a laugh, the one that belonged to a huge mechanical woman who towered above the entry to the Funhouse from the 1940s until it closed in 1972 and she was auctioned off. \r\n\r\nHer name was Laughing Sal. \r\n\r\nAnyone walking down Playland\\'s Midway -- even nearby neighbors -- heard Sal\\'s bellowing laugh. She had devilish curly red hair and huge freckles all over her fat, terrifying visage. In the middle of it all was a gap-toothed smile that provided nightmare material for countless children. This was creepy, the same way a ventriloquist\\'s dummy is. \r\n\r\n\"She would stand there laughing and laughing, and you would stand there laughing and laughing, and you didn\\'t know why,\" said Sharon Jessup, a San Francisco native who grew up going to Playland. Sal\\'s continuous laugh was a drunken yelping guffaw, an evil cackle, the uninhibited outburst of someone going out of her mind. With arms extended, she heaved back and forth with a bit of a bobbing motion in her huge glass box. \r\n\r\nSal was constructed by the Old King Cole papier-mache company under commission to the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., maker of amusement park furnishings. Old King Cole started with a mechanical laughing department store Santa Claus. They fitted the Santa with a woman\\'s legs, breasts that jiggled on the end of springs and custom-made heads. With the addition of a 78 rpm recording of the most memorable laugh in the world, Laughing Sal was born. \r\n\r\nBy the 1960s, Playland was run down and a little seedy. Some say it started downhill when Whitney tore down the Big Dipper roller coaster in the late 1950s. Sutro Baths burned during its demolition in 1966, and Whitney stopped operating Playland in 1968. \r\n\r\nThe park took on a roving carnival feel, said Marvin Gold, who grew up nearby, going to sleep every night to the sound of Sal\\'s cackle. In 1972, Playland was put up for sale. When it closed on Sept. 4, 1972, Herb Caen wrote a column called, \"We\\'ll Never Go There Anymore.\" He reminisced over It\\'s-Its, Bull Pup enchiladas, a 40-cent corn dog and a ride on the carousel. \r\n\r\nToday, Playland is covered with housing. A Safeway stands on the site of the old diving bell. Gold said he remembers when workers came to smash the concrete foundation and heard a clang. They found the concrete lined with a steel tank, filled it in and built on top of it. \r\n\r\n\"One hundred years from now when they tear Safeway down, they\\'re going to find an old steel tank sitting there and have no idea what it was,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, and those slides, those beautiful wooden slides,\" he said of the long hardwood slides in the Funhouse. \"When I saw them cutting those slides into pieces ... I nearly cried. \r\n\r\n\"Playland was our second home.\" \r\n\r\nFor the next 30 years after Playland closed, people didn\\'t have to look far to find Laughing Sal. Although the main Funhouse Sal went to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk for 0,000, Playland\\'s back-up Sal found a home in the basement of the Cliff House, along with the penny arcade machines. They all were put into the Musee Mecanique, a collection that Ed Zelinsky he obtained from George Whitney. \r\n\r\nAll of the machines are still working, offering love tests, telling fortunes and showing the first silent films. Video games were added to a small arcade at the back -- early games like Pac Man and eventually the 3-D driving and shooting simulators we see now. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, the Musee was imperiled when the Cliff House was renovated. San Franciscans came to the rescue with a petition carrying more than 25,000 signatures. They were outraged that the National Park Service, which owns the Cliff House, hadn\\'t tried to find the historical Musee a new home. \r\n\r\nThanks to the public outcry, a home was found at Pier 45, where a row of crab stands leads to a building painted with a giant version of Laughing Sal\\'s face. Her missing tooth is the entry to Amusing America, which chronicles San Francisco\\'s place in the country\\'s cultural history of amusement parks. \r\n\r\nPlayland, Sutro Baths and the 1939 World\\'s Fair are all featured in interactive and informative displays, with the Musee Mecanique collection in the back. \r\n\r\nAnd at the door, as in her two previous homes, Sal is the greeter and gatekeeper who still bursts into laughter for a quarter. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at her luck, having survived the urban development that has put her into a museum version of a city that no longer exists. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at what amusement in San Francisco has become around her: a Fisherman\\'s Wharf that has become a commercial tourist center with many of the same type of attractions as Playland. \r\n\r\nDan Fontes, the muralist and a good source of history on Sutro Baths and Playland, says that when Playland was alive, \"Fisherman\\'s Wharf was a fisherman\\'s wharf, with fishermen.\" \r\n\r\nNow, it is the Playland of today, the city\\'s waterfront amusement center, even if it is there mostly for tourists. Playland\\'s remains are scattered elsewhere around the city, too. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s-It snacks are found in many grocery stores. \r\n\r\nCarousel in Yerba Buena \r\n\r\nThe marvelous carousel built by Charles I.D. Looff in 1906 and installed at Playland in 1912 eventually found its way back to San Francisco. Marianne Stevens, a preservationist, had bought it from Playland and restored it for a Long Beach mall. In 1998, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency bought it for  million and installed it in a beautiful glass pavilion at Yerba Buena Gardens. \r\n\r\nThe ocean wind even blew Playland\\'s ashes all the way to El Cerrito, where muralist Fontes and partner Ed Cassel are working with Playland collector Richard Tuck to create a tribute to that vanished beach area. \r\n\r\nThey\\'re creating a mural 32 feet long and 10 feet high depicting Playland, Sutro\\'s Baths and Museum and the Cliff House. Fontes said the reactions of former Playland visitors range from surprised delight to tears. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, on the very ground where Playland once stood, five ghosts of those bygone days arose. From a distance, the five 15-foot-high figures across the street from Safeway on 48th and Cabrillo look like ghostly black shadows. Up close, they\\'re monuments called Playland Revisited created by Ray Beldner, an artist who often visited Playland as a child. \r\n\r\nMade of perforated stainless steel, each tall, narrow sculpture represents a Playland icon. There\\'s Laughing Sal of course, a Muni streetcar, the clown entrance to the Funhouse, the rooster from Topsy\\'s Roost and a carousel horse. \r\n\r\nThe statues at the bus terminus also mark the terminus of San Francisco, of the solid world before it hits the sea, and the terminus of a time when that spot was filled with thousands of people of all classes and types enjoying themselves. \r\n\r\nThe icons give tangible body to the ghosts of Playland that live in the hearts and memories of so many grown-ups. They ensure that Playland isn\\'t entirely gone and that childhood won\\'t be forgotten\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother links:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.playlandatthebeach.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sonic.net/~playland/cliffhouse.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63309c94fak"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.510664,37.7732]}},{"properties":{"name":"Queenie's Psychic Hit's for your next Party!","description":"Posted by Queenie617<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/jello_shot.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Fairfax, CAAdd some mystical fun to your next party!

Prowl the back alleys where the Continental Op, Hammett\\'s longest-running detective, faced down the opposition over the barrel of his blazing .38. Follow Hammett himself as he works for the Pinkerton Detective Agency on the infamous Fatty Arbuckle case. See the spot where Spade\\'s partner, Miles Archer, with a smile on his mug and his pistol buttoned away under his overcoat, met swift death in the night-fog. \r\n\r\nTIME: Noon. \r\n\r\nCOST: 0.00 per person.\r\n\r\nPLACE: Meet n.w. corner of the new main library at 100 Larkin in San Francisco\\'s Civic Center (n.w. corner is closest to the intersection of Fulton &amp; Larkin); if this corner is blocked off for some huge event (it happens, it happens), the n.w. corner of McAllister &amp; Larkin a block north is the backup.\r\n\r\n2006 SCHEDULE: SUNDAYS in the month of May and in the month of September—Extra Walks, Book Signings, Hammett-related activities may be found under Special Dates.\r\n\r\nNo reservations taken. Just show up. Use your detective skills to spot the guy in the snap-brim hat and trenchcoat. The New York Times found him. You can, too.\r\n\r\nHammett tours may be given by appointment as well, e-mail for arrangements.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330946gv87"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.416646,37.778808]}},{"properties":{"name":"The White House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500Where it all goes down.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a63309arc9gl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036474,38.89859]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tour Guide ov Haunted Haight Street","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/9acb02f1_063a_4520_ab6c_0747543fbd20_mugshot.jpg\">1573 Haight Street, San Francisco CA Ze Haunted Haight Walking Tour eez led by ze founder ov ze San Francisco Ghost Society, a paranormal group wot investigates claims of ze supernatural in San Francisco.
