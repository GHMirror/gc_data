He likes to get inside of a cardboard box with handle-holes in the sides and peer out until a hapless person walks by close enough. Then he reaches out his lightning paw, with claws out, and grabs your leg.\n\nAbout a year later, my roommate Tali and I were splitting up and leaving France for a while, so we needed to find a new home for Booger. Tali took Booger in a cardboard box to Shakespeare and Co. and sat outside looking for a nice person to adopt him. \n\nShe tried to convince the actress who played Sue Ellen on Dallas, who was hanging out there that day, to adopt Booger, but in the end George took pity on the cat and let him stay there in the store.\n\nBooger loves living at Shakespeare and Company, and I think he also likes the fame and attention which goes along with being the housecat of one of the most famouse bookstores on the planet.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6en5t6mnce1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.346944,48.852687]}},{"properties":{"name":"Buddy, rocky, and james","description":"Posted by Bdolan2000<img src=\"http://circa75.com/aaron/snapshots/buddyandjames.jpg\">59 cedar st somerville m a<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6en5t8iu4gl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.113624,42.390221]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cat , Granpa &amp; Stranger","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/3/MalaysiaCat.jpg\">Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaMalaysian cat<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6en5tek192g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[101.709999,3.16]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cat's Cradle Bookstore Cats","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://www.catscradlebks.net/home/sleepingcat.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.catscradlebks.net/home/browsingcat.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> High Point, North Carolina<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6en5tczbb51"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.995317,35.950705]}},{"properties":{"name":"ChickyMonkey","description":"Posted by Stephanie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/be07f5abd6cebccf847b8168d036631d.jpg\">ELIDA OHIOAKA: Chicky Noodle-O<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6en5t6oe88t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.163966,40.791599]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dudley","description":"Posted by Stephanie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/174de2d934516729181a30a26a04cf3c.jpg\">ELIDA OHIOAKA: Studley Dudley<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6en5t21vssz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.163966,40.791599]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gato","description":"Posted by Ksoggie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/380edcb0752727d64f4c58492bd2797a.jpg\">1019 Pace Ave. Mount Vernon, IL 62864This is Gato, my kitty.

Dakota Ave., Fresno CAI moved about 2,200 miles across country, from Michigan to California, driving three and a half days with my dad and three cats in their own separate car carriers. Each day, I\\'d start the trip with catching the cats and getting them in the carriers. Two were scared enough they didn\\'t put up much of a fight. The third put up a fight every time. Then I spent the next hour of the drive listening to them cry, and trying to calm down the most vocal by putting his carrier on my lap. Each night, I\\'d set up their food and a disposable litter box and let them out. They never went to the bathroom in their carriers. When we finally got to my new apartment, I opened their carriers in a bedroom and closed the door. I started unloading stuff, came back, and saw two of my cats in the same carrier. Ziggy, who is a very fat cat, managed to squeeze himself into the carrier with Stinky, an elderly, thin cat. They normally hate each other, but I guess they were both so upset and scared they needed some companionship. I guess oil and water mix if they\\'ve been agitated for three and a half days.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6en5t37yaus"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.832865,36.786384]}},{"properties":{"name":"In Yorkshire and London England!

Born probably about mid-June 1998 she is now (summer 2005) 7 years old. Indeed she is probably a year younger than Cleo. Nonetheless, she is the senior cat because she arrived here first and she trained both us and the dogs about how to live with cats and how wonderful they are. In the case of the dogs the education took about 3 months. In the beginning, the dogs considered her prey to be chased up trees or under chesterfields -- but eventually they learned and we learned too. I (Rod) always thought that cats were elegant, aloof strangers who would suavely stab you in the back while wearing elbow-length velvet gloves. Wrong wrong wrong! They are sweethearts. But what did I know? I had to be taught.
