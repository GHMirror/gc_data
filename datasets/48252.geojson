We hiked a mile in the snow with our gear. We reached the entrance and she freaked. She started crying and telling me she would do anything else I wanted as long as we didn\\'t go in that hole. I was annoyed, frustrated and pushed. No luck. So, we walked back in the rain and snow. As we drove off the car got stuck in snow. We sat for several hours during which time my mom peed on the tires thinking that would help melt the snow and free us from our misery. Eventually we dug ourselves out using a piece of plastic.\r\n\r\nA few years later my mom, her husband, my brother and I went back. My mom thought she was going to hang out in the car while we did our thing. This time we forced her in the hole (see photo).

The students were convinced that large underground passages existed under the amazing 60-foot limestone bridge. On their fourth expedition, Orion Knox Jr., one of the discoverers, felt a cool draft from a rubble-filled crawlway. Such air currents often indicate the presence of additional rooms or passages.\n\nThe explorers made their way carefully climbing and crawling through two miles of vast cavern passage. After making this amazing discovery, they returned to the surface to tell the landowners. The discoverers knew immediately what an astonishing find they had made and the land owners decided to develop the first ½ mile, the most spectacular part of the caverns, for the enjoyment of guests from around the world. That first ½ mile is now the North Cavern Tour. Natural Bridge Caverns’ North Cavern Tour was developed with two main goals in mind: preservation of the cavern environment and comfort of its guests. The result is one of the world’s premier show caverns. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bcyjocgwdy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.310196,29.709791]}},{"properties":{"name":"Space Bike RV Guy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebikeFullView.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebikeRearView.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebikeFrontView.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/0/_motorhomebike1.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bcyjwacwgo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.661709785,45.539293438]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Ultimate Secure Cave Home","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://www.ultimatesecurehome.com/images/pod.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Strategically located in the awesome San Juan mountains of Southwest Colorado, this patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand almost any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
