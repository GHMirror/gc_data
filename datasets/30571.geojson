Steve and Naomi are old friends of Judy and Dave, parents of Shane who was in Vigo’s first grade class last year. They made us feel comfortable right away, even though they were probably going through their toughest time in a while. Vigo and their son Sam became good pals. We stayed two nights. I helped Naomi get ready for her trip to the Northeast by folding some laundry and returning library books. It was harder to find anything I could do to help Steve who was supremely exhausted by a medical treatment he was taking. I hope I get to experience the normal Steve one day. It was a nice relaxing time after the always slightly stressful days touring with my patents. I got to leave Vigo with Naomi for an hour and a half on Monday afternoon so I could ride my bike into town and see what all the fuss was about. Asheville seems like a funky little place indeed. There seem to be several different trends balancing each other out: street people, yuppies, students, hippies, givernment wiriers, with businesses or organizations catering to them all clustered in the small downtown area. Our friends live in West Asheville, which has its own little strip of healthy local businesses. Naomi keeps bees. Steve helped start WPVM, the low-power progressive/freeform FM station owned by the Mountain Area Network community ISP.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639f548douj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.783094,35.738947]}},{"properties":{"name":"A Short Stop in Nantmeal Village","description":"Posted by Testytester<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Nantmeal Village PennsylvaniaPennsylvania is beautiful.

It was great except for a two-hour commotion when cops came questioning people. They never got to us, but I heard them tell this one couple, “We just want to make sure you’re not fugitives from the law”. They ended up arresting a guy who had arrived with his boat in tow shortly after we arrived. There were two fish and game pickups and two county sheriff cruisers. They were seriously harshing my mellow if you know what I mean.\n\nThe place was called Rush after a zinc rush in the late 1800s early 1900s.

Glebe Rd. , Arlington, VAWe got to the District of Columbia around one in the afternoon. Again I chose to drive right through the city. I ended up on New York Ave. Traffic was beastly. It took me an hour to cross the city. Still I enjoyed it. When we were near the white house I woke Vigo up. He had been napping all this time. He barely looked at the place. I tried to get him to look out at the Washington Monument as well but he preferred his sleep. We arrived at the hotel in Arlington a mere twenty minutes before my parents. Our dog Sam would have to stay on the car because they didn’t allow pets. I decided right then not to spend more than one day sightseeing in DC so that Sam wouldn’t be stuck in the car too long. The hotel had an underground garage where it didn’t get too warm. Sam even seemed to enjoy the safety of the car. We humans went to a chain restaurant in the Ballston neighborhood of Arlington. Then we returned to the hotel room. I took Sam for a nice long walk and then practically fell asleep for the night around seven. Vigo engaged in his favorite hotel activity: watching tv, which he doesn’t get to do at home. My parents were as tired as I was and no one was in the mood to hunt down some excitement across the Potomac.

Great riverfront. So many neighborhoods in transition right by the main strip. Also: a few gated communities right in the urban core. We stopped to reflect at the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King was shot and talked to Jacqueline Smith, who has been holding a one-woman civil-rights protest across the street for a long time. She gave me a copy of an article about her in German.

We stopped in a muy shady part of town. Some hard living girls were “getting rides” from truckers. Finally got enough wifi to find the local theater showing Wall-E. Spent a pleasant couple hours. Drove around Tulsa. Finally found a starbucks with help over the phone from Tracy. It was lightning like crazy. We spent 3 hours there. I had decided to drive all night to get past Oklahoma. One of the baristas invited me to taste coffees with him which is part of his training. We tasted Sumatran and Arabian Sanai both from the French press. When the rain got really hard I dashed out to the car to close the windows. Lightning had fallen two blocks away. I knew it was risky. The car was parked under a tree. As I was running towards it. Lightning struck an electricity pole in frontof the coffeshop. I saw the sky get lighter and then even lighter. I was too far away to feel the electrified skin crawling sensation that you’re supposed to feel in those cases but the sound follwed instantaneously and an eight-foot ball of white-yellow fire and sparks erupted around the power lines. It lasted a couple of seconds.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639f55wj0c8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.976563,36.155618]}},{"properties":{"name":"Looking for the Natchez Trace Parkway","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://ontheroadwithvigo.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/img_4057.jpg?w=128&amp;h=96\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Riding through the tony farm country west of Nashville trying to locate the entrance of the Natchez Trace Parkway, I blew a fuse trying to relight my cigar using the car’s lighter plugged into the adapter accessory that I was using to charge the batteries for the digital camera.

Everything was crowded, but not overly so. The systems in place were designed to handle throngs: the Metro, the bag check to enter the Mall, the museums. We toured the Air and Space Museum and the Hirschhorn–the latter not without protestations from Vigo who was worried he’d miss the best shows on the hotel tv. At the Hirschhorn, we watched all thirty minutes of Fischli and Weiss’s Der Lauf Der Dinge, which SO beats any afternoon childrens television.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639f4yghx8w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.023344,38.889764]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parisian Reunion 2008","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 24 Oxbow Road, Egremont, MAA lot of old friends are getting together for a weekend here.

Visions of John Waters movies and the TV show The Wire kept going through my mind as I rambled past blocks of boarded up brick houses and low rise apartment blocks. I was vaguely aware that Vigo was not sitting like an upright citizen in his booster seat. A few blocks north of downtown a cop flashes his lights at me. I pull over. “You know why I’m pulling you over don’t you?” “Uh is it because of how my son isn’t sitting properly?” “Not just that but he had his feet out the window.
