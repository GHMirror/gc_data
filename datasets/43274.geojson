She was going to spend part of the break at home in Chicago with family and old friends, and then fly to Minneapolis to visit with three of our sorority sisters.  The first Saturday home she went with her parents to visit her grandfather.  Though he had been diagnosed with cancer, he was doing well, and living with his wife, who suffers from Alzheimer’s, in an assisted living facility.  They had a great, if normal, day together catching up on everyone’s life and eating lunch.  But Katie had a weird feeling all day, and she even called her brother who was unable to make it, when they got home.  She told him that she just couldn’t shake an unspoken impression, and that he should stop putting off going to visit their grandparents.  He was sufficiently weirded out, and made plans to make the hour and a half drive the following weekend.  But that wasn’t soon enough… Wednesday morning Katie’s parents received a phone call that her grandfather had passed away in his sleep.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330fj965e7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.04761,42.11484]}},{"properties":{"name":"2 Family Meeting","description":"Posted by Dwright1<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Along with the stress of funeral arrangements and updating family members, Katie and her parents also had to have a family meeting to decide how to best take care of her grandmother.  Because of her Alzheimer’s and age, they needed to come up with a way to make sure she was happy and healthy.  One morning they had all the vital family members come over to their house.  Her parents put out fresh flowers and orange juice.  They bought Burger King breakfast and Krispy Kremes, just like her grandfather always used to buy for breakfast when grandkids or relatives came to visit.  \n\nOne of the most difficult tasks before them was to sort through his things from his and his wife\\'s room at the living center.  She found a Valentine\\'s day card she\\'d drawn for him when she was in third grade and a little clay alligator she\\'d painted for him.  It hurt to see these objects that were meant for his hands and eyes being packed away in boxes and carefully labeled for storage or goodwill.  But then family members started telling funny and amazing stories about Katie\\'s grandfather, like the time he saved his brother\\'s life in the war by having them both transferred to a unit that suffered almost no losses instead of the unit they were in that was almost completely destroyed.  He had been smart and caring, dedicated to his wife, responsible, and infinitely proud and loving of his family.  \n\nCards and alligators and stories wouldn\\'t be near enough to satisfy his family in the absence of his presence.  But his life can be remembered and cherished because of those things.  \n\nKatie brought home the Valentine\\'s card and stuck it in the corner of her bedroom mirror.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330fve0ntu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.00959,42.11354]}},{"properties":{"name":"3United Center","description":"Posted by Dwright11901 W. Madison St., Chicago, IL, United StatesAnother elderly man made Katie’s break interesting.  She went to the first round of NCAA tournaments at the United Center and tried to relax and enjoy the game with her brother.  She loved the smell of perfectly inflated basketballs, sweaty uniforms, concession stand food and beer.  Due to the two hour break between the four games, most of the fans went out to the bars and got loaded before returning to their seats.  One seventy year old man who’d had a few too many tried to make it up the stairs to his stadium seating as Kaite was making her way down.  The man tripped on his drunken feet and went sprawling into the aisle.  As he fell, he reached out for something to steady himself and landed on Katie’s chest.  Not only did she now smell too much like beer and nachos, but a man old enough to be her grandfather just copped a feel in front of an entire stadium of people and her older brother.  What better way to celebrate athleticism? <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330fk8op9b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.674115,41.881361]}},{"properties":{"name":"4 ESPN 1000","description":"Posted by Dwright1Katie’s been looking for a summer internship after graduation, and she had an interview downtown for her dream job.

Katie is a huge sports buff though she doesn’t look like a tomboy and she wants to land a job in TV or radio. \n \nKatie put on her pressed business suit, fixed her hair in its most professional do, and took the train downtown.  When she walked into the office building she could imagine herself coming in a few times a week, pressing the white elevator button to take her upstairs, and listening to her black heels walk her down the hall to a group of desks and computers that would include her own space.  \n\nThe carpet was new and promising.  Large flat screen T.V.\\'s lined the hallway walls.  She wanted to call this office-supply and pigskin scented building her home.  Well maybe she just imagined the pigskin smell.

The intoxicating smells of chimichangas and enchiladas encircled the green and pink pinatas hanging from the ceiling and the detailed landscape paintings of Mexican houses and playing children that were up on the walls.  Katie missed coming to this hot and busy restaurant when she was in Valpo, and it was a nice treat to visit before leaving home.  They ate taco salads and talked about themed parties, as we are planning to have another one in April and we’re running out of ideas.  When her parents were in college, they threw involved parties for their friends and carried themes to the extreme.  Once they threw a racing party where her father created an elaborate chart of horses and jockeys and everyone dressed in old-fashioned hats and suits and wagered on horse races.  They also threw disco parties, a circus party with fair food and real carousel horses, and a slew of other creative get-togethers.  Katie brought home the idea of an 80’s party for the spring.  She’s waiting to see if we’ll get crazier than her parents or even be able to keep up.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330fpi75y9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.06229,42.12573]}},{"properties":{"name":"6 The Library","description":"Posted by Dwright1Once she got to Minneapolis, Katie went with the girls to a bar called The Library where they obviously served drinks instead of books.  Everybody decided to make up fake names at the bar in case creepy old men tried to pick them up.  Katie’s new name was Alex, Rachel was Maura, and Kelsey was Liz.  Once you know someone by their name, they almost become that name, but these new ones fit each of the girls perfectly.

The menu was pretty pricey and they sat at a fancy-modern table with several pieces of silverware apiece and pristine water glasses to sip from.  They walked through the skyway and saw the general manager of the Timberwolves, but those were minor occurrences compared with what happened as they sipped their Caribou coffee. Sitting in some of those waffle-grated metal chairs, watching people pass by huge potted plants and flashy stores, they got to sit in front of the stairs that the Mighty Ducks roller bladed down in the infamous Emilio Estevez and Joshua Jackson flick of the early nineties.

My other roommate and I had cleaned for her return, and she was welcomed back by freshly vacuumed carpet, an empty sink (usually full of used plates and cups), a clean dining room table with her mail stacked neatly in the center, and a living room free of shoes and books--nothing but a hearty welcome lying around.  She thought it was nice to return to her own quiet space after such a tumultuous break.  In a couple weeks, she’d lost her grandfather and traveled to a new city.  But we’d all experienced changes in a short time, and late night talking is always necessary to catch up.  In less than two months now, we’ll all graduate and start new chapters of our lives, move to different cities, start growing apart from each other.  Katie kept the familiar going by doing what we always do:  try to figure out each other’s lives over whatever’s left in the fridge.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6330fumfmo0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03594,41.471067]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20772","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dwright1","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dwright1","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20772","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":8,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20772,platial:user=dwright1","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":43274}
