Integral to the McQueen culture is the juxtaposition between contrasting elements: fragility and strength, tradition and modernity and fluidity and severity. An openly emotional and even passionate viewpoint is realised with a profound respect and influence for the arts and crafts tradition. Alexander\\'s collections combine an in-depth working knowledge of: bespoke British tailoring, the fine workmanship of the French Haute Couture atelier and the impeccable finish of Italian manufacturing.\n\nIn less than 10 years McQueen became one of the most respected fashion designers in the world. In October 1996 he was appointed Chief Designer at the French Haute Couture House Givenchy where he worked until March of 2001. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bf3h0tqe99"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006252,40.741318]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amarcord","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>223 Bedford Ave, BrooklynNew clothing store<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bf3h0vbnut"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.959221,40.716457]}},{"properties":{"name":"Anytime","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>Fun, loud atmosphere<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bf3h113i30"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.95936,40.71805]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aspen","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>30 W 22nd St, New York, NYCool vibe, good tapas<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bf3h297dlt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.991061,40.741274]}},{"properties":{"name":"Atlanta, GA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>Lived there from about 6 months to 3 years old.

As for fabric selection, unlike other tailors with their binders of dainty swatches, Sew lets you finger full bolts of textiles, including vintage 60s/\\'70s argyle, plaid, and houndstooth (for Caddyslacks?).\n\nSew also purveys ready-to-wear accoutrements, like cashmere shirts from Abaton and Sew-designed 7-fold ties; even though they\\'re not bespoke, wear one, and no one will mistake you for that d*ckhead Marcus Halberstram. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bf3h884xwr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.995197,40.72226]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sherman Oaks Galleria","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>Like, Oh my god!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bf3gxi1qw2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.46712,34.15536]}},{"properties":{"name":"Southern Gourmet Pantry","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\" href=\"http://brandonm.photoblog.com\">Brandonm</a>529 Hudson St, NY, NY 10014SO SO GOOD!!
