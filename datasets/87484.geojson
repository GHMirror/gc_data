Determination of what constitutes a terrorist act, however, can be more art than science; information is often incomplete, fact patterns may be open to interpretation, and perpetrators' intent is rarely clear. Moreover, information may become available over time, changing initial judgments about attacks. Users of this database should therefore recognize that reasonable people may differ on whether a particular attack actually constitutes terrorism or some other form of political violence. NCTC has made every effort to limit the degree of subjectivity involved in the judgments and, in the interests of transparency, has adopted a set of counting rules that are delineated below.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"dead":{"max":204,"mean":6.78125,"variance":305.778222934473,"stdev":17.4865154600473,"min":0,"median":1},"total
