Along with Delhi, 204km northwest, and Jaipur in Rajasthan, Agra is the third apex of the \"Golden Triangle\", India\\'s most popular tourist itinerary. It fully merits that status; the Taj effortlessly transcends all the frippery and commercialism that surrounds it, and continues to have a fresh and immediate impact on all who see it.\r\n\r\nThat said, Agra city itself can be an intense experience, even for seasoned India hands. Years of corruption and political neglect have reduced its infrastructure to a shambles: filthy water and open sewers are ubiquitous, power cuts routine and the traffic pollution appalling (some mornings you can barely see the sun through the fog of fumes). Moreover, as a tourist you\\'ll have to contend with often overwhelming crowds at the major monuments, absurdly high admission fees, and some of Asia\\'s most persistent touts, commission merchants and rickshaw-wallahs. Don\\'t, however, let all this put you off. Although it\\'s possible to see Agra on a day-trip from Delhi, the Taj alone deserves so much more – a fleeting visit would miss the subtleties of its many moods, as the light changes from sunrise to sunset – while the warren of old streets and bazaars around it offers glimpses of an Indo–Muslim way of life that, in many respects, has altered little since the time of the Moghuls.\r\n\r\nTaj Mahal  \r\n \r\nDescribed by the poet Rabindranath Tagore as a \"tear on the face of eternity\", the Taj Mahal (daily 6.00am –7.00pm, closed Fri; Rs750 [Rs20]) is undoubtedly the zenith of Moghul architecture and quite simply one of the world\\'s most marvellous buildings. Volumes have been written on its perfection, and its image adorns countless glossy brochures and guidebooks; nonetheless, the reality never fails to overwhelm all who see it, and few words can do it justice.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the monument is strangely undiminished by the crowds of tourists who visit, as small and insignificant as ants in the face of this immense and captivating structure. That said, the Taj is at its most alluring in the relative quiet of early morning, shrouded in mists and bathed with a soft red glow. As its vast marble surfaces fall into shadow or reflect the sun, its colour changes, from soft grey and yellow to pearly cream and dazzling white; it\\'s well worth visiting at different times. This play of light is an important decorative device, symbolically implying the presence of Allah, who is never represented in anthropomorphic form.\r\n\r\nOverlooking the Yamuna River, and visible from the fort in the west, the Taj Mahal stands at the northern end of vast gardens enclosed by walls. Though its layout follows a distinctly Islamic theme, representing Paradise, it is above all a monument to romantic love. Shah Jahan built the Taj to enshrine the body of his favourite wife, Arjumand Bann Begum, better known as Mumtaz Mahal (\"Elect of the Palace\"), who died shortly after giving birth to her fourteenth child in 1631. The Shah was devastated by her death, and set out to create an unsurpassed, eternal monument to her memory. Of all the Moghuls, only Shah Jahan, who had been designing palaces and forts since the age of sixteen, could have come up with such a magnificent design. The name of the chief architect is unknown, but Amanat Khan, who had previously worked on Akbar\\'s tomb, was responsible for the calligraphic inscriptions that adorn the gateways, mosque and tomb. Construction by a workforce of some 20,000 men from all over Asia commenced in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1653. Marble was brought from Makrana, near Jodhpur in Rajasthan, and precious stones for decoration – onyx, amethyst, lapis lazuli, turquoise, jade, crystal, coral and mother-of-pearl – were carried to Agra from Persia, Russia, Afghanistan, Tibet, China and the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe story is given an exquisite poignancy by the fate of Shah Jahan himself, who became a tragic and inconsolable figure. Eventually, his devout and austere son Aurangzeb seized power, and Shah Jahan was interned in Agra Fort, where as legend would have it he lived out his final years \"gazing wistfully at the Taj Mahal\" in the distance (although the truth is somewhat less poetic). He died there in January 1666, with his daughter, Jahanara Begum, at his side; his body was carried across the river to lie alongside his beloved wife in his peerless tomb.\r\n \r\nAgra Fort  \r\n \r\nThe high red-sandstone ramparts of Agra Fort (dawn to dusk; Rs300 [Rs20]) dominate a bend in the River Yamuna 2km northwest of the Taj Mahal. Akbar laid the foundations of this majestic citadel, built between 1565 and 1573 in the form of a half moon, on the remains of earlier Rajput fortifications. The structure developed as the seat and stronghold of the Moghul empire for successive generations: Akbar constructed the walls and gates, his grandson, Shah Jahan, had most of the principal buildings erected, and Aurangzeb, the last great emperor, was responsible for the ramparts.\r\n\r\nThe curved bastions of the sandstone battlements are interrupted by massive gates, of which only the Amar Singh Pol is open to the public. Ornamented with glazed tiles, and boasting impressive double walls and a forecourt, it was used by the victorious General Lake when he entered the fort in 1803. The original and grandest entrance, however, was through the western Delhi Gate, leading to the inner portal, Hathi Pol or \"Elephant Gate\", now flanked by two red-sandstone towers faced in marble, but once guarded by colossal stone elephants with riders – destroyed by Aurangzeb in 1668.\r\n\r\nAccess to much of the fort is restricted, so masterpieces of Moghul architecture such as Shah Jahan\\'s beautiful Moti Masjid (\"Pearl Mosque\") are out of bounds to visitors. Only those parts open to the public are described in detail in this Guide, working in an anticlockwise direction from Shah Jahan\\'s Hall of Public Audience to the private apartments.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m658l1zh6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[78.010002,27.19]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ajanta","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65af7m5t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[75.75,20.533333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aruba Dam","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64wr5del"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.824868,-3.351578]}},{"properties":{"name":"Athene","description":"Posted by KaozAthens, GreeceDag 1.\r\nDag 12, 13, 14.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m6531bmk8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.729999,37.979999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ayr","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m659h8yu8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.625244,55.466399]}},{"properties":{"name":"Banavie","description":"Posted by Kaozbanavie<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m658499g3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.083333,56.849998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bangalore","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64x848dl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[77.559997,12.97]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bannockburn","description":"Posted by Kaozbannockburn, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65250yk7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.914895,56.091939]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bharatpur","description":"Posted by KaozThe walled town of BHARATPUR is just a stone\\'s throw from the border with Uttar Pradesh, 150km east of Jaipur, and a mere 18km from Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar\\'s deserted capital. It\\'s fun to explore by bike or on foot, with traditional markets, mosques, temples and a massive fort, but the real reason to come here is to visit India\\'s most famous bird sanctuary, the Keoladeo National Park, just a short way south of the town. Even if you\\'re not particularly interested in ornithology, this extraordinary site deserves at least a night or two. Few places in the world, let alone ones so easily accessible, boast such a profusion of wildlife in so confined an area. Cycling around the sanctuary\\'s quiet, shady paths, you\\'re almost certain to glimpse several species of large mammals such as black buck and deer, as well as lizards and pythons, and some startlingly exotic birds.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m652qm7uw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[77.489997,27.229999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carcassonne","description":"Posted by Kaozcarcassonne, france<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65atwt7k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.356099,43.212605]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chongqing","description":"Posted by Kaozchongqing, china<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m657l9pn4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[106.580001,29.569999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cochin","description":"Posted by KaozKochi (Cochin)  \r\n \r\nThe venerable city of KOCHI (long known as Cochin), is Kerala\\'s prime tourist destination, spreading across islands and promontories in a stunning location between the Arabian Sea and the backwaters. Its main sections – modern Ernakulam and the old peninsular districts of Mattancherry and Fort Cochin to the west – are linked by a complex system of ferries, and distinctly less romantic bridges. Although most visitors stay in Ernakulam, Fort Cochin and Mattancherry are the main tourist spots, where Kochi\\'s complex history is reflected in an assortment of architectural styles. Exotic spice markets, Chinese fishing nets, a synagogue, Portuguese palace, India\\'s first European church, Dutch homes, and a village green that could have been transported from England\\'s Home Counties can all be found within an easy day\\'s walk. Kochi is also one of the few places in Kerala where you are guaranteed Kathakali dance performances, both authentic and abridged tourist versions. Around Kochi, a 12km auto-rickshaw or bus ride southeast of Ernakulam, the colonial-style hill palace at Thripunitra is now an eclectic museum that stages a music and dance festival in October or November.\r\n\r\nKochi was founded in 1341, when a flood created a natural safe port, replacing Muziris (or Kodungallur, 50km north) as the chief harbour on the Malabar coast. In 1405, the royal family made it their new base, after which the city expanded rapidly, attracting Christian, Arab and Jewish settlers from the Middle East. Its name probably derives from kocchazhi, meaning new, or small, harbour.\r\n\r\nEuropean involvement in Kochi began in the early 1500\\'s with the Portuguese – followed by the Dutch and British, all wanting to control the port and its lucrative spice trade. In 1800, the state of Cochin became part of the British Madras Presidency and from 1812 until Independence in 1947, was administered by a succession of diwans, or finance ministers. In the 1920s, the British expanded the port to make it suitable for modern ocean-going ships and Willingdon Island, between Ernakulam and Fort Cochin, was created by extensive dredging.\r\n \r\nMattancherry  \r\n \r\nWith high-rise development restricted to Ernakulam, across the water, the old-fashioned character of Mattancherry and Fort Cochin remains intact, with glimpses of Kochi\\'s past greeting you at virtually every turn. Approaching Mattancherry jetty by ferry, the shoreline, with its tiled roofs and pastel-coloured buildings, offers a view that can\\'t have changed for centuries.\r\n\r\nDespite the revenue brought in by tourism, traditional trade is still the most important activity here. Barrows loaded with sacks of produce trundle between godowns (warehouses), and there are numerous little shops where you can negotiate prices for tea, jute, rubber, chillies, turmeric, cashew, ginger, cardamom and pepper.\r\n \r\nSt Francis Church and around  \r\n \r\nSouth of the Chinese fishing nets on Church Road, the continuation of River Road, stands the church of St Francis, the first built by Europeans in India. It overlooks the large typically English village green, known locally as the Parade Ground. The exact age of the church is not known, though the stone structure dates back to the early sixteenth century; the land was a gift of the local raja, and the title deeds, written on palm leaf, are still kept inside. The facade, with its multi-curved sides, became the model for most Christian churches in India. Vasco da Gama was buried here in 1524, but his body was later removed to Portugal.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dutch, the church was renovated and became Protestant in 1663, then Anglican with the advent of the British in 1795; since 1949 it has been attached to the Church of South India. Inside, various inscribed tombstones date back to 1562. One throwback from British days is the continued use of punkahs, large swinging cloth fans on frames suspended above the congregation, operated by the \"punkah-wallah\".\r\n\r\nSouth of St Francis church, the interior of the twentieth-century Santa Cruz Cathedral will delight fans of colourful, gaudy Indo-Romano-Rococo style of decoration.\r\n \r\nThe Pardesi (White Jew) Synagogue \r\n\r\n(daily except Sat 10am–noon &amp; 3–5pm; Rs2) was founded in 1568, and rebuilt in 1664. Its interior is an attractive, if incongruous, hotchpotch; note the floor, paved with hand-painted eighteenth-century blue and white tiles from Canton, each unique, depicting a love affair between a mandarin\\'s daughter and a commoner. Opposite the entrance, an elaborately carved Ark houses four scrolls of the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament), encased in silver and gold, on which are placed gold crowns presented by the maharajas of Travancore and Cochin, testifying to good relations with the Jewish community.\r\n\r\nMattancherry Palace  \r\n \r\nMattancherry Palace (daily except Fri 10am–5pm; free) stands on the left side of the road a short walk from the Mattancherry Jetty in the opposite direction to Jew Town. The gateway on the road is, in fact, the back entrance, but the most accessible way from the ferry. In the walled grounds behind the gate stands a circular, tiled Krishna temple (closed to non-Hindus).\r\n\r\nKnown locally as the Dutch Palace, the two-storey building was actually erected by the Portuguese, as a gift to the Cochin raja, Vira Keralavarma (1537–61) – though the Dutch did add to the complex. While its squat exterior is not particularly striking, the interior is captivating. The murals that adorn some of its rooms are among the finest examples of Kerala\\'s much underrated school of painting; friezes illustrating stories from the Ramayana, on the first floor, date from the sixteenth century. Packed with detail and gloriously rich colour, the style is never strictly naturalistic; the treatment of facial features is pared down to the simplest of lines for the mouths, and characteristically aquiline noses. Downstairs, the women\\'s bedchamber holds several less complex paintings, possibly dating from the 1700s.\r\n\r\nWhile the paintings are undoubtedly the highlight of the palace, the collection also includes interesting Dutch maps of old Cochin, coronation robes belonging to past maharajas, royal palanquins, weapons and furniture. Without permission from the Archaeological Survey of India, photography is strictly prohibited.\r\n \r\nKuttanad: The backwaters of Kerala  \r\n \r\nOne of the most memorable experiences for travellers in India – even those on the lowest of budgets – is the opportunity to take a boat journey on the backwaters of Kerala. Immortalized as the setting for Arundhati Roy\\'s Booker-prize-winning novel The God of Small Things, the area known as Kuttanad stretches for 75km from Kollam in the south to Kochi in the north, sandwiched between the sea and the hills. This bewildering labyrinth of shimmering waterways, composed of lakes, canals, rivers and rivulets, is lined with dense tropical greenery, and preserves rural Keralan lifestyles that are completely hidden from the road.\r\n\r\nViews change from narrow canals and dense vegetation to open vistas and dazzling green paddy fields. Homes, farms, churches, mosques and temples can be glimpsed among the trees, and every so often you might catch the blue flash of a kingfisher, or the green of a parakeet. Pallas fishing eagles cruise above the water looking for prey and cormorants perch on logs to dry their wings. Daily life continues both on the water and the palm-fringed shorelines. Families subsist on tiny pockets of land, with just enough room for a simple house, yard and boat, and bathe and wash their clothes – sometimes their buffaloes, too – at the water\\'s edge. Powered both by gondolier-like boatmen with poles and by sail, kettu vallams glide past laden with heavyweight cargoes, and fishermen work from rowing boats or operate massive Chinese nets on the shore.\r\n\r\nCoconut trees at improbable angles form shady canopies, and occasionally you pass under simple curved bridges. Here and there, basic drawbridges can be raised on ropes, but major bridges are few and far between; most people rely on boatmen to ferry them across the water to connect with roads and bus services, a constant criss-crossing of the waters from dawn until dusk (a way of life beautifully represented in the visually stunning film Piravi, by Keralan director Shaji). Poles sticking out of the water indicate dangerous shallows.\r\n\r\nThe African moss that often carpets the surface of the narrower waterways may look attractive, but it is actually a menace to small craft traffic and starves underwater life of light. It is also a symptom of the many serious ecological problems currently affecting the region, whose population density ranges from between two and four times that of other coastal areas in southwest India. This has put growing pressure on land, and hence a greater reliance on fertilizers, which eventually work their way into the water causing the build up of moss. Illegal land reclamation, however, poses the single greatest threat to this fragile ecosystem. In a little over a century, the total area of water in Kuttanad has been reduced by two-thirds, while mangrove swamps and fish stocks have been decimated by pollution and the spread of towns and villages around the edges of the backwater region.\r\n \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m650wqvpl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[76.272499,9.944722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Craignure","description":"Posted by Kaozcraignure, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m653ppjbz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.699264,56.467396]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cuillin Hills","description":"Posted by Kaozcuillin hills<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m653gln9s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.317139,57.267164]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delhi","description":"Posted by KaozOn first impressions, DELHI, with its jam-packed streets, tower blocks and temples, forts, mosques and colonial mansions, can be both disorienting and fascinating. It certainly takes a while to find your feet, as you attempt to weave a path through buses, trucks, nippy modern cars, mopeds, rickshaws, cows, bullock carts, hand-pulled trolleys and even the occasional elephant being ridden along with the flow of traffic. You\\'ll find unlikely juxtapositions are everywhere you look: suit-and-tie businessmen rub shoulders with traditionally dressed orthodox Hindus and Muslims; groups of young Levis-clad Delhi-ites pile into burger joints, bars and discos; turbaned snake charmers tease hypnotizing moans out of curved pipes; pundits pontificate while sadhus smoke their chillums; and ragged beggars clutching dusty children plead for a little help towards a meal.\r\n\r\nDelhi\\'s daunting scale becomes more manageable as you start to appreciate that, geographicall as well as historically, it consists of several distinct cities, an amalgamation and expansion of the \"Seven Cities\" of tradition (seven fortress settlements built at different times here by different rulers). The hub of the metropolis is New Delhi, an orderly plan of wide roads lined with sturdy colonial buildings, which was established soon after the imperial capital of British India moved here from Calcutta in 1911. Many of the city\\'s hotels are here, concentrated amid the colonnaded facades of Connaught Place. A couple of kilometres south, the broad, green east–west swathe of Raj Path links India Gate and the Indian parliamentary buildings, once considered to be the architectural jewels in the Imperial crown. Old Delhi, Shah Jahan\\'s seventeenth-century capital of Shahjahanabad, lies 3km northwest of Connaught Place. This is Delhi at its most quintessentially Indian, where the traditional lifestyle of its predominantly Muslim population has changed little over two hundred years. A visit to the mighty Lal Qila or Red Fort and Jami Masjid, India\\'s largest mosque, is a must, and should be combined with a stroll through the area\\'s ancient bazaars, a warren of clustered houses, buzzing with commotion, and infused with aromatic smells drifting from open-fronted restaurants, spice shops and temples.\r\n\r\nFirozabad, another of Delhi\\'s ex-capitals, is centred around Delhi Gate, while the other five former capitals, further south, are today all but deserted, standing as impressive reminders of long-vanished dynasties. Among them you\\'ll find the towering free-standing twelfth-century column erected by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the Qutb Minar – it marks the first capital, Qila Rai Pithora, and signalled the development of the city that visitors see today. Walls and dilapidated pillars survive from the fourteenth-century city of Tughluqabad, and Purana Qila, the sixth capital. Interspersed between these historic ruins are the grand tombs of Delhi\\'s former rulers, plus a plethora of Hindu temples, and domed mosques, introduced by the Muslims, which dramatically changed the conventional mould of Indian cities. Perhaps the finest expressions of the Moghuls\\' architectural genius were the grand charbagh (quartered garden) mausoleums of Humayun\\'s Tomb, and, most famously, the Taj Mahal in Agra. The major monument of the great Moghul period is Lal Qila (the Red Fort) in Old Delhi.\r\n\r\nAs befits a national capital, Delhi, with its many museums and art treasures, cultural performances and crafts, provides a showcase of the country\\'s diverse heritage. Shops trade in goods from every corner of India, and with a little legwork you can find anything from Tibetan carpets, antiques and jewellery to modern art and designer clothes. After years of economic isolation caused by India\\'s draconian post-Independence trading laws, Delhi is enjoying a tremendous economic boom. With plenty of spending money and a new sense of confidence among the wealthier classes, the city now boasts a great nightlife scene, with designer bars, chic cafés and good clubs. Its auditoria host a wide range of national music and dance events, drawing on the richness of India\\'s great classical traditions. Smart new cinemas show innumerable Bollywood and Hollywood movies, while theatres hold performances in both Hindi and English.\r\n\r\nCrafts Museum  \r\n \r\nImmediately north of Purana Qila on Bhairon Marg, the Crafts Museum (Tues–Sun 10am–5pm; free) is a uniquely dynamic exhibition of the rural arts and crafts of India. Its village complex displays an assortment of building traditions, bringing together cultures from across the subcontinent to provide a unique, if artificial, insight into rural life. Authentically constructed mud huts are beautifully decorated with folk art, and exhibits include woodcarvings, paintings, papier-mâché, embroidery and a full-sized wooden haveli from Gujarat. Live demonstrations by the artisans offer close-up glimpses of the folk arts that can be all too difficult to obtain elsewhere in the country. You can buy ritual objects, ornaments, rugs, shawls and books from the craftsmen and women or from the excellent museum shop.\r\n \r\nHumayun\\'s Tomb  \r\n \r\nClose to the medieval Muslim centre of Nizamuddin and 2km from Purana Qila, Humayun\\'s Tomb (daily dawn–dusk; ) stands at the crossroads of the Lodi and Mathura roads, 500m from Nizamuddin railway station (one stop from New Delhi station on the suburban line). Delhi\\'s first Moghul mausoleum, it was constructed from 1564 onwards after the death of the second Moghul emperor, under the watchful eye of Haji Begum, Humayun\\'s senior widow and mother of Akbar, who camped here for the duration. The grounds were later used to inter several prominent Moghuls, and served as a refuge for the last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, captured here by the British in 1857.\r\n\r\nThough later eclipsed by the Jami Masjid and the Taj Mahal, its sombre, Persian-style elegance marks this as one of Delhi\\'s finest historic sites. Constructed of red sandstone, inlaid with black and white marble, on a commanding podium looking towards the Yamuna, it stands in the centre of the formal charbagh, or quartered garden. The octagonal structure is crowned with a double dome that soars to a height of 38m – the inner shell forms the vaulted ceiling. Porches on each side rise to 12.2-metre-high pointed arches, flanked by outer bays and recessed windows with lattice screens of stone and marble. Below the cenotaph, inside the building, are the graves of Humayun and Haji Begum.\r\n\r\nNearby stands the Nila Gumbad (\"blue dome\"), an octagonal tomb with a dome of blue tiles, supposedly built by one of Akbar\\'s nobles to honour a faithful servant, and which may possibly predate Humayun\\'s Tomb. Within the grounds southeast of the main mausoleum, another impressive square mausoleum, with a double dome and two graves bearing Koranic inscriptions, is that of Humayun\\'s barber, a man considered important because he was trusted with holding a razor to the emperor\\'s throat.\r\n \r\nRaj Ghat  \r\n \r\nWhen Shah Jahan established his city in 1638, its eastern edges bordered the River Yamuna, and a line of ghats, or steps leading to the water, was installed along the riverbanks. Ghats have been used in India for centuries, primarily for worship, but also for washing clothes and bathing, and for the final ritual, cremation. Raj Ghat, the site of the cremations of three of modern India\\'s most revered figures, Mahatma Gandhi (1948), Indira Gandhi (1984) and her son Rajiv (1991), is more of a park than a ghat, lying well away from the river bank. Rajiv is honoured by a striking frieze and his mother marked by a red-grey stone monolith. The Mahatma\\'s samadhi, a low black plinth, receives a steady stream of visitors, and he is remembered through prayers here every Friday evening, and on the anniversaries of his birth and death (Oct 2 &amp; Jan 30). Opposite Raj Ghat, the small Gandhi Memorial Museum (daily except Thurs 9.30am–5.30pm; free) houses some of Gandhi\\'s photographs and writings, and on Sundays you can watch a film on his political and personal life (March–Oct Hindi 6pm, English 7pm; Nov–Feb 4 &amp; 5pm).\r\n \r\nOld Delhi (Shahjahanabad)  \r\n \r\nAlthough it\\'s not in fact the oldest part of Delhi, the seventeenth-century city of Shahjahanabad, built by the Moghul emperor, Shah Jahan, is known as OLD DELHI. The original city walls spread for seven miles, enclosing the sprawling fort, Lal Qila, and the formidable Jami Masjid, or \"Friday Mosque\". Old Delhi\\'s main thoroughfare, Chandni Chowk, a seething mass of hooting, pushing cars, tempos, cycle rickshaws and ox carts, was once a sublime canal lined with trees and some of the most opulent bazaars of the East. Today the city walls have crumbled, and of the fourteen old gates only five remain. It\\'s a fascinating area, but you\\'ll need stamina, patience and time to endure the crowds and traffic.\r\n \r\nJami Masjid  \r\n \r\nOld Delhi\\'s red-and-white Jami Masjid (no set hours; free; Rs50 for cameras), 500m southwest of the Red Fort, is India\\'s largest mosque. Soaring above the narrow streets of the old city, it may look huge from a distance, but feels nothing short of immense once you\\'ve climbed the wide staircases to the arched gateways and entered the open courtyard, large enough to accommodate the bending bodies of 25,000 worshippers. It was designed by Shah Jahan and built by a workforce of 5000 between 1644 and 1656. Originally called Masjid-i-Jahanuma (\"mosque commanding a view of the world\"), this grand structure stands on Bho Jhala, one of Shahjahanabad\\'s two hills, and looks east to the sprawling Red Fort, and down on the seething streets of Old Delhi all around. Broad red sandstone staircases lead to gateways on the east, north and southern sides, where worshippers and visitors alike must remove their shoes. Dress conservatively.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the courtyard, your eyes will be drawn to the three bulbous marble domes crowning the main prayer hall on the west side (facing Mecca), fronted by a series of high cusped arches, and sheltering the mihrab, the central niche in the west wall reserved for the prayer leader. The pool in the centre is used for ritual ablutions. At each corner of the square yard a slender minaret crowned with a marble dome rises to the sky, and it\\'s well worth climbing the tower south of the main sanctuary (Rs10) for an unrivalled view over Delhi. In the northeast corner a white shrine protects a collection of Muhammad\\'s relics, shrouded in rose petals and watched over by keepers who will, in exchange for a tip, reveal the contents: two sections of the Koran written on deerskin by relatives of the prophet, a red beard-hair of Muhammad\\'s, his sandals, and his \"footprint\" miraculously embedded in a marble slab.\r\n \r\nQutb Minar Complex  \r\n \r\nAbove the foundations of Lal Kot, settled in the eighth century by the Tomara Rajputs and developed in the twelfth century by the Chauhans, the first monuments of Muslim India are now known as the Qutb Minar Complex (daily dawn–dusk; ), and stand in well-tended grounds 13km south of Connaught Place off Aurobindo Marg; to get here take bus #505 from Ajmeri Gate. One of Delhi\\'s most famous landmarks, the fluted red sandstone tower of the Qutb Minar tapers upwards from the ruins, covered with intricate carvings and deeply inscribed verses from the Koran, to a height of 72.5m. In times past it was considered one of the \"Wonders of the East\", second only to the Taj Mahal – in the words of the Victorian historian, James Ferguson, \"the most beautiful example of its class known anywhere\"; but historian John Keay was perhaps more representative of the modern eye when he claimed that the tower \"[had] an unfortunate hint of the factory chimney and the brick kiln; a wisp of white smoke trailing from its summit would not seem out of place\".\r\n\r\nWork on the Qutb Minar started in 1199; it was Qutb-ud-din Aibak\\'s victory tower, celebrating the advent of the Muslim dominance of Delhi (and much of the subcontinent) that was to endure until 1857. For Qutb-ud-din, who died four years after gaining power, it marked the eastern extremity of the Islamic faith, casting the shadow of God over east and west. It was also a minaret, from which the muezzin called the faithful to prayer. Only the first storey has been ascribed to Qutb-ud-din\\'s short reign; the other four were built by his successor Iltutmish, and the top was restored in 1369 by Firoz Shah, who used marble to face the red sandstone.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the tower lie the ruins of India\\'s first mosque, Quwwat-ul-Islam (\"the Might of Islam\"), built by Qutb-ud-din using the remains of 27 Hindu and Jain temples and the help of Hindu artisans – their influence can be seen in the detail of the masonry and the indigenous corbelled arches. Steps lead to an impressive courtyard flanked by cloisters and supported by pillars unmistakably taken from a Hindu temple and adapted to accord with strict Islamic law forbidding iconic worship – all the faces of the decorative figures carved into the columns have been removed. Especially fine ornamental arches, rising as high as 16m, remain of what was once the prayer hall. Beautifully carved sandstone screens, combining Koranic calligraphy with the Indian lotus, form a facade immediately to the west of the mosque, facing Mecca. Iltutmish and his successors extended the building, enlarging the prayer hall and the cloisters and introducing geometric designs, calligraphy, glazed tiles set in brick, and squinches (arches set diagonally to a square to support a dome).\r\n\r\nIn complete contrast to the mainly Islamic surroundings, an Iron Pillar (7.2m) stands in the corner of the mosque, bearing fourth-century Sanskrit inscriptions of the Gupta period attributing it to the memory of King Chandragupta II (373–413). Once topped with an image of the Hindu bird god, Garuda, the extraordinary and virtually rust-free pillar, made of 98 percent pure iron, is a puzzle to metallurgists. It must have been transplanted here, but its origins remain hazy. Tradition has it that anyone who can encircle the column with their hands behind their back will have their wishes granted.\r\n\r\nAla-i-Darwaza, a mausoleum-like gateway with stone lattice screens, was added by Ala-ud-din Khalji (1296–1316). Its inlaid marble embellishments are ascribed to an influx of Pathan artisans from Byzantine Turkey, and the import of Seljuk influences – the true arches were the first in India. The south entrance to the complex is marked by yet another tower, Alai Minar, which was planned as grander and larger than the Qutb Minar but left abandoned after the construction of its first storey.\r\n\r\nOn a plinth west of Quwwat-ul-Islam, the tomb of Iltutmish, built in 1235 by the ruler himself, is said to be the first Muslim mausoleum in India (Hindus cremate their dead rather than bury them). A relatively plain exterior blending Indian and Muslim styles, with three ornate arches, hides an interior 9m square with geometric arabesque patterns combined with calligraphy and lotus and wheel motifs.\r\n\r\nPerched above the scrubland 150m southeast of the Qutb Minar, the octagonal Moghul tomb of Muhammad Quli Khan, one of Akbar\\'s courtiers, was somewhat bizarrely occupied by Sir Thomas Metcalfe, resident at the Moghul court, as a country house – the first floor above the sepulchre room was converted into a living apartment, and the chamber beneath the dome became dining room. The building now lies in ruins. Another crumbling Raj-era house nearby still boasts a very ornamental English fireplace and swimming tank. Outside the complex, north of the Qutb Minar, Adham Khan\\'s tomb stands on the remains of the walls of Lal Kot. A general in Akbar\\'s army, Khan was hurled from the ramparts of Agra Fort on the orders of the emperor after some murderous court feuding. You can get good views of both the tomb and the Qutb complex from the roof of the Church of St John, an incongruous little chapel with an Anglican nave, monastic cloisters and a Hindu chhapra (tower), tucked down a lane opposite the tomb entrance.\r\n \r\nHauz Khas  \r\n \r\nThe Soho of Delhi, Hauz Khas is a wealthy suburban development, packed with boutiques and restaurants, 12km southwest of Connaught Place. The \"village\", as it\\'s known, is just off Aurobindo Marg (or the Delhi–Mehrauli Road), which leads from the centre to the Qutb Minar Complex, and adjacent to a pleasant deer park. The road through the shopping enclave leads to the ruins of Ala-ud-din-Khalji\\'s large tank (enclosed reservoir) known as Hauz-i-Alai, built early in the fourteenth century to supply water to the inhabitants of Siri, Delhi\\'s second city. It was expanded almost fifty years later by Firoz Shah Tughlak, who added a two-storey madrasa (seminary), and a mosque at its northern end.\r\n\r\nIn among the anonymous tombs scattered throughout the area is that of Firoz Shah himself, situated on the edge of the tank. Its high walls, lofty dome, and doorway spanned by a lintel with a stone railing outside, are fine examples of Hindu Indian traditions effectively blended with Islamic architecture. At dawn every day, the surrounding woodlands and the bed of the immense tank, once the site of Timur\\'s camp, come alive with Delhi-ites out walking, practising yoga and jogging; in the evenings, Hauz Khas\\'s salubrious restaurants attract diners from all over the city.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m656n55v2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[77.209999,28.67]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delos","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m6580ubp4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.22324,37.41816]}},{"properties":{"name":"Delos","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65b1084e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.266667,37.4]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dubrovnik","description":"Posted by Kaozdubrovnik, croatiaDUBROVNIK is a beautifully preserved medieval fortified city. First settled by Roman refugees in the early seventh century and given the name Ragusa, the town soon exploited its favourable position on the Adriatic with a maritime and commercial genius unmatched anywhere else in Europe. By the mid-fourteenth century, having shaken off the yoke of first the Byzantines and then the Venetians, it had become a successful and self-contained city state, its merchants trading far and wide. Dubrovnik fended off the attentions of the Ottoman Empire and continued to prosper until 1667, when an earthquake devastated the city. Though the city-state survived, it fell into decline and, in 1808, was formally dissolved by Napoleon. An eight-month siege by Yugoslav forces in the early 1990s caused much destruction, but the city swiftly recovered. The prestigious Summer Festival (July 10 to Aug 25; tel 020/412-288, www.dubrovnik-festival.hr) is a good, if crowded, time to be around, with classical concerts and theatre performances in most of the city\\'s courtyards, squares and bastions.

The pace of life in this former colonial enclave, midway down India\\'s southwest coast, has picked up over the past twenty years, but in spite of the increasing chaos of its capital, beach resorts and market towns, Goa has retained the laid-back feel that has traditionally set it apart from the rest of the country. Its 1.4 million inhabitants are unequivocal about the roots of their distinctiveness; while most of the subcontinent was colonized by the stiff-upper-lipped British, Goa\\'s European overlords were the Portuguese, a people far more inclined to enjoy the good things in life than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts.\r\n\r\nGoa was Portugal\\'s first toe-hold in Asia, and served as the linchpin for a vast trade network for over 450 years. However, when the Lusitanian empire began to founder in the seventeenth century, so too did the fortunes of its capital. Cut off from the rest of India by a wall of mountains and hundreds of miles of un-navigable alluvial plain, it remained resolutely aloof from the wider subcontinent – while India was tearing itself to pieces in the run-up to Independence in 1947, the only machetes being wielded here were cutting coconuts. Not until 1961, after exasperated Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru gave up trying to negotiate with the Portuguese dictator Salazar and sent in the army, was Goa finally absorbed into India.\r\n\r\nThose who visited in the late 1960s and 1970s, when the overland travellers\\' trail wriggled its way south from Bombay, found a way of life little changed in centuries: Portuguese was still very much the lingua franca of the well educated elite, and the coastal settlements were mere fishing and coconut cultivation villages. Relieved to have found somewhere inexpensive and culturally undemanding to recover from the travails of Indian travel, the \"freaks\" got stoned, watched the mesmeric sunsets over the Arabian Sea and partied madly on full-moon nights, giving rise to a holiday culture that soon made Goa synonymous with hedonistic hippies.\r\n\r\nSince then, the state has largely shaken off its reputation as a drop-out zone, but hundreds of thousands of visitors still flock here each winter, the vast majority to relax on Goa\\'s beautiful beaches. Around two dozen stretches of soft white sand indent the region\\'s coast, from spectacular 25-kilometre sweeps to secluded palm-backed coves. The level of development varies wildly; while some are lined by ritzy Western-style resorts, the most sophisticated structures on others are palm-leaf shacks and old wooden outriggers that are heaved into the sea each afternoon.\r\n\r\nWherever you travel in Goa, vestiges of former Portuguese domination are ubiquitous, creating an ambience that is at once exotic and strangely familiar. This is particularly true of Goan food which, blending the Latin love of meat and fish with India\\'s predilection for spices, is quite unlike any other regional cuisine in Asia. Equally unique is the prevalence of alcohol. Beer is cheap, and six thousand or more bars around the state are licensed to serve it, along with the more traditional tipple, feni, a rocket-fuel spirit distilled from cashew fruit or coconut sap.\r\n\r\nTravelling around the Christian heartland of central Goa, with its whitewashed churches and wayside shrines, it\\'s all too easy to forget that Hinduism remains the religion of more than two-thirds of the state\\'s population. Unlike in many parts of the country, however, religious intolerance is rare here, and traditional practices mingle easily with more recently implanted ones. Faced by the threat of merger with neighbouring states, Goans have always put regional cohesion before communal differences at the ballot box. A potent stimulus for regional identity was the campaign through the 1980s to have Konkani, the language spoken by the vast majority of Goans, recognized as an official state language, which it eventually was in 1992. Since then, the immigration issue has come to dominate the political agenda. Considerably more prosperous than neighbouring states, Goa has been deluged over the past couple of decades with economic refugees, stirring up fears that the region\\'s cultural distinctiveness will disappear. Among the main employers of migrant labour in recent years has been the Konkan Railway, completed in 1997 to form a super-fast land link with Mumbai – another conduit of economic prosperity that has brought lasting changes.\r\n\r\nWhich beach you opt for when you arrive largely depends on what sort of holiday you have in mind. More developed resorts such as Calangute and Baga in the north, and Colva and Benaulim in the south, offer more \"walk-in\" accommodation and tourist facilities than elsewhere. Even if you\\'re looking for a less touristy scene, it can be worth heading for these centres first, as finding places to stay in less commercialized corners is often difficult. Anjuna, Vagator, and Chapora, where accommodation is generally more basic and harder to come by, are the beaches to aim for if you\\'ve come to Goa to party. However, the bulk of budget travellers taking time out from tours of India end up in Palolem, in the far south, or Arambol, both beyond the increasingly long reach of the charter buses. That said, Palolem, in particular, has become a resort in its own right, with thousands of long-stay visitors in peak season.\r\n\r\nSome 10km from the state capital, Panjim, the ruins of the former Portuguese capital at Old Goa are foremost among the attractions away from the coast – a sprawl of Catholic cathedrals, convents and churches that draw crowds of Christian pilgrims from all over India. Another popular day excursion is to Anjuna\\'s Wednesday flea market, a sociable place to shop for souvenirs and dance wear. Further inland, the thickly wooded countryside around Ponda harbours numerous temples, where you can experience Goa\\'s peculiar brand of Hindu architecture. The district of Salcete, and its main market town, Margao, is also littered with Portuguese mansions, churches and seminaries. Finally, wildlife enthusiasts may be tempted into the interior to visit the nature reserve at Cotigao in the far south.\r\n\r\nThe best time to come to Goa is during the dry, relatively cool winter months between mid-November and mid-March. At other times, either the sun is too hot for comfort, or the monsoon rains and clouds make life miserable. During peak season, from mid-December to the end of January, the weather is perfect, with temperatures rarely nudging above 32°C. Finding a room or a house to rent at that time, however – particularly over Christmas and New Year when tariffs double, or triple – can be a real hassle.\r\n \r\nOld Goa  \r\n \r\nA one-time a byword for splendour with a population of several hundred thousand, Goa\\'s erstwhile former capital, OLD GOA, was virtually abandoned following malaria and cholera epidemics from the seventeenth century onwards. Today you need considerable imagination to picture the once-great capital as it used to be. The maze of twisting streets, piazzas and ochre-washed villas has gone, and all that remains is a score of cream-painted churches and convents. Granted World Heritage Status by UNESCO, Old Goa today attracts bus-loads of foreign tourists from the coast, and Christian pilgrims from around India, in roughly equal numbers. While the former come to admire the gigantic facades and gilt altars of the beautifully preserved churches, the main attraction for the latter is the tomb of St Francis Xavier, the renowned sixteenth-century missionary, whose remains are enshrined in the Basilica of Bom Jesus.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re staying on the coast and contemplating a day-trip inland, this is the most obvious and accessible option. Just thirty minutes by road from the state capital, Old Goa is served by buses every fifteen minutes from Panjim\\'s Kadamba bus stand; alternatively, hop into an auto-rickshaw (Rs75), or rent a taxi (Rs200–250).\r\n\r\nBasilica of Bom Jesus  \r\n \r\nClose to the convent of St Francis, the 1605 church of Bom Jesus, \"Good\" or \"Menino Jesus\" (Mon–Sat 9am–6.30pm, Sun 10am–6.30pm), is known principally for the tomb of St Francis Xavier. In 1946, it became the first church in India to be elevated to the status of Minor Basilica. On the west, the three-storey Renaissance facade encompasses Corinthian, Doric, Ionic and Composite styles.\r\n\r\nThe interior is entered beneath the choir, supported by columns. On the northern wall, in the centre of the nave, is a cenotaph in gilded bronze to Dom Jeronimo Mascarenhas, the Captain of Cochin and benefactor of the church. The main altar, extravagantly decorated in gold, depicts the infant Jesus under the protection of St Ignatius Loyola (founder of the Jesuit Order); to each side are subsidiary altars to Our Lady of Hope and St Michael. In the southern transept, lavishly decorated with twisted gilded columns and floriate carvings, stands the Chapel and Tomb of St Francis Xavier. Constructed of marble and jasper in 1696, it was the gift of the Medici, Cosimo III, the Grand Duke of Tuscany; the middle tier contains panels detailing the saint\\'s life. An ornate domed reliquary in silver contains his remains; for a week around his feast day, December 3, tens of thousands of pilgrims – Hindus as well as Christians – queue for darshan (ritual viewing) of the casket before attending open-air Mass in the square outside.\r\n \r\nChurch of St Francis of Assisi and Archeological Museum  \r\n \r\nSouthwest of the Sé Cathedral is the ruined Palace of the Inquisition, in operation up until 1774, while to the west stands the Convent of St Francis of Assisi, built by Franciscan monks in 1517 and restored in the mid-eighteenth century. Today, the core of its Archeological Museum (daily except Fri 10am–5pm; Rs5) is a gallery of portraits of Portuguese viceroys, painted by local artists under Italian supervision. Other exhibits include coins, domestic Christian wooden sculpture, and downstairs in the cloister, pre-Portuguese Hindu sculpture. Next door, the Church of St Francis (1521) features fine decorative frescoes and paintings on wood showing the life of St Francis of Assisi.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65864y4k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.832779,15.382778]}},{"properties":{"name":"Guilin","description":"Posted by Kaozguilin, china<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m652m3sns"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[110.279998,25.28]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hawick","description":"Posted by Kaozhawick, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64xk6c0y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.786878,55.422569]}},{"properties":{"name":"Helensburgh","description":"Posted by Kaozhelensburgh, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64z9g0be"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.732862,56.004944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hvar","description":"Posted by Kaozhvar, croatiaOne of the most hyped of all the Croatian islands, HVAR is undeniably beautiful – a slim, green slice of land punctured by jagged inlets and cloaked with hills of spongy lavender. Tourist development hasn\\'t been too crass, and the island\\'s main centre, Hvar Town, retains much of its old Venetian charm. At least one daily ferry from Split arrives at Hvar Town itself; numerous others head for Stari Grad, 4km east, from where buses run into Hvar Town.\r\n\r\nThe best view of HVAR TOWN is from the sea, the tiny town hugging the bay, grainy-white and brown with green splashes of palms and pines bursting from every crack and cranny. At the centre, the main square is flanked to the south by the arcaded bulk of the Venetian arsenal, the upper storey of which was added in 1612 to house a theatre (daily: summer 9am–1pm &amp; 5–11pm; winter 11am–noon; 10kn), the oldest in Croatia and one of the first in Europe. The theatre has since been converted to a cinema, but its painted Baroque interior has survived pretty much intact. At the eastern end of the square is Hvar\\'s cathedral (usually open mornings), a sixteenth-century construction with an eighteenth-century facade that\\'s a characteristic mixture of Gothic and Renaissance styles. Inside is routine enough, but the Bishop\\'s Treasury (daily: summer 9am–noon &amp; 5–7pm; winter 10am–noon; 10kn) is worth the entry fee for its small but fine selection of chalices and reliquaries. The rest of the old town stretches back from the piazza in an elegant confusion of twisting lanes and alleys. Up above, the fortress (daily: May–Sept daily 8am–dusk; 10kn) is a good example of sixteenth-century military architecture. The views over Hvar and the islands beyond are well worth the trek to the top. From the fort you can pick out the fifteenth-century Franciscan Monastery (summer Mon–Fri 10am–noon &amp; 5–7pm; winter 10am–noon; 10kn), to the left of the harbour; next door, the monastic church is pleasingly simple, with beautifully carved choir stalls.\r\n\r\nThe beaches nearest to town are rocky and crowded, and it\\'s best to make your way towards the Pakleni otoci, just to the west. Easily reached by water taxi from the harbour (about 15kn each way), the Pakleni are a chain of eleven wooded islands, three of which cater for tourists with simple bars and restaurants: Jerolim island is the nearest; next is Marinkovac; then Sv Klement, the largest of the islands. Bear in mind that camping is forbidden throughout Pakleni.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65ac5gpp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.44,43.169998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Inveraray","description":"Posted by Kaozinveraray, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m653mryuv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.074131,56.230577]}},{"properties":{"name":"Inverness","description":"Posted by Kaozinvernesscapital of the highlands<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65atsk3v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.236648,57.479786]}},{"properties":{"name":"Iona","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m6589w4hv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.409492,56.329102]}},{"properties":{"name":"Istanbul","description":"Posted by KaozistanbulArriving in İSTANBUL can come as a shock. Most visitors head for the old city in and around Sultanahmet, where back streets teem with traders pushing handcarts, stevedores carrying burdens twice their size, and omnipresent shoeshine boys. Men still monopolize the public bars and teahouses, while many women cover their heads. Yet this is merely one aspect of modern İstanbul; only a couple of kilometres to the north you\\'ll find the former European quarter of Beyoğlu, with its trendy bars and cutting-edge dance clubs, while north again are the pavement cafés and restaurants of Ortaköy and a series of swish Bosphorus suburbs.\r\n\r\nİstanbul is the only city in the world to have played capital to consecutive Christian and Islamic empires, and retains features of both. Byzantium, as the city was formerly known, was an important trading centre, but only gained power in the fourth century AD, when Constantine chose it as the new capital of the Roman Empire. Later, as Constantinople, the city became increasingly dissociated from Rome, adopting the Greek language and Christianity and becoming the capital of an independent empire. In 1203 the city was sacked by the Crusaders. As the Byzantines declined, the Ottoman Empire prospered, and in 1453 the city was captured by Mehmet the Conqueror. In the following century, the victory was reinforced by the great military achievements of Selim the Grim and by the reign of Süleyman the Magnificent. By the nineteenth century, however, the glory days of Ottoman domination were firmly over. Defeat in World War I was followed by the War of Independence, after which Atatürk created a new capital in Ankara – although İstanbul retained its importance as a centre of trade and commerce. In recent years, the population of the city has reached twelve million, almost a fifth of the country\\'s total, and is still on the rise, adding further to the cacophony and congestion.\r\n\r\nThe city is divided in two by the Bosphorus, which runs between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, dividing Europe from Asia. At right angles to it, the inlet of the Golden Horn cuts the European side in two. The old centre of Sultanahmet, occupying the tip of the peninsula south of the Golden Horn, is home to the city\\'s main sightseeing attractions: the cathedral of Aya Sofya, Topkapı Palace and the Blue Mosque. Annoying hustlers mean first impressions can be negative, but tourist police will respond quickly to any problems you may have. Further west, near the city walls, lies the Kariye Camii, which contains the city\\'s finest surviving Byzantine mosaics and frescoes. Across the Golden Horn to the north, the Galata Tower offers superb panoramic views over the city.\r\n\r\nBlue Mosque  \r\n \r\nWith its six minarets, the Sultanahmet Camii, or Blue Mosque (daily 9am–7pm; closed prayer times), is instantly recognizable; inside, its four \"elephant foot\" pillars obscure parts of the building and dwarf the dome they support. It\\'s the 20,000-odd blue tiles inside that lend the mosque its name - fine examples of late-sixteenth-century İznık ware, they include flower and tree panels as well as more abstract designs. Outside the precinct wall is the Tomb of Sultan Ahmet (daily 8.30am–5pm), where the sultan is buried along with his wife and three of his sons. Behind the mosque is the Vakıf Carpet Museum (Tues–Sat 9am–4pm; ), which houses antique carpets and kilims from all over Turkey.\r\n\r\nWest of the Blue Mosque the Hippodrome arena was constructed by Septimus Severus in 200 AD. The Egyptian Obelisk at its southern end was originally 60m tall, but only the upper third survived shipment from Egypt in the fourth century. The scenes carved on the base record its erection in Constantinople under the direction of Theodosius I. Nearby, the Serpentine Column comes from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi and was brought here by Constantine.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the Hippodrome, the former palace of İbrahim Paşa, completed in 1524 for the grand vizier of Süleyman the Magnificent, is a fitting home for the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art (Tues–Sun 9am–5pm; ), containing the best-exhibited collection of Islamic artefacts in the world. İbrahim Paşa\\'s magnificent audience hall is devoted to a collection of Turkish carpets, while on the ground floor, in rooms off the central courtyard, is an exhibition of the folk art of the Yörük tribes of Anatolia.\r\n\r\nTo the north, on the corner of Yerebatan Caddesi, the Yerebatan Saray or \"Sunken Palace\" (daily 9am–4.30/5.30pm; ) is one of several underground cisterns that riddle the foundations of the city. Probably built by Constantine and enlarged by Justinian, the cistern is thought to have supplied water to the Great Palace of the Byzantine emperors. Raised pathways allow you to walk through the cistern\\'s forest of columns, and gaze upon the monumental Medusa heads that support two of them. On the other side of the Blue Mosque, the Mosaic Museum (Tues–Sun 9.15am–4.30pm; ), on Torun Sokak, displays some of the magnificent mosaics that once decorated the floors of the Great Palace, a vast complex which once stretched from the Hippodrome down to the sea walls.\r\n \r\nAya Sofya  \r\n \r\nThe former Byzantine cathedral of Aya Sofya (Tues–Sun 9.15am–4.30/6pm; 0), readily visible thanks to its massive domed structure, is perhaps the single most compelling sight in the city. Commissioned in the sixth century by the Emperor Justinian, it was converted to a mosque in 1453, after which the minarets were added; it\\'s been a museum since 1934. For centuries this was the largest enclosed space in the world, and the interior – filled with shafts of light from the high windows around the dome – is still profoundly impressive. Scaffolding currently obscures part of the dome\\'s interior, but nevertheless helps bring home the scale of the place. Between the four great piers that hold up the dome, columns of green marble support the galleries. There are a few features left over from its time as a mosque – a mihrab (niche indicating the direction of Mecca), a mimber (pulpit) and the enormous wooden plaques which bear sacred names of God, the prophet Muhammad and the first four caliphs. The balconies, pediments and capitals are of white marble, many bearing the monograms of Justinian and his wife Theodora. Upstairs in the western gallery (closes one hour before museum) a large circle of green Thessalian marble marks the position of the throne of the empress. There are also remains of abstract and figurative mosaics. Two of the most beautiful can be seen upstairs, where the figures of Christ and Virgin with Child, as depicted on countless posters and postcards, can be found.\r\n \r\nCovered Bazaar, Sülemaniye Camii and Spice Bazaar  \r\n \r\nWest of Sultanahmet, continue along busy Divan Yolu to Cemberlitaş, or the Column of Constantine, erected in 330 AD to mark the city\\'s dedication as capital of the Roman Empire. Off the main street to the right lies the district of Beyazıt, centred on the Kapalı Çarşı, or Covered Bazaar (Mon–Sat 8.30am–6.30/7.30pm; www.kapali-carsi.com), a huge web of passageways housing over 4000 shops. It has long since spilled out of the covered area, sprawling into the streets that lead down to the Golden Horn. There are carpet shops everywhere catering for all budgets, shops selling leather goods around Kurkçular Kapı and Perdahçılar Caddesi, and gold jewellery on Kuyumcular Caddesi. Don\\'t forget to haggle. When you need a break, the Fes Café on Halıcilar Caddesi is a comfortable spot to gloat over your booty.\r\n\r\nWest of the bazaar, peek into the Beyazit Camii, the oldest surviving imperial mosque in the city (1506), with a beautiful courtyard full of richly coloured marble. Beyond the Covered Bazaar, in a pleasant area of shady courtyards behind the university, stands one of the finest of all the Ottoman mosque complexes, the Süleymaniye Camii. The cemetery here (Wed–Sun 9.30am–6.30pm) holds the tomb of Süleyman the Magnificent and of Roxelana, his powerful wife. Süleyman\\'s tomb is particularly impressive, with doors inlaid with ebony and ivory, silver and jade. The rest of the complex is made up of the famous Süleymaniye Library, and the Tomb of Mimar Sinan, a simple tomb for the master imperial architect except for a magnificent carved turban.\r\n\r\nThe area sloping down to the river behind the Covered Bazaar is known as Eminönü, where, on the waterfront, is the last of İstanbul\\'s imperial mosques, Yeni Camii. Next door, the Mısır Çarşısı (Egyptian Bazaar), also known as the Spice Bazaar, sells everything from saffron to aphrodisiacs. A short walk west, the Rüştem Paşa Camii is one of the most attractive of İstanbul\\'s smaller mosques, with tiles from the finest period of İznik tile production. On the waterfront, the most prominent landmark is the Galata Bridge, a modern two-tier structure that provides access to the opposite bank of the Golden Horn.\r\n \r\nTopkapı Palace  \r\n \r\nImmediately north of Aya Sofya, Topkap? Palace (Wed–Mon 9am–5pm; ) is the other unmissable sight. Ongoing restoration work means parts of the museum and some less important palace rooms are often closed, but this is unlikely to spoil your visit – there\\'s still plenty to see. Built between 1459 and 1465, the palace was the centre of the Ottoman Empire for nearly four centuries. The ticket office is in the first courtyard, with the second courtyard the site of the beautifully restored Divan, containing the Imperial Council Hall and the couch that gave the institution its name. The Divan tower is a useful landmark, visible from many vantage points across the city. In the Inner Treasury there\\'s an exhibition of arms and armour, while across the courtyard are the palace kitchens, with their magnificent rows of chimneys. Around the corner is the Harem, well worth the obligatory guided tour (9am–noon &amp; 1–4pm, every 30min; .50; buy your ticket at least 15min in advance). The only men once allowed in here were eunuchs and the imperial guardsmen, who were only employed at certain hours and even then blinkered. Many rooms have never been opened to the public and are awaiting restoration, but the tour takes in a good part of the 400-room complex, including the Hünkar Sofası (Imperial Hall) where the sultan entertained his visitors, and the bedchamber of Murat III, covered in sixteenth-century ?zn?k tiles and kitted out with a marble fountain and bronze fireplace. Back in the main body of the palace, in the third courtyard, the throne room was where the sultan awaited the outcome of sessions of the Divan in order to give his assent or otherwise to their proposals. Nearby, the Pavilion of the Conqueror (9am–5pm; .50) houses the Topkap? treasury, where you can see such famous items as the Topkap? Dagger, decorated with three enormous emeralds, and the Spoonmaker\\'s Diamond, the fifth largest in the world. In the Pavilion of the Holy Mantle are the holy relics brought home by Selim the Grim after his conquest of Egypt in 1517. The fourth courtyard consists of gardens graced with various pavilions, including the circumcision room and the sumptuously decorated Mecidiye Kö?kü, which commands the best view of any of the Topkap? pavilions.\r\n\r\nJust north of Topkap?, Gülhane Park?, once the palace gardens, now houses three museums all covered by one  ticket. In the Archeological Museum (Tues–Sun 9am–5pm) is a superb collection of sarcophagi, sculptures and other remains of past civilizations. The adjacent Çinili Kö?k is the oldest secular building in ?stanbul, now a Museum of Ceramics (Tues–Sun 9.30am–5pm), housing a select collection of ?zn?k ware and Seljuk tiles. Nearby, the Museum of the Ancient Orient (Wed–Sun 9.30am–5pm) contains a small but dazzling collection of Anatolian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian artefacts.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65c0nw2d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[29.0,41.099998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jaipur","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m6595h7xg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[75.800003,26.92]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jaipur","description":"Posted by Kaoz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/11/3/header_r1_c3.jpg\">A flamboyant showcase of Rajasthani architecture, the Pink City of JAIPUR has long been established on tourist itineraries as the third corner of India\\'s \"Golden Triangle\", just 300km southwest of Delhi and 200km west of Agra. Though the \"Pink City\" label applies specifically to the old walled quarter of the state capital, in the northeast of town, exuberant eighteenth- and nineteenth-century palaces are scattered throughout the whole urban area. The orderly bazaars of the old town rank among the most vibrant in Asia, renowned above all for hand-dyed and embroidered textiles, jewellery, and the best selection of precious stones and metals in India. For all its colour, however, Jaipur\\'s heavy traffic, combined with the aggression of over-eager traders and touts, tends to reduce the appeal of a long stay. Few travellers find it easy to relax here, and most leave craving the fresher air and laid-back pace of Bharatpur or the Thar Desert towns.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re anywhere near Jaipur in March, don\\'t miss the Elephant Festival, one of India\\'s most flamboyant parades, celebrated with full Rajput pomp during Holi (March).\r\n\r\nCity Palace  \r\n \r\nThe magnificent City Palace (daily 9.30am–4.45pm; Rs150, Rs50 extra for camera, Rs150 extra for video; same ticket also valid for Jaigarh Fort at Amber if used within 24hr), open to the public as the Sawai Man Singh Museum, stands enclosed by a high wall in the centre of the city amid fine gardens and courtyards. The royal family still occupies part of the palace, advancing in procession on formal occasions through the grand Tripolia Gate in the centre of the southern wall. Less regal visitors must enter through Atish Gate left of the main gate or Nakkar Gate in the west, passing the food stalls and souvenir shops in Jalebi Chowk.\r\n\r\nThe palace was conceived and built by Jai Singh, but many of the apartments and halls were added by his successors. The exhibits and interior design have lost none of the pomp and splendour of their glory days. Each door and gateway is heavily decorated, each chandelier intact and each hall guarded by turbaned retainers decked in full royal livery, so that Jaipur\\'s palace impresses upon the visitor the continuity of a living royal presence.\r\n\r\nAn ornate gateway in the southwest corner of the complex leads into the first courtyard, with the solid marble Mubarak Mahal in its centre. This elegant palace, built in 1899, holds the textile section of the museum, whose treasures include throne carpets and antique pashmina shawls from Kashmir. Opulently decorated ritual objects are also on display, but the real highlight is the former maharani\\'s richly gilded black Diwali outfit, covered in elaborate gota appliqué work. The first floor of the building next to the Mubarak Mahal, once the harem, houses the royal arsenal.\r\n\r\nAs you enter the second courtyard you\\'re confronted by the raised Diwan-i-Khas, the Hall of Private Audience, built in sandstone and marble. Open-sided, with its roof raised on marble pillars, the hall contains two silver urns, or gangajalis, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest crafted silver objects in the world, each more than 1.5m high with a capacity of 8182 litres. When Madho Singh II went to England to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1901, he was so reluctant to trust the water in the West that he had these urns filled with Ganges water and took them along with him.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the compound, with balconies and windows studding its seven-storey facade, Chandra Mahal is the residence of the royal family. You can see it best from Pritam Niwas Chowk, known as Peacock Courtyard, to the west of the Diwan-i-Khas.\r\n\r\nThe largest section of the museum is housed in the Diwan-i-Am, once the Hall of Public Audience. The intricately painted walls provide perfect mounts for immense medieval Afghan and Persian carpets. Miniatures from the Moghul and Jaipur schools, and Jai Singh\\'s translations in Arabic and Sanskrit of the astronomical treatises of ancient scientists such as Euclid and Ptolemy, are displayed in glass cases.\r\n \r\nHawa Mahal  \r\n \r\nJaipur\\'s most acclaimed landmark, the tapering Hawa Mahal, or \"Palace of Winds\" (daily 10am–5pm; Rs5, Rs30 extra for camera or video), stands to the west of the City Palace, where it exudes an orangey-pink glow in the rays of the rising sun (8–9am is the best time for photographs). Built in 1799 to enable the women of the court to watch street processions while remaining in a strict state of purdah, its five-storey facade, decked with no less than 593 finely screened windows and balconies, makes the building seem far larger than it really is; in fact it is little more than one room thick in most parts. Though the primary source of its appeal is undoubtedly the fantastic honeycomb pink-and-white face, visitors can go inside (enter from the back) to see exactly where the women sat, and take a close look at the detailed stonework.\r\n \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m658fmukv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[75.800003,26.92]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jaisalmer","description":"Posted by KaozIn the remote westernmost corner of Rajasthan, a good 100km beyond its closest neighbour Pokaran, JAISALMER is a desert town par excellence, its sand-yellow ramparts rising out of the arid Thar like a vision from Scheherazade. Put off by reports of rampant commercialism, many travellers never make the long detour out here, but in spite of all the souvenir shops, hotel touts and large tour groups, the town remains one of India\\'s most enchanting destinations. Villagers from outlying settlements, dressed in dazzling red and orange odhnis or voluminous turbans, still outnumber foreigners in the bazaar, while the exquisite sandstone architecture of the \"Golden City\" is quite unlike anything else in India.\r\n\r\nHavelis  \r\n \r\nThe streets of Jaisalmer are flanked with numerous honey-pale facades, covered with latticework and floral designs, but the city\\'s real showpieces are its havelis. Each of these extravagant mansions, comprising three or more storeys around a central courtyard, was commissioned by a wealthy merchant during the eighteenth or nineteenth century. Their stonework was the art of silavats, a community of masons responsible for much of Jaisalmer\\'s unique sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe large Patwon-ki-Haveli (daily 9.30am–5pm; Rs2), not far from Narayan NiwasHotel in the north of town, was constructed over fifty years by the Patwa merchants – brocade and opium traders. Five separate suites with individual entrances facing a narrow street are connected from within, and all have flat roof areas – the views are excellent. Traces of stylish wall-paintings survive in some rooms. The building\\'s most striking features, however, are its exuberantly carved jharokhas, or protruding balconies.\r\n\r\nSalim Singh\\'s small haveli provides Jaisalmer\\'s only favourable memory of the tyrannical Salim Singh Mohta, who became prime minister in 1800 after his father was murdered for publicly challenging a Rajput prince to repay a loan. From an early age, Salim seemed hell-bent on avenging this crime, impoverishing Jaisalmer\\'s citizens through vigorous taxation and extortion rackets, and holding the royal family to ransom by raising interest rates on their huge loans. He was eventually stabbed by a furious Rajput, and his wife made sure the wound wouldn\\'t heal by infesting it with poison. Their curious family home is topped with small blueish domes; its upper floor, enclosed by a protruding balcony, is best seen from the roof of Natraj Restaurant. The house is still lived in, but you can go inside for Rs15. On the road to Malka Pole, you pass the decorative facade of the late-nineteenth-century Nathmalji-ki-Haveli, also built for a prime minister of Jaisalmer. It\\'s Rs10 to visit inside and you can expect a hard sell at the gift shop.\r\n \r\nCamel safaris from Jaisalmer  \r\n \r\nFew visitors who make it as far as Jaisalmer pass up the opportunity to go on a camel trek, which provides an irresistibly romantic chance to cross the barren sands, sleeping under one of the starriest skies in the world. Sandstorms, sore backsides and camel farts aside, the safaris are usually great fun.\r\n\r\nAlthough you can travel for up to two weeks by camel from Jaisalmer to Bikaner, treks normally last from one to four days, at prices varying from Rs350 to Rs1500 per night. In general the less you spend the less you get, in terms of food, blankets, fitness of camel, and so forth. A lot depends on whether the guides are friendly, how big the group is, and what expectations you have. Freelance camel owners, working for extremely low prices, may stop you in the street and offer their services, but increased demand has resulted in high prices and very poor service from some. All in all, you\\'ll do better to go through an established agency or hotel. A couple of reputable operators are mentioned in this Guide, and you should also check with other travellers. Make sure you\\'ll be provided with an adequate supply of blankets (it can get very cold at night); a quota of fruit if you\\'re paying anything over the average; and a campfire. As a precaution, have the deal fixed on paper, giving the maximum size of the group, details of the food you\\'ll be getting, transport and anything else you\\'ve arranged. If you\\'re only going for a day, none of this applies, but wear a broad-brimmed hat and take high-factor sun-protection lotion.\r\n\r\nFollowing government restrictions on routes, most safaris head west of Jaisalmer through places such as Sam sand dunes, Lodurva, Amar Sagar, Bada Bagh and assorted small villages. Some visitors feel this puts too much emphasis on sightseeing; it\\'s possible to arrange a few days\\' amble through the desert without stopping at any monuments. Taking a Jeep at the start or end of the trek enables you to go further in a short time, and some travellers prefer to begin their trek at Khuhri. Longer treks to Pokaran, Jodhpur or Bikaner can also be arranged. Firms running treks into restricted areas should fix the necessary permits for you, but check in advance.\r\n\r\nHowever much you intend to spend on a trek, don\\'t book anything until you get to Jaisalmer. Unscrupulous touts trawl the train from Jodhpur, and even try to pick up tourists in Udaipur, but they, and the barrage of operators at the bus and railway stations, usually represent dodgy outfits, most of which are based at one or other of the small budget hotels north of the fort. Some offer absurdly cheap rooms if you agree to book a camel trek with them, but guesthouse notice boards (not to mention our postbags) are filled with sorry stories by tourists who accepted.\r\n \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m6548qu5l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.900001,26.92]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jodhpur","description":"Posted by KaozOn the eastern fringe of the Thar Desert, JODHPUR, dubbed \"the Blue City\" after the colour-wash of its old town houses, sprawls across the arid terrain, overlooked by the mighty Meherangarh fort, whose ramparts rise from a sheer-sided sandstone outcrop. It was once the centre of Marwar, the largest princely state in Rajputana, and today has a population of 1.2 million. Most of the tourists that stop in Jodhpur only stay for a day, squeezing in a visit to the fort before heading west to Jaisalmer (300km) or east to Jaipur (320km). It\\'s a shame to rush the place though. Getting lost in the blue maze of the old city you\\'ll stumble across Muslim tie-dyers, puppet makers and traditional spice markets, while Jodhpur\\'s famed cubic roofscape, best viewed at sunset, is a photographer\\'s dream. In addition, the encroaching desert beyond the blue city is dotted with small settlements where you can escape the congestion for a taste of rural Rajasthan.\r\n\r\nMeherangarh Fort  \r\n \r\nJodhpur\\'s Meherangarh Fort (daily: summer 8.30am–1pm &amp; 2.30–5.30pm; winter 9am–1pm &amp; 2–5pm; Rs250 entry includes headphone guide; Rs200 extra for video, camera free; elevator Rs15), provides what must be the most authentic surviving taste of the ceaseless round of war, honour and extravagance that characterized Rajputana. Unlike the fort in Jaisalmer, it is uninhabited, its paths trodden only by visitors to the temples and palaces within its high crenellated walls. The walk up to the fort from the old city passes through busy bazaars, with some streets so narrow that pedestrians must advance in single file. You can also reach the fort by taxi or rickshaw along the much longer road (5km) that enters the old city at Nagauri Gate. Allow at least a couple of hours for a tour of the various exhibitions inside the palace, followed by a stroll out to the Durga temple, perched on the far southern tip of the precipice, from where the views over the old city are superb. A good place to steel yourself for the visit, or recover afterwards, is the fort\\'s cool little restaurant, just inside the main entrance.\r\n\r\nOn the wall next to Loha Pole, the sixth of seven gates designed to hinder the ascent of enemies up a steep winding cobbled road, are the handprints of Maharaja Man Singh\\'s widows. Following the Rajput code of honour, they voluntarily ended their lives in 1843 on their husband\\'s pyre, in defiance of the law against sati passed in 1829 by the British. As you stop to look at them, musicians and dancers will strike up in the hope of receiving a tip.\r\n\r\nBeyond the massive Suraj Pole, the final gate, lie the palaces that now serve as the Meherangarh Museum. From the courtyards, you can see the fantastic jali (lattice) work that almost entirely covers their sandstone walls and balconies, as well as a portrait of Rao Jodha himself. Solid silver howdahs (elephant seats) and palanquins are on display, as well as weapons and photos of the maharajas\\' coronations. In the Jhanki Mahal, or \"Queen\\'s Palace\", there\\'s a colourful array of cradles of former rulers, while Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace) holds the nine chairs reserved for the nine heads of the Jodhpurian state (and one central cushion for the maharaja). Outside, in Shangar Chowk (King\\'s Coronation Courtyard), is the majestic marble coronation seat upon which all the rulers apart from Jodha have been, and still are, crowned. One prize exhibit in the museum is a 250-year-old pure silk tent seized during a raid on the Moghul court in Delhi. The most elaborate of the apartments is Phool Mahal (Flower Palace), a dancing hall for the entertainment of the maharaja and his guests. Pictures of dancers, deities and rulers look out from its walls and wooden ceilings.\r\n \r\nVillage safaris  \r\n \r\nJodhpur\\'s surroundings can be explored on organized \"village safaris\", which take small groups of tourists out into rural Rajasthan, usually stopping at four or five villages of the local Bishnoi tribe where you can taste traditional food, learn about herbal remedies, and watch crafts such as spinning and carpet-making. The maharaja encourages the fair sale of Bishnoi handicrafts in the hope that they can thereby avoid the emigration to the city that has destroyed the traditional way of life of so much of India\\'s rural population. These tours get mixed reviews; some enjoy the experience, others find it totally contrived. A lot depends on the integrity of the operators and the relations they have with the villagers. Three inexpensive, commendable companies are: RTDC, based at the tourist office on High Court Road; the Govind Hotel on Station Road (tel 0291/254 5083); and Joshi, at Cosy Guest House, Novechokiya Road, Brahm Puri (tel 98290 23390). Rates start at around Rs900 per head for a group of eight and it\\'s a good idea to opt for a translator-guide, although this bumps the price up a little.

Even now, it\\'s one of the greenest of the Adriatic islands, and one of the most popular. The island\\'s main settlement is Korčula Town, and the rest of the island, although beautifully wild, lacks any real centres. The main coastal ferry docks at Korčula Town harbour. In addition, local ferries travel daily between Split and Vela Luka at the western end of Korčula island, from where there\\'s a connecting bus service to Korčula Town. There\\'s also a bus service from Dubrovnik, which crosses the narrow stretch of water dividing the island from the mainland by ferry from Orebić.\r\n\r\nKORČULA TOWN sits on a beetle-shaped hump of land, a medieval walled city ribbed with a series of narrow streets that branch off the spine of the main street like the veins of a leaf. The Venetians first arrived here in the eleventh century, and stayed, on and off, for nearly eight centuries. Their influence is particularly evident in Korčula\\'s old town, which huddles around the Cathedral of St Mark, squeezed into a space between the buildings that roughly passes for a main square. The cathedral facade is decorated with a gorgeous fluted rose window and a bizarre cornice frilled with strange gargoyles. The interior, reached through a door framed by statues of Adam and Eve, is one of the loveliest in the region – a curious mixture of styles, ranging from the Gothic forms of the nave to the Renaissance northern aisle, tacked on in the sixteenth century. The best of the church\\'s treasures have been removed to the Bishop\\'s Treasury (July &amp; August: daily 10am–noon &amp; 5–7pm; at other times enquire at the tourist office; 10kn), a couple of doors down. This small collection of fine and sacral art is one of the best in the country, with an exquisite set of paintings, including a striking Portrait of a Man by Carpaccio and a Leonardo da Vinci sketch of a soldier wearing a costume bearing a striking resemblance to that of the Moreška dancers. Opposite the treasury, a former Venetian palace holds the Town Museum (July &amp; August daily 9am–1pm &amp; 5–7pm; rest of year Mon–Sat 9am–1pm; 10kn), whose more modest display contains a plaster cast of a fourth-century BC Greek tablet from Lumbarda – the earliest evidence of civilization on Korčula. Close by the main square, down a turning to the right, is another remnant from Venetian times, the so-called House of Marco Polo (summer daily 10am–1pm &amp; 5–7pm; 10kn). Korčula claims to be the birthplace of Marco Polo, although it seems unlikely that he had any connection with this seventeenth-century house, which these days is little more than an empty shell with some terrible twentieth-century prints.\r\n\r\nYour best bet for beaches is to head off by water taxi from the old harbour to one of the Skoji islands just offshore. The largest and nearest of these is Badija, where there are some secluded rocky beaches, a couple of snack bars and a naturist section. There\\'s also a sandy beach just beyond the village of Lumbarda, 8km south of Korčula (reached by hourly bus in the summer).\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\"

by KaozMumbaiEver since the opening of the Suez Canal in the 1860s, the principal gateway to the Indian subcontinent has been MUMBAI (Bombay), the city Aldous Huxley famously described as \"the most appalling . . . of either hemisphere\". Travellers tend to regard time spent here as a rite of passage to be survived rather than savoured. But as the powerhouse of Indian business, industry and trade, and the source of its most seductive media images, the Maharashtrian capital can be a compelling place to kill time. Whether or nor you find the experience enjoyable, however, will depend largely on how well you handle the heat, humidity, hassle, traffic fumes, relentless crowds, and appalling poverty, of India\\'s most dynamic, westernized city.\r\n\r\nFirst impressions of Mumbai tend to be dominated by its chronic shortage of space. Crammed onto a narrow spit of land that curls from the swamp-ridden coast into the Arabian Sea, the city has, in less than five hundred years since its \"discovery\" by the Portuguese, metamorphosed from an aboriginal fishing settlement into a sprawling megalopolis of over sixteen million people. Being swept along broad boulevards by endless streams of commuters, or jostled by coolies and hand-cart pullers in the teeming bazaars, you\\'ll continually feel as if Mumbai is about to burst at the seams.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the population problem and attendant poverty lie, paradoxically, in the city\\'s enduring ability to create wealth. Mumbai alone generates nearly forty percent of India\\'s GNP, its port handles half the country\\'s foreign trade, and its movie industry is the biggest in the world. Symbols of prosperity are everywhere: from the phalanx of office blocks clustered on Nariman Point, Maharashtra\\'s Manhattan, to the expensively dressed teenagers posing in Colaba\\'s trendiest nightspots.\r\n\r\nThe flip side to the success story, of course, is the city\\'s much chronicled poverty. Each day, hundreds of economic refugees pour into Mumbai from the Maharashtrian hinterland. Some find jobs and secure accommodation; many more (around a third of the total population) end up living on the already overcrowded streets, or amid the squalor of Asia\\'s largest slums, reduced to rag-picking and begging from cars at traffic lights.\r\n\r\nHowever, while it would definitely be misleading to downplay its difficulties, Mumbai is far from the ordeal some travellers make it out to be. Once you\\'ve overcome the major hurdle of finding somewhere to stay, you may begin to enjoy its frenzied pace and crowded, cosmopolitan feel.\r\n\r\nElephanta  \r\n \r\nAn hour\\'s boat ride from Colaba, the island of ELEPHANTA offers one of the more atmospheric escapes from the seething claustrophobia of the city – as long as you time your visit to avoid the weekend deluge of noisy day-trippers. Populated only by a small fishing community, it was originally known as Gharapuri, the \"city of Ghara priests\", until the island was renamed in the sixteenth century by the Portuguese in honour of the carved elephant they found at the port. Its chief attraction is its unique cave temple, whose massive Trimurti (three-faced) Shiva sculpture is as fine an example of Hindu architecture as you\\'ll find anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Deluxe\" boats set off from the Gateway of India (Oct–May hourly 9am–2.30pm; Rs85 return including government guide); book through the kiosks near the Gateway of India. Ask for your guide at the caves ticket office on arrival – they take about thirty minutes. Ordinary ferries (Rs65 return), also from the Gateway of India, don\\'t include guides, and are usually packed. The journey takes about an hour on either boat.\r\n\r\nCool drinks and souvenir stalls line the way up the hill, and at the top, the MTDC Chalukya restaurant offers food and beer, and a terrace with good views out to sea, but you cannot stay overnight on the island.\r\n \r\nGateway of India  \r\n \r\nCommemorating the visit of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911, India\\'s own honey-coloured Arc de Triomphe, the Gateway of India, was built in 1924 by George Wittet, the architect responsible for many of the city\\'s grandest constructions. It was originally envisaged as a ceremonial disembarkation point for passengers alighting from the P&amp;O steamers, but – ironically – is today more often remembered as the place the British chose to stage their final departure from the country. On February 28, 1948, the last detachment of troops remaining on Indian soil slow marched under the arch to board the waiting troop ship back to Tilbury. Nowadays, the only boats bobbing about at the bottom of its stone staircase are the launches that ferry tourists across the harbour to Elephanta Island.\r\n \r\nPrince of Wales Museum (Chhatrapati Shivaji Museum) and Jehangir Art Gallery  \r\n \r\nSet back from Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Road in its own grounds, the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India (Tues–Sun 10.15am–6pm; Rs150, Rs15 extra with camera), recently renamed as the tongue-twisting Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Sanghralaya, ranks among the city\\'s most distinctive Raj-era constructions. Crowned by a massive white Moghul-style dome, it houses a superb collection of paintings and sculpture that you\\'ll need several hours, or a couple of visits, to get the most out of. The building was designed by George Wittet, of Gateway of India fame, and is the epitome of the hybrid Indo-Saracenic style – regarded in its day as an \"educated\" interpretation of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Gujarati architecture, mixing Islamic touches with typically English municipal brickwork.\r\n\r\nThe central hall provides a snapshot of the collection with a few choice Moghul paintings, jade work, weapons and miniature clay and terracotta figures from the Mauryan (third century BC) and Kushana (first to second century AD) periods.\r\n\r\nThe main sculpture room on the ground floor displays some fine fourth- and fifth-century heads and figures from the Buddhist state of Gandhara, a former colony of Alexander the Great (hence the Greek-style statues). Important Hindu sculptures include a seventh-century Chalukyan bas-relief from Aihole depicting Brahma seated on a lotus, and a sensuously carved torso of Mahisasuramardini, the goddess Durga with tripod raised ready to skewer the demon buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe main attraction on the first floor has to be the superb collection of Indian painting, including illustrated manuscripts and erotic Gita Govinda paintings in the pre-Moghul Sultanate style. Moghul schools are well represented, too, with famous portraits and folios from the reign of Akbar (1556–1605)\r\n\r\nEuropean art – including a minor Titian and a Constable – is featured on the second floor, alongside a collection weapons belonging to various Moghul emperors. The poorly lit Indian textiles room showcases brocaded saris, turbans, and intricately pattered antique Kashmiri shawls.\r\n\r\nTechnically in the same compound as the Prince of Wales Museum, though approached from further up MG Road, the Jehangir Art Gallery (daily 11am–7pm; free) is Mumbai\\'s best-known venue for contemporary art, with five small galleries specializing in twentieth-century arts and crafts from around the world. You never know what you\\'re going to find – most exhibitions last only a week and exhibits are often for sale.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64wdza6d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[72.819999,18.959999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mysore","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m651o2cez"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[76.65,12.3]}},{"properties":{"name":"Míkonos","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m659z7gcc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.3688,37.43997]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nairobi","description":"Posted by Kaoznairobi, kenya<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64we8fh6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.819999,-1.289999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nanyuki","description":"Posted by Kaoznanyuki, kenya<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m659msq5g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.060001,0.019999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nasik","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64wrivs7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.780853,20.00066]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ngorongoro Crater","description":"Posted by Kaozngorongoro crater, tanzania<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64yxxau1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.546002,-3.216]}},{"properties":{"name":"Náxos","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m6559r0hz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.47729,37.04641]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oban","description":"Posted by Kaozoban, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65by133y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.469723,56.41041]}},{"properties":{"name":"Perpignan","description":"Posted by Kaozperpignan, france<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m655b77x2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.89415,42.701573]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pula","description":"Posted by Kaozpula, croatiaOnce the chief port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, PULA is an engaging combination of working port, naval base and brash riviera town. The Romans put the city squarely on the map when they arrived in 177 BC, transforming it into an important commercial centre. The most obvious relic of their rule is the first century BC Amphitheatre (daily: June–Sept 8am–8pm; Oct–May 9am–5pm; 30kn) just north of the centre, a great grey elliptical skein of connecting arches, silhouetted against the skyline from wherever you stand in the city. It\\'s the sixth largest in the world, and once had space for over 23,000 spectators. The outer shell is fairly complete, as is one of the towers, up which a slightly hair-raising climb gives a good sense of the enormity of the structure and a view of Pula\\'s industrious harbour. The cavernous rooms underneath, which would have been used for keeping wild animals and Christians before they met their death, are now given over to piles of crusty amphorae and reconstructed olive presses.\r\n\r\nSouth of the amphitheatre, central Pula circles a pyramidal hill, scaled by secluded streets and topped with a star-shaped Venetian fortress. On the eastern side of the hill, Istarska – which later becomes Giardini – leads down to the first-century BC Triumphal Arch of the Sergians, through which ul Sergijevaca, a lively pedestrianized thoroughfare, leads in turn to a square known as Forum – site of the ancient Roman forum and now the centre of Pula\\'s old quarter. On the far side of here, the slim form of the Temple of Augustus was built between 2 BC and 14 AD to celebrate the cult of the emperor; its imposing Corinthian columns, still intact, make it one of the best examples of a Roman temple outside Italy.\r\n\r\nHeading north from Forum along Kandlerova leads to Pula\\'s Cathedral (daily 7am–noon &amp; 4–6pm), a broad, simple and very spacious structure that is another mixture of periods and styles: a fifteenth-century renovation of a Romanesque basilica built on the foundations of a Roman temple. From the cathedral, you can follow streets up to the top of the hill, the site of the original Roman Capitol and now the home of a mossy seventeenth-century fortress, built by the Venetians and housing a pretty inessential local museum. You\\'re better off following tracks to the far side of the fortress where there are the remains of a small Roman Theatre and the Archeological Museum (May–Sept Mon–Sat 9am–8pm, Sun 10am–3pm; Oct–April Mon–Fri 9am–2pm; 20kn), which has pillars and toga-clad statues mingling haphazardly with ceramics, jewellery and trinkets from all over Istria, some dating back to prehistoric times.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m650p9id5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.84,44.880001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pune","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m6538nqmp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.839996,18.53]}},{"properties":{"name":"Quillan","description":"Posted by Kaozquillan, france<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65aib5kc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.184685,42.87455]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ravenna","description":"Posted by Kaozravenna, italyWhen RAVENNA became capital of the Western Roman Empire fifteen hundred years ago, it was more by quirk of fate than design. The Emperor Honorius, alarmed by armies invading from the north, moved his court from Milan to this obscure town on the Romagna coast around 402; it was easy to defend, surrounded by marshland, and was situated close to the port of Classis – at the time the biggest Roman naval base on the Adriatic. Honorius\\'s anxiety proved well founded: Rome was sacked by the Goths in 410 and sank into a decline matched only by Ravenna\\'s ensuing prosperity, and the town became the Roman capital almost by default. After enjoying a period of great monumental adornment as chief city of the empire, Ravenna, too, was conquered by the Goths in 476. However, the new conquerors – and new emperors – were also Christians and continued to embellish the city lavishly, particularly the Ostrogoth Theodoric, making it one of the most sought-after towns in the Mediterranean. It wasn\\'t long before Byzantine forces annexed the city to the Eastern Empire and made it into an exarchate, under the rule of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine rulers were responsible for Ravenna\\'s most glorious era, keen to outdo rival cities with magnificent palaces, churches and art, and the city became one of the most compelling cultural centres in the world. The growing importance of Venice brought some further prosperity, but the sixteenth century saw the sack of the city and its absorption into the Papal States, since when the Adriatic shoreline has receded, and an eleven-kilometre-long canal through a vast industrial complex now links Ravenna\\'s port to the sea. But remnants of the dazzling Byzantine era are still thick on the ground – not least a set of mosaics at San Vitale that is generally acknowledged to be the crowning achievement of Byzantine art extant anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nUnlike Florence or Venice, say, tourism seems almost incidental to the life of the town, although the nearby Mirabilandia, a Disneyesque theme-park, helps bring in the crowds during summer. For a city that has such historic monuments Ravenna\\'s centre feels surprisingly modern – a combination of Mussolini\\'s building programme and allied bombs that levelled much of the city in the last world war. It\\'s a pleasant enough place to spend a couple of days and has some excellent bars and restaurants, but the churches and mosaics will easily monopolize your time. Nightlife is sparse, though the lido towns a couple of kilometres away provide some excitement in summer.\r\n\r\nSan Vitale  \r\n \r\nIn terms of monuments, Ravenna\\'s biggest draw is the area ten minutes\\' walk northwest of the city centre, around the basilica of San Vitale, which holds the finest of the mosaics and is now gathered together into one big complex, including the mausoleum of Galla Placida and the National Museum.\r\n\r\nSan Vitale (daily: April–Sept 9.30am–6.30pm; March &amp; Oct 9.30am–5.30pm; rest of year 9.30am–4.30pm), which was begun in 525 under the Roman emperor Theodoric and finished in 548 under the Byzantine ruler Justinian, is a fairly typical Byzantine church, and its Eastern-inspired arrangement of void and solid, dark and light, was unique for an Italian building of the time. The Byzantines had a mathematical approach to architecture, calling it the \"application of geometry to solid matter\", and it shows in the building, based on two concentric octagons, its central dome supported by eight columns, and with eight recesses extending from each side – one of which is a semicircular apse that glitters with mosaic. The design was the basis for the great church of Aghia Sofia in Istanbul, built fifteen years later.\r\n\r\nThere were definite rules about who appeared where in mosaics – the higher up and further to the east, the more important or holy the subject. The series in the basilica starts with Old Testament scenes spread across the semi-circular lunettes of the choir; the triumphal arch shows Christ, the Apostles and sons of St Vitalis. Further in, on the semi-dome of the apse, a beardless Christ stands between two angels, presenting a model of the church to St Vitalis and Bishop Ecclesius. But what could have been simply a rigid hierarchy preserved in stone is enlivened by fields and rivers teeming with frogs, herons and dolphins. Of the mosaics on the side walls of the apse, the two processional panels are the best surviving portraits of the Emperor Justinian and his wife Theodora – he\\'s on the left and she\\'s on the right – and a rich example of Byzantine mosaic technique. The small glass tesserae are laid in sections, alternate rows set at slightly different angles to vary the reflection of light and give an impression of depth. Colour is used emblematically too, with gold backgrounds denoting either holiness or high status.\r\n\r\nTheodora looks a harsh figure under her finery, and she certainly had a reputation for calculated cruelty, arranging \"disappearances\" of anyone who went against her. According to the sixth-century chronicler Procopius, in his \"Secret History\" of the court, her rise to power was meteoric. When young she made a living as a child prostitute and circus performer with her two sisters, and later became a courtesan and an actor in bizarre sex shows. She travelled the Middle East, and when she returned brought herself to the attention of the emperor, Justinian. To the horror of the court, he rejected the well brought-up daughters of his Roman peers and lived with Theodora, giving her the rank of patrician. He was unable to marry her until his mother, the empress, was dead and the law changed; the two then embarked on a reign of staggering corruption and legalized looting.\r\n\r\nAcross the grass from the basilica is the tiny Mausoleo di Galla Placidia (daily: April–Sept 9.30am–6.30pm; March &amp; Oct 9.30am–5.30pm; rest of year 9.30am–4.30pm) named after the half-sister of Honorius. The emperor\\'s frequent absences left Galla in charge of the city and she was responsible for much of the grandeur of Ravenna\\'s early days. Despite the name and the three sarcophagi inside, it\\'s unlikely that the building ever held her bones. Galla Placidia was taken hostage when the Goths sacked Rome, and caused a scandal by marrying one of her kidnappers, Ataulf. She went into battle with him as his army forged south, and later they reigned jointly over the Gothic kingdom; when Ataulf was assassinated the Romans took her back for a ransom of corn, after which she was obliged to marry a Roman general, Constantius. Their son formally became the Emperor Valentinian III at the age of 6, and as his regent, Galla Placidia assumed control of the Western Empire.\r\n\r\nInside the basilica, filtered through thin alabaster windows, the light falls on mosaics that glow with a deep blue lustre, most in an earlier style than those of San Vitale, full of Roman and naturalistic motifs. Stars around a golden cross spread across the vaulted ceiling; the Gospels are four volumes on the shelves of a small cupboard, and there are symbolic representations of the Apostles – the lion of St Mark and the ox of St Luke are set in the sky at the points where you would expect to see the constellations of Leo and Taurus. At each end are representations of St Lawrence, with the gridiron on which he was martyred, and at the entrance end is a depiction of the Good Shepherd, with one of his flock.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to San Vitale on the southern side, housed in the former cloisters of the church, the Museo Nazionale (Tues–Sun 8.30am–6.30pm; €4) contains various items from this and later periods – fifteenth-century icons, early Byzantine glass and embroidery from Florence. Among the most eye-catching exhibits is a sixth-century statue of Hercules capturing a stag, possibly a copy of a Greek original and a very late example of classically inspired subject-matter; and the so-called \"Veil of Classis\", decorated with portraits of Veronese bishops of the eighth and ninth centuries.\r\n\r\nStill within Ravenna, but a bit of a hike north of the train station, lies one more early sixth-century monument that\\'s worth the effort: the Mausoleo di Teodorico, Theodoric\\'s Mausoleum (daily 8.30am–7pm; €2). This ten-sided curiosity is unique in Western architecture. Its design owes much to Syrian models of its day, and the whole is constructed of Istrian limestone. The 300-tonne cupola is a single, if cracked, chunk and no one knows exactly how it was manoeuvred into place. Inside the decagonal second storey sits an ancient porphyry bathtub, pressed into use as the royal sarcophagus.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64xu8f43"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.20027,44.417118]}},{"properties":{"name":"Robanda","description":"Posted by Kaozrobanda, tanzania<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m656x6d2v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.650002,-2.116667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santoríni","description":"Posted by KaozGreece<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65c1xgaa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.80708,38.278603]}},{"properties":{"name":"Selkirk","description":"Posted by Kaozselkirk, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64xfzoaw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.838921,55.548276]}},{"properties":{"name":"Shanghai","description":"Posted by Kaozshanghai<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64wkxnxf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[121.470001,31.229999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Somnathpur","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m653h3neo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[76.8833313,12.2666664]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sound Of Mull","description":"Posted by Kaozsound of mull<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m653uqebi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.921631,56.559482]}},{"properties":{"name":"Split","description":"Posted by Kaozsplit, croatiaThe largest city in the region, and its major transit hub, SPLIT is one of the most enticing spots on the Dalmatian coast; a hectic city, full of shouting stall-owners and travellers on the move. At the heart of all this, hemmed in by the sprawling estates and a modern harbour, lies a crumbling old town built within the precincts of Diocletian\\'s Palace, one of the most outstanding classical remains in Europe. Built as a retirement home by Dalmatian-born Roman Emperor Diocletian in 305 AD, it has been modified over the centuries, but has remained the core of Split. The best place to start a tour of the palace area is on the seaward side, through the Bronze Gate, a functional gateway giving access to the sea that once came right up to the palace itself. Inside, you find yourself in a vaulted hall, from which imposing steps lead through the now domeless vestibule to the Peristyle. Once the central courtyard of the palace complex, these days the Peristyle serves as the main town square, crowded with cafés and surrounded by remnants of the stately arches that once framed the square. At the southern end, steps lead up to the vestibule, a round, formerly domed building that is the only part of the imperial apartments to be left anything like intact. You can get some idea of the grandeur of the old apartments by visiting the subterranean halls (daily: July &amp; Aug 8am–8pm; Sept–June 8am–noon &amp; 4–7pm; 10kn) beneath the houses which now stand on the site; the entrance is to the left of the Bronze Gate.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the Peristyle stands one of two black granite Egyptian sphinxes, dating from around 15 BC, that flanked the entrance to Diocletian\\'s mausoleum; the octagonal building, surrounded by an arcade of Corinthian columns, has since been converted into Split\\'s cathedral (Mon–Sat 7am–noon &amp; 4–7pm). On the right of the entrance is the campanile (same hours; 5kn), a Romanesque structure much restored in the late nineteenth century – from the top, the views across the city are splendid. As for the cathedral itself, the walnut and oak main doorway is one of its most impressive features – carved in 1214 with an inspired comic strip showing scenes from the life of Christ. Inside is a hotchpotch of styles, the dome ringed by two series of decorative Corinthian columns and a frieze that contains portraits of Diocletian and his wife. The pulpit is a beautifully proportioned example of Romanesque art, sitting on capitals tangled with snakes, strange beasts and foliage. But the church\\'s finest feature is on the Altar of St Anastasius – a cruelly realistic Flagellation of Christ, completed by local artist Juraj Dalmatinac in 1448.\r\n\r\nNorth of the cathedral and reached by following Dioklecijanova is the grandest and best preserved of the palace gates, the Golden Gate. Just outside there\\'s a piece by Mestrović, a gigantic statue of the fourth-century Bishop Grgur Ninski. Fifteen minutes\\' walk northwest of here, the Archeological Museum at Zrinsko Frankopanska 25 (June–Sept Tues–Sat 9am–1pm &amp; 5–8pm, Sun 10am–noon; Oct–May Tues–Fri 9am–2pm, Sat &amp; Sun 10am–1pm; 20kn) contains comprehensive displays of Illyrian, Greek, medieval and Roman artefacts. Outside, the arcaded courtyard is crammed with a wonderful array of Greek, Roman and early Christian gravestones, sarcophagi and decorative sculpture.\r\n\r\nIf you want some peace and quiet, head for the woods of the Marjan peninsula west of the old town. It\\'s accessible from Obala hrvatskog narodnog preporoda via Sperun and then Senjska, which cuts up through the slopes of the Varoš district. Most of Marjan\\'s visitors stick to the road around the edge of the promontory with its scattering of tiny rocky beaches; the Bene beach, on the far northern side, is especially popular. From the road, tracks lead up into the heart of the Marjan Park, which is thickly wooded with pines. The main historical attractions of Marjan are on the lower, southern edge, along Šetalište Ivana Meštrovića. Highlight of these lies some fifteen minutes west of the centre (bus #12 from the seafront). The Meštrović Gallery, Ivana Meštrovića 46 (Tues–Sat 11am–6pm, Sun 10am–3pm; 20kn, includes entrance to Kaštelet), is another Croatian shrine, housed in the ostentatious Neoclassical building that was built – and lived in – by Croatia\\'s most famous twentieth-century artist, the sculptor Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962). This fabulous collection consists largely of boldly fashioned bodies curled into elegant poses. Mestrović\\'s former workshop, Kaštelet (same times and ticket), is 300m up the same road, and contains a chapel decorated with one of Meštrović\\'s most important set-piece works: a series of wood-carved reliefs showing scenes from the Stations of the Cross.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65bmk96a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.45,43.509998]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Andrews","description":"Posted by KaozSt. Andrews<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m658ngz0f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.80014,56.340901]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stirling","description":"Posted by Kaozstirling, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65cddgia"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.935882,56.119423]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tobermory","description":"Posted by Kaoztobermory, scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65amueoq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.069683,56.623844]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tsavo","description":"Posted by Kaoztsavo, kenya<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m65230fhc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.466667,-2.983333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tínos","description":"Posted by Kaoz<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64yybhw9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.1532,37.59247]}},{"properties":{"name":"Udaipur","description":"Posted by KaozReflected in the shimmering waters of Pichola Lake, UDAIPUR\\'s skyline of whitewashed havelis and tapering temple shikharas, surmounted by the domes and ornately carved balconies of the famous Rajput city palace, has managed to keep its head above the rising tide of hotels and terrace restaurants, and remains one of Asia\\'s most exotic spectacles. Enjoying it from a boat at water level, or on a rooftop in the cool of the evening, many travellers are tempted to forget their tight itineraries. In any case, it takes at least a week to explore the city\\'s monuments, and the temples, forts, palaces and scenery of the hills and valleys nearby.\r\n\r\nThe smooth rolling hills that surround Udaipur were once covered with forests. Widespread felling, instigated by the Indian government in the 1970s after it took possession of the Mewar lands, left them irreversibly barren and have added to the dry and dusty desert conditions of the Udaipur valley.\r\n\r\nLake Pichola  \r\n \r\nThe serene lakeside location chosen by Udai for his new capital made a welcome change from the craggy heights of Chittaurgarh. He enlarged the lake, which drew water from mountains up to 160km away, and now covers eight square kilometres. Later rulers added dams and canals to prevent flooding during the monsoon.\r\n\r\nThe two islands in the lake, topped with the ivory-white domes and arches of private palaces, are the most familiar and photogenic features of Udaipur. Jag Niwas, now the Lake Palace Hotel, is the larger of the two, built as a summer palace during the reign of Jagat Singh (1628–52). If you aren\\'t staying here, you can visit the palace for lunch, dinner or afternoon tea; the price includes the boat ride from the mainland (booking advisable).\r\n\r\nThe larger Jag Mandir, on the island to the south, has changed little since its construction by Karan Singh in 1615. (It takes its name from Jagat Singh who added to the initial structure.) Intended as a small Rajput palace, it was never used as such; Karan Singh offered refuge here to the Moghul prince Khurum (later Emperor Shah Jahan), exiled by his father, Emperor Jahangir, in the 1620s. Khurum succeeded his father while still in Udaipur, and the Moghul gathering for the occasion defied the established code of Rajput–Moghul enmity. During the 1857 Mutiny the island once again served as a safe haven, this time for European women and children. The main building facing the City Palace has detailed stone inlay work within its domed roof. In front of it a green marble chhatri carved with vines and flowers is the centrepiece of a garden guarded by stone elephants. Jag Mandir\\'s only inhabitants other than flocks of birds are three royal servants who tend the gardens and grow flowers for the maharana\\'s celebrations.\r\n\r\nHalf-hour boat rides around the lake depart from the jetty behind the City Palace, below the Fateh Prakash Palace hotel (hourly: April–Sept 8–11am &amp; 3–6pm; Oct–March 10am–noon &amp; 2–5pm; Rs100), while an hour\\'s trip (hourly 2–6pm; Rs2000) includes a stop at Jag Mandir. The view of the palaces and shoreline from the lake at sunset is one of the most memorable images of Rajput splendour. To make the most of them by boat, however, you\\'ll have to sit on the side facing the palace (they usually run anticlockwise around the lake, so check when you get on).\r\n \r\nCity Palace  \r\n \r\nUdaipur\\'s fascinating City Palace stands moulded in soft yellow stone on a rocky promontory on the northwest shore of Lake Pichola, its thick windowless base crowned with ornate turrets and canopies. Eleven constituent mahals (palaces), constructed by successive maharanas during the three hundred years that followed the foundation of Udaipur in 1559, together form the largest royal complex in Rajasthan.\r\n\r\nPart of the palace is now a museum (daily 9.30am–4.30pm; Rs50, Rs100 extra for camera, Rs300 extra for video), entered through Toran Pole from the massive courtyard where elephants once lined up for inspection before battle. Although guided tours (Rs95 for a non-Indian language) are not compulsory, they do serve to illuminate the chronology of the palaces, the significance of the paintings, and details of the lives of the maharanas.\r\n\r\nEverywhere you look the marble and granite walls are laden with brilliant miniature paintings, decorated with tiles or overlaid with spangling mosaics of coloured glass and mirrors, and each room glows with sunlight filtering through stained-glass windows. Narrow low-roofed passages connect the different mahals and courtyards, creating a haphazard effect, designed to prevent surprise intrusion by armed enemies.\r\n\r\nEach of the three large peacocks (mor) set into the walls of the seventeenth-century Mor Chowk, placed there by Sajjan Singh two hundred years after the palace was built, is composed of 5000 pieces of glass, glittering in green, gold and blue. The pillared apartments that face Mor Chowk are adorned with scenes from Krishna legends. Corridors lead to another chamber called Kanch-ki-Burj, decorated throughout with a mosaic of mirrors, and to Chandra Chowk (Moon Square), which encloses its own garden on the crest of a hill in the heart of the palace.\r\n\r\nMore hallways, some with good views of Lake Pichola, continue to the Zenana Mahal, the women\\'s quarters, decorated with more legends of Krishna. With alcoves, balconies, coloured windows, tiled walls and floors, these are amongst the most splendid rooms in the palace. Krishna Vilas, an apartment full of miniatures, honours a nineteenth-century Udaipur princess who poisoned herself to avoid the dilemma of choosing a husband from the two rival households of Jodhpur and Jaipur.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67m64yy2k7t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[73.690002,24.579999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Venetië","description":"Posted by Kaozvenice, italyVenice  \r\n\r\nNobody arrives in Venice and sees the city for the first time. Depicted and described so often that its image has become part of the European collective consciousness, Venice can initially create the slightly anticlimactic feeling that everything looks exactly as it should. The water-lapped palaces along the Canal Grande are just as the brochure photographs made them out to be, Piazza San Marco does indeed look as perfect as a film set, and the panorama across the water from the Palazzo Ducale is precisely as Canaletto painted it. The sense of familiarity soon fades, however, as details of the scene begin to catch the attention – an ancient carving high on a wall, a boat being manoeuvred round an impossible corner, a tiny shop in a dilapidated building, a waterlogged basement. And the longer one looks, the stranger and more intriguing Venice becomes.\r\n\r\nFounded fifteen hundred years ago on a cluster of mudflats in the centre of the lagoon, Venice rose to become Europe\\'s main trading post between the West and the East, and at its height controlled an empire that spread north to the Dolomites and over the sea as far as Cyprus. As its wealth increased and its population grew, the fabric of the city grew ever more dense. Very few parts of the hundred or so islets that compose the historic centre are not built up, and very few of its closely knit streets bear no sign of the city\\'s long lineage. Even in the most insignificant alleyway you might find fragments of a medieval building embedded in the wall of a house like fossil remains lodged in a cliff face.\r\n\r\nThe melancholic air of the place is in part a product of the discrepancy between the grandeur of its history and what the city has become. In the heyday of the Venetian Republic, some 200,000 people lived in Venice, not far short of three times its present population. Merchants from Germany, Greece, Turkey and a host of other countries maintained warehouses here; transactions in the banks and bazaars of the Rialto dictated the value of commodities all over the continent; in the dockyards of the Arsenale the workforce was so vast that a warship could be built and fitted out in a single day; and the Piazza San Marco was perpetually thronged with people here to set up business deals or report to the Republic\\'s government. Nowadays it\\'s no longer a living metropolis but rather the embodiment of a fabulous past, dependent for its survival largely on the people who come to marvel at its relics.\r\n\r\nThe monuments which draw the largest crowds are the Basilica di San Marco – the mausoleum of the city\\'s patron saint – and the Palazzo Ducale – the home of the doge and all the governing councils. Certainly these are the most dramatic structures in the city: the first a mosaic-clad emblem of Venice\\'s Byzantine origins, the second perhaps the finest of all secular Gothic buildings. Every parish rewards exploration, though – a roll-call of the churches worth visiting would feature over fifty names, and a list of the important paintings and sculptures they contain would be twice as long. Two of the distinctively Venetian institutions known as the Scuole retain some of the outstanding examples of Italian Renaissance art – the Scuola di San Rocco, with its dozens of pictures by Tintoretto, and the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni, decorated with a gorgeous sequence by Carpaccio.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the city\\'s treasures remain in the buildings for which they were created, a sizeable number have been removed to one or other of Venice\\'s museums. The one that should not be missed is the Accademia, an assembly of Venetian painting that consists of virtually nothing but masterpieces; other prominent collections include the museum of eighteenth-century art in the Ca\\' Rezzonico and the Museo Correr, the civic museum of Venice – but again, a comprehensive list would fill a page.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, there\\'s the inexhaustible spectacle of the streets themselves, of the majestic and sometimes decrepit palaces, of the hemmed-in squares where much of the social life of the city is conducted, of the sunlit courtyards that suddenly open up at the end of an unpromising passageway. The cultural heritage preserved in the museums and churches is a source of endless fascination, but you should discard your itineraries for a day and just wander – the anonymous parts of Venice reveal as much of the city\\'s essence as the highlighted attractions. Equally indispensible for a full understanding of Venice\\'s way of life and development are expeditions to the northern and southern islands of the lagoon, where the incursions of the tourist industry are on the whole less obtrusive.\r\n\r\nPiazza San Marco  \r\n \r\nWhen the first Palazzo Ducale was built, in the ninth century, the area now occupied by the Piazza San Marco was an islet known as Morso. Two churches stood here – San Teodoro and San Geminiano – but most of the land was covered by the orchard of the nuns of San Zaccaria. It was in the late twelfth century, under the direction of Doge Sebastiano Ziani, that the land was transformed into a public space – the canal connecting the waterways to the north with the Bacino di San Marco was filled in, the canalside San Geminiano was demolished (a plaque close to the Campanile marks where it stood) and a replacement built at the far end. The general shape of the Piazza hasn\\'t changed much since Ziani\\'s scheme, but most of the buildings you see today, excluding the Basilica and the Campanile, date from the great period of urban renewal which began at the end of the fifteenth century and went on for much of the following hundred years.\r\n\r\n\"The finest drawing room in Europe\" was how Napoleon described the Piazza, but less genteel phrases than Napoleon\\'s might seem appropriate on a summer afternoon, as your ears are battered by the competing café orchestras blasting out selected melodies from the Lloyd-Webber oeuvre, and your sightlines are repeatedly blocked by tour groups. You can take some consolation from the knowledge that the throngs and the racket are maintaining a long tradition. The Piazza has always been crowded, and foreigners have always made up a sizeable proportion of the crowds – long before the tourist industry got into its stride, the swarms of foreign merchants and travellers in the Piazza were being cursed as \"the monsters of the sea\", to quote one disgruntled native.\r\n\r\nIf anything, life on the Piazza is less diverse nowadays than it used to be. From the foundation of the city, this area was used by traders (the slave market was here until the end of the ninth century), and as the city grew, so the range of activities taking place on the Piazza multiplied: by the end of the fifteenth century butchers and grocers had established their pitches, moneylenders and notaries had set up kiosks nearby, and makeshift stages for freak shows and masques were regular additions to the scene.\r\n\r\nBy the eighteenth century the Piazza might have become a touch more decorous, but it was certainly no emptier. One English visitor characterized the throng as \"a mixed multitude of Jews, Turks, and Christians; lawyers, knaves, and pick-pockets; mountebanks, old women, and physicians; women of quality, with masks; strumpets barefaced . . . a jumble of senators, citizens, gondoliers, and people of every character and condition\". Jugglers, puppeteers, sweet-sellers, fortune-tellers and a host of other stallholders seem to have been almost perennial features of the landscape, while Venetian high society passed much of the day in one or other of the Piazza\\'s dozen coffee shops – Europe\\'s first bottega del caffè opened here in 1683, and within a few decades Goldoni had created a play in which the hero, a café owner, declared \"my profession is necessary to the glory of the city\". During the Austrian occupation of 1814–66 the coffee houses were drawn into the social warfare between the city\\'s two hostile camps. Establishments used by the occupying troops were shunned by all patriotic Venetians – Quadri became an Austrian coffee house, whereas Florian remained Venetian. Certain prominent Venetians even went to the length of shunning the Piazza whenever the Austrian band was playing, a policy that entailed a thrice-weekly withdrawal from the centre of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Piazza remains the pivot of social life in Venice. Contrary to first appearances, today\\'s customers at the tables of Florian and Quadri– the only eighteenth-century survivors – or at the equally intimidating Lavena, the favourite haunt of Richard Wagner, are almost as likely to be Venetians as they are to be outsiders. Wander through at midday and there\\'ll be clusters of friends taking the air and chatting away their lunch-hour; the evening passeggiata inevitably involves a circuit of the Piazza; and even at midnight you\\'ll almost certainly see a few groups rounding off the day with a stroll across the flagstones.\r\n\r\nA note on the ubiquitous pigeons – you can choose between three improbable stories about their origins: either they came here with the refugees from Attila\\'s army; or they\\'re the descendants of caged birds given to a doge\\'s wife in an attempt to cheer her up; or they\\'re the distant relatives of pigeons released by successive doges during Holy Week, in a ceremony commemorating the return of Noah\\'s dove. Whatever their ancestry, they used to be fed daily by a council official, who was rumoured to dispense seed that had been laced with avian contraceptive; recently there have been moves to ban the selling of bird-food on the Piazza, in an attempt to reduce the health hazard presented by the disease-ridden pigeons.\r\n \r\nPalazzo Ducale  \r\n \r\nArchitecturally, the Palazzo Ducale is a unique mixture: the style of its exterior, with its geometrically patterned stonework and continuous tracery walls, can only be called Islamicized Gothic, whereas the courtyards and much of the interior are based on Classical forms – a blending of influences that led Ruskin to declare it \"the central building of the world\". Unquestionably, it is the finest secular building of its era in Europe, and the central building of Venice. The Palazzo Ducale was far more than the residence of the doge – it was the home of all of Venice\\'s governing councils, its law courts, a sizeable number of its civil servants and even its prisons.
