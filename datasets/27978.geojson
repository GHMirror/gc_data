It used to be fenced off, rarely visited by anybody. Then it became a homeless encampment. Now, the mounds of dirt, old rebar and chunks of concrete are overgrown with fennel and pampas grass, forming a haven for birds and lizards, a playground for unleashed dogs and an outdoor gallery for sculptors. The Bay Trail runs out to the end. Rough side trails lead to twisted found-object metal sculptures, a crazy little plaster house with a circular staircase, and cartoon-style paintings of uncertain theme, often favoring devils, fast-looking cars and flaming urban wreckage.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heig48skof"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.325296,37.889486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alcatraz","description":"Posted by Dylan<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/DSC00296.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heifz7tofb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.422907,37.826718]}},{"properties":{"name":"Annie's Cocktail Lounge","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/IMG_3382.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 15 Boardman Place, San Francisco CA\n\nThrill to the sound of Dolores singing to Myrna at Annie\\'s Cocktail Lounge!

Inside Bix - it has a swanky speakeasy-vibe - 1920\\'s art decor and a live band playing loud jaz music. The food was decadent and scrumptious.\n\nWe did hor d\\'oeuvres in a tapas fashion...we tried the \"Tuna Tartare on Olive Toasts\". I love the fresh fish in San Francisco. Heaven.\n\nWe also tried: \"Kampachi Crudo with Blood Orange, Fennel, Daikon Sprouts and Fiordolio Olive Oil.\"\n\nI first heard about crudo in a Vogue article by Jeffrey Steingarten. He\\'s a brilliant gourmand and he has such an evocative writing style...I also read about this Italian-style of doing raw fish in the NY Times...I think. This SF Gate article has a great way of explaining crudo: \"...crudo is shorthand for any kind of raw fish -- chopped tartares, marinated ceviches, sliced sashimis, paper-thin carpaccios. The stumpy word itself conveys little about the silky, sensual feel of eating a raw scallop glistening with olive oil and shivering under sheer fennel slices and bits of orange...\". And in this NY Post article...a chef has another way of explaining crudo: \"Crudo is basically Italian sashimi with good ingredients. Instead of wasabi, we use garlic, and instead of ginger, we use tomato.\"\n\nNow, Susan said she had really good crudo at Incanto - possibly better than Bix...As for myself, this first taste of crudo was delightful. Again, fresh fish - slice thin and marinated lightly. It melted in my mouth and left my palate swooning. I especially liked how it finished off with the blood orange - a clean citrus tang...\n\nWe also did some sliders in a gourmet fashion - \"Mini Lamb Burgers with Spicy Red Pepper Sauce\". A month or two ago, I picked up the movie \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\" DVD and I still have a craving for little burger bites. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heigawcg3v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.402519,37.796915]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boogaloos","description":"Posted by Mcmcilvoy<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/1/75038993_265674f43e_m.jpg\">3296 22nd St, San Francisco, CABreif brunch with Lita, Jason, Carrie and Joe.

Anytime anyone gets close to his seaside attraction, Warren pokes his head through the round window of his plastic \"box office\" --housed just to the left of the lenslike door, and asks, \"Have you seen the camera obscura?\"\r\nWhat they\\'ll see, if they pay their dollar and open themselves up to Warren\\'s enthusiasm, is sheer magic. They\\'ll also get to know a man who loves what he does. \"Take a moment to let your eyes adjust,\" Warren tells his guests, once they\\'ve walked through the swinging doors into his world. He rests his hands on the white rail surrounding what looks like a satellite dish, pointed toward the sky, dominating the small room. Swimming across that dish is a scene that looks like a painting-- a painting in motion.\r\n\r\nDepending on where the camera obscura\\'s periscope like lens is pointed at the moment, the view on the dish is of the walls of the Cliff House, or of the man-made concrete cliffs across the street, or of the condos lining the Great Highway where Playland at the Beach to be or of the Seal Rocks and the Pacific. As people watch, birds fly across the screen, a surfer rides a wave, the sea lions stretch on the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"The camera takes six minutes to go all the way around, but you can stay as long as you like, \"Warren tells his guests. One man last week stayed six hours.\" At this point, Warren can put on a taped narration and go back into his box office, but more often than not, he stays around, just to watch the reactions and share the discovery. \"What you are seeing is a rotating picture of what\\'s happening outside at this very moment, \" Warren tells his small, rapt audience. \"It works on the principle of the periscope. It reflects eighteen degrees of the view from outside, through an optically flattened, front surface-finished mirror and a series of concave and convex lenses, on to a parabolic or curved screen.\r\n\r\n\"It was the first camera,\" Warren goes on to explain. \"The camera obscura was invented by Leonardo da Vinci in the sixteenth century. His neighbors thought it was the instrument of the devil. They thought he could predict the future, the past and the present. They banned the creation because they believed it was related to the super- natural. That\\'s because, \"Warren continues, in his soft voice, \"people would go in and then go out and see their friends and say, \"I saw you when I was in the camera obscura,\" and people would think they\\'d seen the future because they had no idea about projected image.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Warren, on the other hand, several centuries removed from da Vinci\\'s time, has a lot of ideas about the projected image and the camera obscura. There\\'s very little he can\\'t tell you about this rare device -- how Isaac Newton wrote about it, or Copernicus charted the stars with it, or Renaissance artists painted with it.\r\n\r\n\"I\\'ve been an artist all my life,\" he says, \"and vision and light and shadow are wondrous things to me. Inside you become entrenched, especially people into the visual arts or visual optics and light.\r\n\r\n\"The vision of your eye opens up in there,\" Warren says. \"You see things differently. Your optic nerve is being affected in a different way. It stimulates the chemical makeup and your emotions. It moves me to tears.\" As the camera swings around to capture the view across the street from the Cliff House, Warren tells his viewers, \"This is the old Playland at the Beach. If you are a registered voter, you can sign a petition as you go out to put something there other than more condominiums.\"\r\n\r\nThere\\'s a reason that the former site of Playland holds a special place in Warren\\'s heart. That\\'s where he first saw the camera obscura, when he was sixteen years old. As a young man, Warren had show business in his bones; he ran away with the carnival, he learned how to eat fire.\r\n\r\nThen Warren grew up. worked on his career as a salesman, and lost touch with his beloved camera. When things began to fall apart for him, he found it again.\r\n\r\n\"I ended up separated from my family,\" he says. \"My wife divorced me. I had five kids, and I went into a deep depression. How can you sell anything at that point?\r\n\r\nHe took up some of his old interests. He signed up for the docent\\'s course at the Exploratorium and began doing research on Playland at the Beach, Just as it was about to be torn down. He met Gene Turtle, one of the two men who had built the camera. As youngsters, Turtle and Floyd Jennings had discovered Leonardo\\'s plans by accident, thumbing through the Encyclopaedia Britannica for a science project. They showed their completed model to George Whitney, who owned the Cliff House and Playland.\r\n\r\nWhitney set up the camera at the Cliff House, but for the first few years it didn\\'t do well because no one knew what it was. Then Whitney got the idea to make it look like a giant camera. Though located at the Cliff House, the camera obscura was a Playland attraction until they tore the place down in 1972. Early in his career, photographer Ansel Adams hung around the camera so much that they quit charging him.\r\n\r\nWarren ran into Gene Turtle in the 1970\\'s and ended up doing a fire-eating demonstration at Turtle\\'s wife\\'s birthday party. In 1978, David Warren was perched on a ladder at the Balboa Theater, painting a mural on the side -it\\'s still there, with Marilyn Monroe as centerpiece, but that\\'s another story -- when Turtle approached him and asked whether he\\'d like to take over the operation of the camera obscura.\r\n\r\n\"I told him I\\'d do it as soon as I got down from the ladder,\" Warren recalls, \"and I\\'ve been doing it ever since.\"\r\n\r\nWarren proceeded to spend years trying to figure out how to get people in to see what the camera had to offer. \"It\\'s a wonderful thing,\" he says. \"You think you should be able to tell people what it is, But it\\'s a paradox. As a salesman, I knew that people would like to know about it, but I found out that you couldn\\'t tell them about it.\"\r\n\r\nHe finally hit upon a solution; tell them what it does, not what it is. Slowly, Warren has learned the tricks of wooing them in, has discovered where the magic line lies between those who come in and those who wander off. A few years ago, he added a pair of huge brass arrows, pointing to the entrance. \"Before, people would just walk by and start looking at the ocean,\" he says. \"Now, these get their attention.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the people come inside, Warren starts spilling his enthusiasm, as the camera obscura chugs quietly around on its motorized axis, panning the surf and the sea lions and the sinking sun. At one point, Warren says, there were three such cameras in San Francisco alone. Now, there are only a handful left in the world. Dave Warren can tell you where each one is and who if running it. That\\'s one of his projects -- forming an organization of all the camera obscura operators in the world, so they can share information.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun sinks low enough in the sky at the end of the day, the sun itself is captured on the rim of Warren\\'s satellitedish screen, a glowing ball of concentrated light. At that point, Warren will hold up a flat, white board, moving it into the field of projection so that he can show people the sunstorms around the edge of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"We always look for the sunspots,\" he says. \"It\\'s part of our show. We turn off the narration tape and do the sunset show in person. We see the green flash in here about twice a month. It\\'s caused by the spectrum of light being split by the atmosphere. The various colors of light are separated. When green comes along, it flashes, like the northern lights, just as the last rays of light leave.\" Warren can\\'t help himself; his voice fills with awe. \"It lasts only a tenth of a second, but it\\'s very beautiful. Liquid jade. When Jules Verne was writing, he said if there is a green in heaven, it\\'s surely this green.\"\r\n\r\nAs people leave, Warren nearly always seems to find some excuse to give them a free pass for another visit. (\"Next time, come back while it\\'s still light, so you can see the sea lions\" or \"Come back and bring a friend.\")\r\n\r\nThe camera never fails to surprise him. \"The most unusual thing happened just the other day,\" says Warren. \"We were watching a sunset, and all of a sudden there was a thud. The screen got black. I thought for sure a bird had hit the camera, Later, when I went up to close the hatch, I reached in, and there was a fish. A pelican probably dropped it,\" he says. \"He sure had good aim.\"\r\n\r\nBut even on more humdrum days, the object of his livelihood and his affections totally entrances David Warren. Someday, he\\'d like to create a mobile camera, on that he could haul up to Twin Peaks. \"Now that would be something,\" he says. Meanwhile, if you venture down the stairs that lead to the terrace below the Cliff House, you\\'ll find him, polishing the brass arrows or leaning out through the box office, trying to coax people over that invisible line. When someone gets within earshot, Warren is there, speaking softly. \"Have you seen the camera obscura?\"\r\n\r\n On a side note, Dave was the first “fire performer” and individual to light the burning man in the black rock desert.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heig9mgvy5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.514215,37.778262]}},{"properties":{"name":"Defenestration","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/DEFENSE.bmp\">6th and Howard St. San Francisco CaOn March 9, 1997, hundreds of people came together to celebrate the opening of Brian Goggin\\'s Defenestration installation.

Later, a follow-up track \"Cheap Date\" was released on Teen Rebel Records.

Greens changed that by raising the bar, by placing vegetarian cuisine on a level with other fine dining restaurants. We have been reviewed by food and design magazines from the time we opened.

The striped Fleetwood is impossible to miss even nestled, as it is, off the street beneath the shadow of a large apartment building. It is a hypertrophy of migratory convenience -- a palatial estate on wheels being outfitted with a techie\\'s dream camera system using high-powered lenses that once monitored the grounds in front of the Federal Building. \r\n\r\n\"It\\'ll be set up for teleconferencing,\" says Wickett. \"The cameras will be computer-controlled, picking up details at a good distance with very little light, and sending images back and forth.\" \r\n\r\nThe NSA-style security camera lenses were bought outright by Wickett, as was the lovely little house peeking over the roof of the Fleetwood, and the old French laundry two blocks away, where Wickett\\'s most alluring passions are displayed: tens of thousands of collectibles from the near and far reaches of the globe that comprise the San Francisco Museum of Exotica. \r\n\r\n\"I\\'m not open to the public,\" says Wickett with a gentleman\\'s flourish. \"These are just my props.\" \r\n\r\nWickett\\'s \"props\" include a tribal throne from New Guinea, a bishop\\'s mantle woven with solid gold thread, an antique marionette of Joan of Arc, opium pipes for every disposition, an elaborate bird cage built to resemble an Austrian prison, Indonesian phalluses, Philippine bridles, and ceremonial knives used for the dismemberment of the Tibetan dead before their meat is offered to the vultures. The place measures over 6,000 square feet -- featuring lofts, closets, alcoves, odd passageways, and hidden platforms -- and every centimeter is festooned with resplendent colors and extravagant ornamentation. The effect is dizzying, and if hash smoke were still flowing from the hookahs, your best bet would be to completely succumb, give up your day, drop to your knees on the thick layers of Persian carpet, and methodically work your way up from the floorboards -- examining the tiny portraits created in Chinese silk, the minuscule grasshopper band that plays instruments under glass, the Tantric figurines stolen long ago from Nepalese temples, the African instruments made of human skulls and snakeskin, the robes of an Indian child prince, and then moving up to a ceiling covered in animal skins (a hippopotamus, a full-grown giraffe, a Tibetan snow leopard) mingled with hand-woven tapestries and kaleidoscopic patterns of colored light sprayed from intricately carved Iranian lanterns. Over the blanketed windows you would notice an enormous Alaskan moose head smoking a joint. Several large clowns from Playland at the Beach grin from atop the carriage house; they are flanked by two Indian tigers that once stood at the City of Paris (now Neiman-Marcus). A figure in Chinese robes who once held court in the Lost Wax Museum (now McDonald\\'s) looks on with a sage eye, and the last Empress of China judges everything through beeswax eyes. \r\n\r\n\"I\\'m interested in anything and everything that is interesting,\" says Wickett, an elegant snow-haired 82-year-old wearing a Turkish shirt and slim-fitting slacks, who runs nimbly through his museum turning on lamps made of camel bladders and shifting Arabic gaming tables inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl, and onyx. \r\n\r\n\"This is just stuff, hardly worth writing about. This giant silver teapot was given to me while I was staying with the Shah of Iran. Just stuff,\" says Wickett casually. \"This is a whale rib pulled out of the Santa Cruz Mountains, which haven\\'t been under water for over 14 million years, I\\'m told.\" \r\n\r\nLike his \"stuff,\" Wickett\\'s past is \"just the past.\" Born to an affluent New York insurance family, Wickett grew up in Atherton at Mille Fleure -- John Sutro\\'s former estate -- with a four-story elevator, three guest houses, and tennis courts. He wore a tie every day; walls of ties stand here, testament to his sartorial past. He married a lovely girl and ran no less than 14 businesses, becoming one of the largest landowners in San Mateo; he was president of the Redwood City Rotary Club and the State Board of Realtors, and a founder of the United Way for the Bay Area; he served on the cotillion committee for a decade, during which he made sure the nerves of all underage debs were assuaged with a quick double-gin martini before their grand entrances (a secret well guarded until now). \r\n\r\nThen, in his mid-40s, John Wickett got divorced, sold his businesses, and went native. \r\n\r\n\"I had grown up so conservative, so Victorian,\" says Wickett. \"I just wised up one day, caught on that there was another side to life, something more interesting.\" \r\n\r\nAt one point Wickett lived in Melvin Belli\\'s old home on Twin Peaks, and in a synagogue nestled between Fillmore West and Jim Jones\\' church. He became a silent partner in Jim Gabbert\\'s Channel 20. Ten years ago he began filling the French laundry on Sutter with objects from distant shores and more distant eras. Each object came with a story -- like the ritual Philippine phallus used by grandmothers to aid virgins on their wedding nights, or the shaman mask made of the four elements of life (blood, sweat, semen, and shit), or Laughing Sal, the Playland matron who springs to cackling-and-grinning life at the flick of a switch. Wickett treats all of his possessions like living history. The chairs are for sitting and the costumes for wearing, when the occasion is suitable. \r\n\r\n\"I like to have events here if the people are interesting,\" says Wickett. It\\'s not surprising that the interesting people don\\'t always leave. Presently Wickett has a helpful couple living at his house, a woman silently tucked away in his museum loft space, a gentleman convalescing in his carriage house, and someone\\'s cat winding its way along a windowsill lined with antique glassware. \r\n\r\n\"No one pays rent, or gas bills, or phone bills,\" says Wickett, \"as long as they\\'re interesting.\" \r\n\r\nIt\\'s even less surprising that during Wickett\\'s fetes an interesting treasure or two disappears -- as with a giraffe hoof he notices has been recently cut from the skin hanging from his ceiling -- but Wickett just chuckles. \r\n\r\n\"People come in and ask about the three most valuable small objects I own. It\\'s OK, things get \\'souvenired.\\' I have four auctions and four trips to the Orient planned this year.\" \r\n\r\nSurprising that he would bother searching for the exotic. After living in the San Francisco Museum of Exotica, the real thing might almost disappoint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://130.212.44.5/custom/magazine/wickett.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heig3r23oc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444344,37.784721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Karla ov Cafe La Taza","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/platialmission2006_045.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/platialmission2006_046.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 470 Post Street, San Francisco CA 94102\nZe pulled pork panini wif chipotle mayonnaise eez ze way tou goose.

Its whimsical style has delighted generations. \r\n\r\n\"A massive, grassroots effort to preserve it, chronicled nationally in the comic strip, \"Zippy the Pinhead,\" led to its acquisition by the City of San Francisco in March, 2000. \r\n\r\n\"Toppled by wind April 1, 2003, it was restored to its original site by SF Central Shops and the Department of Public Works. In January 2005, the Doggie was relocated to this spot to welcome all who visit Ocean Beach. \r\n\r\n\"\\'Long Live the Doggie!\\'\" \r\n\r\nThe last Doggie Diner head (on a pole) makes its home in the Outer Sunset district, and with talk of official landmark designation, it has transcended its origin as a whimsical advertising icon. \r\n\r\nStarted in 1949, the chain of Doggie Diner restaurants were everywhere by the 1960s. The Richmond district alone had three of them, and a three-dimensional (and once rotating) dog head with chef hat glared down gleefully at each of them. \r\n\r\n \r\nDesigned circa 1960 by illustrator Harold Bachman (who is still surprised at all the hubbub and said in early 2005 he just thought the darned thing would help sell hamburgers), this San Francisco institution has found a new location a block from its old home. The Doggie Diner Head now welcomes visitors to Ocean Beach from 45th Avenue and Sloat Boulevard, giving his sardonic grin to all who come west. (Probably a nice change of view, after looking south at the Zoo for over 40 years.) \r\n\r\nOn February 14, 2005, under threatening skies, a small, happy crowd welcomed the Doggie to its new home. Ed Lee, the head of San Francisco\\'s Department of Public Works, presided and welcomed third-graders from Ulloa Elementary School, some real canines (and their guardians), a couple of jugglers, and a passel of media. The Mayor couldn\\'t make it, but Supervisor Sean Elsbernd said how the Doggie was a great memory of his childhood, and Supervisor Fiona Ma\\'s representative talked of official landmarking! \r\n\r\nDoggie saviors Diana Scott and Joel Schechter of the Ocean Beach Historical Society attended and Diana gave a few words of thanks along with the exclamation of the day: \"Long Live the Doggie!\" \r\n\r\nNo sign of Zippy the Pinhead, but likely the Doggie will find its way into his world soon enough... \r\n\r\nThe Doggie was actually moved on January 28, 2005, and these great photos of city workers moving the Doggie are courtesy of Diana Scott of the Ocean Beach Historical Society. \r\n\r\nhttp://outsidelands.org/doggie_diner.php<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heig8lqqur"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.504033,37.735488]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Bike Kitchen","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 18th Street and Alabama, San Francisco CACoopied from ze site:\nThe Bike Kitchen is a cooperative, do-it-yourself bike repair shop.

It was atop this island that the Farallon Islands Lighthouse was constructed. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heig5ws5x4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.67849,37.782383]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Exploratorium","description":"Posted by Mrylyn<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/3/explo_&amp;_me.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 3601 Lyon St. San Francisco, CA 94123museum of science, art &amp; human perception<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heifwhlln4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.448463,37.803681]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Orange Show","description":"Posted by Shoothouston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/Orange_Show_600.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/3/Orange_Show_600_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 2402 Munger St., Houston, TX 77023<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heig47ro71"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.324522,29.717852]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Punch at Hobson's Choice","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/May2006_098.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1601 Haight Street, San Francisco Itttsa knockouttie!

The concept was developed by Peter Richards and was installed in collaboration with sculptor and master stone mason George Gonzales. Inspiration for the piece came from artist Bill Fontana\\'s recordings made of sounds emanating from a vent pipe of a floating concrete dock in Sydney, Australia. \r\nIn 1980, Richards (now a Senior Artist at the Exploratorium) received a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which enabled him to conduct an extensive period of investigation into the physicality of the Wave Organ phenomenon. The sculpture\\'s speaker horn and audio equipment were either built or acquired for use in some of the experiments of this period. \r\nA prototype, built at the same location, was presented as part of the New Music \\'81 Festival. Though very rudimentary in nature, it generated enthusiasm and support for a permanent work. Permit acquisition and fundraising efforts by Frank Oppenheimer, founding director of the Exploratorium, began soon after, but actual construction did not start until September of 1985, seven months after Oppenheimer\\'s death. The Wave Organ was completed in May of 1986 and was dedicated in June to the memory of Frank Oppenheimer. The Wave Organ is located on a jetty that forms the small Boat Harbor in the Marina district of San Francisco, walking distance from the Exploratorium. The jetty itself was constructed with material taken from a demolished cemetery, providing a wonderful assortment of carved granite and marble, which was used in the construction of this piece. The installation includes 25 organ pipes made of PVC and concrete located at various elevations within the site, allowing for the rise and fall of the tides. Sound is created by the impact of waves against the pipe ends and the subsequent movement of the water in and out of the pipes. The sound heard at the site is subtle, requiring visitors to become sensitized to its music, and at the same time to the music of the environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heig02zd5i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.440259,37.808351]}},{"properties":{"name":"The White House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500Where it all goes down.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heigb3sc73"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036474,38.89859]}},{"properties":{"name":"The best beach in San Francisco","description":"Posted by Whysteriastar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/jennydanny075_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/me.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/jennydanny065.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> If you ever want to see somewhere absolutely stunning and far beyond the trip any San Francisco tour guide would dream of taking you, go here.

Local novelty became self-assured celebrity as Alma secured the position of model for sculptor Robert Aitken. His creation, a monument honoring naval hero Admiral Dewey and the recently assassinated president William McKinley, would feature the buxom temptress as a triumphant bronze libertine atop a granite pedestal, her right arm outstretched, holding the laurel wreath of peace towards the horizon, her left arm, raised above her head, valiantly pointing a trident to the heavens.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6heifx1id1x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40845,37.78833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Witches' Castle - Stone House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://gozer.ectoplasm.org/albums/GQ-Portland-jul2004-day3-Forest_Park-LMT/aaa.sized.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/5/5161735_a54ad5d430.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/42e2b96916512.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/42e2b96a59a2b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/42e2b96b6f0e3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Somewhat old stone house ruins.
