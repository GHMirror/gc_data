While Art major 1 was kind of a base and learning skills of art type of class, Art major 2 was more of an opportunity to  experience many medias and mediums of art, and you also had more options in projects and creativity available. Portfolio was an even greater opportunity to be creative with your work and this is where you picked a concentration, or theme, and created several pieces going with that. These 2 classes were mostly important to me because Ms. Gallagher was all for preparing you for college art courses and treated it as if it was one, and from my experience so far in drawing and 2d design going by what we do and how they are run, she\\'s done well. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6h44xgq2slk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.137941,40.183347]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ocean City New Jersey","description":"Posted by Nikkinuttall<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> ocean city new jerseyWhere i\\'m from when summer arrives, everyone heads to the jersey shore.
