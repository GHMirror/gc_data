The number of inactive elderly as a ratio of the number in the total labour force is also increasing throughout OECD countries. These trends have a number of implications for government and private spending on pensions and health care and, more generally, for economic growth and welfare. \n\nPopulation is defined as the resident population, i.e. all persons, regardless of citizenship, who have a permanent place of residence in the country. The labour force is defined according to the ILO Guidelines and consists of those in employment plus persons who are available for work and who are actively seeking employment. Population projections are taken from national sources where these are available, but for some countries they are based on Eurostat and UN projections.\n\nNull data &quot;..&quot; was changed to be -1\n\n","stats":{"latitude":{"max": 64.963943, "mean": 39.4352667368421, "variance": 697.803778639449, "stdev": 26.4159758222075, "min": -43.587711, "median": 47.164509},"pct2005":{"max": 45.9, "mean": 27.7421052631579, "variance": 65.3100711237553, "stdev": 8.08146466451196, "min": 12.5, "median": 28.3},"pct2050":{"max": 98.5, "mean": 56.3026315789474, "variance": 656.837560455192, "stdev": 25.6288423549561, "min": -1, "median": 55.9},"pct2040":{"max": 90.9, "mean": 50.7368421052632, "variance": 510.192119487909, "stdev": 22.5874327777175, "min": -1, "median": 53.3},"pct2030":{"max": 71, "mean": 42.4552631578947, "variance": 356.180376955903, "stdev": 18.8727416385618, "min": -1, "median": 46.5},"pct2020":{"max": 61.2, "mean": 33.6078947368421, "variance": 246.426152204836, "stdev": 15.6979664990354, "min": -1, "median": 36.6},"pct2010":{"max": 48.5, "mean": 26.5052631578947, "variance": 162.504836415363, "stdev": 12.7477384823883, "min": -1, "median": 30.1},"longitude":{"max": 170.366638, "mean": 19.4570890263158, "variance": 3863.9490924812, "stdev": 62.1606715896893, "min": -101.956253, "median": 13.34577},"pct2000":{"max": 45.1, "mean": 26.7, "variance": 74.1362162162162, "stdev": 8.61023903362829, "min": 11.3, "median": 28.1}},"next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"limit":1000000,"total":38},"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"metadata":"","url":"http://titania.sourceoecd.org/vl=700732/cl=16/nw=1/rpsv/factbook/","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"OECD","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://titania.sourceoecd.org/vl=700732/cl=16/nw=1/rpsv/factbook/","data_type":"Dataset","permissions":[{"group_id":"everyone","permissions":{"download":true,"view":true}}],"classification":null,"tags":"elderly,employment,global,international,population,senior","id":319}
