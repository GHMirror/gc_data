This is a haven for wildlife, but the Gulf is also littered with oil rigs. This means lots of tar on the beach, jellyfish, seaweed, and murky bath-warm water. That being said, if seeing beautiful night skys and being able to drive for miles on the beach and see very few people is something you are interested in, I highly reccomend it.

Also remember, even in summer, its cold at 14,000 feet.

We went during the rut so that we could get a full experience of the area. It was a mild fall, so we were hot in our sleeping bag that was temperature rated for much colder conditions. We drove Trail Ridge Road, hiked to Moraine Park, Cub Lake, did the Bear Lake Corridor hike up to Emerald Lake and did many other unofficial hikes. Beaver Mountain and the trail to the treeline next to it was where we saw the majority of the elk herds. While coming back down from a hike at dusk, we stumbled upon some cows crossing down towards the meadow and eventually spotted the bull. Luckily, he didn\\'t spot us - as the thought of my husband tangling with a creature that size as I watched from up in a tree wasn\\'t very inviting. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cgwsgdtmql"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.599513,40.400555]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Antonio Missions, TX","description":"Posted by Bluenude3<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/2000_san_antonio_missions.jpg\">2202 Roosevelt Ave San Antonio, TXDay trips to the missions in San Antonio are a great way to slow down the speed of life.
