Sun-Soo Kwon, as portrayed by Korean actress Yunjin Kim, is not keen on arranged relationships, but she soon finds that she has an easy rapport and is growing fond of Jae Lee as portrayed by actor Tony Lee.\n\nOn a subsequent lunch date, however, Jae confides in Sun that he while at Harvard he met an American woman and he intends to move there in six months and marry her. Distraught, Sun leaves the hotel dining room and goes for a walk along the canal. This is where Sun and Jin first meet face to face and speak to each other.\n\nTheir meeting actually takes place along the Ala Wai Canal near the recently rebuilt Kalakaua Avenue Bridge into Waikiki.

Young James vows revenge upon the con man but instead finds himself sucked into the same lifestyle to the degree that he even takes on the name of the hated con man, Frank Sawyer.\nIn Lost Season 1, Episode 16 - Outlaws, James is told by his former partner Hibbs that the man who ruined his family and his childhood, the same man from whom he took his alias Frank Sawyer, was in Australia operating a shrimp truck.

The architects of the design/build team - Loschky, Marquardt and Nesholm; and Wimberly, Allison, Tong and Goo - gave special attention to the idea of relating the building to its Waikiki environment and Hawaii\\'s history and culture.\n\nVolunteers conduct tours through the Center for groups of 10 or more by appointment only. \n\nOne-hour tours can be arranged on Wednesday and Thursday at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. You can, however, usually walk into the foyer area and escalator area where scenes from Lost were filmed.\n\nThe Hawaii Convention Center is located at 1801 Kalakaua Avenue in Honolulu right near the border of Honolulu and Waikiki.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66qak36arpg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.8372,21.2918]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sydney Mosque Where Sayid Finds Essam","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/normal_greatergood190.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/4/lost_16.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1040 Richards Street, Honolulu, HILost Season 1, Episode 21: The Greater Good, is an emotionally charged episode that includes a back story of Sayid Jarrah as portrayed by actor London-born Naveen Andrews.

As a communications officer in Saddam Hussein\\'s Republican Guard he was, nevertheless, assigned to interrogate Nadia who was suspected of some crime. After being ordered to kill her, he instead arranges for her escape.\n\nSeveral years later Sayid arrives in Sydney presumably in search of Nadia. He is taken into custody by the CIA and ASIS. They are looking to locate a terrorist cell. Sayid denies any terrorist involvement. He soon learns that the authorities want his help in exchange for helping him find Nadia. It turns out that one of the members of the cell is Sayid\\'s old roommate at Cairo University, Essam Tazir.\n\nLater in the episode the scene switched to a mosque at time of prayer. Sayid sees his old friend Essam across the room and approaches him after prayer is finished.\n\nThe mosque scene was filmed in the Laniakea YWCA at 1040 Richards Street in Downtown Honolulu.

John Locke, as portrayed by actor Terry O\\'Quinn, has one of the show\\'s most interesting and mysterious back stories. Frustrated by his job at a box company where he is constantly belittled by his supervisor for his interests in war gaming and survival training, Locke dreams of more adventurous things. Tired of being told what he cannot do, Locke books a trip to the Australian Outback where the participants will hike through this difficult terrain. Upon his arrival in Australia, he is advised by the tour company that he cannot participate in the tour. We learn for the first time that Locke is actually a paraplegic and the company cannot insure his safety. He is sent home angry on the doomed Flight 815. Much to his surprise he discovers that after the crash he has regained the use of his legs. The scenes at the tour company in Australia were filmed at what was at the time a vacant retail space at 1 North King Street in Honolulu. It has since been leased to McClain\\'s Auctions. The screenshot of this is taken from the inside of the building looking outwards.
