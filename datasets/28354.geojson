The entrance leads into an extravagant main room with high ceilings and the building\\'s original brick walls decorated with champagne collectibles and artwork. Ten inviting salons are furnished with satin couches, overstuffed chairs, rich mahogany, and marble tables - all under the soft, warm glow of candlelight.
