It is probable that only small areas of this region are truly underlain by such thermal water; the region represents that part of the state that deserves exploration for thermal areas. The region is defined on the basis of various geothermal and tectonic phenomena at such as locations of thermal wells and springs, above-normal heat flow, youthful volcanism, mineralization, and seismicity.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"PERIMETER":{"max":5497095.0,"mean":1950245.26733333,"variance":9465139359987.32,"stdev":3076546.66143508,"min":3522.708,"median":350118.094},"AREA":{"max":262635880448.0,"mean":89849394377.7187,"variance":2.24033207329984e+22,"stdev":149677388850.148,"min":227933.156,"median":6912074752.0},"CA_LGHTGRY":{"max":3,"mean":2.0,"variance":1.0,"stdev":1.0,"min":1,"median":2}},"features":[{"properties":{"PERIMETER":5497095.0,"ArcIds":"(12:-9,-12,-13,-11,-6,-5,4,-7,-8,-3,0,10)","AREA":262635880448.0,"id":"a622q9j81tvx","CA_LGHTGRY":1},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"PERIMETER":350118.094,"ArcIds":"(1:-10)","AREA":6912074752.0,"id":"a622q9irmrix","CA_LGHTGRY":2},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"PERIMETER":3522.708,"ArcIds":"(2:1,-2)","AREA":227933.156,"id":"a622q9czg1qs","CA_LGHTGRY":3},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.120680247442,40.1091467794071],[-124.126543265722,40.1210134016341],[-124.118970087715,40.1117559449868],[-124.116561495694,40.1074588730619],[-124.118970087715,40.1117559449868],[-124.126543265722,40.1210134016341],[-124.120680247442,40.1091467794071]]]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=422&&PageID=3487&mode=2&in_hi_userid=200&cached=true","metadata":"http://geothermal.inel.gov/maps/ca_metadata.htm","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory","contact_phone":""},"source":"https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=422&&PageID=3487&mode=2&in_hi_userid=200&cached=true","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":3,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"california,energy,environment,geothermal,us","published":"2003-11-01T12:00:00Z","id":13698}
