The list of 66 included nine high schools that serve less than 1,250 students (including Houston's two oldest high schools for African-Americans, Yates and Wheatley), 15 middle schools with less than 750 students, 15 elementaries with less than 500 students and seven multilevel schools (including K-7 and K-8 facilities) serving less than 750 students.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"g: total \"small school\" subsidy october 2010":{"max":285315.0,"mean":88945.9166666667,"variance":7577247090.42754,"stdev":87047.3841676333,"min":0.0,"median":72944.0},"h: 2010-11 magnet funding":{"max":412880.0,"mean":17203.3333333333,"variance":7102912266.66667,"stdev":84278.7770833599,"min":0.0,"median":0.0},"f: total \"small school\" subsidy december 2010":{"max":288847.0,"mean":95511.75,"variance":5696890776.45652,"stdev":75477.7502079687,"min":0.0,"median":101541.0},"i: students december 2010":{"max":551,"mean":353.708333333333,"variance":17597.3460144928,"stdev":132.654988652869,"min":9,"median":375}},"features":[{"properties":{"k: hispanic":"81%","g: total \"small school\" subsidy october 2010":133180.0,"e: hisd designated 66 \"small schools\"":"No","d: school board member":"Manuel Rodriguez","j: white":"1%","geo_score":0.822,"h: 2010-11 magnet funding":0.0,"l: black":"18%","m: other":null,"c: 2010 tea rating":"Not Rated","f: total \"small school\" subsidy december 2010":159027.0,"id":"a64n3v3xt2j5","geo_precision":"range","i: students december 2010":355,"address":"8615 Glen Valley\nHouston, TX 77061-1703","b: school":"Bellfort ECC"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.275019,29.665692]}},{"properties":{"k: hispanic":"61%","g: total \"small school\" subsidy october 2010":72944.0,"e: hisd designated 66 \"small schools\"":"No","d: school board member":"Mike Lunceford","j: white":"14%","geo_score":0.605,"h: 2010-11 magnet funding":0.0,"l: black":"19%","m: other":"7%","c: 2010 tea rating":"Exemplary","f: total \"small school\" subsidy december 2010":62322.0,"id":"a64n3v57oeeb","geo_precision":"zip","i: students december 2010":444,"address":"5601 West Loop South\nHouston, TX 77081-2221","b: school":"Challenge High School*"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.306914,29.68193]}},{"properties":{"k: hispanic":"62%","g: total \"small school\" subsidy october 2010":215189.0,"e: hisd designated 66 \"small schools\"":"No","d: school board member":"Carol Galloway","j: white":"0%","geo_score":0.558,"h: 2010-11 magnet funding":0.0,"l: black":"37%","m: other":"","c: 2010 tea rating":"Exemplary","f: total \"small school\" subsidy december 2010":179180.0,"id":"a64n3v5fjm74","geo_precision":"range","i: students december 2010":243,"address":"1510 Jensen Drive\nHouston, TX 77020-2124","b: school":"Crawford Elementary School"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.341778,29.774683]}},{"properties":{"k: hispanic":"57%","g: total \"small school\" subsidy october 2010":176670.0,"e: hisd designated 66 \"small schools\"":"No","d: school board member":"Carol Galloway","j: white":"1%","geo_score":0.609,"h: 2010-11 magnet funding":0.0,"l: black":"42%","m: other":"1%","c: 2010 tea rating":"Recognized","f: total \"small school\" subsidy december 2010":192337.0,"id":"a64n3vc2upfo","geo_precision":"zip","i: students december 2010":321,"address":"4202 Liberty\nHouston, TX 77026-5824","b: school":"Dogan Elementary School"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.434241,29.83399]}},{"properties":{"k: hispanic":"89%","g: total \"small school\" subsidy october 2010":76437.0,"e: hisd designated 66 \"small schools\"":"No","d: school board member":"Juliet Stipeche","j: white":"2%","geo_score":0.611,"h: 2010-11 magnet funding":0.0,"l: black":"5%","m: other":"4%","c: 2010 tea rating":"Exemplary","f: total \"small school\" subsidy december 2010":41906.0,"id":"a64n3v0gcc8z","geo_precision":"zip","i: students december 2010":461,"address":"220 N.
