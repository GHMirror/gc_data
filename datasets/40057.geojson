To transform Amsterdam Bos into the breathtaking park that it is today, park architects planted a vast forest. Although the forest is basically man-made, it appears to be a perfectly natural setting. Beside the forest, one of the fantastic draws to Amsterdam Bos is its sports park, which is constantly in use. \r\n\r\nVondel was built over 140 years ago. Real estate developers wanted to build homes on the outskirts of Amsterdam, but city officials put a condition on their development. The real estate developers would also be required to provide the city with an impressive park; Vondel is the result of this endeavor. The park and the surrounding neighborhoods were built together as cohesive pieces of a greater puzzle. \r\n\r\nLike so many of the parks in Holland, Amsterdam Bos and Vondel Park are always full of people enjoying precious public amenities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5noqr8kgd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.867115,52.358331]}},{"properties":{"name":"Balboa Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/balboatophome.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 1549 El Prado, San Diego, CASan Diego\\'s Balboa Park came about through the efforts of wealthy land-developer Alonzo Horton, who persuaded city leaders to set aside 1400 acres that could be developed in a variety of ways for public use. Today the park includes nine public gardens, an arboretum, the Old Globe Theater, the Starlight Amphitheater, a children\\'s theater, 15 museums and art galleries, and the world-renowned San Diego Zoo.\n\nNearly a century ago, the Panama-California Exposition took place at San Diego\\'s Balboa Park. To mark the opening of the exposition, sugar magnate John D. Spreckels financed the construction of a huge outdoor organ to be housed at the Spreckels Pavilion in the park. Ever since this 1915 exposition, the Spreckels Pavilion has been a community gathering place for residents from all over San Diego. To this date, they have a tradition of regular organ recitals, which are free to the public. Anyone who has ever attended a concert at the pavilion can tell you just how special it is. With its 4,518 pipes this organ can mimic many orchestral sounds, including brass, strings and percussion. On a clear night, the organ\\'s music can be heard far beyond the park\\'s boundaries. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5nopyr40v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.149974,32.73145]}},{"properties":{"name":"Butchart Gardens","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/1_3_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 800 Benvenuto Avenue, Brentwood Bay, British ColumbiaButchart Gardens on Victoria Island is an accidental paradise. Beginning as a gardening experiment on the grounds of a former limestone quarry, the gardens have transformed into a world-class park over the past century.\n\nIn 1888, Robert Pim Butchart started manufacturing cement, drawing much of the necessary limestone from the land around his factory on Vancouver Island. When the limestone quarry was mined out, Robert Pim Butchart’s wife, Jennie, had an idea to transform the empty pit into something more aesthetically pleasing. She had rich topsoil brought in from the neighboring farmland and planted what has become known as the Sunken Garden. Over the coming decades, the Butcharts added a Japanese Garden, an Italian Garden, a Rose Garden, and even a large vegetable patch. By 1920, over fifty thousand people came every year to see the remarkable landscapes that the Butcharts had created.\n\nToday, Butchart Gardens is considered a world-class attraction. In the next year, they anticipate the welcome of their fifty millionth visitor. In addition to the many gardens, there are seasonal attractions including fireworks, concerts, strolling Christmas carolers, and the summertime “Night Illuminations.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5nouz25wz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.463162,48.563683]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cantigny Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/gag103a_e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\">  1 South 151 Winfield Road, Wheaton, Illinois 60187Cantigny Park in Wheaton, Illinois is home to many exciting and beautiful amenities. One of the most spectacular of these is the Formal Gardens, designed in 1967 by landscape architect Franz Lipp.\n\nOver the past few decades, the trees and foliage in the Formal Gardens have matured, growing into one of the finest gardens in America. \nCantigny’s Formal Gardens include the North Scalloped Garden, the Fountain Garden, the Rock Garden, the Green Garden, Bur Oak Garden, Golden and Silver Ponds, the Rose Garden, and the Douglas Fir Garden. Each location within the Gardens radiates its own personality and character, some places full of vibrant color, others relaxing and soothing in nature.  The Formal Gardens also change with the seasons, the greenery and scenery varying as the year passes. \n\nAmongst the numerous plants that grow in the Gardens are magnolia, yew, boxwood, linden, euonymus, birch, larch, redbud, smoke tree, low creeping juniper, trailing cotoneaster, ginko, dogwood, maple, and a variety of roses.  The Formal Gardens at Cantigny Park provide residents and tourists with an enchanting landmark, which is enjoyed by thousands of guests each year.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5np3ckovi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.16067,41.852989]}},{"properties":{"name":"Central Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/malloftrees_500x413.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Central Park, New York, NYNew York\\'s Central Park was envisioned by nineteenth century landscape architect, Fredrick Law Olmstead. Olmstead\\'s plan, known as the Greensward Plan, was submitted to the Central Park design competition in 1857. The Greensward Plan created a green haven in the center of what was becoming a noisy and hectic city. The park\\'s design was built around areas of tufted trees, rolling lawns, meandering pathways and placid lakes. Fredrick Law Olmstead\\'s plan for New York\\'s Central Park still serves as a model for park planners today. His vision set the standard for the pastoral urban park.\nToday, with the aid of the Central Park Conservancy, New York\\'s Central Park has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Every day, thousands of residents and tourists traverse the park, enjoying an expanse of green in the middle of one of America\\'s largest cities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5nosfa1x1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9727,40.77341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chapultepec Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/chapultepec.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 19.421768,-99.184613Open space is hard to find in Mexico’s capital, which is home to about 20 million residents. Chapultepec Park, located in El Distrito Federal, or Mexico City, constitutes one of the largest open spaces in this densely urban area. In the Aztec language, “Chapultepec” literally means “grasshopper hill.” This park is the largest in Mexico City, stretching three times as long as New York’s Central Park. Because of Chapultepec Park’s central location, it serves as an excellent “jumping-off” point for many of Mexico City’s other attractions. Chapultepec Park is a popular spot for both the residents of Mexico City, as well as tourists.\n\nSurrounding Chapultepec Park, which is east of the city center, are a centuries-old forest and beautiful, historical neighborhoods. Inside the park, there are a wide variety of amenities and venues including: an amusement park, the only genuine castle in North America, Mexico\\'s largest zoo, a lake, a water park, and Los Pinos, the residence of the President of Mexico. The park is also home to numerous museums, such as the Anthropology Museum (Museo Nacional de Antropologia), the Modern Art Museum (Museo de Arte Moderno), and the Contemporary Art Museum (Museo de Arte Contemporaneo Internacional Rufino Tamayo).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5novbf5zm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-99.184613,19.421768]}},{"properties":{"name":"De Hoge Veluwe Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/de_hoge_veluwe.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 52.0833333,5.8333333De Hoge Veluwe National Park is a huge public space formerly owned by the influential Kroller-Muller family.

The German park, which was built between 1991 and 2000, is constructed on grounds that were once highly industrialized. What makes this park different from so many other exercises in reuse, however, is that the skeletons of industry are the main attraction at the park.\n\nNewly fitted for safety and public exploration, the former industrial mountains, machines and structures have become a permanent exhibit of German history. But they are only half of the spectacle. Duisburg’s lush landscaping has been melded into the heavily industrialized backdrop and is comprised of what may be called experimental vegetation. Because of the nature of the site, the park’s designers were unsure what plants would flourish. They planted a large variety of flora species and let nature decide how the final landscape would look. The result is a menagerie of unexpected greenery growing in very unexpected places: trails of vines climbing water towers, groundcover wading into rain-filled pools and trees sprouting up between vast metal towers.\n\nPark-goers are constantly surprised and enchanted with their surroundings at Duisburg Nord, one of Europe’s more intriguing feats in park reuse.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5notkn87l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[6.784253,51.47984]}},{"properties":{"name":"Forest Park","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/86684599@N00/144050889/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/52/144050889_1ae563aae0_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/93587218@N00/147054310/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/55/147054310_0f25d88eb0_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5noo5fymb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.764664,45.568451]}},{"properties":{"name":"Golden Gate Park","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/goldengate_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Fulton at 36th Ave / Lincoln at 41st Ave San Francisco, CA 94102Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was first envisioned in the 1860s by Mayor Frank McCoffin, who wanted San Francisco to have a grand open space. Unlike the lush beauty we see when visiting Golden Gate Park today, the land was originally a patch of barren, shifting sand dunes. Now the park is home to nine lakes and ponds, colorful flower gardens, beautiful landscaping, a Japanese tea garden, two replicas of Dutch windmills, and a total of 1017 acres of land devoted to a variety of recreation including bicycling, soccer, and boating.

One of the primary objectives for the park’s designers was to transform the railroad tracks and parking lots that blemished prime real estate in downtown Chicago into a desirable and beautiful city amenity.\n\nThe 25-acre Millennium Park combines extraordinary architecture, sculpture and landscape design. This includes the work of world-renowned artists, architects, planners, landscape architects and designers such as Frank Gehry, Anish Kapoor, Jaume Plensa and Kathryn Gustafson.\n\nA wide array of events and entertainment at Millennium Park provide interest to children, families and adults. These events encompass both the performing arts like live music, theatre and dance, as well as fine art presentations and exhibits.\n\nMillennium Park has become a jewel in the middle of urban sprawl, offering a place of beauty and peace in the midst of one of America’s largest metropolitan centers. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5nowpr8r5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.622769,41.882654]}},{"properties":{"name":"Missouri Botanical Garden","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/mobot.jpg\">4344 Shaw Blvd, St Louis, MOFounded in 1859, the 79-acre Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the oldest botanical institutions in the country. Besides being a much-needed green space in the middle of St. Louis, the Garden is also a center for botanical research and science education.\n\nMissouri Botanical Garden encompasses a variety of landscapes, including a Victorian garden, an English woodland garden, a Japanese garden, a boxwood garden, a home demonstration garden, a greenhouse, a Chinese garden, and a geodesic dome, the Climatron. Throughout this botanical masterpiece are numerous water features, including a four-acre lake in the Japanese garden, and a great deal of beautiful statuary. Missouri Botanical Garden is also home to the Monsanto Center, one of the nation’s leading botanical research facilities.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the Missouri Botanical Garden is the diversity of the plants. The Garden houses plants from many countries around the world, giving guests the opportunity to explore and learn about the magnificent natural world of plants. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5noww9g04"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.25713,38.616656]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parc Andre Citroen","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/imagebank_display_thb_pict_php.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/balloon.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Quai André-Citroën, 75015, ParisTucked in amongst high-density housing and office spaces, Parc Andre Citroen in Paris provides the surrounding community with a luscious 35-acre front yard. Built on the former site of the Citroen Automotive factory, the park incorporates diverse landscapes into one cohesive natural tapestry.\n\nOn the northern end of Andre Citroen, park-goers can enjoy the White Garden, which is landscaped entirely with plants bearing white flowers, and the Black Garden, which houses only black-flowering plants. Between these opposite gardens are two botanical greenhouses, a bubbling fountain, and two magnolia groves, one planted on land and one floating in water.\n\nIn the middle of Parc Andre Citroen, there is a great lawn surrounded by a shallow moat. The lawn is a lovely place to play soccer or just rest and take a break from urban life. To the west of the lawn lie a series of small garden “rooms,” each designed by a different landscape architect and displaying a unique theme. Although these “rooms” are actually outside, they provide the illusion of privacy and intimacy.\n\nTo the south of Andre Citroen, the gardens are freeform, planted with wildflowers and bamboo. This end of the park edges against a business complex, yet there is little division between the park and the city beyond. The two blend into one another, drawing the urban-dwellers into Andre Citroen and park-goers back into Paris. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5not2s6s5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.274942,48.840854]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parc de Belleville","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/91714541_bb5f6dadf9.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/147123653_5b5d684be0.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/147134399_d658343080.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/120011036_737d8b7064.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/120010778_356f01a50d.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/15639686_13ffc81f9e.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Paris, FranceOne of the best views of Paris.

In 1848, it was taken over by the U.S. Army. Then, in 1972, the federal government created the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and transferred the 1480-acre base from the military to the National Park Service. For the next 22 years, the base was gradually retired from military service and converted to park use. When the base was decommissioned in 1984, the Presidio became a national park. Unlike other national parks, The Presidio is being developed to include residences, shops and businesses. These are mixed with a variety of other uses including recreational facilities, the Palace of Fine Arts and the Exploratorium Science Museum.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6f5noyg4x2f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.469406,37.79812]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Royal Parks","description":"Posted by Baostar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/2/royals_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Rangers Lodge Hyde Park, London, W2 2UH, United KingdomEvery year, London\\'s eight Royal Parks host millions of Londoners and tourists.
