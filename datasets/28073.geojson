Most people from the Island know about it, and many have stopped there at least once. It is a small establishment, with no indoor seating and only a few outdoor tables. Most people buy and eat in their car or simply hang out in front. The lack of dining facilities hasn\\'t hurt their business; the place is almost never empty, and in the hours surrounding lunch and dinner times the lines for the indoor order counter pack the small indoor waiting area and spill outside. Maybe All American was once, indeed, a drive-in, but in the quarter century I\\'ve known the place, you park and walk inside.\r\n      \r\n      The big sellers here are the hamburgers. The basic burger is small, probably 3 ounces before cooking, and good for a quick bite (and, at 90 cents quite reasonable). Most people will want more for lunch, though: the double-header (.70) is two patties between a bun (no third piece of bun between them), and a double-double is what you\\'d imagine it is. Alternately, a quarter-pounder (.85) can also be ordered. Though small, the burgers are intensely flavored, served with ketchup, pickles, and finely diced onions unless specified otherwise. They don\\'t have the flavorless, generic taste of the big chains.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md81z3wzm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.475764,40.666702]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alonso's - MD","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/alonso_front.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/omivore_26.jpg\">415 W Cold Spring Ln, BaltimoreArea is known as Roland Park. When the Classic Catering folks took over Alonso\\'s several years ago, regulars quietly wondered what would become of the corner bar/restaurant\\'s signature staple -- a 24-ounce mound of meat that qualifies as the holy grail of hamburgers. Alonso\\'s pub-grub menu was replaced with more upscale fare, and the smoky center bar gave way to a new long rail that opened up space for a few more tables. But the 24-ounce burger, and its 16-ounce little brother, were spared and now continue to satisfy gargantuan appetites while eliciting contented Homer Simpson-like sighs. When the big burger -- dubbed The Alonso Meal -- makes its way through the dining area, heads turn in amazement, and rightfully so. The beefy sandwich dwarfs the smattering of French fries served with it, and it\\'s nearly impossible to eat the whole thing without losing either the top or bottom portion of the bun. Plan your dining time wisely, as the gastronomic granddaddy takes at least 15-20 minutes to prepare (but the good news is, if you order it medium well, it\\'ll come that way -- not crispy on the outside and rare in the middle).

It was here that Washington issued the proclamation requiring all people in America to swear allegiance to the United States. The tavern is believed to have been built by Samuel Arnold before 1764, and operated for approximately 100 years, until the first floor was converted to retail shops. During the 1880s the building was scheduled for demolition until a horrified Julia Keese Colles purchased and moved it to Mount Kemble Avenue. There it served first as a boarding house and later as All Souls Hospital until the structure burned in 1918.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md82ap3um"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.4804,40.79762]}},{"properties":{"name":"BURGER JOINT - Le Parker Meridien Hotel","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/20050506BJInHand_thumb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/20050506LeParker_thumb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 118 W 57th ST, New York City NY 10019This hidden gem serves some of New York\\'s best burgers.

That\\'s a good start.  It\\'s an enormous piece of meat, weighing in at about 10 ounces I\\'d estimate.  That\\'s a bit too big for my taste, but generally not a deal-breaker.  But don\\'t get your hopes up, because it\\'s somewhat downhill from there.\r\n\r\nThe patties are not seasoned at all as far as I can tell.  No salt.  No pepper.  It goes against everything that I stand for to not season a piece of meat, especially one that size.  And then there\\'s the roll.

In the over 260 years that have followed, the BLACK HORSE TAVERN has catered to the discriminating tastes of its customers. Much of this history is still alive as you can see for yourself each time you enter any of the three magnificent buildings that make up this unique dining landmark.\r\n\r\nA stroll through the BLACK HORSE TAVERN today continues to conjure up images of its illustrious past. The ceiling beams in The Pub were part of the original stable in the late 1700\\'s that was the main stagecoach stop between Newark, New Jersey and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Much of the 18th century artifacts on display come from behind the walls of the Blacksmith Shop. These and other century-old antiques lend tradition and heritage to the warm atmosphere that one experiences even today in both The Pub and The Tavern.\r\n\r\nThanks to the efforts of expert restaurateurs Anthony Knapp and his son, A.J., a graduate of the Cornell School of Hotel and Restaurant Management, and a superb staff of professionals, the tradition of excellence continues. Why, there are days when, if you listen closely, you would swear you hear the stagecoach wheels rolling across the courtyard or the merry laughter of naughty prohibitioners discovering five gallon jugs hidden behind covered trap doors in the floor.Come to the Black Horse Tavern, Pub, &amp; MacKenzie\\'s - share the tradition, and the experience.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md7xkmkq5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.60206,40.77645]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blue Anchor Tavern - c1750","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/3_metro2004_0202AB.jpg\">High Street and E Broad Street, Burlington NJ.\r\nSite of the historic Blue Anchor Tavern, established 1750. This famous hostelry was used as a public house where food, drink, lodging and a place to meet and exchange ideas were available to locals, and visitors. During the Revolution, this building served both Colonial and British forces. A stage line ran from the Blue Anchor to points north. The current structure has also served guests of national fame. The Belden House, as it was later known, was a favorite lodging place for stars of the American Stage performing at the Opera House located nearby. Republicans utilized this building as a headquarters during Abraham Lincoln’s presidential political campaign. The bar within is the site of a legendary arm-wrestling match between candidate Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. Also known as The Metropolitan Inn, and Alexander’s Inn.

It began life in 1816 as a simple boarding house for summer visitors to one of America’s earliest seaside resorts. Its owner, Thomas H Hughes, called his new boarding house \"The Big House\". The local people had other ideas, though. Convinced the building was far too large to ever be a success they nicknamed it \"Tommy’s Folly\".\r\nHotel guests and the general public are welcome daily for breakfast, lunch or dinner in the two distinctive dining rooms of the Blue Pig Tavern. The Tavern is tucked in the corner of Congress Hall that fronts on Congress Place and Perry Streets. Its name derives from a gambling parlor sited in Congress Hall in the mid-1800s. Earlier still, in the 1700s, Elias Hughes operated a tavern for whalers on this site. It was the first tavern in Cape May. Each of the two dining rooms in the Blue Pig Tavern provides a different mood. One has an open, airy garden feel, with a large skylight providing dramatic views of the colonnade and Congress Hall’s historic façades. The second room is reminiscent of a cozy tavern, with dark green paneled walls, a large fireplace, natural wood floors, and comfortable banquettes. Both dining rooms serve the Congress Hall restaurant’s signature American fare – nostalgic, simple and fresh – utilizing local seafood and produce in creative, accessible ways.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md80vjio5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.925463,38.930199]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chee Burger Chee Burger - NJ","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/bestof7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/doc_14152.jpg\">251 North Ave W Westfield, NJNow this may not be the oldest operation on the circuit, but this newer franchise is taking this area by storm.

The 8-oz. burgers at Collins Pub in Morris Plains overshadow anything else on the menu in this decidedly Irish eatery, and it\\'s only partly because of the meat. Having your steak-quality burger on a toasted roll is fine, but Collins offers (and suggests) you replace the roll with an English muffin. Looking around at the packed dining area, you can see that most of the crowd has taken the suggestion. The nooks and crannies in the muffin do a better job of soaking up the flavor of your choice of toppings, which include mushrooms, onions, crisp lettuce and tomatoes. And of course there\\'s the cheese: Be specific as to what type you want; an answer of \"any kind\" will not cut it.

Panavision-wide but not gourmet-thick, they are happy lunch counter patties with a good oily smack. They are sold whole or half, topped with regular cheese (or, as the ingenuous menu advises, “a generous serving of Velveeta cheese”) or zestier jalapeno cheese, or served as a “Hickory Dickery Top” infused with smoke flavor and smothered with chopped onions and barbecue sauce. \r\n      \r\n      The Red Tops have been a family operation since 1962 when Norb Conway bought the hamburger shop he worked in and he and his wife and ten children went to work. The Conways instilled an unshakeable pride in the business that is as much a part of this restaurant’s charm as are the giant hamburgers. After all, the Red Tops aren’t really much more than fast-food hamburger shops, with waitresses in red hats and blue uniforms who deliver the check with your meal and provide the kind of quick service one expects.

Cooked in a small broiler just to the left of the bar, these burgers have been a friend to boozers for years on end.\r\n\r\nThe fat patties are served open-face on a toasted bun with onion, pickle, tomato, and lettuce resting on the roll top. This serving arrangement allows you to choose which toppings you\\'d like to dress your sandwich with, instead of making you open the roll to pick off those you don\\'t.

The burgers are served on small buns, with small squares of cheese, if desired, and with mustard and/or relish for a few cents extra. Six or eight of them make a nice meal.\r\n      \r\n      These are not hamburgers for nutritional prigs. From the counter, you can watch them cooked on a grill to the left. A golf ball-size glob of meat is placed upon the hot iron in what appears to be about a half inch of bubbling oil. It is flattened out with a spatula, becoming a sort of free-form tile of meat that is thoroughly immersed in the hot grease, then gradually moved to the left on the grill, where there is somewhat less oil, and where the cooked patties sizzle until dark. They have a nice crunch to their exterior, and because they are so thin, they have no interior. Like White Castles, but better, these little fellas, even in their buns, are two-bite sandwiches.\r\n      \r\n      Above the counter hang signs announcing the current Crabill record holder: “THE KING, Dave Woods, ate 31 burgers 2/22/01”. There is another record posted for the person who ate the most doubles, which is two burgers in a single bun. Doubles seem like a good way to go if you believe these hamburgers are just too small; but in our experience, the single burger in its spongy little bun, with a single slice of orange cheese melted from the heat, garnished with Crabill’s dark mustard, is one of the perfect foods, not to be modified in any way.

Denny\\'s Beer Barrel Pub cooked up a 123-pound behemoth this past weekend besting a record set by a New Jersey restaurant by 18 pounds. The Beer Barrel Main Event Charity Burger sells for a hefty 79 and serves about 100 people. Denny\\'s used 80 pounds beef, 160 slices of cheese and a house-baked 30-pound bun, among other things to create the meaty monstrosity. It was cooked overnight in an oven for more than six hours.

The burger, broader and thinner than the Shake Shack\\'s, gives you more salty surface area and just as much juicy beef goodness. It\\'s a burger worth going to Austin for, and the tater tots were good, too.Today, Dirty\\'s is still in the original building and location near the University of Texas campus in Austin.  The ceiling in the back dining room has been raised to accommodate four large-screen TVs and a few new menu items have been added such as the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Veggie Burger, Homemade Chili and Queso, an assortment of appetizers, Nightly dinner specials, and our wonderful Cheeseburger Salad.  Other than that, Dirty Martin\\'s is still providing the same delicious food and great service that it always has.

In 1784, at the French Arms Tavern at King and Second Streets, Congress met to deliberate naming Trenton the capital city of the nation. Trenton served only briefly as the presidential and cabinet seat for John Adams. The French Arms and later the Sign of the Golden Swan were each, for a time, Trenton’s most suitable place for large gatherings. Other popularly frequented institutions included the Rising Sun, the Indian King, the Phoenix Hotel, and the City Hotel, all on King Street (Warren Street). Today, the Trenton House (#59), the American Hotel (#60), and the Sign of the Golden Swan (#55) remain standing. A Federal style building originally built probably as a residence in 1815 served as the Golden Swan Tavern between 1826 and 1855. It then served as newspaper offices of the True American, predecessor to the Trenton Times, and is presently a custom tailor shop. At the corner of North Warren and Hanover Streets, the American Hotel, dating from 1847, has accommodated such luminaries as President James K. Polk and Daniel Webster. One of the country’s most historic hotels, the Trenton House stands across the street. The Tremont House (#7), built in 1847 at the corner of East State and Canal Streets, served travelers on the Camden and Amboy Railroad.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md82mm4zc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.76643,40.22011]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gladstone Tavern - c1847","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/Picture_17.png\">Gladstone Tavern was originally built as a farmhouse in 1847 by Andrew Rarick. He’d be happy to know that he left his mark, as his signature was discovered on a main supporting beam during our recent renovation. By the turn of the century the farmhouse became a familiar stop on the stagecoach route to Morristown; an addition was added and it opened to the public as the “Gladstone Hotel,” with a tavern on the first floor. Shortly after World War II, the hotel was purchased by the Somerset Hills Elks Club and served as their meeting place for decades. In 1971 the “Willow Tree Inn,” a tavern and rooming house, opened. A few years later the Karner Family opened “The Brass Penny.” They added a new dining room, kitchen, terrace and our beloved antique horse statue crowned “Sir Pennysworth,” that resides on our porch today. Chatfield’s opened in 1989 as a popular bar and restaurant featuring live music until closing on New Year’s Eve, 2002.

Richard Southard bought his grandfather\\'s farm in 1777. The small wooden mill supplied flour, meal and feed to the Continental Army encampment at Jockey Hollow, Morristown during the winter of 1779-80, with the barn used to store its supplies. Hence, where the grain was stored is today\\'s \"Grain House Restaurant\".\r\nIn 1929, William Childs purchased the property and converted the structure to an inn. In 1930, the structure was moved across Route 202 and meticulously restored without touching its solid frame. Remnants of its past are seen today: the William Childs Dining Room was once the machinery room; the Grain Room is the former grain storage area; the Coppertop Pub was the horse stable; and the second floor dining rooms were each a bent in the towering haymow. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md87uztm3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.540116,40.732635]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hamburger + Fries aka Burger Joint - CA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/4/22.jpg\">700 Haight St., San Francisco CA 94117 Burger Joint, a 50\\'s retro burger spot, was built on the need for a truly good hamburger; one that was free of chemicals and added hormones.

Just tell the In-N-Out Burger cashier how many meat patties and how much cheese you want and that is what you\\'ll get! For instance, if you want 6 pieces of meat and 10 pieces of cheese tell them you want a \"6-by-10.\" \"Double Meat\" = like a Double Double without cheese. \"3 by Meat\" = three meat patties and no cheese. \"Animal Style\" = the meat is cooked and fried with mustard and then pickles are added, extra spread and grilled onions are added. \"Animal Style Fries\" = fries with cheese, spread, grilled onions and pickles (if you ask for them). \"Protein Style\" = for all you low-carbohydrate dieters, this is a burger with no bun (wrapped in lettuce). \"Flying Dutchman\" = two meat patties, two slices of melted cheese and nothing else - not even a bun! Fries \"Well-Done\" = extra crispy fries . . . even better than the regular! Fries \"Light\" = opposite of fries well-done, more raw than most people like \\'em \"Grilled Cheese\" = no meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce and spread on a bun. \"Veggie Burger\" = burger without the patty or cheese.

During its early years, the hotel was known as Lambert’s Inn and served as a stagecoach stop that provided lodging to U.S. presidents including Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant, dignitaries, and business leaders traveling the main thoroughfare between New York and Philadelphia. \r\n\r\nBy the 1980’s, the Lambertville House was in serious need of repair. In 1994, a change of ownership occurred and the task of renovating the hotel finally began. By 1997, restored to its 19th-Century glory, the Lambertville House reopened.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md823b8g3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.945718,40.36561]}},{"properties":{"name":"Landmark Tavern - c1868","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/V_NYCNY_55091851_ID171343_guide_inclusion.jpg\">626 11th Ave, New York, NYThe Landmark is so far on the west side of Manhattan Island that is used to be on the waterfront before 12th Avenue was built on landfill (link to the Landmark Tavern). The Landmark dates from 1868 and looks the part. The bar itself was carved in 1839 from a single mahogany tree; the front door is the original speakeasy door. History at the Landmark is dyed into the wood. Legend accounts at least three ghosts on the premises. One is an Irish girl who arrived starving during the Great Hunger, only to die on the third floor of the Landmark when that floor was designated as a flophouse. Another ghostly presence is attributed to a Confederate soldier who was mortally wounded in a bar fight and died in a bathtub on the second floor. In its speakeasy days the Landmark was frequented by George Raft, the gangster/actor who grew up in New York\\'s Hell\\'s Kitchen. More recently, the Landmark was featured regularly in episodes of \"Spin City\" (in at least one drinking game related to watching \"Spin City\" you\\'re supposed to quaff when the Landmark is shown). \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md81lidxc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.996426,40.763214]}},{"properties":{"name":"Linwood Inn - NJ","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 19 S Wood Ave, Linden, NJFrom Newark Star Ledger - 2006 Munchmobile article:\r\n\r\nYosh\\'s Linwood Inn is a cheery, NASCAR flag-festooned hangout.

When he passed away in 1769, Judge Leonard\\'s elegant town residence became a hostelry, called by its new owner \"College Inn\". The first proprietor was Christopher Beekman, whose natural talent as an Innkeeper soon developed the establishment into the center of the town\\'s life. \r\n\r\n \r\nWine and argument flowed freely in Christopher Beekman\\'s taproom, or drinking room, where his wife helped tend the punchbowls. During these parlous times, students and townsmen drank eagerly of the news and opinions of honored guests such as Paul Revere, Robert Morris, and Thomas Paine, who stayed the night more than once at the hospitable public house.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the Committee of Safety met at College Inn, and a few weeks later, delegates were stopping overnight on their way to the first Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Signers of the Declaration of Independence, passing through Princeton in 1776, rested at College Inn. \r\n\r\nAs the war began, military men took the place of travelers. Officers of the Continental Army, also the British and Hessians (depending upon which side was in possession of the town), whiled away their time in the taproom. Months later the Battle of Yorktown and the signing of the Peace Treaty were properly celebrated over College Inn punchbowls. When the Continental Congress met in Princeton in 1783, the national celebrities of the day were guests of the Inn, which were just a few steps from the historic session in Nassau Hall. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md8819oo9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.660855,40.3495]}},{"properties":{"name":"Newark, NJ - Krug's Tavern (Down Neck)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Newark, NJShrimp platter is best anywhere.

During the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778, Englishtown was the headquarters for the American Army. The Village Inn  (pictured here),  which was built in 1726, was headquarters for General Charles Lee who commanded the army of nearly 5,000 men. In the dining room of this inn, General Washington and Lord Stirling drew up the court martial papers citing Lee for his conduct during and after the battle. The inn served as a stage-coach stop offering food and lodging to the weary travelers between the cities of New York and Philadelphia. In later years it was renowned for it\\'s excellent cuisine. \r\n\r\nThe night after the battle General Washington and his officers were invited to the home of Moses Laird to partake of a special \"collation\" prepared by his wife and daughters. This house is now the Hulse Memorial Home, Main Street, which was built by Moses Laird as a two room tavern before the revolution.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 one of the Monmouth County\\'s main roads ran from Monmouth Court House, now Freehold, to Englishtown and on into Middlesex County. Because Englishtown was on a main highway it became a trading center for the surrounding country side.

In actuality, Thomas made it back to the Chelsea Hotel and finally expired days later at St. Vincent\\'s Hospital, so it\\'s not unlikely that his last words were considerably less memorable (perhaps the final utterances were complaints about the cut and style of his hospital gown). Nonetheless, Thomas, who frequented the White Horse Tavern when he was in town on poetry-reading tours late in his life, left an enduring mark. Established in 1880, the White Horse is sometimes called the second-oldest bar in New York. It has slick black painted beams and is broken up in to a number of small rooms, like a British pub. In nice weather a hamburger at an outside table along scenic Hudson Street can make for a nice lunch. \r\n\r\n   Drawn to the Dylan Thomas legacy, the White Horse was the place to be for beat poets. Bob Dylan       frequented in the early 1960s, followed by others including John Belushi. Belushi\\'s SNL partner, Dan   Akroyd, is said to have visited the White Horse at closing time after Belushi\\'s death. He had the doors closed and bought the house a round.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md85ep8wr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006116,40.735549]}},{"properties":{"name":"White Mana - NJ","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/20060518whitemanna_thumb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/254962686_71083fe790.jpg\">358 River Street, Hackensack, NJWhat hasn\\'t been said.

Since that time it has served as a pub, a polling place, a pool room, a package store, a political forum, a speakeasy, a hotel and a restaurant. In 1893 a man named Willie Howard came to Gladstone with Charles Pfizer and served as huntsman for the Essex Hunt. In 1898 Willie and his wife, Bertha, upon Willie’s retirement, purchased the Bedminster Hotel, as it was called, for ,000. The hotel was renamed the \"Howard Hotel\" and in 1912 the first indoor plumbing was installed. The name was later changed to Willie\\'s Tavern....where you can still grab a sandwich and a pint today! It is even noted that one of Pfizer’s favorite horses, named after his daughter, was buried behind the hotel.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68md899zbq8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.64506,40.68139]}},{"properties":{"name":"XXX Rootbeer - WA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\" href=\"http://blog.t3consortium.com\">Veehikle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/05/2/xxx_drive_in.jpg\">98 N.E.
