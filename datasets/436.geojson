Power Plant emissions from all power plants in North Korea were obtained by CARMA for the past (2000 Annual Report), the present (2007 data), and the future. CARMA determine data presented for the future to reflect planned plant construction, expansion, and retirement. The dataset provides the name, company, parent company, city, state, zip, county, metro area, lat/lon, and plant id for each individual power plant. The dataset reports for the three time periods:\n\nIntensity: Pounds of CO2 emitted per megawatt-hour of electricity produced.\n\nEnergy: Annual megawatt-hours of electricity produced.\n\nCarbon: Annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The units are short or U.S. tons. Multiply by 0.907 to get metric tons.\n\nCarbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA) is a massive database containing information on the carbon emissions of over 50,000 power plants and 4,000 power companies worldwide. Power generation accounts for 40% of all carbon emissions in the United States and about one-quarter of global emissions. CARMA is the first global inventory of a major, sector of the economy.\n\nThe objective of CARMA.org is to equip individuals with the information they need to forge a cleaner, low-carbon future. By providing complete information for both clean and dirty power producers, CARMA hopes to influence the opinions and decisions of consumers, investors, shareholders, managers, workers, activists, and policymakers. CARMA builds on experience with public information disclosure techniques that have proven successful in reducing traditional pollutants.\n\nPlease see carma.org for more information","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"carbon_2007":{"max":1598595,"mean":140324.108917647,"variance":160969004958.98,"stdev":401209.427804208,"min":0,"median":0},"latitude":{"max":42.34278,"mean":40.5000670588235,"variance":1.64760699658456,"stdev":1.28359144457439,"min":38.94,"median":40.45806},"energy_2000":{"max":2487462,"mean":463622.053082353,"variance":379141744214.498,"stdev":615744.869417926,"min":20774.5195,"median":224874.5},"carbon_2000":{"max":1337133,"mean":115022.858335294,"variance":112177327850.29,"stdev":334928.839979913,"min":0,"median":0},"carbon_nextdecade":{"max":1598595,"mean":140324.108917647,"variance":160969004958.98,"stdev":401209.427804208,"min":0,"median":0},"intensity_2007":{"max":3673.7339,"mean":556.405058823529,"variance":1114186.61670429,"stdev":1055.55038567767,"min":0,"median":0},"plant_id":{"max":50065,"mean":29663.4705882353,"variance":309927102.389706,"stdev":17604.746586921,"min":1468,"median":36243},"longitude":{"max":130.3956,"mean":127.694494117647,"variance":3.98111105308825,"stdev":1.9952721751902,"min":124.9039,"median":127.4183},"intensity_nextdecade":{"max":3673.7339,"mean":556.405058823529,"variance":1114186.61670429,"stdev":1055.55038567767,"min":0,"median":0},"energy_2007":{"max":2478351,"mean":541512.180264706,"variance":421977201974.262,"stdev":649597.723190485,"min":25824.9707,"median":289442.3125},"energy_nextdecade":{"max":2478351,"mean":541512.180264706,"variance":421977201974.262,"stdev":649597.723190485,"min":25824.9707,"median":289442.3125},"intensity_2000":{"max":1943.353,"mean":398.874358823529,"variance":485860.928684914,"stdev":697.037250571957,"min":0,"median":0}},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"ANBYON YOUTH","carbon_2007":0,"latitude":39.0425,"energy_2000":1107974,"country":"North Korea","parentcomp_id":"","carbon_2000":0,"carbon_nextdecade":0,"intensity_2007":0,"company_id":"MINISTRY ELEC &amp;
