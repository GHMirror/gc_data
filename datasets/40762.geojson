I had my camping stove but did not take gas on the aircraft so I needed to stock up.\n\nIf you use the other kind of gas cylinder (Coleman etc) you will need to come prepared with an adaptor so your stove will take French Camping Gaz cartridges, the French are very patriotic so they don\\'t have those foreign types, but the French Camping Gaz stoves are no good for lightweight camping. French campers all travel by Renault Espace and carry massive amounts of culinary and sporting equipment, they don\\'t transport things by bicycle.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a638x72vlbzg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.44661,43.60825]}},{"properties":{"name":"End of the riverside path","description":"Posted by ChrisrustThe path is blocked by the bridge, turn down to your left on to the road that circles round under the main road.

The queus for the ticket office were impossibly long and there were two SNCF self-service ticket machines with relatively short queues but the machines appeared to be do slow and difficult to use that people were taking up to ten minutes each to buy a ticket.\nBut I found a secret weapon, a ticket machine operated by the TER regional railways close to the access to the platforms. This worked very well, but I advise you to hang around for a few minutes and watch a local operating it first as there is a quirky rotating dial to operate the menus. Once you have the idea, it\\'s easy, even with my minimal French language I was able to use it and buy a ticket with my UK debit card.\nThe only problem after that is, when you find which platform your train goes from, you discover that information services are very badly run, there are electronic signs which seem to tell you what you want to know but the reality is that people mill around and rush from one empty train to another with confused station staff and even the train driver not knowing which train is going to depart. But there is good cycle space on the TER trains and the modern little ones that go into the mountains are comfortable with low floor access (Other French trains are designed for mountaineers who like very steep steps)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
