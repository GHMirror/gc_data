The little kids\\' area is fenced and only has one exit, which has a nice table strategically situated right in front of it, where you can sit and work and stand guard at the same time. The larger park also has only one exit to watch, really. There is a back exit, but it\\'s far away from the playground equipment and not very appealing to the kids. There\\'s a good climbing structure, and water play in the summer. There are almost always kids here, even very early in the morning. \n\nAnother great thing about this park is that dogs are allowed and tolerated off leash when the park isn\\'t crowded. There are poop-pick-up bags in the park and an area where you can throw a ball or stick.\n\nGreat park, great internet connection.\n\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67hakki54lx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.130407,42.395715]}},{"properties":{"name":"Central Hill Playground","description":"Posted by Micropopetah<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 81 Highland Ave, Somerville, MA<a href=\"http://www.ci.somerville.ma.us/Maps.cfm?page=24\">City of Somerville website</a>:Central Hill Playground is in front of Somerville High School, at 81 Highland Ave, next to the Somerville Library.
