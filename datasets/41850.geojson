Others would walk in and out of its brightly painted rooms to party and socialize, exchange ideas, create art, or seek temporary lodging. Writers Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes lived at the house in the summer of 1926.\n\n267 House became known as the center for a younger generation of artists and writers who revolted against aesthetics and ideas put forth by the so-called \"Talented Tenth.\" This older group, which included seminal figures like W.E.B. Du Bois, supported the use of art as propaganda and steered clear from any aesthetics, forms, and manners that might jeopardize a \"dignified\" image of African Americans.\n\nRejecting Du Bois\\' views as elitist, residents and visitors at 267 House wanted to create art for art\\'s sake. Hurston, who had coined the term \"Niggerati\" for the Talented Tenth, playfully called 267 House \"Niggerati Manor.\"\n\nIn this creative and rambunctious environment, Thurman, Hurston, Hughes, Nugent, artist Aaron Douglas, and writer Gwendolyn Bennett discussed the need for an avant-garde literary magazine that is not tied to sociopolitical motivations.

Among its founders were a group of wealthy Ethiopian traders who refused to accept the segregation policies of other New York churches of the day. (The name \"Abyssinian\" is a reference to ancient Ethiopia.) \n\nIn 1908, Rev. Dr. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr. became pastor of the church. His charismatic preaching style mesmerized the congregation and drew many new members. In 1922, the congregation moved to Harlem, in a newly constructed Neo-Gothic style church.\n\nRev. Powell was a fervent proponent of civil rights, and an active participant in the National Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He worked aggressively to improve social conditions for African Americans, and established the church as both a religious and social center for the community. Under his Depression-era leadership, the Abyssinian fed thousands of Harlem\\'s poor residents.\n\nOther notable preachers at the Abyssinian included the father of musician Fats Waller (with the young Waller himself playing piano at the church) and Rev. Adam Powell, Jr. who eventually succeeded his father as pastor.\n\n\n\t \t \t \t \t \t \n \t \t \t \t \t \t <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x7x54tyo3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.940738,40.816421]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a>239 West 136th Street, NY, NYThe Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first major African-American labor union, was founded by A.

Not only was it one of the first New York City playhouses to welcome integrated audiences, but its stage was among the first to showcase sophisticated performances by African-American actors.\n\nThe 2,000-seat theater, dubbed \"House Beautiful\" by its fans, was home to Harlem\\'s first professional stock company, the Lafayette Players. This acting troupe had been attached to the Lafayette since 1916. It cast black actors in serious dramatic roles—many of them written for white actors by white authors.\n\nStandout Harlem thinkers such as W. E. B. Du Bois rebuked the players for failing to promote the work of black authors. Yet the set-up allowed serious black actors such as Evelyn Preer, Charles Gilpin, and Paul Robeson to transcend the stereotyped or comedic roles to which they had once been relegated. The Lafayette stage also put the public spotlight on such beloved performers as blues singer Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington and his orchestra, and the legendary tap dancer Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson.\n\nIn 1923, new management transformed the Lafayette into a lively community nightspot. For the next decade or so, the Friday night late show was a hallowed neighborhood tradition: From midnight until four in the morning, first-rate professionals shared the stage with audience members brave enough to get up and deliver impromptu performances.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x7wsywhdn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.945093,40.813029]}},{"properties":{"name":"Liberty Hall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/exploring/harlem/images/places/libertyhall_full.jpg\">180 W. 135th Street, New york, New YorkLiberty Hall housed the headquarters for the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), an organization dedicated to promoting self-reliance among African Americans.

The tracks she laid down there began to sell rapidly in stores, grabbing the attention of company founder Harry Pace. In 1921 he sent Waters out on tour with Pace recording manager Fletcher Henderson to promote Black Swan—Pace\\'s new label showcasing the talents of African-American singers and musicians. Black composer William Grant Still was hired to be the music director of the new label; in fact, all employees at Black Swan were African American.\n\nThe name \"Black Swan\" had originally applied to Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, an African-American concert singer popular in the 19th century. Every Black Swan record bore a circular sticker trumpeting the label as \"The Only Genuine Colored Record—Others Are Only Passing for Colored.\" Apparently \"genuine\" had its limits: The label rejected some musicians—including Bessie Smith, the \"Empress of the Blues\"—as \"too colored.\"\n\nBlack Swan had been created with the avowed purpose of advancing the African-American race. Its board of directors, which included scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, decreed that no record it issued could subvert this mission—not even from the Empress of the Blues. Despite robust sales of Ethel Waters records, the board grew leery of blues records; it began to seek out more \"elevated\" forms of music.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x7x562nb3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.943896,40.81804]}},{"properties":{"name":"Renaissance Casino and Ballroom","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/exploring/harlem/images/places/renaissance_full.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 150 W. 138th Street, New York, NYBuilt in 1924, the Renaissance Casino and Ballroom was one of the only upscale reception halls in New York available for events sponsored by African Americans. Thus, it earned the distinction of hosting the first awards ceremony for The Crisis (a publication edited by W. E. B. Du Bois).\n\nThe Renaissance Casino and Ballroom entertained patrons with such varied diversions as cabaret acts, concerts, and gambling. On the second story, couples danced the Lindy Hop, Black Bottom, and Charleston to the sounds of Chick Webb\\'s and Fletcher Henderson\\'s orchestras.

During the Harlem Renaissance, aspiring performers such as Ethel Waters, Fletcher Henderson, and Eubie Blake were rumored to have visited the Tree of Hope.\n\nWhen the tree was cut down in 1934 during the expansion of 7th Avenue, it was cut into logs and sold as souvenirs. One section was salvaged and found a home at the Apollo Theater, where today\\'s amateur performers continue to rub the trunk in the tradition of their predecessors.\n\nIn 1941, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson joined New York Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia in a formal ceremony to rededicate the stump of the original tree.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x7x43dqrc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.945048,40.812705]}},{"properties":{"name":"YMCA","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/exploring/harlem/images/places/ymca_full.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 180 W. 135th Street, New york, New YorkBanned from white YMCAs, African Americans were encouraged to form separate branches. The 135th Street branch of the YMCA became a major cultural center that offered a variety of services and resources to Harlem\\'s black residents. It was an outreach organization for black men, a hotel, a theater venue, a lecture hall, and a gathering place for Harlem literati. It also was the home of murals created by the acclaimed artist Aaron Douglas.\n\nAs a hotel, the \"Y\" provided temporary housing for black visitors who were not allowed in segregated New York hotels. Some of its short-term residents included acclaimed writers Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison, Claude McKay, and James Baldwin.\n\nWith such lively visitors, it is not surprising that the YMCA became a venue for many writers and artists to exchange ideas and share works. Patrons of the Y were treated to fascinating lectures by intellectuals such as Professor John Dewey of Columbia University, as well as plays performed by groups like W.E.B. Du Bois\\' Krigwa players.\n\nOne of actor Paul Robeson\\'s performances at the Y, in Simon the Cyrenian, sent members of Provincetown Playhouse running backstage to offer him the lead in Emperor Jones, which became one of his signature roles.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69x7wv7dn9v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.943094,40.814908]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/1807","metadata":null,"contact_name":"tracy_the_astonishing","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:tracy_the_astonishing","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/1807","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":18,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=1807,platial:user=tracy_the_astonishing","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41850}
