The village elders have welcomed the help of Plant With Purpose to replenish the soil that has been depleted and to develop alternative ways of creating income so that they don’t have to cut down more of their trees. Plant With Purpose has teamed up with the community to start a nursery where villagers grow seedlings, fruit trees, and other plant to replenish the sparse forests and provide income. Plant With Purpose has also set up a solar drier to help them turn their oregano into a storable, marketable good. In addition to the nursery and solar driers, Plant With Purpose offers workshops to teach sustainable farming methods and other ways to conserve the land. Give now and help the farmers of El Café restore their land, boost their income, and transform their lives.

But deforestation has led to soil erosion and diminished coffee yields as well as leaving less fodder for pigs and cattle to eat. As the community grows, unsustainable farming practices threaten productivity and the very well being of the community. With increasing soil erosion leading to infertile, unproductive land, the village is in critical need of Plant With Purpose’s sustainable agriculture training and environmentally friendly, income generating projects. By supporting Plant With Purpose in La Joya, you will be empowering farmers to apply soil conservation techniques that replenish and restore their land. Additionally you will be providing families with low interest loans to invest in sustainable businesses and overcome poverty. Through Plant With Purpose community groups, families and neighbors will strengthen their relationships, pool their resources, and learn new ways to provide for the families, protect their land, and transform their lives. Don’t miss your chance to be a part of the amazing transformation taking place in the hearts and lives of the people of La Joya.

This small community of about 300 people is very poor and, like most of the villages where Plant With Purpose works in the Dominican Republic, the poor live in the valley but walk several kilometers to farm the steep hillsides surrounding the town.

Desperate farmers have cut down large areas of forested land, clearing it for farming and/or to sell the cut trees as fuel wood. The La Yautia region has been especially affected by severe deforestation and devastating floods, most recently as a result of tropical storm Noel. Farmers lost their entire harvest and parents lost their children to the floods. The people of La Yautia are wonderful, skilled people who have become trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and deforestation from which they see little hope of escape. Plant With Purpose works in this devastated region to teach farmers to work with, not against, the land. By fostering environmental restoration, economic opportunity, and spiritual renewal, Plant With Purpose empowers rural farmers to transform their lives. There is both tremendous need and also an openness and desire on the part of the local community to partner with Plant With Purpose to bring about positive change in the community. Help the people of La Yautia restore their land, overcome poverty, and improve their lives.

When the plantation owner left, the farmers fought to stay on their land. Today, the people of Los Arroyones struggle to survive on the now desolate plains that they fought so hard to keep. Plant With Purpose empowers these desperate farmers to get the most out of their land. By teaching sustainable agriculture techniques and providing access to credit, Plant With Purpose is helping the community come together to overcome poverty.

Through Plant With Purpose’s training, many farmers are starting to understand that “slashing and burning” the forest for cropland will not work in the long-term. As problems with deforestation and erosion worsen, the river gets choked with the soil and sediment that washes off the hillsides. Plant With Purpose’s work helps keep the waters clean and the community healthy and vibrant. Plant With Purpose does this by providing alternatives. In the middle of some of these cleared areas are large plots of forest and fruit trees that have been planted by the local community with the help and encouragement of Plant With Purpose. Tender seedlings planted in the new community nursery ensure that the rich valley of Zumbador will stay lush and green and the river will continue to flow with life-giving water.
