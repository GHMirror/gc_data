He likes to get inside of a cardboard box with handle-holes in the sides and peer out until a hapless person walks by close enough. Then he reaches out his lightning paw, with claws out, and grabs your leg.\n\nAbout a year later, my roommate Tali and I were splitting up and leaving France for a while, so we needed to find a new home for Booger. Tali took Booger in a cardboard box to Shakespeare and Co. and sat outside looking for a nice person to adopt him. \n\nShe tried to convince the actress who played Sue Ellen on Dallas, who was hanging out there that day, to adopt Booger, but in the end George took pity on the cat and let him stay there in the store.\n\nBooger loves living at Shakespeare and Company, and I think he also likes the fame and attention which goes along with being the housecat of one of the most famouse bookstores on the planet.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9glcv7z4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.346944,48.852687]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bookstore 3 / Harry Strikes Back, Desert Dog","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/bookstore_3_pic.jpg\">Melbourne, Australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gju3ylk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.960006,-37.810001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brandon Haithcox","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gmz2ce6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.81567,35.81113]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bye and Bye is a great place to talk to strangers","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/3/image_upload_397_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nightlife_verD.gif\"> I love to sit in the back courtyard.

But if you\\'ve got ,500 and the five-year waiting list doesn\\'t scare you off, you can join Mickey Mouse\\'s ultra-exclusive club, the secret spot where the Magic Kingdom welcomes real kings.\n\nSomewhere near Pirates of the Caribbean, in the heart of New Orleans Square, is the hidden doorbell to Club 33, a members-only restaurant reminiscent of a Prohibition-era speakeasy. Here, Elton John might come in and tickle the keys of an antique harpsichord. Since its opening, Club 33 has reportedly welcomed King Hussein of Jordan, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco, President Reagan, Cher and Michael Jackson.\n\nWhen Walt Disney made plans for the club in the early 1960s, he intended Club 33 to entertain corporate sponsors and address special adults-only events. Decorated in a 19th century French style, it remains the only place in the park where you can sip a single-malt scotch with your meal.\n\nClub 33\\'s kitchen was supposed to be shared by a secret apartment for the Disney family, but Walt passed away in 1965, two years before the hideaway was completed.\n\nNowadays, the list of 450 paying members is strictly confidential, although each member gets fancy matchbooks inscribed with his or her name, consider it the most expensive souvenir that you won\\'t see at a Disney gift shop.

They had lunch together and became a well-known pair.\n\nAfter many years, the shepherd died and was buried in the churchyard. A few days later, Bobby showed up at the inn, and ate his regular lunch of bone. When the innkeeper followed the little terrier they ended up at the churchyard where Jock was buried, and Bobby laid on the grave of his late master. Bobby kept their routine and stayed by his master’s grave until his own death 14 years later.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gfuc3ft"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.1914,55.947085]}},{"properties":{"name":"Groucho!","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/05/0/grouchooo.jpg\">03070 thornton road new boston new hampshireHe\\'s so KYOOT!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9ghs7k92"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.723969,42.988129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Haggai Yedidya","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9g823gmu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.18753,36.13787]}},{"properties":{"name":"Halo 2 - The story of lil Johnny","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/2_8_.jpg\">Dubuque, Iowa\n\nThis is the tragic tale of what happens when people play too much Halo 2.

a cat I used to have when I was a kid. \n\nThis is from the site:\n\nKiisu (aka Kiisu Miisu -- Kiisu simply means \"kitten\" in Estonian) is the senior cat at SwallowHill. Born probably about mid-June 1998 she is now (summer 2005) 7 years old. Indeed she is probably a year younger than Cleo. Nonetheless, she is the senior cat because she arrived here first and she trained both us and the dogs about how to live with cats and how wonderful they are. In the case of the dogs the education took about 3 months. In the beginning, the dogs considered her prey to be chased up trees or under chesterfields -- but eventually they learned and we learned too. I (Rod) always thought that cats were elegant, aloof strangers who would suavely stab you in the back while wearing elbow-length velvet gloves. Wrong wrong wrong! They are sweethearts. But what did I know? I had to be taught. You have to honour your teacher -- and I do.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gkdrgx6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.159485,43.955259]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kona Kitties live here","description":"Posted by LollyKailua Kona, Hawaii<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gn4h3zw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.983056,19.639722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Laika, First Animal in Space","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://www.daviddarling.info/images/Laika.jpg\">moscow, RussiaLaika (from the Russian word for \"Barker\") was one of the Russian space dogs and the first living creature to enter orbit. She was launched into space on Sputnik 2, a Soviet spacecraft, on November 3, 1957. Like many other animals in space, she died during the mission, though earlier than intended.\n\nShe was found as a stray wandering the streets of Moscow, a mongrel female weighing approximately 6 kg (13 lb) and about 3 years old. \"Laika\" is in fact the Russian name for several breeds of dogs similar to the husky. Her name was changed from Kudryavka (Russian for \"Little Curly\"), and she was also nicknamed Zhuchka (\"Little Bug\") and Limonchik (\"Little Lemon\"). The American press dubbed her Muttnik (mutt + suffix \"-nik\") and some animal rights activists at the time called her Curly. Her true ancestry can never be known, although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part terrier.\n\nLaika died a few hours after launch from stress and overheating. Her true cause of death was not made public until decades after the flight, with officials stating that she was either euthanized by poisoned food or died when the oxygen ran out. Some former Soviet scientists have since expressed regret for allowing Laika to die.\nAlthough Laika did not survive the trip, the experiment proved that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure weightlessness. It paved the way for human spaceflight, and provided scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9geyz2fm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.649889,55.75354]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mac &amp; Tosh","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/08/4/macquilt2.jpg\">simpsonville SCMac &amp; Tosh<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9g89xzzm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.2556,34.73833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Marcus Behling","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gfdzs8q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.66751,33.85901]}},{"properties":{"name":"Matthew Miller","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gi6q5zc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.83887,36.78949]}},{"properties":{"name":"Me","description":"Posted by Lollyijmuiden<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gc9t1ru"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.6,52.466667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Melissa Stavros","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9g7y0437"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.3822,47.5376]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mimosa Paint Your Own Pottery","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/3/image_upload_440_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 1718 Ne Alberta St, Portland, OR<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gbij8py"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.647577,45.559088]}},{"properties":{"name":"Minneapolis Audition Medley","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9glumqd2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.19977,44.92981]}},{"properties":{"name":"Minx &amp; Topaz","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Kittens_Dec03_02resize.jpg\">ne34 7jl<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gakrmrn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.43886,54.974735]}},{"properties":{"name":"Missing Bones on the Indiana Jones Ride","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/images/hand/hand.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Hollywood Boulevard, Orlando, FLOn the Indiana Jones attraction many of the skeletons no longer have any fingers.

It was his nature not to burden others and he stayed in a hovel. While he lay dying, a dog from a nearby villa found Saint Roch and brought a fresh roll from his master\\'s house each day. The dog\\'s owner noticed this strange behavior and his curiosity led him to Rochus. Touched by the sick man and his condition, the dog\\'s owner befriended him and Saint Roch recovered.\n\nBack in France there was a civil war. Saint Roch left for home and the dog went with him. The turbulence of war led him to be accused to spying. Saint Roch refused to identify himself as royalty and was thrown in prison along with his dog. He spent time praying and helping fellow prisoners until he died five years later. At his death a document in his possession and the distinctive birthmark revealed his true identity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9ghrk8m0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.501068,41.874929]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sammy Neighbors","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gbtxvq8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.37021,36.50812]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sarah Krueger","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9ggo2y4v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.50101,44.81886]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sat 15 April.

though he\\'s generally known as Mister B.\n\nFrom his humble beginnings as a barn cat, Mr. B has quickly won the hearts of staff and customers alike with his larger than life personality.\n\nHe\\'s very social and enjoys meeting anyone who pays him compliments, offers to stroke him, or sits down to look at a book. Naturally he\\'s also a great fan of napping - taking to his avocation with relish in the front windows, in his basket, and even on the computer. He\\'s also quite curious and loves to get into shopping bags and baby strollers.\n\nBe sure to say hello to him when you stop in - and ask him about his infamous trip to Rutland.\n\nIf you\\'d like a memento of your visit, he sells his own bookmark - created by Mimi. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9ggiqyoe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.517918,43.625139]}},{"properties":{"name":"Space Oddity by 47Sims","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/Space_Oddity_b.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gbn6i9v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.876104,41.193268]}},{"properties":{"name":"Splash Mountain aka Flash Mountain","description":"Posted by LollyThe Magic KingdomThe most outrageous behavior happens on Splash Mountain. There is a drop on the ride where a camera takes a souvenir picture of the riders. After the ride the pictures are quickly developed and riders can go claim their picture.\n\nIt seems that many Disneyland guests want to flash the camera for a fun photo. Women flash their breasts and both sexes moon the camera. Disneyland has strict rules against this type of behavior so these pictures are deleted and never developed. At least that is what guests that misbehave are told.\n\nThe camera system is on a 35 second time delay so any picture that contain objectionable poses can be deleted. The funny thing here is, it seems that while guests are told the photos were deleted some naughty Cast Members have secretly developed some of these pictures.\n\nThere is a web site devoted to the posting of these x-rated photos. \n\nIf a guest happens to be seated with someone else who poses inappropriately noone gets a picture. If this happens, the non-offending guest can tell the CM. The CM will escort the guest back to the head of the line to ride again so they are able to obtain a souvenir picture.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gmw4dry"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.585095,28.420316]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spooky","description":"Posted by LollyBuffalo New York<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9glh7u0x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.87838,42.88539]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stephen Horst","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gid79ix"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.98743,40.70042]}},{"properties":{"name":"Steven Red Theon","description":"Posted by Lolly<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gcxbtep"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.37671,47.67833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Strange Company HQ","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/3/control_room7_s.jpg\">Edinburgh, Scotland<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9ggmyueq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.18753,55.950152]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sun 23 Apr, Arctic Monkeys","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:DQNQIgilB3ZR8M:www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/Lookup/thecoralx25x04x05xrev/%24file/thecoralx25x04x05xrev.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Empress Ballroom &amp;

The Updates were usually shorter editions, to quickly give each other the latest news in between the \"regular\" editions of our Video Letters. That said, this update had a total running time of almost 13 hours when it was all done. So much for being short!\nI had recently acquired my first Playstation 2 and wanted to show it off, since Jason is as big a video game freak as I am and I knew he would enjoy a look at my new toy in action. So this intro is comprised almost entirely of clips from the various PS2 games I showed him in the video letter - Red Faction, Onimusha: Warlords, ATV Offroad Fury and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\nI still didn\\'t have a computer that I could do editing with, so this one was edited entirely tape-to-tape. Fortunately, Digital8 gives you frame accurate timecode, so I was able to use the timecode as a guide for syncing up the music with key points in the video. The machine-gun editing clips were a pain to do with this editing method, but I think they turned out pretty good. This really shows you just HOW precisely you can edit with a Digital8 camcorder if you have no other options!\nThe titles were done with DeluxePaint IV on my Amiga 2000. This will give you some idea of how behind the times I was - this video was originally made in 2002. And I was still using my Amiga 2000 as my main computer! A little later that year, I got an old P3 that became my main system.\nI managed to dig up the original footage and just finished a nicely remastered version (which is the version presented here), redoing the audio digitally as well. Previously, the audio was all mixed together in analog with my audio mixer. This version sounds much cleaner. The music is a rocking instrumental techno piece by Lunatic Calm from the Mortal Kombat: Annihilation soundtrack.\nI also have a \"Making Of\" video about how I put this together, elsewhere on my YouTube page.\n\nAdded to YouTube on March 20, 2006, 05:16 AM by Zaranyzerak\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66f9gdntsz4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.351703,48.427492]}},{"properties":{"name":"We had a nice meal in Florence","description":"Posted by Lolly<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Can\\'t remember the exact name of the restuarant.
