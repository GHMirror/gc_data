I was always good at talking my way out of things. I had already told myself to just starting drinking juice for breakfast, and a light lunch, and then after dinner it would all come up. I had my plan, and I knew that it was going to work. I knew that the nuns would be keeping a close eye on me, so I had to be sure to keep things low key. So I went to Walmart and picked up a sand pale bucket, and placed it under my bed. Every night I would purge into the bucket, and then I would wait till the morning. I would put the bucket in my shower caddy and wrapped the towel over the top. I would go into the shower and water down my vomit before putting it down the drain.”\r\n\r\nKellie was doing well with the trick. No one was suspected anything about Kellie. She had gained about five pounds on purpose to make it look like she was following orders. Every Tuesday and Thursday she would go to see her psychologist and talk like there was no end of the day. The doctor there put her some medications that were supposed to help with her chemical imbalances and stress related problems.\r\n\r\nShe said, “That is always the doctors to everything, put the loony on medicine so the patient won’t feel a thing. Its not that I didn’t enjoy sitting around for four hours a week talking about myself, but everything that I was saying was a complaint lie, and this guy had no idea.”\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6piduo3b7i1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.911143,43.052531]}},{"properties":{"name":"A trip to a Milwaukee Hospital","description":"Posted by Ddobosz<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> 9200 West Wisconsin Avenue Milwaukee WiAfter the Holiday season had passed, Kellie returned back to school. Her parents had been keeping a close eye on her all through the holiday season. Even though she didn’t eat much, she didn’t seem to making as many “noticeable” trips to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n Kellies said, “I was learning the tricks of the trade. I would play the waiting game. Once my parents were gone and dinner was over for sure, I would then go to the bathroom when nobody was looking and ride myself of what I had just eaten. I remember after Christmas dinner I could not find a place to do my business. So I told my mother that I was hot from all the cooking that had been going on. I claimed to want to go outside and cool off. This seemed innocent enough to my mother, so I went on my way. I remember I snuck around to the side of my house where there were no windows. I crawled back in by a bush and got down on my knees. I stuck my middle and index finger way down my throat and just started purging up garlic potatoes, sweetened carrots, rolls, and the other dinner foods. This took about a good ten minutes. I picked a leaf up off the ground and wiped my face off before returning back inside of the house. I entered the house full of joy and excitement ready to open the family gifts.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “My mother and father took my back to school thinking and hoping that what they had noticed of Thanksgiving break was just a phase, and I was starting to outgrow it. Now that I look back on it, I know that just like me, neither of them wanted to comfort the issue of my eating disorder. I got out of the car, and head straight to my room of isolation. I was thinking that it was good to be back because now I would not have to worry about being so discreet about my diet.”\r\n\r\nClass soon got started, and so did the dinner times. Nuns were sure to go to Kellie’s room and bring her straight to eat. When she chose to go to Mount Mary, she had to sign a contract. This was a very strict school. If she were caught disobeying any of the rules, then she would be out of the school. One of those rules was to eat your food and to keep it down. Kellie knew as well as some of the facility that she was not up holding her contract to the highest standard. Since the nuns had no real evidence to uphold Kellie to, they were just going to do there best with watching her with the closest of eye. \r\n\r\nAbout two weeks into the second semester while sitting at dinner Kellie became very dizzy and could see straight. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “At this point I was keeping nothing down me, and I was only eating the very minimal that I could. I was sure to drink lots of water, but I was done to 85 pounds at this point. As gross as this sounds, I was not longer just purging the food that I had just eaten, but rather what looked to be my insides. The vomit was a pale yellow and greenish color. It also just didn’t taste the same.”\r\n\r\nKellie started to roll backward off of the cafeteria table and fall onto the floor. She had blacked out. She was told that she was taken straight the emergency room at Milwaukee hospital. When the doctors had heard everything that was going on, and they took a look at her skin and saw her bones coming out it, they knew to diagnose Kellie with Bulimia. Kellie was unconscious for along time, and when she awoke she looked over at her left side, and saw all of the IV’s that she was hooked up too. She was scared, but still had no idea why she was in the hospital. \r\n\r\nShe laid in her bed and stared at the IV in her arm, and noticed that all she could see on her arm was pale colored flesh. There was no fat surrounding her arm or to give her that extra look of healthiness. She was in a room that contained another older women. Kellie looked over at the woman who was just lying in her sleeping. The women was a large older women, and Kellie couldn’t help but think to herself that even when people get older they are still chucky and don’t want to do anything about it. Kellie turned her head and stared up at the ceiling. She could not put two and two together on how and why she was in the hospital.\r\n\r\nA nurse entered the room and gave Kellie a menu and told her what number to call and order herself a lunch. The nurse also told Kellie that the cooks had a menu of what she was and wasn’t aloud to order. \r\n\r\nKellie picked up the phone and called the cafeteria. She said, “ I would like to order lunch. I will have green Jello, and a water with a lemon.”\r\n\r\nThe cook said, “Miss Kellie, you have to order more then that.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “I am not that hungry, and I just want a little something to tide me over for dinner. I will be hungry then and order a feast, can you please just this once not follow my guidelines. This is how I always eat, and since I don’t know why I am here, I will just order how I normally would eat.”\r\n\r\nThe cook said, “Miss Kellie, I am not aloud to tell you why you are here, nor am I aloud to bend the rules. Is there a sandwich or something else you want?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “NO there is not. Just forget it.” Kellie slammed down the phone and felt a tear starting to roll down her face.\r\n\r\nThe doctor entered the room and started to ask Kellie a list of questions. Then he sat on the side of Kellie’s bed and told her that she was being diagnosed with an eating disorder. He explained that even though she is skin and bones she sees herself as being fat. This is all due to a chemical imbalance in brain. He told her that he would give her some medications, and that she was to start seeing a therapist to work out her issues. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “Excuse me, but I don’t have an eating disorder. I am just naturally thin, and I can’t help that.\r\nThe doctor said, “That is the imbalance talking. Kellie at the age of 20 nobody is naturally 82 pounds. You have a problem, but we will work through it, and you will get better.”\r\n\r\nKellie sat in her bed and watched the IV just pump a white liquid into her. All she could think about was how much weight she will have gained by the time she gets out. She needed to get out of this hospital and back to her way of living. She knew deep down that she had a big problem, but she wasn’t ready to admit it yet. \r\n\r\nBefore leaving the hospital the doctors and nurses gave Kellie a guidebook to her new diet. IT wasn’t full of fatty foods or unhealthy choices, but rather it was a healthy book filled with salads and sandwiches, but Kellie still didn’t want to put one calorie into her system.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pidugqeubl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.026689,43.038352]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harper Community College","description":"Posted by Ddobosz 1200 W. Algonquin Road Palatine, IL. 60067Kellie’s parents didn’t spend her back to Mount Mary so they could keep a close eye on her. Kellie took a year off of school to straighten her life out, and think about the past. She started to take her medicines without question, and made sure to make healthy eating choices. In that one year Kellie put on 30 pounds, and started to lose hair.\r\n\r\nKellie will still sometimes mysteriously disappear to the bathroom unannounced, or will disappear at eating functions. Kellie will always be fight the Bulimia monster in herself. Sometimes, I am almost positive that it gets to her and she purges, but it is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. \r\n\r\nKellie is afraid to leave home. She is attending Harper Community College and getting a associates degree in Fashion Merchandizing. \r\n\r\nKellie says, “Yes someday I would like to put out my own live of clothes, but right now I am afraid that the pressures of eating and looking thin will lead me down the wrong path a lone. I am afraid to eat alone because I don’t know what I will do. I also don’t like this weight I have put on. Even though I currently only weight 125 pounds, I still see myself as fat. I don’t want that weight, but I know that I need it. I need to be at home where my mom and dad will watch after me. I am afraid this is turning into a dependency problem.

I am always learning more and more about the personal hidden secrets of what I consider to be my closest and dearest friends/family members. \r\n\r\nKellie has been my best friend for a solid six years now. One would think that the both of us know each others personal and hidden dark times. In reality, I have hardly scraped the surface that unfolds Kellie’s inner challenge. \r\n\r\nJacobs high school was just like any other large high school. It had it clicks with the popular kids, the nerds, the sports jocks, the sex-a-alcohols, the pot smokers, the drinkers, the clubbers, and any other stereotype of a person one would get from a high school. Our school colors were brown and gold, and everywhere in the hall there were pictures of our school mascot, the Golden Eagle. Even though must of the student population didn’t have much school pride, Jacobs was know in the community for one thing, trendy clothes. It was known that if a person could not fit into clothes from Abercrombie and Fitch that they were losers, and would have to endure endless accounts of naming calling and being whispered about during class. \r\n\r\nJacobs had what must people now days call “The Plastics”. Every girl wanted to be one of them. What is a plastic? A girl that wears only name brand clothes, hair down four days a week, has to be blond, weight no more then 125 pounds, drive the newest cars, have parties or attend parties every weekend, and must be in a relationship 85% of the time. Even though the majority of Jacobs girls did not fit into this category, we all wanted to. No matter how much Kellie said, “Those girls are so stupid, and I would almost do anything not to be one of them”, we all knew that she, like the rest of us, was striving to be a plastic. \r\n\r\nKellie was always into fashion. She knew that she was going to major in fashion since I can remember. She was always designing new and weird looking outfits. She would never buy a store bought dress because they were not a Kellie original. For every single prom, and homecoming she designed and made her own original style. Nobody, expect for her closest friends, ever acknowledged her creating talent. Deep down this hurt her.  \r\n\r\nSomething was always different with Kellie. Her friends always had suspicions that something was chemically not right with her thinking methods. Kellie would always deny that anything was wrong with her. Never having hard evidence, nothing could ever be said or done. \r\n\r\nSitting down to lunch at one of the 40-lunch table in the white walled cafeteria, Kellie actually let out a hit to her eating disorder. Standing in the long lunch line waiting to get her usual green Jello and diet Coke, Kellie watched a fellow students go from the pizza line, to the nacho line, to the bake goods line, and then ending in the pop fountain line. Kellie’s face turned green as though she was about the puke. Thinking it was just the smell of the thick coats of grease that layered the pizza of the student in front of her, it was just ignored. \r\n\r\nArriving at the table to sit down and eat, Kellie stared at a large girl. The was only 5’2”, short brown hair, was wearing tight American Eagle Jeans that showed her white an black striped thong, and a red tang top that revealed her 400 pound stomach. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “I just don’t understand how people can let themselves get like that. I mean come on doesn’t she know that she is fat?”\r\n\r\nI said, “Well maybe she is happy with herself the way she is. I wouldn’t worry about it.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Yeah well look at her. Does she actually think that she looks good wearing that? If I was her, I would lock myself in my room and starve myself until I lost at least half of that weight.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Kel, if that was possible, you know I would do it. But she would die. Stop being so concerned with other people. How did you do on the PE test?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Yeah, but at least you know that you have a problem with your weight, and you are trying to take steps in getting ride of it. Plus you don’t dress like that. I mean come on.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Kellie, I have issue with the way I am, but if I was comfortable with myself then I would be looking like her and eating like her. Now look you have made me self-conscious about the food I just ate. I know that I shouldn’t have had the candy bar and coke today. Now that is all I am going to think about for the rest of the day, so lets just drop the subject.”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Let me tell you something. It’s not that bad to go and throw up what you eat every now and then. Just a little bit, then you don’t have to be concerned with what you just put into your body. Plus you can eat whatever you want and not gain any weight. If anything you will lose some weight.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Kellie, that is called Bulimia. I don’t want an eating disorder thank you. Anyways PE…”\r\n\r\nKellie gave her first clue sitting at the fake wooden dark, brown lunch table. What could have been done at that point? Gone to the little green room where the nurse sits and told on her? Called her moms office and relayed the conversation to her? Spread a rumor around school about Kellie and her eating disorder? Maybe one of the above would have helped, but not realizing that it was as serious of a problem as it was, I kept it to myself and pretend like nothing ever happened.\r\n\r\nThe bell sounded to tell us that that lunch block was over, and it was once again time to journey down the long brown and gold halls to my classes. As we stood up from the table, Kellie put her hand around her 109-pound waist and said, “Well, even though I am not small, I will never let myself get like that.” Kellie shock her head so her hair flow to the back of her and her necklace fall right back to the front of her chest. She picked up her untouched Jello carton and half drunk diet Coke and tossed it in the trash. Her chicken legs went one in front of the other as she trotted off to her locker moss colored locker to gather materials for her next class. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6piduqztxsx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.335411,42.168263]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kellie's House","description":"Posted by Ddobosz1208 Poplar St Lake in the Hills IllinoisShe arrived home for the first time on Thanksgiving break. Like must college students the first time coming home for a large break is a big ordeal. As Kellie’s dad drover her up the little drive way leading to the little blue house with the one white garage door, Kellie was thrilled to be arriving home. She ran in through the white garage door that lead her into the house and throw her arms around her mothers. All her mom could feel on her was her bones.\r\n\r\nHer mom said, “Kellie you look so hollow, and thin. What are they feeding you?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “You know college food, its no home cooking.”\r\n\r\nKellie took her suit-case of items down to her room in the basement. Kellie had no door to her little olive green room and contained hardly anything any more since she started school. There was a bed that laid in the corner and a makeup desk that still had all the stuff she left at home before leaving for school, and a closet that had her designer and home-made designer outfits in it.\r\n\r\nKellie walked over to her closet and found a dress that she had made right before the end of senior year in high school. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “I remember I was so proud of this dress when I made it. It looked just like a Ann Taylor, expect better. I striped down to my underwear and put the dress on. The straps on the blue flowered material fell off my shoulders. It no longer sat on them perfectly. The cut I had made to fit my body just tight enough to show my hips off, now just hung there with nothing to show off. It was more of a sack dress at this point. I went to my little mirror that hung on the make table and looked at myself. My cheeks were hollow, my teeth were turning yellow from the purging, and I didn’t have an once of fat on myself. I loved this dress so much, and now I was too thin to fit into it. It was at this time, my first trip home, that I realized I had an eating disorder. I wanted to stop, and I wanted my hips back, but something in my head was telling me that I looked good, and that I need to be thing in order to be the next Vera Wang. (Who also has an eating disorder.)”\r\n\r\nKellie now weighed in at about 90 some pounds, and her clothes were falling off of her. When she would go to eat she would pick at her food, and then run to the bathroom immediately. Her mother started to become very considered, and contacted one of the nuns at her school. The nun told her that Kellie was not showing up to the organized meals, and that herself and other faculty had been keeping a close eye on her. Kellie was standing the hallway bathroom the whole time this conversation was occurring. She could not believe her ears. She did not have an eating disorder. She is as normal as one could be. \r\n\r\nKellie said, “When my mother hung up the phone from that conversation, she leaned up again the wall behind her. She put her hand over her month and leaned her forehead up against the wall started to cry. It was a silent cry. But if you were to walk behind her or peek out of your room, you would know that she was upset about something. I didn’t know what to do, so I simply walked out into the hallway, and started to talk to her as though I hadn’t noticed anything was wrong.”\r\n\r\nKellie’s mom looked up with red, puffy eyes, and asked Kellie, “Would you like something to eat?” Kellie responded, “No thanks I just had a huge lunch.” \r\n\r\nShe knew that she was lying, but after all she was down to a size zero, and had nothing to worry about. She justified this to herself by saying that she was dieting, and since everyone diets there was nothing wrong with that. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pidulvgo3a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.320019,42.187817]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Mary College","description":"Posted by Ddobosz2900 North Menomonee River Parkway | Milwaukee, WI 53222-4597Just like the rest of us, Kellie left for college. Kellie was different though. She didn’t want to go to a big state school, or a private mid sized school. She didn’t even want to go to a school that had boys at it. She chose to attend Mount Mary in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This was a very small school for fashion design, and only allowed girl attendants. She though that by choosing a girls only school, she would be able to give less thought and caring to her appearance. She would be able to focus on her education, and finally get her life put together. She packed her bags, and left to go to school. She got a single room thinking that this would lead her to less temptation, and she would be able to focus on everything else except her looks. (No roommate to compare herself with, or other friends running in and out of her room.)\r\n\r\nKellie decorated her dorm room just as she wanted it to be. Posters of the Red Hot Chile Peppers on the walls, green and yellow flowers that boarded her room to remind her of the outside while doing endless hours of work, green sheets on her twin sized bed, and a desk with a computer and numerous pictures of her friends from Algonquin surrounding it. She felt that since she was at an all girls school that her attire would not matter as much, so she only chose to bring her comfortable clothes and a few other items.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “All of my comfortable clothes were a little on the baggy side, and often when I would put them I would feel fatter then ever. I would run to the bathroom and purge up anything I had in my system, no matter if I had eaten or not. The last thing I wanted was to look fat wearing baggy jeans and a mid-sized sweet shirt.”\r\n\r\nAfter about two weeks of living on her own, she became lonely. She had made tons of friends, and had only wanted to hang out with them instead of going back to her room of isolation. Still being at an all girls school, she felt in the comfort of other girls that would not make fun of her for gaining a few pounds. After all this was college now, and not high school where you have to be plastic to fit in.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with eating disorders is that it’s a mental issue. Even though you think that you are doing something right, or you keep telling yourself that everything will fall into place, you still have that chemical imbalance in your head that makes issues like this hard to deal with. \r\n\r\nKellie’s says, “My friends at Mount Mary could have cared less what I looked like. But because I was not on any medication I could not handle the imbalances, and kept telling myself that I need to purge to stay in the in crowd. This was not the case.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6piduiio306"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.03531,43.07163]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rehab","description":"Posted by Ddobosz 600 S.

She was taken into the center and sat in a group with other just like her with eating disorders. This was lock down time for Kellie. There was no getting out of eating here. \r\n\r\nStill Kellie found a way to purge to first few days she was there. But then she realized that her parents were spending all of this money on her to get better, and that she did in fact have a problem.

She was going to try this new diet that she was put on, and she started to understand that she had a problem with eating. The main this was that Kellie could not keep anything down herself without becoming worried or it was like so was addicted to the whole idea of purging her food. The cycle continued.\r\n\r\nAt a family dinner one night Kellie was standing over by the sink and started to black out again. Her father was able to catch her and they ran her to Sherman Hospital this time. Ad Kel lay in he hospital bed, her parents sat in with a specialist on eating disorders, and she gave them information about a rehab center in Schaumburg Illinois. She parents signed Kellie up immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen Kellie awoke the specialist was right by her bed. She said, “Kellie you have a problem. I know that you understand that you don’t have a problem, but you have to admit it. Please talk to me and tell me everything so I am able to help you.”\r\n\r\nThe hospital room was dark, and no light was on except for a little light about her bed. Her eyes were rolling all over the place, and she did know what to do. This was her third trip to a hospital. She look at the lady and just started balling.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “I want to be normal. I want to fit in. I don’t want to be 200 pounds when I am thirty-five years old. I see people and think to myself that they are huge, and should do something to change themselves. I am afraid that I will never find love, and that no one will want to hire me to design their clothes because I am fat and ugly.”\r\n\r\nThe specialist stopped Kellie and said, “You think you are attractive being 70 pounds and gangly looking. If I were to hire I designer, I would want one that looked healthy enough to finish the project I was assigning. You need to eat, and you need to say you have a problem.’\r\n\r\nKellie looked at the IV in her arm, and stared at the ceiling.

She was ready to return home for the summer and get some rest and stop this non-sense for a while with this so-called eating disorder. Since Mount Mary had seen an improvement with Kellie they said that she would be able to return to school in the fall. Kellie and her parents were happy to hear this, even though her grades were in the dumps. Everyone had felt that since she was dealing with the issue that the next year would be different.\r\n\r\nBoth of Kellie’s parents work during the day, and Kellie didn’t have a ton of hours at Joe Ann Fabrics. This left Kellie a lone most of the day in her house. She was in heaven with all the food that she could eat, and then purge up. No one was there, so she decided to make it appear she ate a ton of food during the day, and then conveniently was not hungry or stuff anything else down her for dinner. Kellie had now gotten into the habit of wearing over sized clothes to make it look like she was not losing weight. On a Tuesday late afternoon, Kellie was on one of her purging episodes and passed out. She laid downstairs in her bathroom, until her mother arrived home to find her daughter laying on the cold blue tile floor and saw the vomit of food in the toilet. She still had a pulse, so she gave Kellie some water and rushed her to St. Joe’s hospital. \r\n\r\nThey rushed Kellie into a rood and immediately connected her to and IV that began shoot a food substance liquid into her veins. Kellie was unconscious for a good eight hours. My mother and father were worried that she was in a comma and that she may not wake up out of it. But eventually she did. Kellie’s eyes were drawn to the large needle sticking in her vain injecting food into her system.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Get this out of me. I don’t need this. I am eating on my own. I don’t want to gain weight. I am up at least eight pounds from my last hospital visit.” \r\n\r\nKellie just started screaming and crying and screaming until a nurse came running into the room. She was able to came Kellie down, and shortly after a doctor came in. \r\n\r\nThe doctor said, “Kellie, actually you are weighing in at 78 pounds which is five pounds less from when you were in the Milwaukee hospital. Are you taking your medications?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Of course I am.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor said, “Because the blood test that we ran show us differently. The chemical that you are missing is still not showing up in the blood. You need to be taking that medicine, or you will kill yourself.”\r\n\r\nKellie looked down at her legs in the stiff white bed. She could see every bone imperfection sticking out of her pale greenish skin. \r\n\r\nThe doctor said, “Do you know what you are actually doing to yourself? You know the life consequences of having bulimia and not dealing with it?”\r\n\r\nKellie said, “Yeah being thin and a super model. Well for me it will be a top designer.”\r\n\r\nThe doctors said, “No. Actually, soon you will start to lose your hair, once you start eating you will have a hard time taking any unwanted weight off, big huge brown blotches will appear on your skin, if will be hard for you to conceive, and may other life long effects. So I suggest that you start to put yourself together, so you can help prevent as many as the above as possible.”\r\n\r\nWith that being said Kellie closed her eyes and fell asleep. She stayed at St. Joe’s for two nights. They once again gave her a guide book as to what foods to eat and how to start eating again. This doctor also gave her information on the life consequences that she was doing to herself.\r\n\r\nKellie said, “This doctor was trying to scare me into eating. He thought that by telling me everything bad with an eating disorder, and then I would be scared to eating again. The most important thing this doctor gave me was a hot line to call in case I felt like purging. Although I never used it, now that I look back on it I should have. This doctor was really concerned, and he should have been I was only weight in at 78 pounds. Must people weight that at the age of 8 and 10. I still just couldn’t bring myself to say that I had a problem and it needed to be fixed.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6pidun4avei"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.328942,42.032536]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20382","metadata":null,"contact_name":"ddobosz","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:ddobosz","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20382","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20382,platial:user=ddobosz","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":32189}
