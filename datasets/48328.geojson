Haha, yeah right! DAYTONA BEACH!!! I went to Daytona in 2005 for my Senior Spring Break (SB@DB\\'05)!!! I had so much fun there and have countless stories about the entire trip!

I cannot even count the number of times that I have been to Myrtle Beach! I recommend to a road-tripper to stay in the South Side area; it\\'s the party area! AND DEFINITELY GO TO BAREFOOT LANDING AND EAT AT DICK\\'S LAST RESORT! And the best hotel is Coral Beach Resort. It\\'s amazing (10 pools, bowling alley, arcade, bar, live band/dj, and right on the beach). GO THERE!

I recommend to anyone that they checkout Drumline! It is held every year in Chatty! It is a ton of fun!

I saw every aspect of the city; stayed in Montemarte (2 minutes from the Moulin Rouge). It was absolutely gorgeous! My picture is of me at the gardens of Giverny, a little outside Paris! The one of the elephant is this statue outside one of the MANY art galleries.
