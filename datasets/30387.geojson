That siren could be heard for miles and sounded quite akin to an air raid warning.\r\n\r\nDirectly across the street was the playground, in the center of which was the creepy secondary school building which was abandoned and boarded up by the time I was in second grade in 1980.

It\\'s been closed down since 2000 and completely torn down in 2006 I beleive, but I went there multiple times pretty much every year when I was a kid. For a youngster, this place was really cool...though outdated by modern standards, it was perfectly adequate for chills and thrills back in the day...and with the lack of safety standards in those times, it was even better!\r\nI\\'ve got my marker right in the middle of where The Comet roller coaster stood. Shortly after it was torn down, I got a piece of it. Some of the other highlights from Whalom\\'s history was the Pirates Den ride, which unfortunately burnt down. The funhouse was one of the coolest I\\'d ever been in (they don\\'t make em like that anymore) it was DARK in there, with all sorts of trippy spooky blacklight paint and strobelights and all manners of weird stuff in the walkways; spinny and squishy floor tiles, ricketty bridge, ramps, and even a rotating tunnel for little children to fall over in. Other rides included The Whip and Tilt-a-Whirl...and various other old timey bygones. \r\nIn 2000, when the park was at the end of it\\'s rope, I went there with a few friends a couple times since it was only 3 bucks to get in after 6pm...we rode the roller coaster nonstop for about an hour once. A few weeks later, the park\\'s gates creaked shut for the very last time. \r\nThe grounds are still there though...still unused... on quiet summer nights you can sometimes here the faint sound of ghostly children squealing with glee in the dark.... woOOOooOOoo!!!!!!!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xz4rwmb29"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.745969,42.57628]}},{"properties":{"name":"former site of Man Ray nightclub","description":"Posted by Mathyula<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> This is where the club known as Man Ray once stood.

Back in good ole 1980, environmental protection measures weren\\'t quite what they are now. In fact, I heard that the Otter River was one of the most polluted rivers in the state, if not the country. So, that\\'s why the bridge that crossed it is on my map. The bridge was along the route for kids going to the elementary school and we walked over it many many times.
