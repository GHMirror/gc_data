Founded in the 1890s gold rush, Kalgoorlie is a major gold and nickel producing centre about 600km east of Perth and 400km inland from Esperance.\r\n\r\nThe main streets are still lined with heritage buildings. The \"wild west\" character of the town has changed though as more families make it a residential base for working in the mines and associated industries.\r\n\r\nThe town has a classic outback feel complete with red dirt and summer heat. I think it\\'s more quintessentially Australian than Alice Springs, which seems to command more attention.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65owez1daei"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[121.462956,-30.743311]}},{"properties":{"name":"Maffra","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://gorey.com.au\" href=\"http://gorey.com.au\">Mgorey</a>Maffra VictoriaA dairy farming town.
