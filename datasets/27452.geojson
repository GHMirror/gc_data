There are 36 primitive walk-in tent sites that are reached by a one-third-mile trail from the parking area. The park service provides wheelbarrows for carting your camp gear up and down the angled, paved pathway. Part of the camaraderie that quickly accompanies a camping trip to Oswald comes from the exchanges of greetings, sympathy, and an occasional helping hand that fellow campers offer as they push, pull, tug, and otherwise maneuver their overloaded carts between car and campsite. It is not unusual to find a heap of spilled goods lying in the path as a frustrated youngster valiantly attempts to right his overturned one-wheeled craft before Dad comes looking to see what in the world is taking so darned long.\n\nOswald West State Park\n830OR Third Street Necarney\nNehalem, OR 97131\n\nOperated by: Oregon State Parks and Recreation\nInformation: (503) 368-5943\nOpen: March through October\n\nIndividual sites: 36 primitive, walk-in\nEach site has: Picnic table, fire pit, piped water, shade trees\nSite assignment: First come, first served; no reservations\nRegistration: Self-registration on site\nFacilities: Bathhouse with toilets, sinks, running water; wheelbarrows for transporting gear; firewood\n\nParking: In-campground parking lot at trailhead\nFee: 4 per night\nElevation: Sea level\nRestrictions: \nPets— On leash\nFires— In fire pits only\nAlcoholic beverages— Permitted \nVehicles— No RV or trailer accommodations; no bicycles on park trails<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6i0kpx4sdrp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.967581,45.794968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Our old haunt","description":"Posted by PhototronWe would walk here what seemed lik every night.
