At that time, we already knew that Saddam Hussein was torturing people and had taken over this country and pushed communism on it. So we went in and tried to rescue the opprosed people. Our government at the time was the Bush administration.\r\n\r\nThe Iraq war is a big political war because it is costing the U.S. so much money and young lives. Although many soldiers have died, there are signs showing that we are making improvements to get business done. \r\n\r\nThe climate in Iraq is closely related to that of the Southwestern United States. It has very hot summers with temperatures that can be as high as 120 degrees fahrenheight, and very cold winters ranging with temperatures below freezing. Iraq is covered by deserts.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6htkut2dx4q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[43.679291,33.223191]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hiroshima","description":"Posted by Tbuddy<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3074/2316320224_c8c4b3a227.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/2315511321_66abea6dc8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/hiroshima_4_.jpg\">JApanHiroshima, Japan is a place that has seen many deaths thanks to the first atomic bomb, which the United States dropped their in an effort to finish the World War II. The United States was tired of the war with Japan, and thought that if we bombed at least one and perhaps two major cities of Japan, they would cease to fight. \r\n\r\nThese two major cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had major war goods going in and out. In our effort to end the War quickly, on August 6, 1945, the U.S. dropped the Atomic bomb \" Little Boy.\" It killed 140,000 people. Three days later the U.S. dropped a bomb on Nagasaki, which killed 80,000 people. After that Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945. They called this day VJ day. The war was finally over.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate in Hiroshima is temperate with four seasons. Usually in summer months it will get up to 95 degrees fahrenheight. Winters aren\\'t brutally cold temperatures not going below 40 degrees fahrenheight.

North Vietnam was becoming a communist country and trying to force South Vietnam to go along. So, we went to the rescue and helped defend South Vietnam from being captured. General Westmoreland was in charge of all American troops. He wanted everything destroyed and more and more men to fight. \r\n\r\nThe North Vietnamese were not so easily taken over. The Vietcong had no rules and they used guerilla warfare, landmines, bilogical warefare and torture. They were willing to fight to their last man. The U.S. was forced down to the capital city of South Vietnam, Saigon. Eventually, the North Vietnamese took over Saigon, naming it Ho Chi Minh City on April 30, 1975. \r\n\r\nToday, the underground miles of tunnels that the North Vietnamese used to fight the Americans are open to tourists in many places. Also, the result of napalm, a poisonous gas used by the Vietcong, is still around. Many of our veterans have died or still suffer its effects. \r\n\r\nClimatewise, it is usually very hot and humid in Vietnam because it is in the tropics.

Its beaches are known and remembered by thousands of Americans because this is the place where the Allied forces invaded in 1944. We call it D-day. \r\nGeneral Eisenhower believed that D-day would end the War in Europe. So, he sent around 156,000 soldiers to take much of Germany\\'s gained ground and push them back. Around 3,000 Germans died, and around 4,000 Americans died. This battle started on June 6, 1944 and ended June 30, 1944.In the end, Eisenhower was right, the Americans took charge of the war and turned the tide for victory on D-Day at Normandy.  \r\n\r\nNormandy has a warm climate and temperatures that are usually mild.

The Canal enables cargo ships to easily manuever from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean without going below South America. The Panama Canal was started in 1900 and was finally opened in 1914. More than 22,000 people died, building it. It brought success to American shipping, and is still a major factor in trade, today.\r\n Each year, the Panama Canal enables 205 million tons of cargo to pass through. Also, private yachts are allowed through the canal as well. It takes around nine hours to pass through the canal. \r\n\r\nPanama, located in South America, has a very tropical climate, with very high humidity and hot temperatures. Panama is covered with grasslands, forests, rain forests and scrubs.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6htkutjn6az"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.529998,8.97]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pearl Harbor","description":"Posted by Tbuddy<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/29638083@N00/2389434629/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3183/2389434629_a83a870294.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3034/2284096704_c6f3538a3c.jpg\">HawaiiPearl Harbor, in Hawaii, is located in the United States.

The Japanesse sent 353 aircraft to suprise attack Pearl Harbor. They destroyed 188 U.S. aircraft--one of them was the U.S.S. Arizona, which had already been in several skirmishes. Because of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the U.S. declared war in no uncertain terms.\r\n\r\nNow, there stands a memorial at Pearl Harbor to remember all those who died that day. There is also a memorial over the U.S.S. Arizona, and the ship is still leaking oil! Pearl Harbor is a reminder that freedom comes with a cost.\r\n\r\nHawaii has a subtropical climate. Rain forests can be found there, along with volcanos and many famous beaches. Hawaii has two seasons, neither of which has which extrene temperatures.

They built a fort there, named the Castillo de San Marcos. It protected the people from British attacks. Then, in 1845, the U.S. staked its claim to St. Augustine. Around 1861, during the Civil War, the Confederate troops took the fort and used it for protection from the Union Army. Then, in the early 1900s, no more active troops were allowed--and Florida created one of its very first themeparks.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6htkuizsiie"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.320206,29.901732]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Alamo","description":"Posted by Tbuddy<img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2269/2200711228_e14ba6034c.jpg\">TexasThe Alamo is an old mission located in San Antonio, Texas. The Alamo was a place where the Texian forces, during the Texas Revolution, battled the Mexican Republic. It started February 23, 1836 and ended March 6, 1836. It took 13 days until the Mexican Republic took over the Mission killing all the Texians. Some of the Texians killed were Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and William Travis.\r\n\r\nThe Texians showed great courage. Even though they lost the battle it gave time for Sam Houston to build up his army. He caught up with General Santa Anna, who was leader of the Mexican forces, defeating him at the Battle of San Jacinto. The Alamo was a turning point which eventually let Texas become independent from Mexico.   <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6htkuky0l24"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-100.099724,31.169859]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/87798","metadata":null,"contact_name":"tbuddy","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:tbuddy","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/87798","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=87798,platial:user=tbuddy","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48411}
