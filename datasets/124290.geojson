The objectives of component one is to develop agricultural technologies through research, and to strengthen agricultural research institutions. Component two: enhancing partnerships between agricultural research, advisory services, and other stakeholders. The objectives of component two are to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of technology development and dissemination by supporting closer linkages between National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO), National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS), and other stakeholders. Component three: strengthening the national agricultural advisory services. The objectives of component three are to support improved delivery of demand-driven and market-oriented advisory services to farmers to promote their progression from subsistence to market-orientation. Component four: supporting agribusiness services and market linkages. The objective of component four is to promote integration of smallholders in value chains by supporting collaboration between agribusiness, farmers, advisers, and researchers to create viable, sustainable market and agribusiness linkages.
