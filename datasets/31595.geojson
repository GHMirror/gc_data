With more than 143,000 square feet, it is one of the largest school of architecture buildings built in the U.S. in the last 40 years. The exterior of the L-shaped building has brick walls accented by metal panels and large windows. Full glass walls facing onto the central courtyard afford a view of that area from almost every room in the building. Inside, the air ducts, light fixtures and structural system have been left exposed, providing a unique architectural teaching environment. \n   The building includes student design studios, classrooms, a lecture hall, exhibition areas, computer labs, offices, a media and photography center, and research centers.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64alyzmgu67"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.8832918406,43.0772540235]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bolton Hall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\" href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\">Ajsmart</a><img src=\"http://www.uwm.edu/map/images/photos/bol.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> The following UITS departments operate within Bolton Hall:\n\nClassroom Services\nDesktop Support\nHelp Desk and CCL Support\nHuman Resources\nProfessional Development\nSTS Administration\nTechnical Training\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64alyvl6aw0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.8813016415,43.0759178514]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bolton Hall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\" href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\">Ajsmart</a><img src=\"http://www.uwm.edu/map/images/photos/bol.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uwm.edu/map/images/photos/bol.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Bolton Hall has more classrooms than any other campus facility. It houses the Departments of Sociology, Anthropology, Political Science, Economics, Urban Studies, and Geography, as well as other offices, computer labs, and registration services. It was the home of the School of Business Administration until the School moved into its new building in 1995. \n   A remodeling project totaling nearly .7 million began in 1997 to renovate Bolton\\'s main lecture hall, create a general access computer lab, remodel geography instructional space and upgrade electrical and telecommunication services. A significant improvement includes an enhanced first floor entrance that serves as a gateway to new offices for the Department of Recruitment and Outreach, relocated from Mitchell Hall. \n   Bolton Hall was named for historian and explorer Herbert E. Bolton (1870-1953), who was born in Wilton, Wisconsin. He taught at the Milwaukee Normal School (1900-1901), the University of Texas, Stanford University, and the University of California.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64alyqn6bet"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.8813016415,43.0759178514]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bolton Hall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\" href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\">Ajsmart</a><img src=\"http://www.uwm.edu/map/images/photos/bus.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> This four-story facility consists of 150,000 square feet of classroom, computer labs and office space and can accommodate 2,000 students in its instructional facilities at one time. Originally constructed in 1995 as the Business Administration Building, it was renamed in 2006, Lubar Hall in honor of Sheldon B. Lubar, a prominent Milwaukee businessman, civic leader and philanthropist.\n\nMr. Lubar is founder and chairman of Lubar &amp; Company, Inc., a private investment firm. His commitment to UWM and higher education spans more than three decades including service as a past president of the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents. Mr. Lubar\\'s distinguished career of public service also includes his work as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration.\n\nThe building\\'s original automated light and temperature controls featured a system called The Lighting Showcase by the Wisconsin Electric Power Company. It was designed to provide maximum energy efficiency for the most highly utilized academic building on the UWM campus. In addition to providing nearly 200 offices, there are three lecture halls, with a total of 785 seats; seven arc-shaped classrooms; 10 U-shaped classrooms; an Executive MBA classroom; three computer labs; and two levels of underground parking.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64alyood85b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.8823959827,43.0760275676]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chapman Hall","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\" href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu\">Ajsmart</a><img src=\"http://www.uwm.edu/map/images/photos/cha.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\">  Acquired in the purchase of the Milwaukee-Downer College campus, Chapman Hall served as the library until the College closed its campus and merged with Lawrence College in Appleton in 1964. The building was named for Alice G. Chapman (1853-1935), benefactress of the College, who willed  million for a library or auditorium, a president\\'s house, and an endowment for faculty salaries. Besides the library, the building contained an art gallery and the Teakwood Room, a reception hall paneled with ornately carved East Indian teakwood taken from the Chapman family home. The teakwood paneling was moved again in 1964 to a special room at Lawrence University. \n   Chapman Hall now houses offices for the Chancellor and other administrative units.
