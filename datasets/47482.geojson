This is a tool for scaring away birds. It\\'s supposed to frighten all non-birds-of-prey. It amuses me to see it up there, spotted with bird poop, obviously not working. The reason it does not work is because it\\'s built to imitate the markings of a bird of prey. However, the Squab in the train station have never seen, much less been attacked by, a hawk or an owl. So, the big balloon with the taget on it\\'s side is just that - a big balloon with a target on it\\'s side.
