The locations are believed to be structures that have a high probability of places that might be currently hosting bin Laden based on the matching characteristics of his life history.\n\nEach data point contains: Grid number, Structure number w/in grid, Score, and lat/lon location.\n\nThe score is the sum of physical structure attributes fitting bin Laden's life history characteristics.\n\nThe data comes from a report called: Finding Osama bin Laden: An Application of Biogeographic Theories and Satellite Imagery. The report is by Thomas W. Gillespie and John A. Agnew et all, who through the use of biogeographic theories have produced a scientific method for finding Osama bin Laden.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"score":{"max":6,"mean":5.15789473684211,"variance":0.140350877192982,"stdev":0.374634324632678,"min":5,"median":5},"lon":{"max":70.121523,"mean":70.1049695263158,"variance":0.000114636965596464,"stdev":0.0107068653487594,"min":70.087519,"median":70.105129},"structure":{"max":4,"mean":1.94736842105263,"variance":0.830409356725146,"stdev":0.911267993910214,"min":1,"median":2},"lat":{"max":33.913399,"mean":33.8984851052632,"variance":5.68818546549649e-05,"stdev":0.00754200601000588,"min":33.885623,"median":33.898657},"grid":{"max":7,"mean":3.68421052631579,"variance":4.2280701754386,"stdev":2.05622717019268,"min":1,"median":3}},"features":[{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.091091,"structure":1,"id":"a62kp3efhwlg","lat":33.903432,"grid":1},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.091091,33.903432]}},{"properties":{"score":6,"lon":70.093746,"structure":2,"id":"a62kp3jd4yw8","lat":33.901944,"grid":1},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.093746,33.901944]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.095839,"structure":3,"id":"a62kp3e3jlsa","lat":33.902662,"grid":1},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.095839,33.902662]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.104956,"structure":1,"id":"a62kp365yc73","lat":33.899715,"grid":2},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.104956,33.899715]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.111935,"structure":4,"id":"a62kp3bppxwo","lat":33.896283,"grid":2},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.111935,33.896283]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.105129,"structure":3,"id":"a62kp3dwf9xg","lat":33.906885,"grid":2},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.105129,33.906885]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.103338,"structure":2,"id":"a62kp3au7942","lat":33.900707,"grid":2},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.103338,33.900707]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.116777,"structure":1,"id":"a62kp3ax8m0z","lat":33.898657,"grid":3},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.116777,33.898657]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.118473,"structure":2,"id":"a62kp3frgeg0","lat":33.899745,"grid":3},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.118473,33.899745]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.121523,"structure":3,"id":"a62kp35vvmki","lat":33.894525,"grid":3},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.121523,33.894525]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.089383,"structure":1,"id":"a62kp36k0mzg","lat":33.897951,"grid":4},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.089383,33.897951]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.087519,"structure":2,"id":"a62kp3g4sby5","lat":33.898255,"grid":4},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.087519,33.898255]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.106461,"structure":1,"id":"a62kp3ayipzn","lat":33.892353,"grid":5},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.106461,33.892353]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.111442,"structure":2,"id":"a62kp36wfb86","lat":33.887763,"grid":5},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.111442,33.887763]}},{"properties":{"score":6,"lon":70.113308,"structure":3,"id":"a62kp3a47bav","lat":33.888207,"grid":6},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.113308,33.888207]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.114477,"structure":2,"id":"a62kp36wsovi","lat":33.891417,"grid":6},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.114477,33.891417]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.115935,"structure":1,"id":"a62kp33csjqp","lat":33.885623,"grid":6},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.115935,33.885623]}},{"properties":{"score":6,"lon":70.0959,"structure":1,"id":"a62kp3f7llcn","lat":33.911694,"grid":7},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.0959,33.911694]}},{"properties":{"score":5,"lon":70.097189,"structure":2,"id":"a62kp33lzxof","lat":33.913399,"grid":7},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[70.097189,33.913399]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://web.mit.edu/mitir/2009/online/finding-bin-laden.pdf","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Finding Osama bin Laden: An Application of Biogeographic Theories and Satellite Imagery.
