Raep","description":"Posted by PatcatOuderzijds Voorburgwal 57, Amsterdam▪ Across the canal we see the finest still existing example of Baroque Renaissance, built by Hendrick de Keyser: Oudezijds Voorburgwal 57, the “Gecroonde Raep”, which was built in 1615 according to the two date plaques. \r\n▪ Here we see not the plain Dutch Renaissance, but the Baroque Renaissance of Hendrick de Keyser. This is a typical Amsterdam version of the renaissance style, which is used until the middle of the 17th century. Characteristic is the abundance of ornaments as a result of which the stepped gable itself can hardly be recognized. We also see accolade arches (relieving arches in the shape of accolades) and double pilasters with cartouches between the windows. This house is also owned by the Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6mxnspt2pwp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.899083,52.374238]}},{"properties":{"name":"Het WApen van Riga","description":"Posted by PatcatOuderzijds Voorburgwal 14, amsterdamStepped gables were built in Amsterdam between circa 1600 - circa 1665 and were so popular that the city was full of these. Nowadays only about one hundred still remain. Stepped gables were initially built in the Dutch or Haarlem style, but soon they were built in a typical Amsterdam style, the style of Hendrick de Keyser: Amsterdam or Baroque Renaissance. We will see examples of both versions. The first step-gabled houses therefore had a style which was not yet the typical Amsterdam style, but Dutch or Haarlem Renaissance. This house, Oudezijds Voorburgwal 14, is an example of such a step-gabled house in Dutch Renaissance style. The house was built in 1605 and has various names: “Het Wapen van Riga”, “Leeuwenburg” or “Burcht van Leiden”. It was built by a merchant from Riga, an immigrant. Hence the two crossed keys in the tablet: the city arms of Riga (which closely resembles the arms of Leiden!). \r\n▪ Hardly any wooden houses are built in Amsterdam after circa 1550. The first brick houses are “turned to stone” wooden houses. This house is a good example. It has a wooden frame and a wooden lower front. The brick walls hang in the anchors on the wooden frame. The facade leans forward quite a bit (“it is in flight”). The side wall has been built out on the protruding joisting (“corbelled”). \r\n▪ In 1942 the house was bought by the Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser and renovated (see the plaque). Behind the plasterwork the old renaissance facade was found. The lower front part (including the leaded windows) has been reconstructed. The Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser is named after the famous 17th century Amsterdam architect, and it buys old, dilapidated houses and restores these, sometimes very spectacularly, as is the case with this house. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
