Globe</a> has a front page article on the lack of respect Edgar Allan Poe receives in his hometown of Boston.  Bostonians obviously thought enough of Poe to name a square after him, near his birthplace--the 1928 map above shows the location.  Part of the problem is that this part of Boston has been reconfigured--Carver Street has been lost, and Charles Street South has replaced it to make a straight line from Tremont Street to Charles Street.  I believe what used to be the corner of Broadway and Fayette is still open space however, although no marker is in place.  It would certainly be a simple matter to reinform the public of the historic name of this area of Bay Village.\n \n_______________________________________________\n&amp;nbsp;\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\"

dormitory at One Western Avenue</a> in Allston following its <a href=\"http://www.architecture.neu.edu/dbuploads/In_Defense_of_OWA.pdf\">defense by George Thrush</a>, director of the School of Architecture at <a href=\"http://www.neu.edu\">Northeastern University</a>, reminds one that harsh criticism of architecture, and of Harvard\\'s architecture in particular, is nothing new. [Update: Professor Thrush has sent me the full-color illustrated article <a href=\"http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/OneWestern.pdf\">Download OneWestern.pdf (3635.3K)</a>]  I\\'ll have more on <a href=\"http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/09.18/09-housing.html\">One Western Avenue</a> soon, but I have some historic criticism to offer now.  George Cleveland, writing in the <a href=\"http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/sgml/moa-idx?notisid=ABQ7578-0043&amp;byte=76452332\"><em>North American Review</em></a> in 1836, had the following to say American architecture, and Harvard in particular:  \n\n\"Wherever it had been found necessary to erect large secular edifices, they have either been entirely destitute of ornament, and belonging to no order of architecture, or slightly adorned with Grecian cornices and pilasters.  Instances of this architecture appear all over the country; but we do not recollect any that are more illustrative of what we mean, than most of the College buildings at Cambridge, New England.  We would cite these as very perfect specimens of no known order of architecture; vast brick barns, destitute alike of symmetry, ornament, and taste; and with all their plain and uncouth proportions, there is a sort of horrible regularity and squareness about them , which heightens their deformity.  Four of these edicfces are guiltless of any attempt at elegance of architecture, and, making no pretensions. perhaps hardly deserve to be noticed.  But what shall we say of the stone edifice, which insults us with its long piazza, and its wooden Ionic pilasters, and the entablature which extends part way across the front?  The proportions of this wonderful building are about one hundred feet by forty or fifty; at the ends, it is three stories high, with basement rooms;  the sides are partly two stories and partly three stories high, the great expanse of wall being somewhat relieved by the pilasters and entablature.  The <em>chef d\\'oeuvre</em> of the whole building, however, is the piazza or portico, which runs along part of the western side or front.  it is approached by a lofty flight of stone steps guarded by an iron balustrade; <em>nine</em> columns, from twelve to fifteen feet high, each a single block of granite, and surmounted by a Tuscan capital of soap-stone, are ranged along the front of the piazza, and support a flat roof eight inches thick, and so light and insignificant that is seems as if a breath of wind would blow it away.  We doubt whether the world contains any other architectural abortion, to be compared to this.\"\n\nWow.\n\nBut what really caught my eye in the statement above was this:  \"We would cite these as very perfect specimens of no known order of\narchitecture; vast brick barns, destitute alike of symmetry, ornament,\nand taste; and with all their plain and uncouth proportions, there is a\nsort of horrible regularity and squareness about them , which heightens\ntheir deformity.\"  It\\'s as if those who criticize One Western Avenue today are channeling George Cleveland.  Is <a href=\"http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/09.18/09-housing.html\">One Western Avenue</a> really that bad?\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atf5kdegu4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.118276,42.364172]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gas Lamps--Union Avenue, Jamaica Plain","description":"Posted by Bostonhistorian1 Union Avenue, Jamaica Plain, MA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atf5sifbgn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.105889,42.309759]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lost Boston: 10 Commonwealth Avenue","description":"Posted by Bostonhistorian10 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA\n<a href=\"http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/10commonwealthavenue006final_2.jpg\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"506\" alt=\"10commonwealthavenue006final_2\" title=\"10commonwealthavenue006final_2\" src=\"http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/notes_on_the_urban_condit/images/10commonwealthavenue006final_2.jpg\"></a>10 Commonwealth Avenue, c. 1924.  Click to enlarge (Image copyright The City Record and Boston News-Letter, all rights reserved)\n\n10 Commonwealth Avenue was built for <a href=\"http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasappleton.html\">Thomas Appleton</a> in 1864 and demolished in 1963 perhaps to make way for an addition to the Ritz Carlton Hotel, which was completed in 1981.  Given the delay between demolition and construction there is some question as to why the addition took so long to be approved and if two events are in fact related.\n\nAppleton is an important figure in 19th Century Boston, known for his art collecting and work for the Boston Public Library.  According to Bainbridge Bunting, 8 and 10 Commonwealth Avenue were built by friends (Erastus Bigelow occupied number 8).  Bunting states that the while number 8 was two feet wider than number 10, number 10 had a second floor library which extended across the south side (rear) of both houses.  For more information on the architecture of the Back Bay, I recommend Bainbridge Bunting\\'s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674409019?tag=bostonhistory-20\">Houses of Boston\\'s Back Bay: An Architectural History, 1840-1917</a>.</em>  You can read more about the addition to the Ritz Carlton at Architectural Boston\\'s <a href=\"http://www.architecturalboston.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=376\">thread on the Ritz Carlton</a>.\n________________\n&amp;nbsp;\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6atf5dv2qby"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.071954,42.353336]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lost Dorchester on Jones Hill","description":"Posted by BostonhistorianHancock and Trull Street, Dorchester, MA\n<a href=\"http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/dexterhouse007websmaller.jpg\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/notes_on_the_urban_condit/images/dexterhouse007websmaller.jpg\" title=\"Dexterhouse007websmaller\" alt=\"Dexterhouse007websmaller\"></a>The Dexter House on Hancock Street, opposite Trull Street, Jones Hill, Dorchester, c. 1888, click to enlarge.
