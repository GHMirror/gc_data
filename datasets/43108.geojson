The atmosphere is good. I\\'ve never seen so many different vibrators in one place before.\n\nAs advertised, the staff is super. Knowledgeable, comfortable, everything you want in the person from whom you\\'re buying your smut.\n\nThis is the perfect sex shop for the beginner and the dabbler. They have a particularly large selection at the entry level (pun intended) of sex toys. Unintimidating sizes of toys that can be intimidating. Inexpensive starter kits like the \"Bend Over Beginner\" pictured to the left. Loads of lube. Friendly beginner bondage and S&amp;M toys. One of my friends bought an adorable little crop with a pink leather kitty cat head at the business end. Très Betty Page. \n\nAfter our visit, my friends and I sat down to take some notes. \n\n* check the website for coupons.\n\n* They have classes which sound really fun.\n\n* lots of books\n\n* that sure is a big selection of dildos and harnesses\n\n* no fetish clothes\n\n* rubber ducky vibrator.... I want one!\n\n* games for couples and groups\n\n* lotsa lube\n\n* party packs are lame\n\n* they don\\'t have much back stock<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\"
