The modestly designed structure\nwas built in 1893 by John Steward. The two-room dwelling featured 18\"-thick plastered\nadobe walls detailed with subtle elements of the Queen Anne design tradition, including\ngeometric proportions, decorative gable shingles, and cornice moulding. About 1914, a rear\naddition was built with a double-pitched roof; it enlarged the house to include indoor\nbathroom plumbing, kitchen, and sleeping porch, and depicts the typical evolution of this\ntype of primarily rental dwelling. The use of traditional adobe construction for buildings\nwas quite common during Tempe's settlement period (1871-1888), due primarily to the lack\nof available milled lumber or fired brick, as well as the economic condition of most\nsettlers. Adobe was almost immediately replaced after 1888 when the arrival of the\nrailroad made prefabricated wood materials more readily available, and local brick kilns\nprovided a less time-consuming alternative to adobe.  \n \nThe adobe core of the Steward House measured 18 feet by 30 feet, and faced onto Maple\nAvenue with its roof ridge parallel to the street. The equilateral triangle gable heads\nwere constructed of decorative shingles and featured a central rectangular louvered\nventilator. Other detailing, including enclosed eaves, cornice moulding at the facia,\ndoors, and windows, were all original architectural elements evolved from the Queen Anne\nstyles. A rear addition, measuring 20 feet by 25 feet, was built in 1914 and was of frame\nconstruction. It was covered by a moderate double-pitched, metal roof and included a\nscreen porch. A front porch extended the length of the east (front) wall.

Its\ndesign combines regional, vernacular material, adobe, with the high-style massing and\ndetailing of Eastlake Victorian.

Farmer Avenue</b> \n  Year Built:  \n    1888 \n  Architectural Style:  \n    Neo-Colonial \n   \n \nThe E. A. Murphy House was significant as one of the best-preserved wood frame\ndwellings constructed during Tempe's initial development period. The Murphy House\ndisplayed the refined level of design and craftsmanship of a building style and method of\nconstruction once common during the settlement period of the Salt River Valley. Wide\nshiplap siding, original doors and French windows, simple moulding at door heads,\ncornices, and eaves, and modest jig-cut ventilators were some of the noteworthy elements.\nThe property's lengthy history also encompassed associations with some important Tempe\npioneers and early businessmen. Edward A. Murphy, who came to Tempe before 1887, was a\nblacksmith and liveryman who operated the Tempe Livery Stable up until 1900. He purchased\na large agricultural lot (115 ft. x 236 ft.) from H. B. Farmer on the southwest corner of\n8th Street and Farmer Avenue in December of 1887 and had the house built the\nfollowing spring. Its fine design, agricultural setting, and prime location along the\nsection line road gave the house a visual prominence through the first two decades of its\nexistence, and made it one of the more desirable residential properties in Tempe. After\n1891, several local persons owned the property, including William H. Thomas, who built the\nrear addition to the house to accommodate his family of seven children. In 1904, prominent\nTempe businessman Andrew Nielsen purchased the house and used it as his residence until\n1907. George F. Kemper occupied the house for a period after 1907. Kemper had come to the\nSalt River Valley in 1874, and had worked as superintendent on several canal construction\nprojects. He also served as Maricopa County Treasurer from 1882 to 1885. He owned the\nproperty until his death in 1923.  \n \nThe E. A. Murphy House was composed of two parts: a 30-foot square wood frame structure\nwith shiplap siding, supporting a truncated hipped roof; and a clapboard addition, built\nc. 1891, with a double-pitched roof extending 25 feet from the rear of the house. The\ndesign of the Murphy House was a modest but well-detailed interpretation of the\nNeo-Colonial style, popular in the Western states during the later part of the 19th \ncentury. Characteristic features included symmetrical plan and elevations, a hipped roof\nbroken by centrally-located flush wall dormers, central entry, and classically-derived\ncornice with enclosed eave and returns at the dormers. Original details included tall\nFrench windows, transoms, hardware, decorative jig-cut attic ventilators, and wood shingle\nroof. The clapboard finished addition had a plastered gable wall at the rear and also\nincluded original doors, windows, and detailing. The addition was compatible, historically\nand architecturally, with the 1888 portion of the house.  \nGo to <u><a href=\"ahpsfile.htm\">Tempe \nHistoric Property Survey</a></u> \n","id":"a68mfee4bnhe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.944548578107,33.4215818297436]}},{"properties":{"name":"J.
