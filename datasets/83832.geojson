In order to support polar projections, the Atlas is divided into two separate map servers: one for the Northern Hemisphere and one for the Southern Hemisphere. In addition to providing map images and source data through Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC) protocols (WMS, WFS, and WCS), a dynamic web interface for exploring these data is also available at http://nsidc.org/data/atlas. If you have questions, comments or suggestions, please contact NSIDC User Services at +1.303.492.6199 or nsidc@nsidc.org. The development of this map server application was supported by NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Program under contract NAS5-03099 and was developed using MapServer, an Open Source development environment for building spatially-enabled internet applications.
