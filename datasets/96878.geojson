It doubles rail capacity on a major freight rail corridor with no increase in noise, emissions or train length, with a significant amount of the investments in this corridor coming in economically distressed areas. Allowing for double-stack trains will provide relief to congested rail and highway corridors by enabling trains to carry more freight.
