database methodology, is part of a global SOTER programme and intended to replace the FAO/Unesco 1:5 million scale Soil Map of the World (1971-1981). The original map sheets were published in 1970-1980 and were compiled on basis of information and data available at that time. It is understandable that a substantial part does not reflect the present state of knowledge of the soils in the regions. The national institutes, responsible for the natural resources inventories, have been collecting a wealth of new information on the distribution and occurrence of soils in their region, which has resulted in updating their national soil maps mostly at scale 1:1 million, often applying the Revised Legend (FAO, UNEP, ISRIC, 1988) for the description of the mapping units. The International Union of Soil Science (IUSS) adopted an important change in the classification used for the map by introducing lower levels of subunits of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS, FAO, ISRIC, 1998). This, together with the new soil data available at national level, justified such an update of the soil resources for the regional updates (South America and the Caribbean, Northeastern Africa, Southern Africa, East and Central Europe, North and Central Eurasia and Central Africa have been completed to date.<a

Since land that is very suitable for rainfed agriculture can sustain more people than land that is not suitable, it was assumed that each suitability class has its own carrying capacity regarding population. On the map, land is considered scarce if the population density is higher that the highest quintile in the density distribution for each suitability class. Land scarce areas in climates with an Aridity Index lower than 0.5 (where the Aridity Index is defined as Yearly Precipitation divided by Yearly Reference Evapotranspiration) are considered both land and water scarce.\n\nWater scarcity in irrigated areas was assessed by combining “Map 1.2: Global distribution of physical water scarcity” with the Global Map of Irrigation Areas. The areas equipped for irrigation are considered water scarce if already more than 10% of the renewable water resources in the river basin is consumed by irrigated crops.<a

Thus, in a formal sense, LGP refers to the number of days within the period of temperatures above 5°C when moisture conditions are considered adequate. \n\nUnder rain-fed conditions, the begin of the LGP is linked to the start of the rainy season. For establishing crops, 0.4 - 0.5 times the level of reference evapotranspiration is considered sufficient to meet water requirements of dryland crops (FAO 1978-81a; 1979; 1992a). \n\nThis layer is a

The map is based on six geographic datasets: • GLC2000 land cover database at 30 arc-sec (http://www-gvm.jrc.it/glc2000), using regional and global legends (JRC, 2006); • an IFPRI global land cover categorization providing 17 land cover classes at 30 arc-sec.

(FAO, 2001; FAO, 2006) at 30 arc-sec. resolution; • digital Global Map of Irrigated Areas (GMIA) version 4.0 of (FAO/University of Frankfurt) at 5’ by 5’ latitude/longitude resolution, providing by grid-cell the percentage land area equipped with irrigation infrastructure (Siebert et al., 2007); • a spatial population density inventory (30-arc seconds) for year 2000 developed by FAO-SDRN, based on spatial data of LANDSCAN 2003, with calibration to UN 2000 population figures. \nAn iterative calculation procedure has been implemented to estimate land cover class weights, consistent with aggregate FAO land statistics and spatial land cover patterns obtained from  remotely sensed data, allowing the quantification of major land use/land cover shares in individual 5’ by 5’ latitude/longitude grid cells.<a

The climatology is based on the GlobColour (http://www.globcolour.info) products obtained by the merging of MERIS MODIS and SeaWIFS data available during the period 1998-2009. \n\nThe \"Number of data\" product represents for each pixel, the number of data available when computing the chlorophyll-a concentration product by merging for each of the 12 years the selected month (April). Depending of the location of the pixel, the number of data varies from 0 to 12.\n\nThe spatial resolution of the product is about 4km.\n\nThe product has been designed and produced by ACRI-ST INFOCEAN-DESK environment monitoring service from EU FP7 &amp; ESA MyOcean GlobColour Products, ESA ENVISAT MERIS data, NASA MODIS and SeaWiFS data.\n\nThe GlobColour project has been initiated and funded by the ESA Data User Element Programme to develop a satellite based ocean colour data service to support global carbon-cycle research. The GlobColour project has largely benefited from NASA contributions, including the availability of the MODIS and SeaWiFS products; the in situ data base of radiometric and phytoplankton pigment data, and other oceanographic and atmospheric data: the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System - SeaBASS (Werdell and Bailey, 2002). The global merged chlorophyll-a concentration for case 1 water is obtained by the merging of MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS data using an advanced retrieval based on fitting an in-water bio-optical model to the merged set of observed normalised water-leaving radiances (nLw?s).

concentration for case 1 water (expressed in mg/m3). The climatology is based on the GlobColour (http://www.globcolour.info) products obtained by the merging of MERIS MODIS and SeaWIFS data available during the period 1998-2009. The \"April 2003 Anomaly\" product represents for each pixel, the difference between the chlorophyll-a concentration product by merging for each of the 12 years the considered month (April) and the chlorophyll-a concentration observed in April 1998. The difference is expressed as a percentage of change \"(April 1998 â?? April 1998-2009) / April 1998-2009\".\n\nThe spatial resolution of the product is about 4km.\n\nThe product has been designed and produced by ACRI-ST INFOCEAN-DESK environment monitoring service from EU FP7 &amp; ESA MyOcean GlobColour Products, ESA ENVISAT MERIS data, NASA MODIS and SeaWiFS data.\n\nThe GlobColour project has been initiated and funded by the ESA Data User Element Programme to develop a satellite based ocean colour data service to support global carbon-cycle research. The GlobColour project has largely benefited from NASA contributions, including the availability of the MODIS and SeaWiFS products; the in situ data base of radiometric and phytoplankton pigment data, and other oceanographic and atmospheric data: the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System - SeaBASS (Werdell and Bailey, 2002). The global merged chlorophyll-a concentration for case 1 water is obtained by the merging of MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS data using an advanced retrieval based on fitting an in-water bio-optical model to the merged set of observed normalised water-leaving radiances (nLw?s). This technique is termed GSM because it originates from the Garver et al. (1997) bio-optical model (Maritorena and Siegel, 2005).

concentration for case 1 water (expressed in mg/m3). The climatology is based on the GlobColour (http://www.globcolour.info) products obtained by the merging of MERIS MODIS and SeaWIFS data available during the period 1998-2009. \n\nThe \"Number of data\" product represents for each pixel, the number of data available when computing the chlorophyll-a concentration product by merging for each of the 12 years the selected month (April). Depending of the location of the pixel, the number of data varies from 0 to 12.\n\nThe spatial resolution of the product is about 4km.\n\nThe product has been designed and produced by ACRI-ST INFOCEAN-DESK environment monitoring service from EU FP7 &amp; ESA MyOcean GlobColour Products, ESA ENVISAT MERIS data, NASA MODIS and SeaWiFS data.\n\nThe GlobColour project has been initiated and funded by the ESA Data User Element Programme to develop a satellite based ocean colour data service to support global carbon-cycle research. The GlobColour project has largely benefited from NASA contributions, including the availability of the MODIS and SeaWiFS products; the in situ data base of radiometric and phytoplankton pigment data, and other oceanographic and atmospheric data: the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System - SeaBASS (Werdell and Bailey, 2002). The global merged chlorophyll-a concentration for case 1 water is obtained by the merging of MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS data using an advanced retrieval based on fitting an in-water bio-optical model to the merged set of observed normalised water-leaving radiances (nLw?s). This technique is termed GSM because it originates from the Garver et al. (1997) bio-optical model (Maritorena and Siegel, 2005).

The landform classes have been developed using the ITC (International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation) and SOTER (Soil and Terrain Database) methods.\nThe structure of the derived legend follows a specific criteria that allows and easy correlation between these classes and the standardised one listed in LCCS (SOTER classification first and second level). SOTER is a pure Parametric or Morphometric classification. The main origin or process of terrain units is an important descriptive element because it realtes to the dominant exogenous or endogenous processes. this aspect in a general classification gives a meaningful grouping and has analytical value. The proposed legend is structured in such a way that it can be read, not only from the Morphometric point of view as in SOTER, but also taking into account the main origin and the age of landforms (mainly derived from the lithology legend). Lithology is linked with the mapping units, but is listed seperately.

width=\"100\"></a>This is a thematic aggregation of the original full resolution Geomorphology - Landform and Lithology database which has been produced from visual interpretation of digitally enhanced LANDSAT TM images acquired mainly in the year 1999. The landform classes have been developed using the ITC (International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation) and SOTER (Soil and Terrain Database) methods. \nThis thematic aggregation groups the landform codes into broader landform units. The structure of the derived legend follows a specific criteria that allows and easy correlation between these classes and the standardised one listed in LCCS (SOTER classification first and second level). SOTER is a pure Parametric or Morphometric classification. The main origin or process of terrain units is an important descriptive element because it relates to the dominant exogenous or endogenous processes. This aspect in a general classification gives a meaningful grouping and has analytical value. The proposed legend is structured in such a way that it can be read, not only from the Morphometric point of view as in SOTER, but also taking into account the main origin and the age of landforms (mainly derived from the lithology legend). Lithology is linked with the mapping units, but is listed separately.

interpretation of digitally enhanced high-resolution LANDSAT TM images (Bands 4,3,2) acquired mainly in the year 1999. The land cover classes have been developed using the FAO/UNEP international standard LCCS classification system. This database can be analyzed in the GLCN software Advanced Database Gateway (ADG), which provides a user-friendly interface and advanced functionalities to breakdown the LCCS classes in their classifiers for further aggregations and analysis. The ADG software is available for download on the GLCN web site at http://www.glcn.org/sof_7_en.jsp.\n\nThe shape main attributes correspond to the following fields:\n-ID\n-USERLABER\n-LCCCODE (unique LCCS code)\n\nYou can download a zip archive containing:\n-the dataset rw-landcover-ge (.shp)\n-the Rwanda Classifiers Used (.pdf)\n-the Rwanda legend (.pdf and .xls)\n-the Rwanda Legend - LCCS Import file (.xls)\n-the Userlabel Definitions (.pdf)\n\nNote: the document Rwanda Classifiers Used.pdf, is a list of all the LCCS classifiers used in the study area. They are grouped under the 8 major land cover types. In addition to the standard classifiers contained in LCCS the user may find “user defined” classifiers used by the map producer to add additional information to a specific class, not available in LCCS. The user-defined attributes are always coded with the letter “Z”.<a href=\"mailto:?subject=Multipurpose%20Landcover%20Database%20for%20Rwanda%20-%20AFRICOVER&amp;body=%0ALink:%0Ahttp://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=1e0758ed-227f-4f2e-bec9-d997562e0b85%0A%0AAbstract:%0AThe%20full%20resolution%20land%20cover%20has%20been%20produced%20from%20visual%20interpretation%20of%20digitally%20enhanced%20high-resolution%20LANDSAT%20TM%20images%20(Bands%204,3,2)%20acquired%20mainly%20in%20the%20year%201999.%20The%20land%20cover%20classes%20have%20been%20developed%20using%20the%20FAO/UNEP%20international%20standard%20LCCS%20classification%20system.%20This%20database%20can%20be%20analyzed%20in%20the%20GLCN%20software%20Advanced%20Database%20Gateway%20(ADG),%20which%20provides%20a%20user-friendly%20interface%20and%20advanced%20functionalities%20to%20breakdown%20the%20LCCS%20classes%20in%20their%20classifiers%20for%20further%20aggregations%20and%20analysis.%20The%20ADG%20software%20is%20available%20for%20download%20on%20the%20GLCN%20web%20site%20at%20http://www.glcn.org/sof_7_en.jsp.%20The%20shape%20main%20attributes%20correspond%20to%20the%20following%20fields:%20-ID%20-USERLABER%20-LCCCODE%20(unique%20LCCS%20code)%20You%20can%20download%20a%20zip%20archive%20containing:%20-the%20dataset%20rw-landcover-ge%20(.shp)%20-the%20Rwanda%20Classifiers%20Used%20(.pdf)%20-the%20Rwanda%20legend%20(.pdf%20and%20.xls)%20-the%20Rwanda%20Legend%20-%20LCCS%20Import%20file%20(.xls)%20-the%20Userlabel%20Definitions%20(.pdf)%20Note:%20the%20document%20Rwanda%20Classifiers%20Used.pdf,%20is%20a%20list%20of%20all%20the%20LCCS%20classifiers%20used%20in%20the%20study%20area.%20They%20are%20grouped%20under%20the%208%20major%20land%20cover%20types.%20In%20addition%20to%20the%20standard%20classifiers%20contained%20in%20LCCS%20the%20user%20may%20find%20%E2%80%9Cuser%20defined%E2%80%9D%20classifiers%20used%20by%20the%20map%20producer%20to%20add%20additional%20information%20to%20a%20specific%20class,%20not%20available%20in%20LCCS.%20The%20user-defined%20attributes%20are%20always%20coded%20with%20the%20letter%20%E2%80%9CZ%E2%80%9D.\"><img src=\"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork/images/mail.png\" alt=\"Send a reference to this record by email\" title=\"Send a reference to this record by email\"></a><a href=\"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=1e0758ed-227f-4f2e-bec9-d997562e0b85\"><img src=\"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork/images/bookmark.png\" alt=\"Permanent link to this description\" title=\"Permanent link to this description\"></a><a href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=1e0758ed-227f-4f2e-bec9-d997562e0b85&amp;title=Multipurpose%20Landcover%20Database%20for%20Rwanda%20-%20AFRICOVER&amp;notes=The%20full%20resolution%20land%20cover%20has%20been%20produced%20from%20visual%20interpretation%20of%20digitally%20enhanced%20high-resolution%20LANDSAT%20TM%20images%20(Bands%204,3,2)%20acquired%20mainly%20in%20the%20year%201999.%20\"><img src=\"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork/images/delicious.gif\" alt=\"Bookmark on Delicious\" title=\"Bookmark on Delicious\"></a><a href=\"http://digg.com/submit?url=http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=1e0758ed-227f-4f2e-bec9-d997562e0b85&amp;title=Multipurpose%20Landcover%20Database%20for%20Rwanda%20-%20AFRICOVER&amp;bodytext=The%20full%20resolution%20land%20cover%20has%20been%20produced%20from%20visual%20interpretation%20of%20digitally%20enhanced%20high-resolution%20LANDSAT%20TM%20images%20(Bands%204,3,2)%20acquired%20mainly%20in%20the%20year%201999.&amp;topic=environment\"><img src=\"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork/images/digg.gif\" alt=\"Bookmark on Digg\" title=\"Bookmark on Digg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=1e0758ed-227f-4f2e-bec9-d997562e0b85\"><img src=\"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork/images/facebook.gif\" alt=\"Bookmark on Facebook\" title=\"Bookmark on Facebook\"></a><a href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=1e0758ed-227f-4f2e-bec9-d997562e0b85&amp;title=Multipurpose%20Landcover%20Database%20for%20Rwanda%20-%20AFRICOVER\"><img src=\"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork/images/stumbleupon.gif\" alt=\"Bookmark on StumbleUpon\" title=\"Bookmark on StumbleUpon\"></a>","link:alternate (application/word)":null,"link:alternate (application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml)":null,"link":"http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=1e0758ed-227f-4f2e-bec9-d997562e0b85","id":"19","link:alternate (WWW:DOWNLOAD-1.0-http--download)":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[28.8544,-2.82549],[30.8933,-2.82549],[30.8933,-1.05445],[28.8544,-1.05445],[28.8544,-2.82549]]]}}],"is_temporal":true,"author":{"url":null,"metadata":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"source":null,"contact_phone":null},"source":null,"pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-14T20:58:05-04:00","id":204694}
