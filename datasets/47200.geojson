Here comes this bedraggled Bill Murray look-a-like, walking down the beach towards me. God knows how long he had to walk from the VABCH bar area to get where we were, but he was coming straight towards us, and I\\'m all bowed up ready to take him down, WITH a gaggling child on my back if he starts getting freaky. Turns out he was just wanting to tell me \"Hey man, look at all the dolphins out there...\" and then he goes and jumps in the water and swims towards them. Alrighteeee-then. Walks over.
