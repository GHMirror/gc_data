NOAA's ArcView\n           ChartViewer extension was used to display the reprojected\n           nautical charts in ArcView v3.2. Subject areas were then\n           digitized off the individual nautical charts and merged\n           into a single dataset/shapefile which covers the entire state.\n           Completed December, 2002.\nThis dataset was collected from the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program: The Office of Planning GIS Program leads a multi-agency effort to establish, promote, and coordinate the use of geographic information systems (GIS) technology among Hawaii State Government agencies.
