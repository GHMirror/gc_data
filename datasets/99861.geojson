a nuclear power plant after its cooling system failed following today's massive earthquake.\nAfter the magnitude 8.9 earthquake rocked Japan today, a \"state of emergency\" was declared at the Fukushima No 1 power plant.\nThe Fukushima reactor, around 30 miles inland from the coast in north-east Japan, suffered a failure in its cooling system.\nThe World Nuclear Association later reported the situation was under control, and water was being pumped into the cooling system.\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the top government spokesman, said the nuclear power plant developed a mechanical failure in the system needed to cool the reactor after it was shut down.\nHe said the measure was a precaution as there was was no radiation leak and the facility was not in immediate danger.\nMore than 2,800 people were ordered to evacuate after the government's declaration of a state of emergency at the plant.\nThe nuclear safety agency says plant workers are scrambling to restore cooling water supply at the . There was no prospect for an immediate success.\nThe plant experienced a mechanical failure in the backup power generation system to supply water needed to cool the reactor. The reactor core remains hot even after a shutdown.\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said that the plant was not in immediate danger of radiation leak.\nThe plant is in Onahama city, about 170 miles north-east of Tokyo.\nThe plant is just south of the worst-hit Miyagi prefecture, where a fire broke out at another nuclear plant.\nThe blaze was in a turbine building at one of the Onagawa power plants; smoke could be seen coming out of the building, which is separate from the plant's reactor, Tohoku Electric Power Co said. It has since been extinguished.\nAnother plant at Onagawa is experiencing a water leak.<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/03/11/japan-earthquake-causes-fire-at-nuclear-plant-115875-22982285/\">www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/03/11/japan-earthq...</a>\n1イエスは、神殿から出て行った彼の方法で行っていた。弟子たちはイエスに寺の建物を見るには、彼になった。 \n図2は、しかし、彼は彼らに答えた、\"そのダウンスローされませんが、ここに一つの石の別のないままにしないあなたは？は、ほとんど確かに私はあなたを伝えるすべてこれらの事を参照してくださいしないでください。\" \n3は、彼はオリーブ山に座ると、弟子たちは言った、個人的に彼に来て、\"教えて、ときにこれらの事になりますか？何が、あなたの今後の符号であり、時代の終わりの？\" \n4イエスは、誰も道に迷ってあなたを導くように注意してください\"、彼らに答えた。 \nと言って、私の名前で来る多くは、'私はイエスキリストを午前、'5は、多くの道に迷ってつながる。 \n6これで、戦争や戦争のうわさを聞くことができます。このすべてが起こらなければならないのあなたは、困っていないことを最後にされていませんを参照してください。 \n国は7に示すように、国に対して上昇し、王国に対する国および飢饉、疫病、地震の様々な場所にはあり得ないでしょう。 \n8しかし、これらすべてのものは産みの苦しみの始まりです。 \n図9は、その後、彼らは、抑圧することをお届けしますあなたを殺すでしょう。あなたは私の名前のために国のすべてから憎まれるだろう。 \n図10は、その後多くは、つまずき、1つ上の別の配信になり、お互いを憎むだろう。 \n11多くの偽預言者は、発生する多くの道に迷ってつながる。 \n不義をお掛けいたしますので、12に示すように、多くの愛が寒くなるでしょう。 \n13しかし、彼は最後まで耐え忍ぶ者は、同じことが保存されます。 \nイギリスの14このグッドニュースは、すべての国との証言に全世界に宣べ伝えられるでしょうし、終わりが来る。 \n（読者が理解させ）神聖な場所に立って、ダニエルによって預言者ムハンマドの話されていた15が\"すると、そのためには、荒廃の醜態を、{12時11分;

He's an amateur photographer and a student of me. After doing a week of research, we decided to go to Thor's well first. After 12 hours of drive from Pullman, WA to Yachats, OR, we FAILED the first time we went down to the Thor's Well. The tide and the waves are so high and vigorous that there is no way we can approach the hole. We are all wet yet the situation was too dangerous to proceed. Therefore, we decided to take a rest at a inn in Newport, OR and go to the Thor's Well again at the noon time of next day. We checked that's the time for lowest tide, and we are able to stand close to the hole itself finally. Still, there are waves that occasionally strikes so high that is ridiculous. Mostly due to the tsunami and high wind warning, a local resident approached us and told us \"People come to Oregon may die...\" We thank for his kindness and stayed for one more hour until the tide is going back up. The weather is rainy and stormy. This is the most dangerous photo that is taken in my life yet, as an unexpected wave can always happen to drag us into that 20-feet tall hole, then to the Pacific Ocean.\nA self-note is that this is the day after the 8.9 magnitude earthquake in Sentai, Japan, which is why the tsunami warning's in place. A deep condolences to all the people who are dead and lost their homes in this natural disaster.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/keithano/5524763837/","id":"64"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.112205,44.282693]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5525310204","title":"南三陸町  Gardener just outside Minamisanriku, Motoyoshi District, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan , doomed town.

Luckily Google streetview obscures peoples faces, but still, this is (was?) a real person working in their garden, RIGHT IN THE PATH of where the Tsunami hit. For all that, it looks a lot like our family does in our garden. The raw numbers of the quake mean little,  when you see the individual stories and see the footage of the tsunami swallowing people's lives, it breaks your heart.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jezevec/5525310204/","id":"65"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[141.446056,38.673315]}},{"properties":{"title":"Misawa Sailors Begin Cleanup at Local Fishing Port [Image 1 of 17","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5525634961","published":{"end_time":"2011/03/14 09:04:52 -0400","original":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 06:04:51 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/03/14 09:04:51 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/dvids/\">DVIDSHUB</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dvids/5525634961/\" title=\"Misawa Sailors Begin Cleanup at Local Fishing Port [Image 1 of 17\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5525634961_06c86889ff_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"171\" alt=\"Misawa Sailors Begin Cleanup at Local Fishing Port [Image 1 of 17\"></a>\n\nAssigned to Naval Air Facility Misawa, Japan Petty Officer 2nd Class John Dicola, aeriographer's mate, from New York, assists in removing debris during a cleanup effort at the Misawa Fishing Port.

Apesar de nenhuma legislação anterior ter especificado uma bandeira nacional, o disco solar já era de facto a bandeira do Japão. Duas proclamações foram publicadas em 1870 pelo Daijō-kan, o corpo de governo do início da era Meiji, cada uma com uma providência para a criação da bandeira nacional. Uma bandeira com um disco solar foi adotada como bandeira nacional por navios mercantes sob a Proclamação Nº57 de Meiji 3 (publicada em 27 de fevereiro de 1870), e como bandeira nacional usada pela Marinha sob a Proclamação Nº651 de Meiji 3 (publicada em 27 de outubro de 1870). O uso do Hinomaru foi severamente restringido durante os primeiros anos da ocupação estadunidense após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ainda que relaxando essas restrições mais tarde.\nNo começo da história do Japão, o Hinomaru foi utilizado nas bandeiras dos daimyos e samurais. Durante a Restauração Meiji, tanto o disco solar como a Bandeira do Sol Nascente da Marinha Imperial do Japão se tornaram símbolos maiores no emergente Império do Japão. Pôsteres de propaganda, textos e filmes mostravam a bandeira como uma fonte de orgulho e patriotismo. Nas casas japonesas, pedia-se que os cidadãos hasteassem a bandeira durante feriados nacionais, celebrações e outras ocasiões como decretado pelo governo. Diferentes sinais de devoção ao Japão e seu imperador sob o Hinomaru se tornaram populares durante a Segunda Guerra Sino-Japonesa e outros conflitos. Esses símbolos surgiram de slogans escritos na bandeira para roupas e pratos que carregavam a bandeira.\nA percepção pública da bandeira nacional varia. Para alguns japoneses, a bandeira representa o Japão, e nenhuma outra bandeira poderia tomar o seu lugar. Todavia, a bandeira não é frequentemente hasteada devido à sua associação com o nacionalismo extremo. O uso da bandeira e o hino nacional Kimigayo foram um assunto contencioso para as escolas públicas do Japão logo após a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Disputas sobre o seu uso levaram a protestos, processos e pelo menos um suicídio na prefeitura de Hiroshima.\nPara os habitantes de Okinawa, a bandeira representa os eventos da guerra e a subsequente presença militar dos Estados Unidos. Para as nações ocupadas pelo Japão, a bandeira é um símbolo de agressão e imperialismo. O Hinomaru foi usado como uma arma contra as nações ocupadas para propósitos de intimidação e subjugação. Durante protestos contra a política externa do Japão, como em contestações de territórios, a bandeira foi queimada por chineses e coreanos em seus países. Apesar das conotações negativas, fontes ocidentais e japonesas apresentam a bandeira como um poderoso símbolo do Japão. Alguns estandartes militares do Japão são baseados no Hinomaru, incluindo a Bandeira Naval, com seus raios solares. O Hinomaru também serve de modelo para outras bandeiras no Japão para uso público e privado.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonycunha/5529303769/","id":"141"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-48.211784,-24.598328]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5529284307","title":"Sailors help local Misawa population in relief effort.","published":{"end_time":"2011/03/15 13:37:05 -0400","original":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 10:37:04 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/03/15 13:37:04 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/usnavy/\">Official U.S. Navy Imagery</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnavy/5529284307/\" title=\"Sailors help local Misawa population in relief effort.\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5529284307_4631dc04eb_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"171\" alt=\"Sailors help local Misawa population in relief effort.\"></a>\n\nMISAWA, Japan (March 15, 2011) Sailors assigned to Naval Air Facility Misawa help a Misawa City employee transport salvageable fishing equipment at the Misawa Fishing Port.

This product is all-age-consuming and good for its beneficial. The edible bird's nests are become the most expensive animal products consumed by humans. The nests have been used in Chinese cooking for over 400 years, most often as bird's nest soup or other variants of herbal and medical foods.\nThere are three different types of edible swallow nest: cave swiftlet, the feathered swallow and grass swiftlet. Swallow nest is also classified according to its colors: white, blood-red and yellow, even grey and purple. \nDifferent colors have different grade in selling but indeed having the same beneficial. \nBird’s nest is the food of the rich. It contains a cell division inducing hormone and an epithelial growth factor that can stimulate the growth and division of cells, thereby enhancing tissue growth, cellular regeneration and cell-mediated immunity in humans.\nMahoni.com, this time, wants to share how this product is really brilliant to consume. That is why, this application have been made in order to show All About Bird’s Nest. \nThis application is a free downloaded for iPad user, and there will be description about the swiftlet, the nest, and the different of the types, the products and even the recipes for each product. \nBy this application, Mahoni.com wants to take part to give healthy information to the people who concern to healthiness and the fact is, this is healthy. \n---------------\nThe Swiftlet bird or scientifically named Collocalia, or known as Walet in Indonesia, is belongs to the Apodidae family, which is not the same as the common Swallow bird. Swiftlet birds live in flocks along tropical seaside and consume wild insects. \nThe average body length of a Swiftlet is 9 centimeters, about half the size of a Swallow. Swiftlet has a shorter and rectangular-sharped tail while Swallow has a longer and forked tail. The average life span of a Swiftlet is about 15 to 18 years. Its age influences the quality of its nest. In general, the older the bird is, the more simmer-tolerant the nest is.\nSwallows live in the northern part of the earth, commonly seen in China, India, Europe and North America. Swallows make their nest from tiny tree branches, dry grass, or even mud, and their nests are certainly not edible. Meanwhile, an edible-nest swiftlets, which can only be found in the tropical coastal areas, make their nests by regurgitating the saliva. \nThe swiflets make their nest by producing it from their saliva, produced by a pair of large salivery glands under the tongue, which can be hardened when it exposed to air. . The precious swiftlet nests are therefore actually the dried saliva of swiftlets, and they are the only swallow's nests constructed entirely from saliva. It is the only edible swallow's nest beneficial to human body. \nHence, swallow's nest is also referred to as bird's nest. These edible nests built by swiftlets are found in caves and cliffs in offshore islands of North Borneo, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. Small colonies of swiftlets are also found in some remote areas of Hainan and Fukien of China. The nests are built during the breeding season by the male swiftlet over a period of 35 days. They take the shape of a shallow cup stuck to the cave wall. In addition to cave swallows, there are also house swallows farmed in these areas. \nSwallow nests that originate from different places have different textures.\nThe edible bird's nests are become the most expensive animal products consumed by humans. The nests have been used in Chinese cooking for over 400 years, most often as bird's nest soup or other variants of herbal and medical foods.\n-----------\nartwork by <a href=\"http://www.indonesiafinedesign.com/\">www.indonesiafinedesign.com/</a>\nCreative Solution For Your Business.\nI'm a freelance web and graphic designer located in Surabaya Eastjava.

This district has some of the most dramatic sceneries in Norway. This view struck me when I was passing by, and I just had to stop my car and make a photo.\nBehind the mountains to the left, an arm of Langefjorden, Eresfjorden, continues into the valley Eikesdalen. Here are some the most famous of all Norwegian waterfall, Mardøla or Mardalsfossene. (Østre Mardalsfossen is the highest waterfall in Northern Europe with a combined fall of 700 m, highest free fall is approx. 250 m.) \nThis place just below my viewpoint, Tjelle, was hit by one of the worst tsunami disasters in Norway in modern time. In 1756, 15 million cubic meters of rock fell into the water, the resulting tsunamis reached 15 m above normal sea level. 32 people were killed.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ystenes/3019720917/","id":"a6365d8ewvjy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[7.888612,62.769791]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5908031031","title":"Tsunami by Jacek Wankowski","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/06 07:38:00 -0400","original":"Wed, 06 Jul 2011 04:37:00 -0700","granularity":"min","time":"2011/07/06 07:37:00 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/helensanders/\">f1jherbert</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5908031031/\" title=\"Tsunami by Jacek Wankowski\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6007/5908031031_9f199b10ed_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Tsunami by Jacek Wankowski\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5908031031/","id":"a6365da2ogq8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.780458,50.835859]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5908590990","title":"Tsunami by Jacek Wankowski","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/06 07:38:41 -0400","original":"Wed, 06 Jul 2011 04:38:40 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/06 07:38:40 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/helensanders/\">f1jherbert</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5908590990/\" title=\"Tsunami by Jacek Wankowski\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5272/5908590990_235c07e409_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Tsunami by Jacek Wankowski\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5908590990/","id":"a6365dhcgsvv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.780458,50.835859]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5908359156","title":"Tsunami 2 by Jacek Wankowski","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/06 05:27:02 -0400","original":"Wed, 06 Jul 2011 02:27:01 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/06 05:27:01 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/helensanders/\">f1jherbert</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5908359156/\" title=\"Tsunami 2 by Jacek Wankowski\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/5908359156_a9ea12ffa5_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Tsunami 2 by Jacek Wankowski\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5908359156/","id":"a6365d6ibim6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.780458,50.835859]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5907804297","title":"Tsunami 2 by Jacek Wankowski","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/06 05:28:42 -0400","original":"Wed, 06 Jul 2011 02:28:41 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/06 05:28:41 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/helensanders/\">f1jherbert</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5907804297/\" title=\"Tsunami 2 by Jacek Wankowski\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5313/5907804297_0ecd483a2e_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Tsunami 2 by Jacek Wankowski\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helensanders/5907804297/","id":"a6365dj938e8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.780458,50.835859]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5907129939","title":"Tsunami Heights Markers, Taro, Iwate 田老　岩手","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/05 23:53:56 -0400","original":"Tue, 05 Jul 2011 20:53:55 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/05 23:53:55 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/anaguma/\">anaguma</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anaguma/5907129939/\" title=\"Tsunami Heights Markers, Taro, Iwate 田老　岩手\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5907129939_3239db8685_m.jpg\" width=\"159\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Tsunami Heights Markers, Taro, Iwate 田老　岩手\"></a>\n\nBoth he 1933 (lower) and 1896 (upper) markers had the writing worn off by the gravel and debris carried in the tsunami.
