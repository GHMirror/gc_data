More than 46,000 protesters rally in a march on the state capitol at Columbia, South Carolina, to protest the Confederate battle flag flying atop the statehouse dome. NAACP chair Kweisi Mfume, the main speaker at the event, called it the greatest civil rights rally since the 1960s. In August 1999, the NAACP had called for a national boycott of vacation spots in South Carolina in an attempt to force the state government to remove the Confederate flag from the dome of its statehouse. Controversy on this issue grows, involving the flying of the Confederate flag in other southern states as well.

She had two children and lived a rather quiet life until 1988, when she returned to Burma to nurse her dying mother. There the mass slaughter of protesters against the brutal and unresponsive rule of the military strongman U Ne Win led her to speak out against him and to begin a nonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights. In July 1989 the military government of the newly named Union of Myanmar placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest and held her incommunicado. The military offered to free her if she agreed to leave Myanmar, but she refused to do so until the country was returned to civilian government and political prisoners were freed. The newly formed group with which she became affiliated, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won more than 80 percent of the parliamentary seats that were contested in 1990, but the results of that election were ignored by the military government.\nBorn June 19, 1945, Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68vrtel78os"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[96.150001,16.79]}},{"properties":{"name":"Automatic Gas Company","description":"Posted by Green_atlasLiquified Petroleum Gas (PROPANE) Refueling Station, Public 2800 S Green Street, Longview TX 75602 903-753-1612 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68vrt57sy85"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.727535,32.455657]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aveda Lifestlye Salon and Store","description":"Posted by Transfairusa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> fair trade<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68vrt7dop0j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.094707,38.980972]}},{"properties":{"name":"Avista Clarkston Service Center","description":"Posted by Green_atlasCompressed Natural Gas (CNG) Refueling Station, Private access only 1330 Fair Street, Clarkston WA 99403 509-495-2772 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68vrtcmv450"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.060413,46.421749]}},{"properties":{"name":"Back to Back Cafe","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/74490484_8ce9402b5b_s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Worker Owned!PAWC Directory: We are a worker owned cafe serving a diverse customer base in the central eastside of Portland.

President Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act, the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. It prohibits discrimination of all kinds based on race, color, religion, or national origin. (1964), comprehensive U.S. legislation intended to end discrimination based on race, colour, religion, or national origin; it is often called the most important U.S. law on civil rights since Reconstruction (1865–77). Title I of the act guarantees equal voting rights by removing registration requirements and procedures biased against minorities and the underprivileged. Title II prohibits segregation or discrimination in places of public accommodation involved in interstate commerce. Title VII bans discrimination by trade unions, schools, or employers involved in interstate commerce or doing business with the federal government. The latter section also applies to discrimination on the basis of sex and established a government agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to enforce these provisions. The act also calls for the desegregation of public schools (Title IV), broadens the duties of the Civil Rights Commission (Title V), and assures nondiscrimination in the distribution of funds under federally assisted programs (Title VI). The Civil Rights Act was a highly controversial issue in the United States as soon as it was proposed by President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Although Kennedy was unable to secure passage of the bill in Congress, a stronger version was eventually passed with the urging of his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the bill into law on July 2, 1964, following one of the longest debates in Senate history. White groups opposed to integration with blacks responded to the act with a significant backlash that took the form of protests, increased support for pro-segregation candidates for public office, and some racial violence. The constitutionality of the act was immediately challenged and was upheld by the Supreme Court in the test case Heart of Atlanta Motel v. U.S. (1964). The act gave federal law enforcement agencies the power to prevent racial discrimination in employment, voting, and the use of public facilities.

Between 2002 and 2005, protests against the Iraq war were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet, the United States and worldwide public opinion.\nThese anti-war demonstrations were mainly organised by anti-war groups, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan, though in some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the State. Europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters, including a rally of 3 million people in Rome, Italy which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally. [1]On March 20, 2003, the day after the invasion of Iraq had begun, thousands of protests and demonstrations were held around the world in opposition to the war in Iraq. In many cases, these protests were known as \"Day X\" protests, reflecting the fact that they had been organized to occur when war started, what ever day that might have been.\n[edit]\nUnited States\n\n\n\nProtesters attend a demonstration in Washington DC against President Bush\\'s Iraq policy.\nIn some U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, New York, and Portland, Oregon, demonstrators blocked traffic in the city centers with the goal of shutting the cities down, resulting in the arrests of over 3,000 people nationwide. In other cities, such as Boston, Atlanta, and Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, demonstrations were more peaceful. In still other cities, people engaged in counter-demonstrations in support of the war.\nIn San Francisco, 5,000 protesters, having planned weeks in advance to shut down the city on \"Day X\", blockaded the Financial District resulting in 2,000 arrests. Other protesters, marching as a black bloc, attacked and loot<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img

Her father, a leader of a peasant organization opposed to Guatemala\\'s military government, died in a fire while protesting human-rights abuses by the military. Her younger brother was kidnapped, tortured, and killed by a military death squad in 1979, and her mother was kidnapped, raped, mutilated, and murdered by soldiers the following year. Menchu fled to Mexico in 1981 and was cared for there by members of a liberal Roman Catholic group. She soon joined international efforts to make the Guatemalan government cease its brutal counterinsurgency campaigns against Indian peasants, becoming a skilled public speaker and organizer in the course of her efforts.\n\nMenchu gained international prominence in 1983 with her widely translated book I, Rigoberta Menchu, in which she tells the story of her impoverished youth and recounts in horrifying detail the torture-murders of her brother and mother. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 for her continuing efforts to achieve social justice and mutual reconciliation in Guatemala. In the late 1990s her autobiography became the centre of controversy after its veracity was questioned, most notably by David Stoll in Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans (1999). Despite alleged inaccuracies in her story, Menchu continued to earn praise for bringing international attention to the situation in Guatemala. In 2004 she accepted President Oscar Berger\\'s offer to help implement the country\\'s peace accords.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68vrt1x12ik"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.263672,14.944785]}},{"properties":{"name":"Roche Brothers","description":"Posted by Transfairusa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> fair trade<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68vrt7ctdx4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.450764,42.474355]}},{"properties":{"name":"Seale Bound and Gagged","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/chicago_conspiracy_trial/images/bobby_seale_bound.jpg\">Chicago, Illinois1969. Black Panther Party cofounder Bobby Seale is ordered bound and gagged by the judge after Seale protests that he was being denied his constitutional right to counsel during his trial for conspiracy to incite rioting at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago the previous year.\n Seale was one of a generation of young African-American radicals who broke away from the traditionally nonviolent Civil Rights Movement to preach a doctrine of militant black empowerment. Following the dismissal of murder charges against him in 1971, Seale somewhat moderated his more militant views and devoted his time to effecting change from within the system.\n\nSeale grew up in Dallas and in California. Following service in the U.S. Air Force, he entered Merritt College, in Oakland, Calif. There his radicalism took root in 1962, when he first heard Malcolm X speak. Seale helped found the Black Panthers in 1966. Noted for their violent views, they also ran medical clinics and served free breakfasts to school children, among other programs.\n\nIn 1969 Seale was indicted in Chicago for conspiracy to incite riots during the Democratic national convention the previous year. The court refused to allow him to have his choice of lawyer. When Seale repeatedly rose to insist that he was being denied his constitutional right to counsel, the judge ordered him bound and gagged. He was convicted of 16 counts of contempt and sentenced to four years in prison. In 1970–71 he and a codefendant were tried for the 1969 murder of a Black Panther suspected of being a police informer. The six-month-long trial ended with a hung jury.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Seale renounced violence as a means to an end and announced his intention to work within the political process. He ran for mayor of Oakland in 1973, finishing second. As the Black Panther Party faded from public view, Seale took on a quieter role, working to improve social services in black neighbourhoods and to improve the environment. Seale\\'s writings include such diverse works as Seize the Time (1970), a history of the Black Panther movement and Barbeque\\'n with Bobby (1988), a cookbook.

The protest, denouncing China\\'s economic instability and political corruption, was violently suppressed by armed soldiers ordered into Beijing by the PRC government.\nAlthough student protests had been occurring for over a year, the famous protest began in mid-April 1989. It was triggered by the death of Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the CCP between 1981 and 1987. Hu was forced to resign by Deng Xiaoping because of his soft attitude toward the student unrest in 1986. He was widely respected among students and intellectuals.

Saturday, October 13 was International Stop Star Wars day, a day called by the Global Network Against Weapons &amp; Nuclear Power in Space to protest the militarization of space.\nProtesters gathered in 19 nations to call for the end of star wars research and development, and the end of the intervention in Afghanistan. Though the Stop Star Wars Day had been planned for over a year, organizers combined the day with a call for a peaceful and legal solution to the recent terrorist attacks. Thousands of demonstrators gathered to call for no war in Central Asia and no missile defense, instead, for the funding of human needs.\n\nIn London around five thousand demonstrators, chanting \"No war, we want peace,\" marched through the center city on Saturday. In New York, hundreds gathered in Washington Square Park for a rally against military retaliation and star wars. One of the speakers was Michio Kaku, a physicist at City University of New York.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68vrt41lwjb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.997555,40.730674]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where Martin Luther King Jr. Delivered the I have a Dream speech","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/fbca3bc93e32640db7c1cb47eb1ba596.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. acknowledges the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial for his \"I Have a Dream\" speech during the March on Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1963.
