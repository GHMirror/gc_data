Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, located in West Palm Beach, Florida, is one of the premier performing arts centers in the Southeast with a growing national and international reputation. True to the spirit in which it was created, the Center is expanding programming by initiating projects on local, national and international levels. The world-class Kravis Center opened fully funded, with a total construction cost of 8 million, of which a remarkable 9 million came from private individuals and corporations. The Kravis Center is a success story that provides communities worldwide with an example of a thriving performing arts center and a major community and economic catalyst. Set on 10.6 acres of property at the highest point in the city, the Kravis Center includes three venues -- the 2,193-seat Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr. Concert Hall, the flexible 300-seat Rinker Playhouse and the outdoor Michael and Andrew Gosman Amphitheatre with a capacity for 1,400 patrons. Additionally, the Kravis Center facilities include the Cohen Pavilion, which houses the Weiner Banquet Center meeting and banquet facility and The Picower Foundation Arts Education Center, along with a five-level parking garage.\r\rFall 2005 marks the Center\\'s 14th season and the number of events hosted annually has grown to more than 800, with attendance of more than 500,000 patrons. Many regionally based arts organizations call the Kravis Center their home including Ballet Florida, Miami City Ballet, Palm Beach Broadway Series, Palm Beach Opera, and the Palm Beach Pops. During the 2005-2006 season, the Kravis Center itself will present more than 350 performances featuring acclaimed artists from every discipline. Established as a leading force in the social fabric of the community, its many outreach programs are as broad and varied as the community itself. To date, the Center has opened the door to the performing arts for more than 1 million schoolchildren as well as thousands of economically disadvantaged senior citizens, minorities and community groups. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.kravis.org%5C'\">www.kravis.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6nxiuc0cg8q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.059042,26.706158]}},{"properties":{"name":"Norton Museum of Art","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1451 S Olive Ave, West Palm Beach, FLNorton Museum of Art (561) 832-5196<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6nxiu9z31z9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.052453,26.700661]}},{"properties":{"name":"Okeeheelee Park, West Palm Beach","description":"Posted by Astrorob<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/0/Dobpng_6_.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This park blows me away!
