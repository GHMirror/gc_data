An extensive variety of exhibits and programs featuring art, historical items, speakers, and artist will be highlighted throughout the year.  The Museum will keynote multiculturalism by emphasizing the positive contributions of many races and cultures while incorporating the African American segment.  Our mission is “Fellowship through Education”.  When people learn about the positive contributions of others regardless of race or gender, it affords us the opportunity to appreciate our differences and celebrate our similarities.  The Museum will be one of the vehicles that teach the earth’s human inhabitants that they are brothers and sisters under one big blue sky.  Come view and join the journey!
