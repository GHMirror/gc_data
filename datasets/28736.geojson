I went through the third and fourth grades while learning how to ride a bike, kiss gyrls, and throw dirt clauds at my hated neighbors. The Cult of Sack was a neighborhood secret society that was shared amongst my sibling friends. We would trample through the gullies and creeks around the borio, smiting any foe who stood in our way. the original NES was released while I lived here. I remember other kids in the neighborhood getting the console. Their living rooms would fill up with kids from around the area gauking at the new toy. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4hy63fe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14376,47.67482]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dancing atm","description":"Posted by Parkerburnmill<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/09/0/image_upload_86_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Dancing atm<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4pr8ch7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.6756,45.55193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Down Down Up","description":"Posted by Parkerburnmill<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46886164@N00/257728228/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/100/257728228_68388d0821_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4iia2sf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.68426,45.52381]}},{"properties":{"name":"Driving to Work","description":"Posted by ParkerburnmillI was on my way to work and I turned on the radio to NPR.

Over the years in an attempt to slow down those who consistently treat Embarcadero like a freeway, the city has erected a dizzying array of \"slow down\" signs, flashing signs that tell you your speed and endless reminders that the road has a 25 mph limit.\r\n\r\nPolice can now use radar on parts of Embarcadero, but before 2001 is was prohibited by state law.  The 25 mph speed limit and 38 mph average speed would have designated it as a \"speed trap\" according to state law.  When police asked that the speed limit be raised to 35 so they could get out the speed guns, residents were solidly opposed.  Similar debates took place over the speed limits on Alma, Middlefield and Arastradero.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the city has come up with all sorts of ideas to slow drivers down other than tickets.  At one point, the council seriously studied cutting the road to one lane in each direction and placing roundabouts down its length (the .5 million pricetag slowed that plan down).  Median strips and bike lanes have also been called for repeatedly.  But still, the road remains the same---a small morality test for drivers each day who must ignore a barriage of slow down reminders as they speed their way to and fro the 101.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4qpyapp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15208,37.43962]}},{"properties":{"name":"Erie and Wood","description":"Posted by ParkerburnmillSt. Louis<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4npqfk3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.672261,41.893005]}},{"properties":{"name":"Feel nature","description":"Posted by Parkerburnmill<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4fwupt6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14806,37.4397]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fire","description":"Posted by Parkerburnmill<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/09/0/image_upload_68_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> bonfire, Fire, burning coals, smoke<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4er89ji"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.6586,45.55642]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gas","description":"Posted by Parkerburnmill<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/09/0/image_upload_79_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Pickup price O gas<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4kkufgb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.6735,45.5589]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gingerman","description":"Posted by Parkerburnmill<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/144/359712535_efccd0d1b4_o.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4sv9gzt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.65895,41.95002]}},{"properties":{"name":"Globe","description":"Posted by Parkerburnmill<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/09/0/image_upload_76_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Globe, kareoke bonus, boom box, xray bonus<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6c8m4f5e9t8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.6587,45.55624]}},{"properties":{"name":"Heavy.

John McLoughin \"The Father of Oregon\" - Van-cruiser. \r\n3-6-0 nucka\r\n\r\nOregon Trail has two endings. If you go over the land route you end in Oregon City if you shoot the cascades you end in Fort Vancouver. Both endings have the same pic of Mt. Hood! \r\n\r\nVancouver Wa. would have to be the capitol of Cascadia for many different reasons. \r\n\r\na) we would have to establish a new graffic standard in architecture. We require vast open spaces that are accessable to the populace. This new spectacle should have some sort of historic barometer to bolster the foundation of the Cascadian icon. Vancouver is by no doubt the center of metropolitan growth from Yeurba Buena (San Fransisco/Oakland) to Vancouver Island. \r\n\r\nb) We have to acknowledge the power of the Columbia. It is the source of our economic fortitude. Deep ports, Hydroelectricity and nature conservation would all be priority issues and should be give the respect that only Vancouver is able to exemplify. \r\n\r\nc)Vancouver is a symbolic military post. Marshall and Roosevelt drafted the Pacific Theatre of Operations from Vancouver. Some argue that the Army AirForce was sharpened as a tactical weapon at Peirson Airport. When the Russians came west on the first transpolar flight they landed in Vancouver. The Kaiser Liberty ships were built on this side of the river. \r\n\r\nd) even the beer industry was started by the Nor\\'Westers and Hudson\\'s Bay employees (Vancouver) \r\n\r\ne) We got the Ross Complex and the rest of the BPA infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTrojan is in Oregon. \r\n\r\nThe capitol is not as interesting as taking all the fissionable and radioactive material in the region and loading it onto freight trains. Drive it up past the continental divide and unhook the box cars.\r\n\r\nThey moved the reactor but the spent fuel rods are on your side of the River. \r\n\r\nCascadia would portion resources for the construction of monoliths and architectural nuevo. Avante garde physical environments and organic preservation that is considerably more harmonious than the current thread of thought. Ban GMO\\'s, redesign hydroelectric harvesting, upgrade and prolong the life span of infrastructure, build a high speed train from Alaska to San Fransisco, erect skyscrapers that lay down into draw bridges, suspend domes over neighborhoods. Sponsor safe, efficient and profitable space tourism. Build swimming pools with four story water slides in everyones backyard.\r\n\r\nFrostitute and I were both born in Portland and our roots are Oregon in origin. We both grew up in the \\'couv and King county. I can\\'t say Washington is better, we have our problems. Oregon is wild and less dense. Washington has higher altitudes and a greater propensity for volcanic eradication. \r\n\r\nOregon has- \r\nFull liqour, full nudity, and gambling in the same room. \r\nThe right to die. \r\nSk8 Parks (the best in the world) \r\n\r\nWashington has- \r\nPuget Sound \r\nKiller Whales \r\nD.B.
