Rather than traveling from one place to the next to buy their fresh produce, pantry items, DVDs and office supplies, \"people want it all under one roof,\" said Barry Scher, a spokesman for the Landover chain.\n\"The traditional supermarket as a lot of people may remember from even 10 years ago is largely a thing of the past,\" Scher said.\nGiant\\'s strategy this year will be to close smaller stores and replace them with prototype superstores that offer more perishable items, ready-to-eat foods and other amenities such as a Boston Market, a coffee shop and banking services.\nBy the end of April, the store at Riverdale Plaza in Maryland will close, as will the Fairfax store in Turnpike Plaza on Main Street. Three Giant stores in the Baltimore area are also slated to close. The company said it will open superstores in Stafford County and remodel others in Gainesville, Dale City and Herndon.\nThe traditional 12-aisle supermarkets are an endangered species, threatened by wholesale membership clubs, big-box retailers and the grocery superstore that can sprawl five times the size of its progenitor. Giant, for instance, recently opened a 56,000-square-foot prototype of the larger store in Urbana.\nGiant operates 190 supermarkets in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and the District.\nA 2006 report by Willard Bishop, a marketing company in Barrington, Ill., said research suggests that grocery superstores can match warehouse clubs in annual average sales per square foot.\nSuperstore sales are expected to grow 10 percent annually over the next five years as companies like Giant continue with aggressive schedules for store openings, according to the report, titled \"The Future of Food Retailing.\" At the same time, it said, the dollar share of food and consumables sold by traditional grocery retailers will shrink, and by 2012, supercenters and other nontraditional grocery retailers will dominate the market.    \n\n\nBaltimore Sun\nGiant to close 5 stores, 3 in Baltimore area\nBy Andrea K. Walker\nSun reporter\nOriginally published March 6, 2007\nGiant Food Inc. said yesterday that it would close five of its oldest stores, including three in the Baltimore area, as it tries to improve its standing in the market by focusing on larger and new locations.\n\nStores closing in the Baltimore area are: the Joppa Heights Shopping Center location at 1925 E. Joppa Road in Baltimore; the Baltimore Shopping Center store at 110 Stemmers Run Road in Essex; and the Randallstown Plaza Giant at 3637 Offutt Road.\n\nGiant also is closing stores in Riverdale in Prince George\\'s County and in Fairfax, Va. The area\\'s largest supermarket chain operates 190 stores in Virginia, Maryland, Washington and Delaware.\n\nGiant officials said they would close the stores after the Easter holiday.\n\nAbout 250 workers are employed at the five stores. A Giant spokesman said the grocer is working with the United Food and Commercial Workers union to determine what will happen to the employees.\n\nUnion officials couldn\\'t be reached for comment yesterday.\n\nThe closings come as Giant has lost market share in recent years, in part, because new grocers such as Wegmans Gourmet Foods Inc. have moved into the area. And more competition is on the way: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently announced it was bringing three Supercenter stores with supermarkets to the area.\n\nGiant recently introduced a new store prototype and has lowered prices on some products to better compete. It also has been renovating stores and building new locations. Last week it opened a 56,000-square-foot store in Urbana in Frederick County and completed renovations at a store in Bear, Del.\n\nThe company said it wasn\\'t worth it to renovate the five stores it\\'s closing. Those locations average about 20,000 square feet, compared with the average store size of 58,000 square feet. Each store is also more than 30 years old and Giant doesn\\'t own the buildings.\n\n\"They\\'re smaller stores,\" said Giant spokesman Barry Scher. \"It\\'s just not economically plausible to bring them up-to-date.\n\n\"We still have an aggressive marketing effort under way and are constantly looking for sites to develop new stores,\" he said. \"If anything, we\\'re accelerating the store remodeling program to bring older stores up-to-date.\"\n\nandrea.walker@baltsun.com\n                                                                                                               \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa44s2tis"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.91545,38.95861]}},{"properties":{"name":"World Arts Focus and Joe's Movement Emporium","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\">  World Arts Focus and Joe\\'s Movement Emporiummission  \t\nWorld Arts Focus is a non-profit organization that brings artists and communities together to study the arts, experience performances, and encourage the preservation of cultural performance traditions.

Mr. Carr retired from CarrAmerica after the company\\'s sale to The Blackstone Group in a .6 billion transaction that closed in July 2006. Mr. Carr served in various capacities at CarrAmerica and its predecessor company, The Oliver Carr Company, from 1985 to 2006, including leading the Washington- born company through its initial public offering in 1993 and its national expansion in 1995.

The company is a combination of the former Columbia Equity Trust, a publicly traded company founded by Oliver Carr, and CarrAmerica Urban Development, which Bob Carr runs. J.P. Morgan Chase is the main backer of the new, privately held Carr Properties.\n\n\"It\\'s a collective enterprise both to serve the market and to blend income for our investors,\" said Bob Carr.\n\nCarr Properties will venture into suburban, mixed-use and residential development. But it will not abandon the script that the Carrs have followed over the decades, which is the development of office space in the District. The company\\'s first project is the construction of a 250,000-square-foot office building behind Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church at 901 K St. NW.\n\nEarlier this month, Thomas A. Carr, brother of Bob and Oliver, joined Federal Capital Partners, a regional real estate investment and development company headquartered in the District. Federal Capital said last week it had purchased the 447-unit Park Place Towers in Bladensburg for 4.4 million. The seller was Shaool Construction.

FCP is investing approximately 0,000 per unit to recondition and reposition the property completely. Improvements include full HVAC-systems upgrades, new elevators and controls, new exterior facades, re-carpeting and reappointing of all interior common-areas, reconditioning of the pool and completion of in-unit upgrades. Pre-sales have materially exceeded expectations.\n\nThe Fairmont addresses the Washington, DC region\\'s need for affordable, \\'fee-owned\\' housing. It is the region\\'s most affordable condominium community, with units priced from 9,000 to 30,000. The property\\'s mid-rise brick-and-block construction, elevator access, campus-like environment and numerous amenities (including pool and exercise room) make it an exceptional value. The Fairmont is located in Hyattsville, one of the area\\'s emerging urban sub-markets.\n\nFCP\\'s focus is on making Fairmont the best \"value\" in the DC condo market.

Safeway grocery store, like the former Bustin’ Suds Laundromat and a McDonald’s restaurant, is closing its doors today.\n\nThe grocery store has been at the shopping center, which is located at the corner of Riggs and Adelphi roads, for more than 30 years.\n\nSalomon Toure and his wife have been shopping at the neighborhood store for years and will now have to drive to Langley Park to shop at the Safeway there.\n\n‘‘That does bother me,” he said. ‘‘We’ve lived here since 1995.”\n\nThe plaza still has Golden Bull Restaurant, Rite-Aid, Popeye’s Restaurant and other smaller shops, but the loss of Safeway has some residents concerned.\n\nCraig Muckle, public affairs manager for Safeway’s Eastern Division, explained the store’s departure is part of the chain’s changing goals. The company would like to expand the existing store but does not have ample room at the Metzerott location, Muckle said.\n\n‘‘Our lease is coming due,” he said. ‘‘We like to make sure we are able to have the store provide the services we like it to.”\n\nSome of those services include a café, pharmacy and more extensive bakery and meat counters, he said.\n\n‘‘People prefer a one-stop-shop opportunity,” he said. ‘‘This is the preferred model.”\n\nMuckle was not immediately aware how large the Metzerott Safeway is, but said the average new store ranges between 50,000 to 65,000 square feet.\n\nThere are no plans to build another Safeway in the Adelphi area because there are stores in nearby Langley Park, Hillandale and Hyattsville, he said.\n\nThe closing of stores will heavily impact Metzerott shoppers, said Kenneth Morgan, president of the Buck Lodge Citizens Association.\n\nMorgan and association Vice President Jennifer Libbe are not satisfied with Safeway’s suggestion to shop at a regional store.\n\n‘‘That may be all fine and dandy but that’s not going to do anything for our residents,” Morgan said. ‘‘When you need something real quick, that’s where you go. It’s about the friendly service.”\n\nAs for Bustin’ Suds, Morgan said the Laundromat was heavily used.\n\n‘‘You could go up there and there would always be tons of people there,” he said.\n\nMetzerott Plaza is owned by The Richmond Corp., based in Rockville.\n\nSkip Kriss, executive vice president of The Richmond Corp., said there are plans to fill the empty Safeway and laundromat spots.\n\n‘‘We are hoping that we will have another grocery store there,” he said of the Safeway lot. ‘‘We’re confident that it will be a grocery store.”\n\nThe Richmond Corp. is not considering expanding the Safeway building to accommodate a larger Safeway.\n\nAs for the empty laundromat spot, the wheels are rolling, Kriss said.\n\n‘‘The deal has not been signed but we’re very confident there are a host of people that would like to open in that location,” he said. ‘‘We’re looking for the most qualified candidate.”\n\n‘‘This moment in time is very unusual for this center,” he said. ‘‘We have had very, very low turnover.\n\n‘‘Our occupancy rate has been well into the 90s [percent] until this time,” he said, adding that older leases were paying below market rents and so the recent raise of rent to market rate appears like a large hike, he said.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3t14x39"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.97013,39.00361]}},{"properties":{"name":"Abdo Project -  billion in development","description":"Posted by RufuslThe Washington Post\nAugust 2006\nWho\\'d Want to Live There?\nBy Dana Hedgpeth Washington Post Staff Writer\n\nDeveloper Jim Abdo eased his silver Range Rover down a potholed alley on the eastern edge of the District, pulling to a stop a few feet away from a junkyard dog.\n\nThe German shepherd slept on the other side of a chain-link fence, under a piece of tin. Crushed cars and stacks of tires surrounded the dog. Beyond that: auto repair shops, a strip joint and a nightclub where police last year arrested the owner in connection with a 220-pound cocaine bust.\n\n\"I\\'ve just found the greatest freaking site,\" Abdo said in his rapid-fire fashion. He lowered both windows. The smell of fuel and oil wafted in. He pointed to a banged-up red Ford. \"That\\'s where the center part of the private green space will be. It can feel like a sanctuary!\"\n\nThis is the vista that has persuaded Abdo to sink more than  million into designs, plans and security deposits to turn 16 industrial acres along New York Avenue and Bladensburg Road NE -- a decrepit stretch that most people barely notice on their way to and from the city -- into 3.5 million square feet of development at a cost that Abdo estimates at .1 billion.\n\nThe site is east of downtown, near the Prince George\\'s County line, and is bordered by New York and Montana avenues and Bladensburg Road NE. The project would include an estimated 3,000 condominiums, some with sweeping views of the Washington Monument, and about 140,000 square feet of retail space. Abdo envisions making it a gateway to the city, adorned with stores like Whole Foods and Crate &amp; Barrel, topped off by condos and a health club, with bike paths to the nearby U.S. National Arboretum.\n\nIt\\'s one of the largest privately financed condominium projects in years in the District, and it comes as the in-town condo market has cooled off. Units take longer to sell, and in some neighborhoods prices are flat.\n\nAbdo agreed that his vision for New York Avenue sounds risky. The site is a mile from the nearest Metro stop and different from what he\\'s done in the past decade: renovate historic buildings -- mostly in the Logan Circle and Dupont Circle areas and one on Capitol Hill -- and turn them into stylish condos and lofts.\n\n\"I know everybody\\'s dying to ask, \\'Jim, are you crazy? Who\\'s going to want to live at New York Avenue and Bladensburg Road?\\' \" he said to a group of builders and brokers at a recent breakfast.\n\nAbdo and his New York partner still need to raise the money to build, and the sale of the land that has five different owners is contingent on a major zoning change this fall. If everything goes well, he hopes to start demolition of what\\'s there by next spring.\n\nAbdo has two other big projects: a 0 million renovation of a historic convent into luxury lofts northeast of Union Station and a 6 million project across the river in Arlington. He is also negotiating to build as many as 600 condominiums above parking garages near the new baseball stadium in Southeast.\n\nAbdo\\'s competitors in an increasingly skittish industry, city planners and Mayor Anthony A. Williams -- a close friend -- are paying more attention than ever to the 46-year-old developer, who arrived in Washington from South Carolina 14 years ago.\n\n\"When you\\'re on the StairMaster, you\\'re looking out at a three-acre park,\" Abdo said, walking past the junkyards one day, talking about his plans. \"We toyed with the idea of tennis courts. . . . Too much land area. What am I doing? I\\'m taking the country-club developers\\' environment and taking it to the urban location.\n\n\"It works all day long,\" he said. \"Who\\'s ever thought of that? No one. Why? Because who has the critical mass? It\\'s not a golf course. It\\'s better than a golf course. Buy a condo and you\\'re in.\"\n\nAbdo got the idea after he met three brothers -- Jerry, Andrew and Dave Schaeffer -- who run a taxicab company their father started more than 50 years ago and have acquired land throughout the city.\n\nThe brothers tried to sell Abdo some land on Capitol Hill, but Abdo wasn\\'t interested. Abdo recalled asking: \"What else do you guys have?\"\n\nThey had quite a bit: 11 contiguous acres near New York and Bladensburg, one of the busiest intersections in the city, where tenants include auto-repair garages, a used-tire salesman, a towing company, a gas station and the Skylark strip club, which operates in a former Roy Rogers restaurant.\n\nThere was only one problem. The brothers were already talking to a group that wanted to build a place for slot machines. Abdo, figuring that slots would never be approved in the District, told the brothers that he would be back the day after the tentative deal expired.\n\nAnd he was.\n\n\"I want to make a big statement . . . something that\\'s going to be remembered for a long time,\" Andrew Schaeffer, 58, remembered Abdo telling him.\n\nWithin two weeks, Abdo essentially met the brothers\\' price, according to Abdo and the Schaeffers. Neither side will say how much Abdo is paying because the deal has not closed. Some brokers and developers estimate the 11 acres to be worth as much as 0 million.\n\nOnce Abdo had persuaded some other landowners around the Schaeffers to sell, he approached Broadway Management, a New York firm that for two decades has developed condos in Manhattan and has three projects in progress in the District.\n\n\"It didn\\'t take us long to decide this was something we wanted to be involved with, based on Jim\\'s capabilities and the opportunity to redevelop part of the city that\\'s in need of it,\" said David Weldler, a Broadway Management principal. \"He understands the D.C. market quite well. He\\'s a visionary.\" Neither Weldler nor Abdo will say how much money they are putting into the project.\n\nAbdo said he knew the project would work when he saw the bumper-to-bumper traffic. City officials say more than 60,000 cars pass through the New York Avenue and Bladensburg Road intersection each day.\n\n\"They\\'re like minnows swimming upstream,\" he said, showing slides of his planned development. \"This is my net. This is my big old net.\"\n\nStill, there are plenty of skeptics who point out that there is little in the area to attract buyers.\n\n\"I\\'m sure he believes in what he\\'s doing and I\\'m rooting for him,\" said Washington developer Monty Hoffman, chief executive of P.N. Hoffman. \"There\\'s not a market there. He\\'ll have to create one.\"\n\nIf Abdo has any doubts about the housing slowdown, they are not evident as he tours the high-end Arlington lofts that will be finished later this year. It\\'s the first time Abdo has built outside the city and one of the few times he\\'s built from scratch.\n\nAbdo -- with closely-cut brown hair flecked with gray -- put on a hard hat, climbed several flights of temporary stairs and looked down on the city around him.\n\n\"Look at these ceiling heights,\" he said, jumping up and down on the concrete floors of a unit with 18-foot ceilings. \"I wanted to bring true honest-to-goodness lofts to a place where everyone else is doing vanilla.\"\n\nTo that end, he ordered new bricks made to look old with black iron spots. And he is also using old bricks, taken from a 130-year-old District building.\n\nWill anyone pay 00,000 to  million?\n\n\"There\\'s 87 units here. I only need 87 people to say, \\'Jim you\\'re crazy, but we love it.\\' \\'\\' Abdo said with a wry smile. \"Right now I\\'m sleeping okay at night.\"\n\nBack in the city, at Second and H streets NE, Abdo pulled up to the former convent, sections of which date to 1870. He plans to sell 44 luxury lofts by next spring. The chapel penthouse is expected to fetch more than  million.\n\n\"This is my baby,\" he said.\n\nAbdo climbed several stories of stairs, walked through an open window and stood on metal scaffolding to show off the old brick structure. He paused, noticing something in the wall.\n\n\"Who the hell is driving a nail into the brick like that?\" he radioed to one of his construction managers. \"Tell them to do it in the mortar joints. They\\'ve chipped the brick. . . . Find out who\\'s doing it and whack them on their hard hat.\"\n\nAbdo has expanded his closely held private company from three people with 87,000 a year in sales to one that employs 55 and expects more than 00 million in sales by next year. He made millions of dollars around Logan Circle, seeing coffee shops in the place of crack houses two or three years before most anyone else did. That caught the mayor\\'s attention.\n\nToday, Abdo and Williams smoke cigars together on Abdo\\'s patio. Abdo tried to get the mayor into fly-fishing, taking him shopping at Orvis with the mayor\\'s security detail in tow. The mayor, who, Abdo says, has a thing for kitchen gadgets, once persuaded Abdo to buy a set of glass bowls at Williams Sonoma. Williams goes to Abdo\\'s weekend farm at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia where he rides an air-conditioned tractor, cutting grass.\n\nAbdo and his wife, Mai, 3-year-old daughter Sophie and 21-month-old son Griffin live in a three-story brick house off Massachusetts Avenue NW that was once the home of the former ambassador from Ghana. It is assessed at .2 million. Vernon Jordan lives across the street. Torched bluestone lines the pool out back. A 1939 Steinway sits in the living room. The kitchen has a Viking stove, two Viking dishwashers and a double Viking refrigerator. Inside, Abdo lines up plastic containers of crab meat the way other people might stack yogurt.\n\n\"We\\'re minimalists,\" Abdo said jokingly as he served grilled steaks, vegetables and peach pie with vanilla ice cream on a recent evening in his perfectly manicured back yard.\n\n\\'7-Year-Old Capitalist\\'\n\nJim Abdo seemingly picked a terrible time to come to Washington to develop real estate. In 1992, the District had just chalked up 443 killings, helping it maintain a reputation as the nation\\'s murder capital. Two years earlier, Marion Barry had been caught on tape smoking crack.\n\nBut Abdo had a few things going for him, the first being a thirst for money. The third child of a Palestinian immigrant who worked as a tool designer and a mother who taught English and social studies before staying home to raise four children, Abdo grew up in Kent, Ohio. As a 7-year-old he saw the homeowners on his paper route as prospects for a variety of services. Snow \"meant dollar signs to me,\" Abdo said.\n\nAbdo put himself through the College of Wooster, studying sociology, and graduated in 1982. He followed a girlfriend to Hilton Head, S.C., where he opened a pizza parlor with a 0,000 loan that his father co-signed. For 3 1/2 months, he said, he slept on a cot in the back supply room, but in four years he had five restaurants.\n\nBy 1992, he was tiring of the restaurants, sold some of them and moved to Washington with 50,000 to start a new chapter in his life.\n\n\"I\\'m Jim Abdo, the little 7-year-old capitalist who has to make money,\" he said.\n\nHe began slowly, buying a rowhouse in Georgetown, helping a contractor restore it, and selling it. Next, he bought a trashed house in Dupont Circle and turned it into condos.\n\nAt the time, most developers wouldn\\'t go east of 16th Street. To Abdo, the Victorian houses and rowhouses in and around Logan Circle, a gathering spot for prostitutes and drug dealers, seemed like a gold mine.\n\nHis strategy was to gut the houses, save historic elements. and put in high-ceilinged condos, apartments and lofts. He installed Sub-Zero refrigerators and Wolf stoves, bathroom fixtures from the Georgetown store Waterworks, and honed limestone from Italy. That lured buyers, which lured retailers, which lured more buyers.\n\nCarol Felix, a Logan Circle resident and marketing consultant, said Abdo had a gift for explaining why his units were worth their high prices. \"He\\'s always telling you a joke, even if he\\'s telling you he\\'s charging you 00 more a square foot,\" Felix said.\n\nAbdo moved to larger apartment buildings and commercial properties. When drug dealers kept crowding around a pay phone on P Street NW, a spot Abdo was fixing up for CVS and the Logan Hardware store, he called the phone\\'s owners several times, asking them to remove it. When they wouldn\\'t, he had his construction workers rip it out and toss it into a Dumpster -- quarters and all, Abdo recalled, as he munched on a Think Thin energy bar.\n\nHe showed another side, too. When Theo Turner, a man living in a nearby church basement, turned up asking for work, Abdo hired him to carry supplies and sweep up debris -- and kept him on for years. Abdo also leased a basement apartment to Turner at a reduced rent in one of his renovated buildings near 15th and P streets NW. Not long ago, Abdo visited Turner in a hospital, where he was being treated for a heart attack.\n\nIn 2002, Williams presided over the marriage of Abdo and Mai at the Meridian House in Kalorama. After that, Williams became a regular at their house. The mayor is godfather to Abdo\\'s son.\n\n\"He calls me the chief,\" Williams said. \"My wife calls me Hey You. It balances out.\"\n\nSince the beginning of 2000, Abdo or his company have contributed 1,550 to District candidates, including ,000 to Williams and ,500 to four candidates in this year\\'s race for mayor.\n\nAbdo admits he drops the mayor\\'s name, which some people find irritating. \"It\\'s because he\\'s a friend,\" Abdo said. \"I\\'m an outward, vocal person and if I see someone over the weekend I start rattling off. If that\\'s interpreted as name-dropping, I\\'m sorry.\"\n\nAs Abdo pursues his New York Avenue plans, he says the quality of his projects and the uniqueness of his design will create a market, regardless of broader trends.\n\nOn April 6, he presented his plans to a seven-member Advisory Neighborhood Commission. About 40 residents came out, and Abdo had the opportunity to display attributes important for a developer -- charm and salesmanship.\n\n\"I\\'m from a working-class family,\" Abdo said. \"That\\'s the idea here. We\\'re not trying to compete with Dupont Circle or Kalorama. These will be at least 50 a foot less than what they\\'d cost in Northwest.\"\n\nFrom the front row, resident Debbie Smith let loose a harrumph, shaking her head at the notion that working-class people would pay upward of 99,000 for a studio and 90,000 for a three-bedroom condominium.\n\nSomeone else asked about rising property taxes. That prompted Abdo\\'s new vice president -- Eric W. Price -- to jump up and address the crowd. They knew him from his previous job as deputy mayor for planning and economic development, which he held for five years. He played a major role in luring a baseball team to the District and jump-starting the redevelopment of the old convention center site. Now they listened as Price, 44, calmly walked through tax-break programs that could keep older residents on tight incomes in their homes, even as their property values rose.\n\n\"New York Avenue can become a place of Whole Foods, hair salons, boutiques and coffee shops,\" Abdo said. \"We\\'ve done this before on 14th Street and at Logan Circle and we\\'re doing it on H Street. We\\'ll tackle the tough areas. We\\'re not here to give you lip service. We\\'re here to make it happen.\"\n\nIt made for a compelling pitch.\n\n\"I\\'m tired of fighting the same garbage,\" Joan E. Black, a neighborhood advisory commissioner, told the crowd. \"We want to improve our standard of living.\"\n\nWithin 30 minutes, the advisory panel endorsed the plan by a 5 to 1 to 1 vote.\n\n \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3u5v4o9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.97554,38.91581]}},{"properties":{"name":"Acme - 121 East City Ave, Bala Cynwyd","description":"Posted by Rufusl121 East City Ave., Phila.

The Anacostia Tributary Trail System, a link in the national shore-to-shore American Discovery Trail, provides miles of uninterrupted trails along the tributaries of the Anacostia River. The southernmost point of the trail is located at Colmar Manor Community Park, and trail spurs extend northeasterly and northwesterly from there along beautiful stream valley parkland. The trail system\\'s continuous greenway traverses a variety of natural environments including woodlands, open fields, and wetlands.\n\nThe trail affords ample opportunities for fishing, bird watching, hiking, biking, jogging, horseback riding, and in-line skating. Sites along the Anacostia Tributary Trail System worth a stop include College Park Airport, College Park Aviation Museum, Ellen Linson Swimming Pool, Herbert Wells Ice Rink, Lake Artemesia, Adelphi Mill, College Park Community Center, Paint Branch Golf Course, the 94th Aero Squadron Restaurant, and many local neighborhood and community parks. The flat, barrier-free trail system is designed for a wide variety of users, and a signage system with mile markers assists with location awareness. The trail system links several neighborhoods to Metro stations, but commuters needing to travel at speeds greater than 12 miles per hour should consider alternative routes.\n\n     Proposed Bike Trail\n\n    The Anacostia Watershed Society has been working to increase recreational access for the public to the Anacostia River, as a way to draw attention to this under-appreciated resource.  We have been working to help create a bicycle link from Bladensburg, where the 21-mile Anacostia Headwaters Bicycle Trail ends, down into DC to the national Mall and downtown, as a way for local citizens to gain recreational access to the extensive trail network that currently exists, and as an effective bicycle commuter route.  This is an excellent opportunity to create linkages between DC and MD, and with the newly formed Anacostia Trails Heritage Area.\n\n    The District of Columbia is actively planning their portion of the trail, but only up to the border with Maryland at the New York Ave./ Rte., 50 bridge. The crucial link that is needed to connect the DC portion of the trail with the existing Maryland trails is a 7,000 foot linear segment from the Bladensburg Waterfront Park to the DC border. We estimate that this segment will cost 0 per linear foot, bringing that to 80,000 for the trail. Two bridges will be needed to cross over two existing streams, and they will cost 20,000. To cover the costs of the design work for the trail and the bridges, we estimate we will need 0,000, bringing the total for the entire project to 00,000.\n\n    We have been working closely with the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission on this project, since they are the majority land owners. They are fully supportive of this trail, but have let it be known that they are not in the position to assume another project at this time due to their already full work load. They have indicated their support for having the Anacostia Watershed Society manage this project, and have offered the services of one of their key planners to help with the engineering details for this trail.

AWS seeks to fulfill its mandate of a swimmable and fishable river through its programs of education, action and advocacy.\n\nA MANIFESTO FOR THE ANACOSTIA RIVER\n\nCLEAN THE WATER\n\nPreserve and restore natural river beds and embankments where possible\nReduce rainwater run-off by maximizing permeable surfaces\nImplement storm water controls\nPreserve and expand functioning wetlands\nProvide water conditions conducive to varied aquatic life\nReduce sediment migration\n\nRECOVER THE SHORES\n\nPreserve woodlands and protect mature trees\nShade all waters with a canopy of trees\nCreate linked wildlife habitats\nEliminate litter and debris\nControl stream bank erosion\n\nHONOR THE HERITAGE\n\nEncircle the nation\\'s capital with a necklace of parks and paths\nRestore and preserve historic sites\nThread pathways throughout the Watershed connecting points of interest\nEncourage a variety of appropriate economic, social and cultural activities on the river\\'s shores\nOpen the river to people through increased visibility and accessibility\nRetain and manage as a unity all public lands in the Watershed\nas a legacy for future generations\n\nAnacostia Watershed Society\n1991\n\nThe Anacostia Watershed Society (AWS) is a non-profit environmental organization dedicated to restoring and protecting the Anacostia River, (designated as one of the nation’s most polluted), for the health and enjoyment of everyone in its watershed, while in the process, bringing people from all walks of life together to achieve this mission. Incorporated in 1989, AWS was founded with a vision of this “forgotten river” attaining the status of swimmable and fishable.\n\nThrough volunteer restoration activities, residents of the Anacostia watershed have been provided with an opportunity to get involved; they have invested their time in a cause, actively working for a positive change. AWS also provides advocacy and coalition building skills to emerging as well as established grass roots organizations within the Anacostia River communities. By assisting local groups, partnerships are formed and efforts to protect the local environment as well as focus decision makers are strengthened.\n\nSince its inception in 1989, AWS has mobilized over 30,000 volunteers who have planted over 11,300 trees and stenciled 1,008 storm-drains within the watershed as well as removed 458 tons of debris and over 7,500 tires from the watershed. Furthermore, AWS has educated 14,535 people with its slide presentation which explains the river’s history and the current threats it faces, as well as the different lifestyle choices and changes citizens can undertake to improve the condition of the watershed. In addition to these education and restoration events, AWS has introduced 8,200 people, of which 4,500 were children, to the river through paddling clinics, canoe adventures and pontoon boat tours along the “Kingfisher Canoe Trail,” a scenic five-mile stretch of the Anacostia River. All AWS programs teach citizens that they are integral participants in the restoration and preservation of this urban river.\n\nThe fruit of AWS\\' educational and grass roots organizing efforts is to develop an enlightened community of citizen stakeholders who are aware of their connection to the natural world and who work to promote the healing of the Anacostia River and its watershed communities. It seems that urban children, often residing in neighborhoods similar to many of those in the Anacostia watershed, have limited opportunities and sometimes turn to unhealthy or dysfunctional activities to fill their time. They have little or no regular contact with the natural world and are consequently insulated from the beauty and character-forming influences that can be found in nature. AWS’ work with urban children assists in the development of an informed and empowered generation of young people. The students are made aware of their connection to the natural world and thus begin to work to promote the healing of themselves as well as the river.\n\nAWS receives 48% of its funding from foundation grants, 20% from federal grants, 23% from cash contributions and 9% from miscellaneous contributions. The key to the Anacostia Watershed Society’s success is its large and growing network of citizen volunteers.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa46cjhya"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.941204,38.940886]}},{"properties":{"name":"Art District Hyattsville by EYA - 500 new townhomes","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> EYA Townhomes in Gateway Arts District20 acre development on old Lustine auto site.

The Town of Bladensburg requested this sector plan amendment to the 1994 Approved Master Plan and SMA for Bladensburg-New Carrollton and Vicinity (Planning Area 69) in the spring of 2004. This request was a key implementation step determined by the “Feasibility Study for the Town Center Project”, which was commissioned by the Town and completed in April 2004. This study explored the possibility of creating a town center for the town of Bladensburg, utilizing the construction of new, expanded municipal offices as a catalyst for the larger development.\n\nThe new sector plan will establish goals, policies and strategies to guide the future growth of the town center in the Town of Bladensburg. The recommended land use, zoning, and design guidelines will help establish a foundation for new real estate and economic development activity appropriate for a regional center along the General Plan designated Developed Tier Corridor of Annapolis Road. The recommendations will promote pedestrian activity and help ensure that development is compatible with adjacent neighborhoods.

Founded in 1969 by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, Brother Martin strives to form Christian young men through a holistic approach to education as put forth in the school\\'s Mission Statement and in keeping with the Philosophy of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. The hallmarks of that tradition are an education rooted in religious values, structured through friendly discipline, nurtured by personal attention and committed to academic excellence.\n\nInformation about our History\n\t\nFather Andre Coindre, founder of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, was born in Lyon, France, in 1787. Devoting his life to the restoration of the Church following the Reign of Terror at the end of the French Revolution, his chief mission became the moral, intellectual, and religious development of young orphan boys left in distress by the consequent disintegration of family life. \n\nFather Coindre had envisioned a community of brothers trained to work with the poor through the establishment of schools; in 1821 that dream became a reality with the formation of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. After Father Coindre\\'s death in 1826 and at the end of Father Francis Coindre\\'s administration, Brother Polycarp, our first Brother Superior General, assumed leadership of the struggling community. His tenure was marked by a period of tremendous growth. By the time of his death in 1859, the Institute had grown to over 400 Brothers in 70 schools.\n\nIn January of 1847 at the request of Bishop Portier, five missionary Brothers of the Sacred Heart arrived in Mobile, Alabama, to begin charitable and educational work. With a presence in the United States, the congregation began its transformation into a worldwide institute, spreading throughout North America in the South, New York and New England areas and into Canada.\n\n“To be a member of the institute today is to be believe in God’s love, to live it, and to spread it.

Ehrlich, Jr., and local elected officials today celebrated the start of a 0 million project to build a railroad bridge over Annapolis Road (MD 450) in Bladensburg.   With tracks currently at street level and trains crossing Annapolis Road more than 25 times a day, traffic is stopped repeatedly creating congestion and delaying the response of emergency crews.\r\n\r\n\"This project will have significant impact on the Bladensburg community and all the commuters who use Annapolis Road,\" said Governor Ehrlich.  \"We are eliminating a traffic bottleneck and improving safety for motorists and pedestrians.  I want to thank Senator Gwendolyn Britt, Delegate Doyle Niemann, Delegate Rosetta Parker, Delegate Victor Ramirez and Delegate Justin D. Ross for supporting my transportation initiative that made this project possible.\"\r\n\r\nMore than 52,000 vehicles travel along MD 450 in Bladensburg daily.  Traffic is expected to exceed 85,000 vehicles by 2025.   There are 25 to 27 trains that cross the intersection daily, stopping traffic for an average of 15 minutes at a time.

There is always a place for the independents -- hopefully,\" says Stephen Needel, a longtime drugstore owner in Landover Hills.

This month, the Prince George\\'s County Council amended zoning laws to allow Wal-Mart, the world\\'s largest retailer and grocer, to open its first store inside the Capital Beltway late next year. The site is the abandoned Capital Plaza Mall, about a mile from Chandler\\'s.\n\"Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart,\" Needel said. \"There is always a place for the independents -- hopefully.\"\nYet history suggests that where Wal-Mart goes -- and with 3,600 stores in the United States, it is close to everywhere -- small businesses often disappear. Some community leaders also have concerns about how the Bentonville, Ark., company, the nation\\'s largest employer, treats its 1.6 million workers, who are not unionized.\nWal-Mart, which has stores in Bowie and Clinton, said its hourly wage in the region is 0.08, compared with 3.19 at Giant and Safeway, whose employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. The company offers a health plan, but labor leaders, who have tried unsuccessfully to organize Wal-Mart\\'s workforce, said the wages are so low that employees cannot afford to pay premiums.\n\"Wal-Mart doesn\\'t have the greatest reputation,\" council member David Harrington (D-Cheverly) said. \"It leads to low wages and little benefit.\"\nStill, community leaders and residents said, most people who have qualms are ready to set aside those concerns for anything that might help Landover Hills and its Annapolis Road corridor, which has been in an economic tailspin.\nEven Needel said he has hated watching Capital Plaza, which takes up several blocks, turn into another abandoned building.\n\"I really do think it will be an igniter,\" said the Rev. Terence D. Collins, executive director of the Community Ministry of Prince George\\'s County, a nonprofit group that works with unemployed and low-income residents. \"There has to be a starting point, and that\\'s what I see Wal-Mart as.\"\nIt has been almost 20 years since shoppers strolled the mall, which was anchored by Montgomery Ward and Bradlees. Girls bought shoes at Fayva, and women shopped for clothes at Merry-Go-Round.\n\"Everything was leased up, the traffic flow was great and we had quite a number of national tenants,\" said Randall J. Levitt, president of Nellis Corp., which owns and manages Capital Plaza.\nWhen Bradlees left the Washington market, Hechinger, the hardware and lumber company, moved in. \"It was a good retailer but not a good anchor for a mall,\" Levitt said. A person buying lumber isn\\'t likely to buy a pair of shoes or a dress at the same time, he said.\nMontgomery Ward and Hechinger filed for bankruptcy, leaving Capital Plaza about five years ago. That left mostly small local businesses working on month-to-month leases.\n\"Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart.

But they are better than nothing.\"\nCollins recently witnessed the area\\'s need for economic revival firsthand as he watched his son play football a few blocks from the Capital Plaza site.

As a result, the college displays excellence in terms of its own distinctiveness, with an emphasis on classes that are smaller and taught by professors who bring not only the kind of technical capability you would expect at a college at the nation’s capital, but also a strong sense of mission. This translates into a more personal style of teaching, where students are not lost in the shuffle, as is possible in larger institutions.\n\nAlso, because we are located at the nation’s capital, our classes take on a distinctive excitement due to the resources available. For example, where in another part of the country a class might talk about a Supreme Court decision, our students can visit the Court and listen to the testimony and watch history being made. Where in another part of the country a class might study about a foreign culture, our students can actually hop on the Metro and go down and visit the embassy.\n\nThe fact that we’re a Christian college with a distinctive emphasis on service (our motto is \"Gateway to Service\") means that students also have opportunities, here, to explore their own spiritual journey in ways that are wholly supportive.

Rainier, MD 20712\nThe evolution of Community-Vision Consultants is a result of over 15 years of combining real estate development, investment and finance expertise with a strong community advocacy agenda.\n\nAfter years of community involvement, I have come to the conclusion that trying to address our increasing affordable housing crisis without addressing the social issues that undermine any housing initiative is short-sighted and doomed to fail. Physically rebuilding housing without addressing the sense of hopelessness, alienation, violence, and other social ills, represents poor policy and will only result in the disintegration of any substantive initiative.\n\nTherefore, two major issues must be overcome in order to achieve true social and community change: 1) all parties interested in permanent community change, particularly investors and developers, must work more closely to maximize efforts; and, 2) we must address housing and social change simultaneously.\n\nAs I gained more business experience, I became involved and, in some cases, helped establish several organizations that focus on the arts, youth programs, and social and economic justice within the community. Through these enriching experiences, I learned that the only way to achieve long-lasting change is to build bridges between all community stakeholders whose goals are to make our neighborhoods stronger – starting here in our own inner-city.\n\nMy goal with C-VC is to build and strengthen the bridges needed to combine our strength for change. We intend to create a more productive paradigm that can be replicated in every American community that needs social and economic change for the benefit of all.\n\nWe encourage anyone to join our efforts.\n\n\n\nStephen Shaff\nFounder\nCommunity-Vision Consultants\n\nCommunity-Vision Consultants’ mission is to revitalize and redevelop urban communities through a combination of mutually reinforcing real estate, finance and community-advocacy activities.\n\nC-VC’s mission is twofold: (1) To generate capital through real estate development, finance, and consultation services; and (2) to do so in a way that creates long-term benefit to disadvantaged urban communities.\n\nC-VC combines expertise in mortgage finance, real estate development, construction and property management, and community advocacy services under one roof to create a company that:\n\n    * Redevelops distressed housing and select small commercial projects\n    * Increases home ownership along with the commercial revitalization necessary to sustain healthier and stronger communities;\n    * Partners with businesses, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies to reinforce our mission and our sustainability; and\n    * Provides mortgage and real estate financing and consultation services to homeowners and investors. \n\nWe believe that \"socially responsible\" business enterprise is not a contradiction in terms, nor do the two principal components of our mission conflict. Indeed, we believe that we have created a business model in which these two goals (the economic and the social missions) are mutually reinforcing and equally important in each aspect of our business activity. In short, our efforts to benefit communities will maximize our profit, ensure our long-term viability, and, in turn, magnify the positive social impact of our activities.\n\nOur long term mission is to change the paradigm in which real estate investors and developers do business within disadvantaged and neglected neighborhoods.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa48l832c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.960785,38.936579]}},{"properties":{"name":"DPZ Gentilly Charette - Spring 2006","description":"Posted by Rufuslpage 26 of DPZ report\nGentilly Town Center \nGalina Tahchieva \n \nAnalysis:  \n \nCurrently the strip shopping center along Gentilly Boulevard is underused and is perceived to \nbe both poorly maintained and outdated. It is owned by Texas-based Gentilly LLC.  The \nbuildings did not suffer major damage from wind or flood; rather, most of them were looted in \nthe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The pre-Katrina tenants included a Dollar Store, \nWalgreens, Right Aid, Blockbuster, several fast food restaurants, as well as a series of local \nbusinesses such as a barber shop, a Laundromat, car wash and others. \n \nToday only a few of these shops are in business and very few will be coming back to this \nlocation. As many of the Gentilly residents noted, the shopping center needs to be redeveloped \nin order to better serve the surrounding community. Even before the hurricane its maintenance \nand overall physical shape was not appropriate for this very central and important location, \nwhich is at the intersection of two major thoroughfares - Gentilly Boulevard and Elysian \nFields. This area should be positioned as a town center instead of a strip shopping center, as it \nis today, and should become the heart of the community. It could be developed as a 24-hour \nplace of character and community synergy by creating a combination of shops and residential \nuses.     \n \nNeeds: \n \n1. Create a square between the Walgreens building on the east and the shopping strip on the \nwest side in order to traffic-calm Gentilly Boulevard and provide a new green civic space \nto be used by the whole community. \n2. Plant a double row of trees around the square to provide shade to the sidewalks around it, \nand leave the central space clear of structures for active use by the residents in the \ncommunity. \n3. Design the square to accommodate future streetcar lines running through Gentilly \nBoulevard and connecting to another line along Elysian Fields. 4. Reverse the current model of parking in the front of buildings to a model of parking in the \nback of buildings.  The parking lots should be laid out in way that allows the construction \nof a future parking garage.   \n5. Create a merchandizing strategy for the town center and present it together with the master \nplan to several developers with good track record of building such centers.  The offer may \nbe extended to the current owners.   \n6. Reshape the north and south corners on the east side of Elysian Fields to form a true \ngateway to the town center.  Propose the “reversed gas station model” that puts the gas \nstation building in the front and the pumps in the back.  The gas station building can then \naccommodate the functions of a corner store.  Encourage the Zuppardo grocery store \nowners to rebuild their building wrapping around the corner but leaving larger sidewalk in \nthe front, at least 20 feet form curb to building.  The parking lot in the back can be re- \nstriped to accommodate more spaces. \n7. Allocate at least three sites with good visibility for new restaurants of different price \npoints, including a family restaurant and a place affordable to students and young people.  \n8. Allocate a major anchor on the north-west corner of the site, across from the historically \nsignificant cemetery to activate the northern edge of the main street.  This anchor may be a \ncinema or a retail tenant.  Create a plaza in the front of the building in order to terminate \nthe street vista and direct the pedestrian traffic. \n9. Study the buildings on the south and east sides of Gentilly Boulevard and preserve the \nones of historical value (including the Deco building of the former McKenzie Bakery) \n10. Create a pedestrian and/or vehicular connection between the town center and Dillard \nUniversity.  Ideally this connection can happen along the northern edge of the Duck Pond \nand continue south of the mausoleum building, terminating on a new plaza at the edge of \nthe town center.  The businesses around this plaza should target younger customers. \n11. Reconfigure several of the street alignments along the south edge of Gentilly Boulevard in \norder to weave together the urban fabric on both sides of the boulevard and create more \npedestrian friendly crossing possibilities. \n12. Encourage two main building types in the town center – apartments above shops and live- work units.   \n\npage 64\nObservation: Gentilly Town Center was in terrible condition even before the hurricane, despite \nits fabulous location. The community requires its updating and refurbishment to a first-rate \nfunctional and social center. \n \nDiscussion: As is the case in the practice of retail, the newer shopping center destroys the old \none. Accordingly, the Gentilly shopping center decayed upon the construction of the center \nfurther to the east and then in turn decayed with the construction of the newer shopping in east \nNew Orleans. This occurred despite the fact the Gentilly shopping center has, by far, the best \nlocation, as the intersection of Gentilly Boulevard and Elysian Fields is in close proximity to \n610 and is conceivably the best of all locations in New Orleans by virtue of its access to \ntransportation, as well as its being in the centroid of New Orleans.  \n \nCurrently, a certain type of regional shopping requires long trips to Metairie, East New \nOrleans, or St. Bernard Parish, and residents of Gentilly must drive great distances to secure \nanything but the most ordinary groceries and services. In reaction to this situation, the Gentilly \nCivic Improvement Association is requiring that a new town center provide for its residents’ \nneeds. The current shopping center is actually a multiplicity of strip shopping, parcels and out \nof date traditional buildings, violently cut by the diagonal of Gentilly Boulevard, with a series \nof unresolved and unconnected parking lots.  \n \nThe proposed plan, while retaining the option of maintaining a number of buildings, is a radical \nredesign that creates a town square as a front door for Gentilly. The town square straddling \nGentilly Boulevard creates a circumstance that is much more pedestrian-friendly by splitting \nthe traffic into a one-way pair (each leg narrow and easier to cross), thus creating a memorable \nspace, and organizing the parking to be generally behind the buildings, such as the traditional \nhometown shopping experience is created. This kind of center is the future of retail. If this \nshopping center is constructed quickly enough it will outperform those others that were \nsimultaneously destroyed.  \n \nThe splitting of the boulevard is not a great problem, as Gentilly Boulevard is equipped with \nstoplights and various impediments. Furthermore, the creation of the commercial and what is \nassumed to be residential and office above may be easily amortized with the aid of the Gulf \nOpportunity Zone which is specifically designed for commercial projects.  \n \nThe demographics of the trade area of this location is the average nationally and the average \nfor New Orleans, and is therefore excellent for the kind of middle class shops that would be \nmost useful to the current residents of Gentilly. The initial trade area, before the New Orleans \npopulation as a whole comes back, is five miles, ultimately to be reduced to what is on the \nmap. Even then the demographics are excellent.  \n Recommendation:  The GCIA must hold to this design or one similar to it. Then, the \nreconstruction of the shopping center can take place regardless of the owner, in such a way that the center forms the town center of Gentilly and does not revert back to an interchangeable \nstrip shopping center of no particular character. \n \npage 73\nObservation:  Dillard University has an opportunity to tie in to the larger neighborhood \nrevitalization, helping to propel it as well as positioned to benefit from it. \n \nDiscussion:  Dillard University has a handsome, small campus that, while damaged by the \nwaters, has not been damaged by recent architecture. The University is currently involved in \nthe rebuilding of its student and faculty residential areas. Additionally, it is adjacent to the strip \nshopping centers at Gentilly and Elysian Fields, which are currently in dismal condition, but \nwhich could become the future Gentilly Town Center. The proposed Dillard plan, while \naccommodating substantially additional programming and reordering the playing fields and \nparking lots, permits the connection to continue.  \n \nRecommendation: The campus architect should coordinate the Dillard Plan with that of \nGentilly Town Center. \n\nGentilly rebuilding plan calls for \\'quality retail\\'; Shopping center at Elysian Fields would get revamp\nBy Jaquetta White, Business writer\nTimes-Picayune (New Orleans)\nNovember 14, 2006\n\nA rebuilding plan proposed recently to residents of Gentilly neighborhoods recommended converting the shopping center along Gentilly Boulevard at Elysian Fields Avenue into something \"more appropriate to the surrounding neighborhoods and that better serves the needs of Gentilly residents.\"\n\nThe plan was presented last week by Andres Duany, principal of Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company, the Miami firm contracted by the community to craft a plan for its rebuilding.\n\nDuany called the shopping strip that had included a Blockbuster, Baskin-Robbins, Radio Shack, Walgreens and a mix of small, locally owned outfits, a \"third-rate shopping center.\" And said it is \"absolutely crucial that you have a first-rate retail on that place.\" Fewer than half of the businesses operating in the shopping strip before Hurricane Katrina have reopened.\n\nThe plan calls for a mixed-use development that would consist of retail space with residential space above it.\n\nAccording to the plan, Gentilly Boulevard would be reconfigured to include a greenspace square surrounded by trees. The addition would \"calm traffic\" and \"provide a new green civic space.\" Parking would be moved to the rear of the shopping strip.\n\nAmong the other highlights, the plan suggests that a cinema or large retailer anchor the strip.\n\nA developer would be identified through a request-for-proposal process. The plan says the remodeled town center could be financed through a public/private partnership, but does not give specifics.\n\nThe plan would need to be adopted by the Gentilly Civic Improvement Association and presented to the city to become the formal rebuilding plan for the neighborhood. Scott Darrah, president of the association, said he did not know if the group had approved it yet.\n\nLocal residents say a change would be welcomed.\n\nGentilly resident Vera Triplett said the goal is to get \"quality retail\" to move to the strip.\n\n\"The quality of occupants is not what the neighborhood would like to see or deserves,\" area resident Reggie Glass said. \"People would like to see something nicer.\"\n\nBut, for those changes to take place, the center likely would have to be sold. The shopping center is now owned by Texas-based Gentilly LLC.\n\nEd Badouh, the company\\'s proprietor, said it is not currently for sale but he would entertain an offer to sell it.\n\nHowever, he said his current priority is not on selling, remodeling or tearing down the center, but on allowing the tenants who want to return the opportunity to do so.\n\n\"What we\\'re doing is what we\\'re obligated to do,\" said Badouh, who, with his wife, bought the center in 1983. \"Our first obligation is to try to put back the tenants that were there.\"\n\nBadouh said he is also open to moving new tenants into the space and has met with the neighborhood group to discuss that possibility, though no plans are final yet.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nJaquetta White can be reached at jwhite@timespicayune.com or (504) 826-3494\n\n\nThere are a number of smart, talented and acclaimed planners and architects who spend virtually all day every day thinking about a better future for New Orleans. Spend a week in the life of one, the prince of \\'new urbanism,\\' Andres Duany.\nSunday, December 10, 2006\nBy Doug MacCash\nArt critic\n\nTo hear some people talk, you\\'d think architect and urban planner Andrés Duany is the devil. They\\'d have us resist with religious zeal his designs for a newer, better post-Katrina New Orleans. Given a chance, Duany would damn the Crescent City to a future of cleanliness, orderliness and artificiality. He would do to us what he did to those poor suntanned zombies who live in Seaside, Fla., his signature 1981 ultra-planned development that made him infamous among the world\\'s architectural aesthetes.\n \t \nHe must be scorned and shunned.\n\nThe trouble is, he\\'s just so darned reasonable -- not to mention charming.\n\nHe\\'s 57 years old, born in New York, raised in Santiago, Cuba, and Barcelona, Spain; educated at Princeton, L\\'Ecole Des Beaux Arts and Yale. He\\'s married to renowned architect Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and based in Miami. For a quarter-century, he\\'s been the prince of \"new urbanism,\" a movement dedicated to defeating suburban sprawl. He\\'s planned hundreds of towns and neighborhoods. He speaks with a sort of bemused authority, as if Shangri-La were easily within reach, if it weren\\'t for the foibles of the unenlightened. His voice is a Caribbean/ Mediterranean baritone, his eyes close-set and intense, his smile blade-like and quick, his sarcasm ever-present and impeccable.\n\nDuany is part of a wave of celebrated visionaries -- from Harry Connick Jr. (on behalf of Habitat for Humanity) to Brad Pitt (for Global Green) to Thom Mayne (for the Hyatt Hotel) to Donald Trump to Pres Kabacoff -- who\\'ve poured forth various utopian plans for the resuscitation of the storm-shattered region. He has been a regular visitor to the Gulf Coast since October 2005. Fueled with grant money from a bevy of benefactors and agencies, including former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale, the Knight Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Louisiana Recovery Authority, he and his team of new urbanists have contributed rebuilding advice and design plans for big cities and small towns from Pascagoula, Miss., to Lake Charles.\n\nIt was Duany who proposed a slow-speed, pedestrian-friendly, oceanfront boulevard through Biloxi, Miss. It was Duany who promoted permanent, expandable, comparatively cozy Katrina Cottages to compete with emergency FEMA trailers. It was Duany who provided a vision for more genteel urban thoroughfares to replace the strip malls of St. Bernard Parish.\n\nIn the arena of post-K planning, Duany and his firm Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Co. seemed to be everywhere, attempting to slow traffic, add green space, elevate and consolidate our collectively reduced footprint.\n\nThose earlier plans for outlying areas may have been benign enough, but in early November, the devil Duany, at the invitation of Unified New Orleans Plan administrators, extended his tentacles to that holiest of holies, the Vieux Carre, which was largely unaffected by Hurricane Katrina. Duany had been called in to plan three of the 14 New Orleans planning districts: Gentilly, the Central Business District and the French Quarter. As is his custom, he conducted a four-day series of public meetings attended by preservationists, residents, developers and shop owners -- what architects call a charrette.\n\nDuany and company absorbed the suggestions, complaints and premonitions of what one member of the staff succinctly called \"stake holders,\" then, calling upon their collective urban planning powers, they presumably attempted to conceive broadly satisfying solutions to the French Quarter\\'s woes. On Nov. 11, Duany presented his vision for an improved Vieux Carre.\n\nThe day before, Duany could be found in his New Orleans headquarters, a cleanly renovated Decatur Street shotgun house, purchased for the Duany team\\'s extended stay. He multitasked as he discussed the future of the oldest section of the city, studying a computer screen, gazing through a window, and compulsively leaping upright from time to time to wander the room, tweaking the arrangement of the furniture, going so far as to wind an electrical cord more neatly around the base of a lamp.\n\nHe said the French Quarter had been an inspiration to him for decades. Despite its age, he sees the \"compact, walkable, diverse\" neighborhood as a model for the \"energy-starved\" future.\n\n\"All other cities are trending toward New Orleans,\" he said. \"Most cities get famous by doing three blocks of French Quarter.\"\n\nHe traced his penchant for designing communities with only a handful of harmonious architectural styles to the French Quarter, where he discovered \"the richness of what can be achieved with 12 notes.\"\n\nBut, he pointed out, all is not well.\n\n\"The French Quarter has been loved to death,\" he said, \"overwhelmed by tourists. It has become an unpleasant living environment.\"\n\nIt\\'s an environment that could be considerably improved, through modest suggestions, he said, but he saved specifics for a public presentation the following night, thereby preserving his spontaneity.\n\nIn the meantime, he turned his attention to a disagreeable e-mail from the New Orleans Building Corp. that had appeared on his screen, announcing a dramatic city-sponsored riverfront development proposal, dubbed the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" plan, that would stretch along the Mississippi from the French Quarter beyond Bywater, featuring architectural marvels by modernist heroes such as Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid and Daniel Libeskind.\n\nThe development would pass immediately in front of Duany\\'s Marigny shotgun house. He feared it would blot out the view of the well-used dog park and nearby burned warehouses that he said he found rather interesting.\n\nHe dismissed showy, big-budget projects such as the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" plan as \"silver bullet\" solutions. New Orleans, he said, is historically addicted to them. The aquarium, Convention Center and world\\'s fair were all silver bullets meant to save the struggling city. They were high-profile substitutes for more elemental changes to the municipal codes that, he believed, would have accomplished more over time. Duany puts great stock in municipal codes.\n\nNo \\'genius architects\\' needed\n\nThe portion of the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" plan that most drew his ire was the reliance on what he called \"the genius architects.\"\n\n\"All these people are congenitally over budget,\" he said, damningly, adding that they had no place in a \"city in crisis.\"\n\n\"They\\'re totally cool things,\" he said of tourist attraction architectural marvels. \"The point is that they don\\'t save the city.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Duany pointed out that he would personally benefit from the appearance of a design by Gehry, or one of the other geniuses, a stone\\'s throw from the Marigny shotgun house he\\'d recently bought for 60,000.\n\n\"I can\\'t wait to have a brilliant piece of architecture facing my house. It\\'s going to do wonders for my property value,\" he said.\n\nIf he had his choice of Pritzker Prize architects to build outside his front window he would choose Dutch star Rem Koolhaas.\n\n\"The others are not fun,\" he said. \"Rem has the irony, fatalism, complexity and bad taste that would work well in New Orleans.\"\n\nWhen Duany was asked if he could be added to a list of \"the genius architects\" brought in to save the city, he was adamant.\n\n\"I am not one of the genius architects,\" he said. \"I write codes. The basic theme is this: Cities require fundamentals to be in place.\"\n\nDuany listed safe streets, good schools, a working water supply, walkability and transit as the sort of citywide fundamentals that need to be addressed before a project like the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" or the proposed Thom Mayne-designed New Orleans Jazz Park, which he declared to be nothing more than a \"doormat for the Hyatt,\" could be undertaken. Both plans remain entirely on the drawing board and in the imaginations of their proponents.\n\nThough Duany\\'s past developments had distinctly historical styles, he said he was not against the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" or New Orleans Jazz Park because of their avowed shiny, starkly geometric modernism.\n\n\"I\\'m not an ayatollah of traditional architecture,\" he said.\n\nConsidering that the French Quarter is a perennial lightning rod of preservationist concerns, Duany\\'s Nov. 11 presentation could easily have become the urban planning equivalent of the shootout at the OK Corral.\n\nHe acknowledged that some people feared his influence on the sacred French Quarter.\n\n\"The monster has come,\" he said.\n\nJust minutes before Duany\\'s presentation at the Scottish Rite Temple on Carondelet Street, a member of his staff marveled that the master was so relaxed that he\\'d spent much of the day smoking cigars in his Decatur Street back yard -- the Marigny, he has said, reminds him of Cuba.\n\n\"I remember specifically when on a street in the Marigny,\" Duany recently wrote, \"I came upon a colorful little house framed by banana trees. I thought, \\'This is Cuba.\\' I realized in that instant that New Orleans is not really an American city, but rather a Caribbean one. I understood that when seen through the lens of the Caribbean, New Orleans is not among the most haphazard, poorest or misgoverned American cities, but rather the most organized, wealthiest, cleanest and competently governed of the Caribbean cities. This insight was fundamental because from that moment I understood New Orleans and began to truly sympathize.\"\n\nFacing the crowd of 50 who\\'d gathered to hear him speak in the acrid yellow ground floor of the temple, he said, \"Today, I spent all day listening to bamboo in the breeze and train sounds.\"\n\nSome in the audience were grim-faced, their arms crossed over their chests. A few folding chairs were occupied by bow-tied architect types. Duany\\'s staff of youthful acolytes eagerly awaited the revelation of their hard work -- and the master\\'s words.\n\nPerhaps it was the soundness of Duany\\'s ideas, perhaps that he\\'d solicited public input in advance, perhaps his aforementioned charm, but his potentially heretical presentation went off without fireworks.\n\nHe began with what he called \"a \\'Tom and Jerry\\' cartoon,\" a plan for the Marigny that he\\'d prepared of his own volition as an alternative to the New Orleans Building Corp.\\'s \"genius architect\" plan. To maximize usable space, he proposed a great wave of buried parking garages applied to the Marigny riverfront. St. Peters Street and the riverfront railroad tracks would tunnel through the landscaped garage berm. Atop the riverfront rise would be three stories of densely packed, brightly colored, quasi-Creole-style apartments and shops opening onto a promenade atop the existing docks. Dwellers and visitors would enjoy an unparalleled view of the river. His laser pointer slashed sword-like across the projected illustrations.\n\nResidents put at ease\n\nIf there was dissent in the audience, it went largely unspoken.\n\n\"I\\'ve never found a place that needed my services less,\" Duany said of the French Quarter as he launched into the feature presentation, setting the crowd immediately at ease.\n\nHe proposed five-story buildings along the French Quarter riverfront, arguing the space was too valuable for the current, ground-level parking lots -- enhanced parking would be integrated into the designs. He proposed that Rampart Street be transformed into a leafy Parisian-style boulevard, with multilevel parking garages to better accommodate French Quarter visitors. Parking, parking, parking: Duany seemed obsessed with the issue. As he later explained, the No. 1 complaint among French Quarter residents was lack of street parking. All of his plans were dedicated in part to \"liberating on-street parking for people living there.\"\n\nOne audience member questioned Duany\\'s reliance on automobiles in his plans. After all, new urbanism eschews individual vehicles for public transportation and pedestrians.\n\n\"I\\'m a ruthless realist,\" he said in response. \"I don\\'t want to force people not to drive. I want to invite them to walk.\"\n\nAnother audience member assailed Duany\\'s assertion that the Iberville public housing development should be saved, equating the complex with French Quarter crime.\n\n\"I believe the Iberville project is beautiful,\" he said, side-stepping the audience member\\'s political thrust.\n\nAnother questioned the height of the French Quarter riverfront structures.\n\nDuany assured them that properly designed structures needn\\'t be as tall or as blank as the towering Wyndham New Orleans Hotel near the river at Canal Street, which he described as a \"big oaf of a building.\"\n\nWith each critical stab, Duany parried deftly.\n\nHe concluded his presentation, true to his word, by suggesting a revamping of current French Quarter codes covering trash disposal, noise, litter, the destruction of buildings, parking lots and spilled liquid garbage, what he called the \"yellow ooze in the cracks.\" More importantly, he said, there needed to be a way to enforce existing code violations.\n\nThe seeming mantra of New Orleans is, he said: \"We shall not enforce anything.\"\n\nHis solution to the enforcement problem is a parking-ticket-style \"quality of life\" citation with such violations as \"building modification without permit,\" \"illegal demolition by neglect,\" \"improper signage,\" \"trash out on incorrect days\" and \"trash in general.\"\n\n\"Even people who handle a great deal of money get upset when they get a ticket,\" he said. \"One good 0 \\'trash in the wrong place\\' violation and you\\'ve got a cop paid for the whole morning.\"\n\nAnd then the presentation was over. His laser was extinguished. It was time for a scotch.\n\nDuany had been hired to consult. The job of implementing his ideas would remain in the hands of New Orleans leaders. His ideas would be passed through a chain of district and citywide planners, to be presented to the City Council as early as January.\n\nAn hour after the French Quarter presentation, at Duany\\'s Decatur Street headquarters, an enormous pot of gumbo was ready, and grace was about to be said. It was the custom during Duany\\'s stay in New Orleans, instigated by the team\\'s Cajun cook, to dedicate a suppertime prayer to one member of the planning team. That night, the last night of their two-week stay in New Orleans, grace was dedicated for the first time to Duany.\n\n\"Finally,\" he said.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nArt critic Doug MacCash can be reached at dmaccash@timespicayune.com or (504) 826-3481.\n\n_________________________\n\nThe Andres Duany File\n\nBorn Sept. 7, 1946, in New York City -- a Virgo.\n\nLived in Santiago, Cuba, until 1960 -- one year after Fidel Castro took power -- then moved to Barcelona, Spain, then Miami.\n\nGraduated from Princeton, 1971; Ecole de Beaux Arts, Paris, 1972; Yale School of Architecture, 1974.\n\nCo-founded Miami Arquitectonica architecture firm in 1976 with wife Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and others.\n\nCo-founded Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Co. in 1980 -- designs Seaside, the 80-acre resort village in Northwest Florida.

St. John founded the Order of the Most Holy Trinity and the Trinitarians today are active in many countries including the United States.\n�\nWhen did DeMatha open?\nIn 1931, the Trinitarians established a monastery in Hyattsville because of the close proximity to Catholic University. In 1946, a small high school was opened at the monastery for young men interested in the priesthood. Soon word spread to the local community and parents asked the Trinitarians to allow their sons to attend. A school was built in 1950, and additions were completed in 1960, 1990 and 1997.

A must-see for visitors.\n\nFact 2: Located in Lowry Woods on the campus of Texas Woman\\'s University, Little Chapel in the Woods was designed by noted architect O\\'Neil Ford and dedicated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on 1 November 1939. Even today, the chapel is regarded as a place where nature, art, and faith come together. It continues to be a popular place for quiet meditation.\n\nFact 3: If, as Elizabeth I observed, every dog has his day, that day must take place on the first Saturday of June – at least in Denton, Texas. The annual Dog Days of Summer Celebration puts the spotlight on man\\'s best friend, and festivities include a dog parade, stupid person tricks, paw readers, and doggie \"glam shots.\" The event also features a pageant to determine who is \"top dog.\"\n\nFact 4: No, Mean Green Fever is nothing you catch from mosquitoes or by drinking the water in an undeveloped country. Actually, it\\'s the nickname of University of North Texas athletics teams, who compete at the NCAA I-A level. Especially during football season, Denton Saturdays are energized by thousands of green-clad fans and alumni, who come in for home games at 30,000-seat Fouts Field.\n\nFact 5: Make no mistake about it: Denton is a special place to live, thanks to its vibrant downtown. Attractive Courthouse Square and the streets that surround it are home to locally-owned shops, restaurants, and bars. In fact, efforts the city put into revitalizing the area (beginning with the Courthouse restoration in 1986) have won the Denton Main Street Association numerous awards for historic preservation, rehabilitation, and adaptive re-use.\n\nFact 6: Folks may wonder why Denton\\'s main shopping center is called Golden Triangle Mall. In point of fact, Denton forms the top of the so-called Golden Triangle metropolitan area, with Dallas and Fort Worth serving as the bottom two points. While Denton may be smallest of the three, it\\'s by no means least important, thanks to its many industries and the town\\'s two highly regarded universities.\n\nFact 7: While football coaching legend Hayden Frye, a Baylor graduate, is perhaps more closely associated with the University of Iowa, he enjoyed a stint at UNT (then called North Texas State). His Texas career lasted from 1973 until 1978; during that time, he compiled a 40-23-3 record. For his 37-year career, Frye tallied 232 wins to go along with 178 losses and 10 ties, earning him a spot in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nFact 8: Denton, which traces its roots to 1857, was named in honor of John B. Denton, a lawyer, preacher, and soldier. (Denton is buried in the center of the downtown square, right in front of the courthouse.) What\\'s truly interesting about the town\\'s origin is that it was not a settlement before it was founded. That\\'s right: residents wanted the county seat to be located in the center of the county, so several owners donated land for the new town, which was laid out by Joseph A. Carroll and officially incorporated in 1866.\n\nFact 9: Aside from providing the setting for two prominent Texas universities, this city of 80,000-plus residents is also home to members of Grammy Award-winning bands Brave Combo and 1 O\\'Clock Lab. Other famous folks with links to Denton include rock-n-roll legends Don Henley, Roy Orbison, and Pat Boone, all alumni of the University of North Texas.\n\nFact 10: Each fall, Denton embraces its newest sons and daughters – that is, incoming freshmen at Texas Woman\\'s University and the University of North Texas. The former, founded by legislative act in 1901, offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral curriculums and is renowned for its work in Health Sciences. (TWU also began accepting male students in the early 1970s.) The latter, meanwhile, dates from 1890 and boasts a population of more than 30,000 graduate and undergraduate students.

Small establishments nestle on corners in large residential sections while larger establishments are positioned on the main thoroughfares, especially Gentilly Boulevard and Elysian Fields Avenue. The community is composed of primarily African American families of low and middle-income levels (Census 2000). The housing stock is predominately low sprawling post-World War II houses.\n  \t \nNative Americans Were First\n\nPrior to the Europeans, the Native Americans used the higher grounds along various bayous in the area. Europeans arrived as early as the late 1600s.\nEuropean\\'s Arrival\n\nAlexander Milne, a Scottish footman, who landed in the United States just before 1776, made a fortune from first a hardware business and then from brick making. He believed that future development would be along Lake Pontchartrain. He bought a large expanse of swampy real estate in this area. By 1830 he owned most of the lakeshore. Milne was right in his prediction. But even with the existence of the London Avenue Canal and the building of the Pontchartrain Railroad (Elysian Fields Avenue), it was not enough to draw homesteaders to the area. Throughout the 1800s, the railroad, that connected the city to Lake Pontchartrain, brought crowds of people from the city to the Milneburg resort in Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks neighborhood. A railway station was at the intersection of Gentilly Boulevard and Elysian Fields, where the railroad intersected Bayou Sauvage on the Darcantel Plantation.\n\nIt was not until the New Orleans Lakeshore and Land Company joined its drainage system at Florida Avenue with the Orleans Pumping Station that some scattered development did occur in the early 1900s.\n\nWith evidence of the earliest settlement in 1830, after the start of the Pontchartrain Railroad, sparse residential development started in 1905. Creoles were the first to inhabit the area after leaving the French Quarter/Esplanade area. The majority of development occurred from 1920 until 1950.\nSugar Hill\n\nDillard University, from which the neighborhood is named, opened in 1930 and moved to its existing site in 1935. During the 1940s, professional African Americans moved adjacent to the university and the area was called \"Sugar Hill.\" Huge oak trees lined the streets from Gentilly Boulevard to Benefit Street. Similar to the destruction of the Treme and 7th Ward\\'s thriving African American businesses and the removal of longstanding homes, this prosperous neighborhood was destroyed by the construction of the I-610 built straight through its middle, demolishing the trees and many houses. \n  \t  \nDillard University selected its name to honor Dr. James Hardy Dillard, whose distinguishable service in the education of African Americans in the South established an important chapter in the history of American education.\n\nHer Rich History\n\nDillard University was formed from a merger of Straight University and New Orleans University.\n\nThe American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church established Straight University in June 1869. The Freedman\\'s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church founded Union Normal School in July 1869. Straight University was later renamed Straight College and Union Normal School\\'s name changed to New Orleans University. Initially, both institutions provided instruction at the elementary, secondary, collegiate and professional levels.\n\nStraight College administered a law department from 1874 to 1886. New Orleans University began its medical department, including a school of pharmacy and a school of nursing, in 1889. The medical department was given the name Flint Medical College and the affiliated hospital was called the Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School. The medical college closed its operation in 1911, but the hospital, including the nursing school, continued and was renamed Flint-Goodridge Hospital of Dillard University and was located in Central City. The University ran the hospital from 1932 to 1983.\n\nNew Orleans University and Straight College merged in June 1930 and opened Dillard University. From 1930 to today Dillard has followed a policy \"in making no distinction as to race, religion or sex in the admission of students or in the selection of faculty.\"\n\nThe trustees of Dillard decided to close Gilbert Academy, the secondary school that was a part of the New Orleans University complex. However, the academy continued as a separate institution under the leadership of the Board of Education of the Methodist Church until 1949.\n\nSome outstanding accomplishments\n\nDillard instituted the first speech department in an African American university, the first undergraduate general education curriculum in the South, the first college in Louisiana to offer a nationally-accredited collegiate program in nursing, and the first among historically Black colleges and universities and any university in south central United States to offer a Japanese Studies program.\n\n    Dillard, University History\n    www.dillard.edu/about_d/history.htm\n\n    Carl Holmes Executive Development Institute hosted by Dillard University\n    www.iabpff.org/edi.htm\n\n  \t \nDillard University\\'s present location, since 1935, sprawls across 48 acres with its buildings fashioned in turn-of-the-19th century architecture. Marcus Akinlana, a local artist, displayed his talents on the London Avenue Canal Wall that borders the campus with a mural called \"Mystical, Magical New Orleans.\" This historically black private, four-year, liberal arts, coeducational university is a member school of the United Negro College Fund.\n\nA Taste of Some Outstanding Graduates and Associates\n\nBeginning in 1941, Dr. Albert Dent led Dillard University as its president for twenty-eight years. Dent grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, during segregation. He refused to ride segregated public transportation and said \"As a boy I walked all over Atlanta. Where ever I wanted to go, I walked.\" Albert Dent affected many African American students who later became activists and leaders in the local civil rights movement.\n\nRevius O. Ortique, Jr. was a student of both Xavier and Dillard Universities. Dr. Albert Dent and A. P. Tureaud, local counsel for the NAACP, made a significant impact on the young Revius. As an attorney, he became involved in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. He helped organize the McDonogh Day Boycott (in the McDonogh neighborhood) in 1954 and various public protests demanding civil rights. In the 1950s, he led the Urban League and fought job discrimination. He was elected judge in 1979.\n\t\t \n  \t  \t \nThomas C. Dent, writer, civil rights activist and dramatist, was the oldest son of Dr. Albert Dent and Ernestine Jessie Covington Dent, a former concert pianist. He began his writing career at Morehouse College as an undergraduate and lived and worked in New York for many years before returning to New Orleans. During his time in New York, he served as press liaison for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund during a most volatile time in United States civil rights history. Thurgood Marshall, then NAACP attorney and later Supreme Court Justice, appointed him to this position.\n\nHis writings in New York contributed greatly to the renaissance of published works that fueled the energy of the day and spoke to the power and struggles of African Americans.\n\nIn 1965, Dent returned to New Orleans and helped start the Free Southern Theater (FST). FST was a collective of artists, activists and thinkers who fought against racism and segregation through dramatic productions. Out of FST, Dent cofounded BLKARTSOUTH, a writer\\'s workshop to develop young writers and \"create a cultural base for them in the city.\"\n\n    AARC Notable African Americans from Louisiana Thomas C.

It opened in March 1949 with only 7,000 volumes. The library was named after a New Orleans cotton broker, whose wife bequeathed her and her husband\\'s entire estate, over one million dollars, to educational and charitable institutions. Approximately 50,000 from that estate was used to build the Norman Mayer Library. Today, the library contains over 30,000 books and has added hundreds of video and audiocassettes to its collection.\n\n    New Orleans Public Library Norman Mayer Branch\n    nutrias.org/~nopl/info/branches/ge/ge.htm\n\nHebrew Rest Cemetery\n\nOn Pelopidas Street is one of the three sites that make up the Hebrew Rest Cemetery, the largest of several Jewish burial grounds in New Orleans.\n\nThe Jewish people have made a significant impact on various aspects of the city\\'s culture and commerce. Through the generosity of Jewish philanthropists, the city benefited from major contributions to the New Orleans Museum of Art, establishment of institutions such as Tulane University and Touro Infirmary, support extended to Dillard University, and donations that helped parks and tourist attractions. Successful Jewish merchants, particularly during the 1800s and early 1900s, strengthened the city\\'s economy. Synagogues serving Jewish populations were built to serve the growing congregations in New Orleans and cemeteries were established for their dead.\nMount Olivet Cemetery &amp; Mausoleum\n\nMount Olivet Cemetery &amp; Mausoleum, on Norman Mayer Avenue, holds the remains of some of New Orleans\\' most noted. Henry Roeland \"Professor Longhair\" Byrd, singer, pianist, and Rock &amp; Roll pioneer, Walter C. Wright, educator and Negro Leagues baseball player and historian ; and Louis Westerfield, the first tenured African American law professor at Ole Miss University and the first dean of its law school. He grew up in the Fischer Housing Development and received his law degree from Loyola University.\n\nToday, Dillard is a residential neighborhood with many conveniences nearby. A high density of commercial establishments, large and small, satisfies most of the needs of the community. Liberty Bank, on Gentilly Boulevard, is one of the ten largest black-owned commercial banks in the United States. St. John Berchman\\'s Manor, run by the Holy Family Order of nuns, operates a Catholic preschool and a home for the elderly population.\nFor more information:\n\nGentilly/Dillard Relocate New Orleans\nwww.relocateneworleans.com/neighborhoods/gentilly.cfm\n\nA House Divided\nwww.tulane.edu/~so-inst/divided24.html\n\nA House Divided\nwww.tulane.edu/~so-inst/divided25.html\n\nJudeo-Alsatians in the Deep South\nwww.sdv.fr/judaisme/histoire/document/south/neworlns.htm\n\nFind A Grave, Henry Roeland \"Professor Longhair\" Byrd\nwww.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=2703\n\nWalter C.

Eager to explore common interests and bridge these divisions, residents of the three towns began meeting as early as 1995 to discuss how we could work together for the betterment of our communities. Year after year, more and more residents became involved. In 1997, in an effort to move forward in cooperation and collective development, the residents formed Gateway Community Development Corporation.\r\n\r\nSince this time, Gateway CDC has grown to become one of the leading membership, planning, and development organizations in Prince George\\'s County.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa41l0ubg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.950803,38.942858]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gentilly Area Map from GCIA","description":"Posted by Rufusl<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa48cxfwd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.05545,30.0156]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gentilly Business Corridor","description":"Posted by RufuslTimes Picayune\nOctober 26, 2006\n\nActivity mixed in Gentilly business corridor\nBy Jaquetta White\nBusiness writer\n\nThe businesses that bookend the two-block long retail hub along Gentilly Boulevard tell the story best.\n\nOn the one end, the parking lot of Liberty Bank at 3002 Gentilly Blvd., is overflowing with cars. Business was fast to return when the bank reopened in March and has not slowed.\n\nAt the other end, the 3216 Gentilly Blvd. address of what once was the flagship store of Zuppardo’s Family Supermarket, now marks only rubble.\n\nIn between, businesses in the retail-dense space fall somewhere within the two extremes. Like Liberty, there are those that are bustling with business. Good Phellaz Barber Shop, for example, won’t advertise for fear that a crush of business would leave the barbers overwhelmed.\n\nOthers, including a pawn shop, paint store and electronics chain, are busy with plans to return, though their storefronts remain dark.\n\nThen there’s the video store, fast food chain and convenience store that have cut ties with the stretch and likely are closed for good.\n\nAll told, about one-third of the businesses that before the storm operated in the Gentilly Boulevard corridor from Elysian Fields Boulevard to Norman Mayer Avenue have returned. With the exception of Family Dollar and Rite Aid, all of the businesses that have reopened are locally owned.\nBefore Katrina, the retail stretch was one of the most trafficked in Gentilly.\n\n“Gentilly and Elysian Fields is probably one of the busiest intersections in the city,” said Councilmember Cynthia Hedge-Morell, whose district encompasses the intersection. “It’s such a high volume of traffic because you can go anywhere in the city from that location.”\n\nAbout 28,000 cars a day drove down Gentilly Boulevard and across Elysian Fields Avenue, in 2004, the last year for which data is available, according to a traffic study done by the city’s regional planning commission.\n\n“It’s always been like a hub for the people who live around here,” said Rep. Juan LaFonta, D-New Orleans, who oversees the district and lives nearby. “It’s convenient for the people in Vascoville, Gentilly Heights and Sugar Hill.”\n\nBut the Gentilly commercial corridor is more than a cluster of stores and businesses along a busy road. It also serves as an economic barometer for the neighborhood and a harbinger of future residential and commercial growth.\n\nLike many of the neighborhood retail hubs scattered throughout the metro area, the resumption of business along the Gentilly stretch promises to provide momentum to a community struggling to rebuild. A revived business district also offers optimism to residents contemplating their own return.\n\n“It’s a vote of confidence in the city when a business opens,” Morrell said. “It’s a big shot in the arm.”\n\n“The development helps a great deal. It builds a sense of hope in people around here,” LaFonta said. “Then when people invest in their homes they feel it’s a good decision.”\n\nBut some of the retailers that once helped anchor the stretch in Gentilly have said they’re not coming back after Hurricane Katrina. Others, beset by insurance issues and concerns about the viability of the customer base, are wracked with indecision and unable to commit one way or the other. It’s unclear when or if the retail area will ever be the bustling vibrant corridor of commerce that it was prior to Katrina.\n\nFor Ji Kang and her father, who were scouting locations for their store Ebony Beauty Supply in 2004, the decision to lease a space in the 3100 block of Gentilly Blvd. was an easy one.\n\n“We knew that this was a good area,” Kang said. “We were like, ‘Woo, this is a busy area. It’s smack in the middle of everything.’ ”\n\nThree Regional Transit Authority bus lines pass through the strip. Last month, nearly 56,500 people rode a bus that passed through the area. What’s more, the stretch is hugged from every angle by residential neighborhoods.\n\nIt was not surprising then that the strip boasted a Blockbuster, Radio Shack, Walgreens, Rite Aid, post office, Auto Zone and numerous food restaurants, all within less than 1/2 mile of each other.\n\n“It was almost like you were in a small town,” Kang said. “Everything was right there. You could park your car in the parking lot and do everything in this area.”\n\nThat made it popular with nearby college students as well as older residents.\n\n“There used to be a lot of elderly people in the neighborhood because everything is in walking distance,” Kang said. “They could walk to the pharmacist and the grocery store.”\n\nDillard University students frequently walked the tract from their Gentilly Boulevard campus, for “junk food runs,” or “just to walk,” said Doneva Lewis, a sophomore at the university.\n\nThe reasons why some of those businesses have decided to close after the hurricane are many.\n\nRoy Zuppardo, whose family owned the Zuppardo’s Family Supermarket on Gentilly at Elysian Fields, said he has not yet decided if the store will be rebuilt. Had the store not suffered physical damage it would have reopened in Sept. 2005, Zuppardo said.\n\nThe 75-year-old structure had to be demolished because the roof fell in. The store was also “outdated” and in need of a facelift before the storm, Zuppardo said. The family owns another store in Metairie.\n\nZuppardo’s was the only grocery in the immediate area.\n\n“Our family owns the property, so there’s always a possibility,” Zuppardo said. “But we haven’t made a decision to come back or not.”\n\nNearby, Peaches Records and Tapes is uncharacteristically quiet. What had been the largest hip-hop music store in the city —— known as much for stocking the music of up-and-coming local rap talent as for the murals that adorned its storefront —— moved to another neighborhood. Rent at the Gentilly building tripled after the storm, LaFonta said.\n\n“This was the meet spot,” said longtime Peaches manager Eddie Gaspard, standing outside the shuttered store. “It was the hanging spot. Now it’s gone.”\n\nThe McDonald’s across the street also is not returning. The McDonald’s insignia has been removed from the storefront and replaced with a “for lease” sign.\n\nThe site, which did not have a drive-through, didn’t fit in with McDonald’s current operating scheme, Morell said.\n\n“It may come back but maybe not in that area,” she said.\n\nLike McDonald’s, two other national chains, Walgreens and Blockbuster, also are not returning, said Jim Brown, construction manager for the property where the stores were located.\n\n“(Blockbuster is) scaling back throughout the nation,” Brown said. “This just gave them a reason to scale back here.”\n\nMeanwhile Walgreens prefers stand alone stores that can accommodate large parking lots and a drive-through pharmacy. The Walgreens on Gentilly was in the center of strip mall and flanked by a pawn shop and hair care store.\n\nThe nearby post office will remain shuttered until there is enough of a population to justify its return.\n\nSome of the other closed businesses in the stretch have indicated that they want to return. Women’s clothing store Ashley Stewart will return next month, the property manager for the store said. The nearby Rite-Aid, which is operating from a trailer, will reopen in January.\n\nBrown said it has taken time to work through the insurance policies and get construction going on some of the sites. Also slowing the effort is that many of the businesses want their sites upgraded, a cost uncovered by insurance.\n\n“They pay for you to put things back the way they were,” Brown said. “Not to make all of these changes.”\n\nMorrell said that could mean that some new businesses will move in, if old tenants don’t come back.\n\n“It’s that they want to come back bigger and better than they were before,” Morell said. “At this time, I think it will be redeveloped, I just can’t say who and when.”\n\nThe goal is to have repairs completed on the stores that want to return, such as Payless Shoe Source and Simply Fashions, by early Spring.\n\n“When I first took this on I didn’t think it would take this long,” Brown said. “Insurance companies are not paying what it would take to put it back together.”\n\nIn the meantime, some locals who used to visit regularly say the shopping strip has lost some its luster.\n\n“Zuppardo’s, that used to be my store,” said Shelia Dillon, who lives in New Orleans East. “The prices were reasonable. The people were friendly. Everything you needed was there. I don’t care if it was chicken feet or chicken butt, they had it.”\n\nDillon said she now drives from the east to the West Bank to shop at the Wal-Mart on Manhattan Boulevard.\n\n“It’s far,” she said. “When you leave you come back two or three hours later.”\n\nHenry Jackson Jr.’s routine has also been altered. Jackson said he regularly took the bus from his home on DeSaix Boulevard to the retail corridor. He would drop off mail at the post office before buying a sandwich at the nearby Subway and eating it outside Baskin Robbins. Then he’d stop in Radio Shack or Walgreens. Jackson, 61, now gives his mail to the mailman or if he’s up to it, he’ll bring it to the main office on Loyola Avenue. As for lunch at Baskin Robbins and browsing the aisles of Radio Shack and Walgreens, he’s waiting to be able to that again.\n\n“I feel like this is a ghost town,” Jackson said. “I wish they would open up some places.”\n\nLewis, the Dillard student, said fewer businesses leaves students with fewer entertainment options. It used to be that they could walk to the stretch grab dinner and rent a movie.\n\n“That kept students on campus and active in campus life,” Lewis said.\n\nNow with fewer stores open nearby the students are always leaving campus.\n\nWhat’s more, she said, what had been a well lit, busy strip is no longer because businesses closed and those that are open close early. That means many students don’t feel safe making the walk.\n\n“If you haven’t eaten by 9 p.m., you won’t eat,” Lewis said. “It’s not safe anymore.”\n\nFor the businesses that have reopened, there is plenty of business.\n\n“We wanted to come back knowing that the Dillard students and the SUNO students and the UNO students would be back,” said Ji Kang, who owns Ebony Beauty Supply at 3114 Gentilly Blvd. “I’m a little bit shocked because I didn’t think I’d have this many customers because I don’t advertise.”\n\nMost of the customers, Kang said, are from New Orleans East and Slidell, where there are few beauty and hair care stores open.\n\nThe number of barbers at Good Phellaz Barber Shop, has slimmed from 14 to five since the storm. And with fewer barber shops open in the city, they’ve been busy, said Ferdinand White, who co-owns the shop on Caton Street, just off of Gentilly Blvd.\n\nThe shop opened in February. And although it sits in a strip mall where most of the other businesses are closed and the main traffic draw, a post office, still sits gutted to the studs, Good Phellaz has not had to advertise and most of its customers are new.\n\nStill, White waits for the day when more businesses open, making it easier for his customers to grab a snack or run errands before and after a haircut.\n\n“I was expecting them to come back sooner,” White said. “I think a lot of people don’t think people are back in the Gentilly area.”\n\nThere is rarely a slow time at the Family Dollar on Caton Street. The store, which reopened June 29 and sells milk, eggs and cheese along with dry food products, clothing and home ware is popular with nearby students and residents, assistant manager Erma Jones said.\n\n“It’s pretty lucrative around here,” Jones said. “At first business was slow, but as people come back and they realize we’re open they come in. This is one of the busiest and largest Family Dollars that the company has.”\n\nAbout 70 percent of the business has returned to Riteway Soul Food, co-owner Minh Tran said. While he’s impressed with that number, he said he has learned that many of his regulars who lived nearby haven’t returned because they are still lining up contractors to work on their homes.\n\n“I do believe the people around here want to come back but don’t have the construction,” Tran said.\n\n“I am satisfied with the progress, but I’m not happy. It could always be better,” Tran said. “I’m more optimistic than skeptical. I think it’s going to get better but I know it’s going to take time.”\n\nThat any business has reopened means the retail center and the community that surrounds it is poised for a comeback, LaFonta said.\n\n“That was an economically viable corridor before the storm,” LaFonta said. “And it will be again.”\n\nMorrell said that as the businesses come back so will the people who live nearby and vice versa. She is confident that Road Home money coming through the pipelines will help to boost both.\n\n“I think that’s going to spearhead a lot of development,” Morrell said. “We’re just getting to the point where people are making final decisions. As they do, everyone wants to have convenience. I think people are going to be more willing to shop in their neighborhoods now, if they can get their shops back.”\n\nJaquetta White can be reached at jwhite@timespicayune.com or (504) 826-3494. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa46ykw1h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.05991,29.99887]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gentilly Civic Improvement Association","description":"Posted by RufuslFabulous web site - lots of planning materials!\n\nGentilly Today\nFrom historic Arts &amp; Crafts bungalows and traditional New Orleans shotguns, to cozy Swiss Chalet-style cottages and modern brick ranch homes, there is something for everyone in Gentilly.\nLive oak, palm, magnolia, and crepe myrtle trees canopy its wide streets and boulevards. One can’t walk far in Gentilly without seeing wild parrots or squirrels.\nA Brief History\n\nTwo centuries ago, indians and French settlers populated what is now the Gentilly community, and an Indian trail followed the path of US Highway 90, or Chef Menteur Highway.\nIn 1830, the Pontchatrain Railroad was built. The Smokey Mary train chugged back and forth along Elysian Fields, bringing New Orelans residents to Milneburg, a recreational village on Lake Pontchatrain.\nAlexander Milne\n\nAlexander Milne, a Scottish footman and philanthropist who made his fortune from a hardware business and brick making, astutely predicted that New Orleans would expand northward. It did. He bought large tracts of land in this area, and by 1834 he owned most of the lakeshore. The Milne Lighthouse still stands at the foot of Elysian Fields, and is perhaps the most historic structure still standing in present-day Gentilly. Milne’s name was also bestowed upon a majestic cluster of elegant white buildings that became a home for wayward boys.\nGentilly Terrace Land Company\n\nThe first major developers in Gentilly were Messers Lafaye, DeMontluzin, and Baccich. Other owners of the area included Lake Shore Land Company, Gus Seeger, Seabrook Realty Company, Bienville Realty and the New Orleans Industrial Canal Land and Harbor Development Company.The 1914 construction of Gentilly Terrace School, in the center of Lafaye, DeMontluzun and Baccich’s development, signaled that Gentilly Terrace—the area\\'s first neighborhood, now listed on the National Historic Register— was a place where families put down their roots, and grow.\nWhy Gentilly?\n\n    * Families fall in love with Gentilly, and they stay in Gentilly.\n    * Gentilly’s myriad of neighborhoods provide a style of living for everyone.\n    * Gentilly is home to four Universities (UNO, SUNO, Dillard, and the Baptist Theological Seminary), as well as numerous elementary and high schools.\n    * Our community relishes diversity.\n    * We know our neighbors, and haveactive neighborhood associations.\n    * Elysian Fields links Gentilly to Lake Pontchatrain, the French Quarter, and the CBD.\n    * Your family can spend a day at Lake Pontchatrain, or even City Park.\n\n\nAbout the GCIA\nMeetings\n\nGeneral Meetings are the 2nd Saturday of each month unless otherwise stated\nGCIA Founders\n\nScott M. Darrah, LaDonna Darrah, Morwen Madrigal, John Triplett, Vera Triplett, David Welch, Georgian Spata\n \nHistory\n\nIn October 2005 several members of the Gentilly after Katrina Yahoo group met at City Hall with New Orleans City Council District D Councilmember Cynthia Hedge Morrell to discuss strategy for the rebuilding and repopulating of the Gentilly Community. As a result of this meeting Scott and LaDonna Darrah reached out to Morwen Madrigal, John and Vera Triplett, David Welch, and Georgian Spata and presented the idea of forming an umbrella civic association with the mission of uniting the Gentilly neighborhoods and neighborhood associations. All agreed and Scott Darrah filed the incorporation documents with the Louisiana Secretary of State as a non profit entity with himself, LaDonna Darrah, Morwen Madrigal, John Triplett, Vera Triplett, David Welch, and Georgian Spata as the founding Board of Directors.\n\nThe Gentilly Civic Improvement Association was born and became officially recognized by the LA Secretary of State as a New Non Profit entity in November of 2005. With the continuous support of Councilwoman Morrell and Criminal Sheriff Marlin Gusman the GCIA began the task of organizing meetings as well as community improvement and beautification projects. Joining the Board of Directors later in November were new members Jim Hollingshad, Flora Williams, and Father Roger Allen of the Episcopal Diocese of LA, Chapel of the Holy Comforter, with Scott Darrah taking responsibility for its leadership as the Acting President of GCIA.\n\nIn early December of 2005 the GCIA had its first public General Meeting which was an open meeting at the Chapel of the Holy Comforter with approximately 65 Gentillyans in attendance. At this meeting The purpose of the GCIA as well as the interim board members were presented to the body in attendance. Nikki Najiola also stepped up and accepted a position on the interim board agreeing to serve as interim Treasurer. Scott Darrah was elected GCIA\\'s first President by the body in attendance, Vera Triplett was elected its first Vice President, Nikki Najiola was elected its first Treasurer, and Georgian Spata was elected its first Secretary. The remainder of the Interim Board were accepted by the body in attendance of this meeting to serve along with the executive board to include LaDonna Darrah, John Triplett, Morwen Madrigal, Dave Welch, Fr. Roger Allen, Flora Williams and Jim Hollingshad.\n\nLater that same December, the GCIA established working relationships with the University of New Orleans, Dillard University, and Southern University at New Orleans all of whom have been instrumental in assisting the GCIA and the Gentilly Community in helping with the planning and implementation of the rebuilding of the Gentilly Community.\nToday\n\nThe GCIA now proudly serves as the common vehicle for all Gentilly Civic and Neighborhood Associations to unite and work together to achieve our collective goals. We continue to work toward seeing to the long term interests of the Gentilly Community and the unified Gentilly neighborhoods hereafter. GCIA has been actively engaged with Urban Planning, Economic Development, Education Re-development, Land Use and Zoning, Safety and Crime Prevention, and a host of other initiatives in the Gentilly Community to see to her future.\n\nGeneral Meetings are the 2nd Saturday of each month unless otherwise stated.\n\nBoard of Directors Meetings (for the time being) are the First Wednesday and the Third Friday of each month at 7pm.\n\nThe location will be primarily room 161 of the UNO Old Business Building which is the new GCIA Office.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3z2ldf4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.06429,30.00438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gentilly Planning District (6th Disctrict Orleans Parish)","description":"Posted by Rufusl<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa41nn26x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.05933,30.0006]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gentilly Terrace Neighborhood","description":"Posted by RufuslGentilly Terrace Neighborhood\n\n“Gentilly Terrace sits on a natural ridge created by Bayou Sauvage, a former flood plain.

California bungalow style houses, most of them constructed from 1910-1940, English cottages and Spanish- and Mediterranean-revival homes constitute this national historic district, the first 20th century New Orleans neighborhood to be listed.\nTerrace\\'s beginnings\n\t\n\nMathurin Dreux was granted a large tract of land in recognition of his services as a militia officer in the New Orleans province. He chose a tract along Bayou St. John that extended across the rear of the city, which included the present day Gentilly district. This was the highest spot in the city and virtually free from flooding.\n\nMathurin with his brother, Pierre, built their homes in the area and operated the land as a plantation. After their death, the estate stayed in the Dreux family for over two generations. The rural character of the area remained for almost two centuries.\nHigh ground key to development\n\nThe high ground and natural drainage with easy access to the city made this a prime section for development shortly before World War I. The Pontchartrain Railroad, built in 1830, provided transportation through the Gentilly district. It ran along Elysian Fields to Lake Pontchartrain.\n\nMichael Baccich, Edward E. Lafaye and R. E. Edgar de Montluzin laid out the neighborhood in the early 20th century. In 1909, Dennis Sheen purchased Edgewood Park, which extended from Gentilly Boulevard to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. After 1935, the neighborhood population grew rapidly.\nGentilly Today\n\nVarious organizations operate to keep the neighborhood safe and well maintained. Some of these organizations are the Gentilly Terrace Neighborhood Association, Gentilly Sugar Hill Residents Association, Gentilly Terrace &amp; Gardens Improvement Association, and the Neighborhood Watch Program.\nGentilly Terrace Creative Arts Elementary School\n\t\n\nThe neighborhood is proud to claim Gentilly Terrace Creative Arts Elementary as a Blue Ribbon School in 1991-92. The school plays an integral part in the community as neighborhood organizations and community groups, such as the Girl Scouts, use its facilities. In turn, the students participate in community activities. The banners that hang in the Kids Tent at the Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival are painted by the students each year.\n\nThe school building, built in 1914, reflects California Craftsman and Swiss Chalet influences. Its architectural significance contributed to the neighborhood\\'s national registry listing.\nFor more information:\n\nLouisiana Timeline\nwww.enlou.com/time/year1909.htm\n\nPreservation Resource Center\\'s Gentilly Terrace Historic District\nprcno.org/neighbor.html\n\nPreservation Resource Center Neighborhood Heroes\nwww.prcno.org/Schools/GentillyTerraceCreativeArts.htm\n\nNew Orleans Public Schools Blue Ribbon Schools\nwww.nops.k12.la.us/Schools/blueribbon.html\n\nNew Orleans Police Department Third District Neighborhood Watch Programs\nwww.new-orleans.la.us/home/nopd/content.php?dir=services/nwatch&amp;page=nw_3rd.php\n\nNeighborhood Profiles Project Document prepared by the City of New Orleans Office of Policy Planning and the City Planning Commission.

One client was Wal-Mart and, as the younger Sitt watched Walton personally tracking daily sales, he observed how differently Wal-Mart was run from other retailers he saw. He recalls cleanliness, friendliness and good prices. He also remembers his father\\'s prediction that one day Wal-Mart would be the biggest retailer in America.\n\nIt was an experience that still fuels the 38-year-old\\'s passion for retail. So did growing up in a tough Brooklyn neighborhood that lacked retail options. “Being frustrated as a kid that I couldn\\'t find decent retail was one of the biggest things that made me an advocate for bringing quality retailing into urban areas,” says Sitt.\n\nHis earliest venture was developing a 12,000-sq.-ft. retail project on East Tremont Avenue in a rough Bronx neighborhood when he was still in his 20s and studying at New York University.\n\nOther endeavors have included founding Ashley Stewart Ltd., a store specifically for African-American women. He eventually sold off more than 90% of Thor\\'s interest in the company. During his leadership, the store and its affiliates generated 00 million in sales in more than 300 stores. Thor also bought and sold The Children\\'s Place retail chain, which now consists of 629 stores nationwide. Thor has acquired or currently has under contract 5.5 million sq. ft. Projects in the works include Gentilly Woods in New Orleans, Military Circle Mall, Norfolk, Va., and an 80,000-sq.-ft. retail and office project on Chicago\\'s State Street.\n\nThe company is also in the midst of revitalizing the 475,000-sq.-ft. Gallery at Fulton Street in Brooklyn, striving for an upscale ambiance. The redevelopment has already attracted at least one big national retailer, Forever 21, which signed a 12-year lease. “This has been a tremendously underserved market,” Sitt comments. He estimates that more than  billion a year in retail spending has been traveling outside Brooklyn.\n\n“So many urban strip centers are run down to the ground. It\\'s disgusting,” he says. “People keep shopping at those places because there\\'s nowhere else to go.” Yet retail turnarounds don\\'t have to cost big bucks. Cleaning, repaving parking lots and installing lighting and music systems can transform an ailing property and the surrounding community. “It\\'s spending pennies to make dollars,” adds Sitt.\nWho\\'s the customer?\n\nRather than drop-kicking a suburban operation into the inner city, Sitt spends time hanging around with local leaders and in neighborhood churches, restaurants and clubs to identify residents\\' ethnic identities and preferences in music and clothing. Then Thor develops retail that caters specifically to local needs and tastes. “It\\'s important to inculcate into our heads an understanding of who that customer is,” Sitt says. For the Ashley Stewart stores, for instance, Thor listened to what aesthetics its target customer wanted. The store designs keyed into those desires with upscale leopard carpet, gold trim throughout and walls with a mahogany appearance.\n\nSitt calls it “Bellagio-ing” (referring to the chi-chi Las Vegas hotel) inner city stores — providing a first-class ambiance in areas that traditionally have been shunned by developers and retailers.\n\nThe development process is personally satisfying to Sitt, especially when customers kiss and thank him at grand openings. Thor\\'s approach also fits with the company\\'s earliest mission, which is embodied in its name. Thor, a Norse god, aims to defend the plant earth. The god\\'s objective correlates with Sitt\\'s aspiration of preserving and gentrifying urban areas. “People appreciate what we bring. The sales tax base jumps and projects spur the economy and bring jobs,” he says. “And when people shop and keep recycling dollars in the community, it furthers its growth.”\n\nUS News &amp; World Report\nUrban makeover artist\nBy Megan Barnett\n8/16/04\n8/05  \t\n\nYoung Adjustment co., Inc.\nRecent Claims Handled\nDate \tClient / Loss \tDamage Cost\nThor Equities � Gentilly Woods Mall- New Orleans, LA � Wind &amp; flood damage from Hurricane Katrina destroy shopping center\n\t5,000,000.00\n\nWhen Joseph Sitt turned 12, his grandmother promised to buy him the two things he wished for most: a video game and a parrot.

After the pair cased all of Brooklyn and came up empty-handed, they had to trek into Manhattan to find retailers selling what the boy wanted.\n\nAnd so a retail developer was born. Now 40, Sitt is the founder and CEO of Thor Equities, a real-estate developer focused on bringing retailers to blighted, urban areas of primarily low-income residents. He started the company in 1986 when he was just 21, with the purchase of a plot of land in the Bronx. He built a one-story retail building that eventually attracted Rite Aid Pharmacy and Payless ShoeSource. Today, the company owns more than 4 million square feet of real estate in cities nationwide, including Detroit, Chicago, and Atlanta. Thor Equities buys and develops primarily retail properties and consults with stores on their urban expansion strategies.\n\nNo sale. While Sitt knew firsthand of the opportunities for brand-name retailers in New York\\'s inner-city neighborhoods, selling that pitch to them wasn\\'t always so easy. For years, he endured rejection after rejection of his attempts to entice retailers to his shopping centers in some of the more crime-ridden areas of New York. The neighborhoods were too rough, there were no data on the market, and the suburbs had more money. Frustrated by the rebuffs, he started his own chain of stores to prove that inner-city retail prospects existed. It worked.\n\n\"Everybody said I was nuts,\" says Sitt. \"They said, \\'This kid\\'s gonna get his ass handed to him.\\' But the day has arrived. The white urban market is saturated. There is no place else to grow. Joe Sitt proved it.\" Indeed, the company Sitt founded in 1991, called Ashley Stewart, now counts 170 stores. He sold the clothing chain, which caters to the African-American professional woman, in 1998.\n\nSpeaking with a thick Brooklyn accent, Sitt is easily excitable. Ask him about inner-city economics, and you\\'re likely to get an earful of colorful anecdotes about urban prospects, places that have \"gold in our own backyards.\" His observations are now backed up by hard data, which have helped to win retailers like Forever 21, Foot Locker, and Old Navy to some of the toughest neighborhoods in the country. According to the nonprofit group Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, urban cores hold more than 5 billion in annual retail spending power. Moreover, the predominantly black and Hispanic populations in many of these neighborhoods are among the fastest growing.\n\nSitt credits these figures as just one of the reasons for the change of heart of some major retailers. His company\\'s improvements to malls are another attraction. In 2001, Thor Equities bought a run-down strip mall in the Gentilly Woods area of New Orleans. Residents told him they needed a linens store. Thor Equities remodeled the building, upgraded the parking lot, improved the lighting, and brought in Anna\\'s Linens as a mall anchor. \"It was an ugly space, and it took a lot of work on his part,\" says Pat Barber, Anna\\'s vice president of real estate. \"He did a beautiful job with it. The store is doing great.\" At the start of the project, Sitt says, only one in 40 lenders responded to his request to fund the project. After its completion, he was able to refinance with J.P. Morgan Chase. \"They all thought it was an unfinanceable ugly duckling,\" he says. \"I had to prove I was able to do it.\"\n\nThor Equities is doing similar renovations in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Puerto Rico. But Sitt still focuses much of his effort on his hometown of Brooklyn. Many firms cite high prices and space constraints as reasons to open in New Jersey instead of Manhattan. \"I think Brooklyn should be the weapon New York City uses,\" he says. Sitt is now weighing offers from three of the largest chains, including Wal-Mart, to anchor his Gallery at Fulton Street in downtown Brooklyn. With a big-box retailer like that, there will be no shortage of video games for all the 12-year-olds in Bensonhurst.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa42rummc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.039931,30.004041]}},{"properties":{"name":"Giant Food Queens Chaple/ Chillum - 1.8 miles","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3104 Queens Chapel Rd., 20782center has a CVS and in need of revitalization<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3xuw73o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.968327,38.950665]}},{"properties":{"name":"Giant Food at PG Metro","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/1/Giant_at_PG_Metro.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> The Washington Post\n\nRetail Near Metro in Hyattsville\n\nBy Dana Hedgpeth\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, October 31, 2005; \n\nThere are more than a dozen Metro stations in Prince George\\'s County, but unlike at stops in Fairfax and Montgomery counties, there is no private development near the stations on land owned by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\n\nThat\\'s about to change. Prince George\\'s County officials and developers held a groundbreaking ceremony last week to mark what will be the first private mixed-use development of office, residential and retail on about 20 acres owned by WMATA at the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station near East West Highway and Belcrest Road in Hyattsville.\n\t\n\nThe 60 million project will be developed in phases over the next three years. It will include a 300,000-square-foot office building and 260 luxury apartments, which will rent for ,500 to ,700 a month. It also will have about 130,000 square feet of retail, including a Staples, Bally\\'s Total Fitness and Circuit City, according to the lead developer of the project, Taylor Development and Land Co. of Miami. The developer also plans restaurants and other small shops for the center.\n\nThe project comes as the area\\'s retail offerings are starting to improve, with the multimillion-dollar renovation of the Mall at Prince George\\'s and the addition of movie theaters and a grocery store at the nearby University Town Center project.\n\nConstruction on the retail part of the new complex will start in the first quarter of next year and be completed in the second quarter of 2007. Residential construction will start in the next month and be done in 2 1/2 years, according to MCF Investment Co. of Silver Spring, which is doing that part of the project.\n\nWork on the large office building will begin in the first quarter of 2007, and Taylor Development officials said they are seeking a federal government agency as a lead tenant for that building. The developers will lease the land from WMATA for 99 years.\n\n\"We\\'re excited we\\'re at a point where we can get moving on our project and get it built,\" said Jennifer Rademacher, a vice president at Taylor Development.\n\nIn the same way that many Prince George\\'s residents express chagrin that their county lacks high-end and fashionable retailers, county officials and local developers have shown frustration that their county has not seen the intense development that has grown up around such Metro stations as Ballston in Arlington and Grosvenor in Montgomery County.\n\nSome say the uncertainty of the market in Prince George\\'s made developers leery of doing deals. Others privately blame WMATA for being bureaucratic and cumbersome in how it does its land deals, although they said they are nervous about criticizing the agency publicly because they want to land future deals with it.\n\n\"For market reasons, developers headed to other parts of the region,\" said Rosalyn Doggett, a senior development staffer at WMATA.\n\nAt least five other projects are planned on WMATA-owned land in Prince George\\'s, according to WMATA officials. There are 15 Metro stations in the county.\n\n\"Developers realize we have sizeable sites in Prince George\\'s County,\" Doggett said. \"There\\'s greater interest in transit-oriented developments because people don\\'t want to drive so far anymore.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa46vyu2x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9586277008,38.9659908398]}},{"properties":{"name":"Green Hill Overseer’s\tHouse","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> 6606 22nd Place.

Just when one foot seems to lift out of the post-hurricane muck, the other slips.\n\nIn the latest entanglement, the move of a historic Catholic school, promising rebirth for the battered Gentilly neighborhood, has been stymied by preservationists. The school had planned to tear down an abandoned 1960s-era church in Gentilly in order to rebuild, but preservationists here said the austere, modernist structure was worth saving.\n\nProviding an unexpected assist to the preservationists is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is vital in financing the school’s move but is balking, for now.\n\nDismayed politicians and residents of the emptied Gentilly district, desperate for any hint of confidence in New Orleans’s future, are crying foul. Barely a third of residents have returned to the neighborhood, one of the city’s black middle-class centers.\n\n“This could be a blow that the neighborhood may not be able to come back from,” said Cynthia Hedge Morrell, the district’s city councilwoman.\n\n“Are you saying,” she said, “that a piece of concrete is more valuable than humans?”\n\nThe dispute is typical of the tough choices routinely forced to the surface here in Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath. Moving on or moving back is a theme playing out across the city, notably in a fierce struggle over the future of public housing projects.\n\nOther signs of faltering renewal abound, like companies shifting their headquarters and employees out of the city, developers waiting on tax credits, and homeowners looking in vain for aid checks. Building projects are numerous on paper, but actual construction is much harder to detect, and it will be several years before inexpensive housing is developed.\n\nA new survey by the University of New Orleans suggests that one-third of residents, weary of the waiting game, are thinking of leaving, and soon.\n\nAt the heart of the church standoff is the Holy Cross School, a fixture on the riverbank in the Lower Ninth Ward since the 1870s. It usually educates more than 800 boys in grades 5 through 12. The school, inundated by Hurricane Katrina, now operates out of trailers at about 60 percent of its old enrollment levels, and it wants to leave the moribund, vulnerable area it colonized when the Lower Ninth Ward was still farmland.\n\nThe school flirted with moving to the Jefferson Parish suburbs, an idea that is generally poison to city residents. But then it said it would stay in New Orleans, proposing to move to Gentilly. That decision was a rare thumbs up for the city, and even citizens living far from Gentilly felt a boost that a pillar of New Orleans’s old-line Catholic establishment would be staying.\n\nIn Gentilly itself, where on a weekday morning the loudest sound is the wind rustling through dead tree branches, there was jubilation, as well as visions of loud schoolboys and teachers crowding the empty sidewalks.\n\n“I can’t tell you the overwhelming joy people felt with this announcement,” said Scott Darrah, president of the Gentilly Civic Improvement Association. “It was one of the most joyous occasions people in this community had had since the flood, one of the most hope-filled occasions. People all over were sending me e-mails saying, ‘Thank you, we’re so thrilled.’ ”\n\nIt is not hard to see why. Vacant houses and empty windows stare across the street at the 18-acre site that the school’s independent board is buying, at a reasonable price, from the Archdiocese of New Orleans. At intervals a trailer in a front yard indicates an owner’s rare interest in the future. All seems ready for redevelopment — or abandonment.\n\nBut there was a hitch in the good news. The site chosen by the school contains the St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Church, one of the city’s rare expressions of mid-20th-century modernism, an unusual structure with a white knitting-needle spire poking out from a thin, curled concrete roof that seems to float over the church’s brick-box body.\n\nIt has hardly been on the city’s list of must-see landmarks, and with its resemblance to a giant kitchen appliance, it gets mixed reviews from architects.\n\n“It’s certainly an important modernist building, locally,” said Errol Barron, a leading New Orleans architect.\n\nThe church has been unused since the storm, and the local archdiocese was ready to part with it. The school, saying it needed the site cleared, was preparing a date with the wrecking ball. Fixing up the church and maintaining it would be too expensive, school officials said. They ringed the site with bright yellow signs advertising enrollment.\n\nBut rumblings from preservation-minded former parishioners, who had moved elsewhere, began percolating upward. The New Orleans Historic District Landmarks Commission voted to study the church, and school officials, construction plans at the ready, started to get uneasy.\n\nThen the city’s de facto tutelary deity stepped in: FEMA decided the church might be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. And that was a position with potentially deep consequences for the Holy Cross School, one that could mean no federal money — a potential 0 million — to help it relocate.\n\n“It was very much of a surprise to us,” said William Chauvin, chairman of the Holy Cross board of trustees. “The archdiocese had no intention of keeping that facility.”\n\nNow, all is on hold, a frustration to the school and its supporters. In a statement on Monday, FEMA said it was required to “evaluate the potential historic significance” of the church, though late in November an agency official wrote that it had already determined that the church was eligible to be in the National Register. Mr. Chauvin interpreted the shift in wording as a softening of FEMA’s position.\n\nThe State of Louisiana and the National Park Service must also weigh in on the church’s precise significance.\n\nIts fans are as passionate as those yearning for Gentilly to come back. “A very exciting place to worship,” said Stephen Verderber, a professor of architecture at Tulane University, “the exact opposite architecturally from the traditional design of a church.”\n\nBut Bruce Velez, a contractor living in a trailer across the street as he fixes up a gutted house, said, “If they keep messing around, the school will go somewhere else.” Mr. Velez longs for the school.\n\n“We were lucky to get it,” he said, looking down the empty street. “I wish they’d hurry up and tear the church down. You’re going to have kids from the 5th to the 12th grades. I mean, think about it. That’s a lot of people.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa461nbec"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.075066,30.013971]}},{"properties":{"name":"Home Depot- 3301 E West Highway","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa41xkpq7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9608700275,38.9664996926]}},{"properties":{"name":"International Food Market","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> International Food Market27,000 SF Latino oriented grocery store.

Two nearby apartment buildings, built nearly four decades ago, would be demolished. New construction would replace them, and the residents who occupy the 1,000 units would be relocated.\n\t\n\nThe Landover Mall site covers most of the area planners want to develop. The plan hinges on a commitment from its owner, Lerner Corp., an official said.\nThe Landover Mall site covers most of the area planners want to develop. The plan hinges on a commitment from its owner, Lerner Corp., an official said. (Maryland-national Capital Park And Planning Commission)\n\n\"This is going to be a major project,\" said County Council member David Harrington (D-Cheverly), who represents the Landover area. \"The importance of this plan is that it sets in motion a vision for this area.\"\n\nThe development, which is in the very early planning stages, is the latest attempt to breathe new life into the inner and older suburbs of Prince George\\'s, where District residents flocked in the 1960s and \\'70s for sprawling green lawns, trees and affordable housing. The area has changed, however, in the past couple of decades: Crime rates have risen, housing stock has eroded and student academic performance has slipped.\n\n\"We have some of the crime stuff, the transient kind of moving,\" said Sylvester Vaughns, 71, a member of the county planning board and longtime Landover resident.\n\nThe proposal to transform Landover into a residential and cultural hub is an example of what is happening in inside-the-Beltway communities throughout the county, with private-public development projects boosting the profiles of areas including Hyattsville and Suitland.\n\nFor example, a two-mile strip in Hyattsville that was once filled with auto repair shops and liquor stores is being reshaped into an arts and entertainment district, where condominiums with lofts are being marketed to artists.\n\nFarther south, Suitland Manor, a 33-acre complex of barracks-style apartments, is being demolished, and an 0 million development of single-family houses, condominiums and rental apartments will be built. County officials say a developer will soon be selected for the project, part of an overall residential and commercial center in Suitland.\n\nHarrington said the Landover development hinges on a commitment from Lerner Corp., which owns the mall property. Lerner\\'s 88 acres cover more than two-thirds of the area being considered for development.\n\n\"We\\'re very much on board,\" said Joel Rozner, an attorney for Lerner.\n\nOver the years, Lerner has been approached at different times with proposals to relocate the county seat, school board headquarters and Prince George\\'s Hospital Center to its site off Brightseat Road. Lerner showed interest, but none of the proposals came to fruition.\n\nRozner said that the company wants a \"vibrant mixed-used development\" on the property and that the current plans are a \"work in progress.\"\n\nPlanners are drafting the Landover Gateway Sector Plan, which would cover the demolished mall site, two aging apartment complexes, the Landover Crossing Shopping Center -- a half-empty complex with a liquor store, nail salon and barbecue takeout restaurant -- and a nearby abandoned used-car dealership. The county would need to make a zoning change in the area from commercial and residential to mixed use.\n\nFor years, community activists and residents of Landover, which includes the neighborhoods of Palmer Park, Kentland, Glenarden and Brightseat, have urged the county to push for revitalization of the area.\n\t\n\nThe Landover Mall site covers most of the area planners want to develop.

The plan hinges on a commitment from its owner, Lerner Corp., an official said. (Maryland-national Capital Park And Planning Commission)\n\nDiane McGlone, 53, said she wants beauty and jobs brought back to the area.\n\nThe Palmer Park resident remembers shopping, going to dinner and seeing movies at Landover Mall, which sits at the Capital Beltway and Landover Road, during its heyday in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe mall, with Garfinckels, Woodward &amp; Lothrop and Hecht\\'s as its anchors, was a landmark in the county for three decades. Before Bowie Town Center was built, people from across the region converged on the mall, which provided shoppers with the type of quality stores offered in nearby Montgomery and Fairfax counties.\n\nBut a stabbing on mall property, a shooting at a nearby apartment complex that left five people dead and a surge in overall crime in the area in the late 1980s and early 1990s frightened shoppers and eventually helped fuel the mall\\'s rapid decline.\n\nBy the time the mall closed in 2002, it had been reduced to a shell of its former self, its fashionable stores replaced with others selling items for a dollar, McGlone said. Only Sears remains of what used to be Landover Mall.\n\n\"Whatever they do, it will be beneficial for the community,\" McGlone said.\n\nBut not everyone is so certain.\n\nGlenarden Mayor John W. Anderson said he is worried about the thousands of people, many of them low-income, who will be forced from their homes.\n\n\"Where are they going to go?\" Anderson asked. \"Somebody needs to be concerned about that. . . . It\\'s not that I\\'m not advocating for development, but you have to also be concerned about the people who are going to be displaced.\"\n\nArthur Berlin, general partner of the Maple Ridge Apartments, which has more than 400 units, said he is interested not in selling his property, but in improving it. Berlin said he\\'d like to see a more upscale community, but he also wants \"to make sure long-term tenants are able to react to the situation.\"\n\nHarrington said the redevelopment of the area is designed to complement the nearly  billion mixed-use development being built less than two miles away, known as Woodmore Towne Centre at Glenarden. The 245-acre development, set to open next year, will include condominiums, a hotel, office space and a Wegmans grocery store.\n\n\"The two areas would strengthen each other,\" said Christine Osei, a county planner who is working on the Landover plan.\n\nOsei said an outline of the development should be finished by the end of the year. A public hearing is expected to be held in February, and the council will consider it for final approval at the end of next year, according to the projected timetable.\n\n\n\nOfficials focusing on Landover Mall\nAbandoned shopping center is down the road from site of new Wegmans\nThursday, June 8, 2006\nby Marcus Moore\nStaff Writer\nNow that Prince George’s County has landed its first major upscale retailer — Wegmans Food Market in Landover — county and business officials have turned their attention to nearby Landover Mall, which for four years has been an eyesore and vivid reminder of the economic development obstacles the county faces.\nArthur Turner, chairman of the Prince George’s Chamber of Commerce’s economic development committee, has criticized owner Lerner Enterprises of North Bethesda for its failure to revitalize the mall.\n‘‘Landover Mall has been a black eye on the county, because of the deterioration that Lerner allowed to happen at the mall,” Turner said. ‘‘While there’s been an effort to revitalize Landover Mall, the biggest obstacle has been the owner, and we have continued to work around them.”\nThe mall — on Route 202 near FedEx Field — is across from a used-car dealership and the 173,495-square-foot Landover Crossing Shopping Center, which has lost both its anchor stores in two years. Sam’s Club closed its doors at the 19-acre shopping center in August, delivering a blow to a center that had already lost Circuit City — its other anchor — to the Boulevard at the Capital Centre in Largo.\nBut before the area gets a major face-lift, much of the land would have to be rezoned, said County Councilman David Harrington (D-Dist. 5) of Cheverly.\nWhile Landover Mall is important to the city’s revitalization, it is not the key component, Harrington said.\n‘‘I don’t think it necessarily depends on Landover Mall,” Harrington said. ‘‘The days of having a mall like Landover doesn’t speak to the current marketplace. The development of the Woodmore Towne Centre will help the development of Landover Mall.”\nHarrington said he met Friday with Lerner officials, who agreed to develop a mixed-use project on the 110-acre property. Lerner officials are scheduled to meet with residents for feedback on the project in the next two weeks, he said. Portions of the mall are now being demolished.\nLerner representatives did not return phone calls seeking comment.\nThe Maryland-National Park and Planning Commission will spend the next two years analyzing Landover Mall and its vicinity, said John Funk, project facilitator of the Landover Mall and Vicinity Planning Study. The commission analyzed redevelopment opportunities for the area during the project’s first phase, which was completed in April. Starting in July, the commission will create a master plan for the area.\n‘‘It’s really a redevelopment strategy that the County Council asked us to look into,” Funk said.\nLandover Mall closed its doors in 2002, leaving only a Sears that remains open. Last September, Dimensions Healthcare System targeted the mall as a site for a 00 million hospital, complete with restaurants, hotel and a 250-bed hospital tower, but those plans have stalled.\n‘‘There wasn’t any fire under that,” Harrington said. ‘‘There was some interest to move there, but they had no funds to build there.”\nDown the road, Petrie Ross Ventures of Annapolis is developing the 245-acre, 8.5 million Woodmore Towne Centre, anchored by a 130,000-square-foot Wegmans Food Market. The store, scheduled to open in late 2008, will have about 700 employees, said Ralph A. Uttaro, senior vice president of real estate development for the Rochester, N.Y., chain.\nUttaro has called Landover an ideal location because of its proximity to the Capital Beltway.\nTurner agreed, calling Landover the center of Prince George’s and saying the city’s pending revitalization was a long time in the making.\n‘‘It’s not an accident. It’s by design,” Turner said. ‘‘Seeds have been planted for quite some time and now they’re germinating.”\nMall\\'s Comedown Taints Lerner Image\nResentment of Nats\\' New Owner Lingers in Pr. George\\'s\nBy David Nakamura\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nTuesday, May 16, 2006; Page B01\nAfter being named owner-to-be of the Washington Nationals, Theodore N. Lerner proclaimed that the team and the new ballpark in Southeast would be his legacy, the capstone in a long, distinguished career as one of the region\\'s most influential builders.\nTysons Corner Center in Fairfax County, White Flint Mall in Montgomery County and Dulles Town Center in Loudoun County are a few of the projects on which the 80-year-old Bethesda developer has made his reputation.\n\"The baggage and ghost of Landover Mall still negatively impact us today,\" says activist Arthur A. Turner Jr. of the Lerner Enterprises complex. (By Lois Raimondo -- The Washington Post\nBut in Prince George\\'s County, Lerner\\'s legacy is clouded by the fate of the Landover Mall, a once-thriving retail destination whose long, slow decline was punctuated when it was shuttered in 2002. Built and owned by Lerner Enterprises, the complex -- on a 110-acre site just inside the Capital Beltway, near the Washington Redskins\\' FedEx Field -- has sat dark and empty for four years, with the exception of a Sears store that remains open. The marquee is covered in sheets, the grass is calf-high and the vast parking lot is used for overflow football crowds.\nSome Prince George\\'s civic activists and the administration of former county executive Wayne K. Curry (D) have charged that the project symbolizes the broad neglect of the predominantly black county by major developers and retailers.\n\"When I look at the news and read stories, everyone fawns over what a great man he is,\" said Arthur A. Turner Jr., an activist from the nearby Kettering neighborhood who has lobbied county leaders to seize the property through eminent domain. \"But the baggage and ghost of Landover Mall still negatively impact us today. He\\'s a failure in Prince George\\'s County.\"\nCurry, who was county executive from 1994 to 2002, complained that Lerner invested heavily in his malls in other jurisdictions but failed to reinvest in Landover Mall after it opened in 1972.\nOther county residents and the administration of current County Executive Jack B. Johnson (D) have been more tempered, saying they hope the Lerner company will redevelop the site. They say Lerner could ride the momentum created by several new projects, including the Boulevard at the Capital Centre, featuring the Magic Johnson movie theaters, and the Woodmore Town Centre, which will include a Wegmans grocery store.\nAlan H. Gottlieb, chief operating officer of Lerner Enterprises, said company officials have met a half-dozen times with Prince George\\'s leaders in the past year.\n\"We listened to their vision for the site and spoke of our desire to build a great project,\" Gottlieb said in an e-mail. \"We discussed potential uses and shared information to create the foundation for a working partnership with the county.\"\nGottlieb added that Lerner Enterprises has made significant investment in Prince George\\'s beyond Landover Mall: The company owns the Greenbelt Marriott and helped build 3,000 apartment units in the county.\nLandover Mall opened when Prince George\\'s was still a predominantly white county. A regional attraction, the mall featured high-end department stores, a movie theater and an ice cream shop.\nBut when anchor stores Garfinckel\\'s, Raleighs and Woodward &amp; Lothrop went out of business, the mall began to decline. The Gap moved out, and the Dollar Store moved in. Meanwhile, the county was changing, too, becoming predominantly African American, with a higher level of affluence outside the Capital Beltway but growing social problems.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa41we60k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.855974,38.918618]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lane Manor Splash Park MNCPPC","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/1/splash_park_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3zrj87u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9624900818,38.9829645272]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lantana Community","description":"Posted by Rufusl1,700+ SF detached houses at build out, <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3yig1zp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.12326,33.07622]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lantana area information","description":"Posted by Rufusldata rich web site<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa40ldn83"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.11451,33.09183]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lewisdale Community Park","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/11/1/lewis_park_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa483t6dp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9690990448,38.9686518489]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lewisdale Elementary school","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 2400 Banning Pl., Hyattsville, MD 20783<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa47qcyt8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.968744,38.97529]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lewisdale Neighborhood Park","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3zmaziu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9642925262,38.9794950527]}},{"properties":{"name":"Liberty Bank &amp; Trust","description":"Posted by Rufusl Strong Financial Institutions are the Bedrock of Thriving Viable Cities\n\nNew Orleans is a better place to live because of Liberty Bank. Citizens who never before had equal access to life’s economic opportunities have been given a chance. Minority businesses have been launched, education for school children has been financed, and countless commercial and consumer loans have been made because of Liberty\\'s sensitivity to the special needs of those it serves.\n\nWord of Liberty\\'s commitment and dedication to top-quality service has spread. Moreover, seventy Fortune 500 companies have exhibited confidence by banking with Liberty. Liberty was awarded the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) \"outstanding\" rating in 1994, and has maintained it.\n\nSuccess and accomplishments of this kind are evidence of hard work and commitment. Liberty Bank &amp; Trust is here to continue providing quality services to the community.\n\nOn the Road to Financial Freedom... Let Liberty Show You The Way. \n\nThe mission of Liberty Bank is to provide cost-effective delivery of high quality, innovative, customer-driven products and services to the diverse markets with particular focus on the disadvantaged African-American community who traditionally have been financially underserved.\n\nConcurrent with the bank\\'s mission, we strive to generate a fair return to shareholders while being an excellent corporate citizen. \n\nA Strong Foundation\nFounded in 1972, Liberty Bank has always been based on ideals of service and integrity. With a primary focus on bringing financial services to the traditionally under-served, Liberty quickly established itself as a financial force in the New Orleans community. By combining a vision of community uplift with a commitment to fundamental banking principles, the Bank helped to grow its customer base while growing its own resources and operations.\n\nMore than three decades later, Liberty Bank is a model of corporate stability. Consistent growth in assets and profitability has created a banking powerhouse with the capacity to participate in major projects and to provide services to the largest clients. The base is strong, making the possibilities virtually limitless.\n\nProfits and Assets: Strength in Numbers\nWhile Liberty has an enviable record of consistent growth, the last decade has seen a tremendous acceleration of both profitability and asset accumulation. Within that period, the Bank has grown from 0 million to 40 million in total assets and has significantly increased its profitability. In its most recent year-end report, Liberty showed single-year profitability growth of 22%, and enjoyed a return on common equity of more than 20% year over year for the past four years.\n\nLiberty\\'s growth has been the result of acquisitions, expansion of products and services, aggressive marketing, fruitful partnerships, strong management, excellent staff productivity, and the trust it enjoys in the community. It all adds up to an efficient, well-capitalized institution that is perfectly positioned to continue fast-paced growth in both profits and assets.\n\nExpanding Our Reach\nFrom its original office in a trailer on a corner lot in New Orleans, Liberty Bank has expanded to 13 branch offices in three cities and two states, with the majority of this growth taking place in the past decade. Liberty established its Baton Rouge presence in 1994, opening its third branch there in 2004. The Bank moved into Mississippi in 2003, acquiring First American Bank in Jackson, and has since opened a second Magnolia State branch on the Jackson State University campus.\n\nLiberty\\'s reach is not limited just to banking offices. Its rapidly expanding ATM network now features over three dozen locations. Independent loan production offices bring mortgage and other profitable lending activity into the Bank. And thousands of credit card holders carry the Liberty brand literally around the world.\n\nWhile Liberty\\'s recent expansion has been rapid, it has also been measured. Each new office, whether an acquisition or a new branch opening, is carefully situated for maximum marketplace impact. Each new territory, product or service is carefully researched to make sure it fits appropriately within the bank\\'s profile and plans.\n\nThe Power of Technology\nNew technologies have revolutionized banking and Liberty Bank\\'s embrace and application of the most powerful banking technologies are another reason for its success. From customer services like on-line banking, check imaging, direct deposit and automated bill paying, to merchant services that increase business speed and opportunity, to the most advanced corporate and governmental support applications, Liberty has harnessed the power of technology for maximum banking versatility, convenience and productivity.\n\nCorporate Partnerships\nHelping business do business is one of Liberty Bank\\'s top priorities. The bank\\'s business portfolio ranges from small business loans to combined ventures with Fortune 500 companies. But this is just one aspect of Liberty\\'s multi-faceted corporate service package. Financial management services, insurance, investments, and consulting make Liberty Bank a valuable partner for any growth-oriented enterprise.\n\nGovernment Partnerships\nPublic-private partnerships are increasingly being seen as a way to get more done while enhancing business profitability. Liberty Bank has had this vision for many years.\n\nCurrently, Liberty serves as the fiscal agent for the City of New Orleans, substantially improving the City\\'s cash flow and cash management practices and increasing its interest income, while also generating significant income for the bank. Liberty also provides expertise in areas such as collections, financial systems and customer service, and has become a key partner to city government.\n\nAt the federal level, Liberty Bank has worked with many different branches of government on everything from the takeover of failing financial institutions to initiatives such as New Market Tax Credits Program. Liberty was one of the first banks in the nation to win the U. S. Treasury\\'s stewardship of a 0 million allocation of tax credits. The program will attract investment to the economically distressed areas of New Orleans.\n\nThe Spectrum of Services\nWith size, strength and stability comes the ability to provide the full spectrum of banking services. As its resources have grown, so has the number of services Liberty offers to its customers, individual, business and institutional.\n\nLiberty Bank provides all types of deposit accounts, from basic checking to a variety of investment instruments. On the lending side, mortgages, commercial loans, personal loans, and credit cards are just a few of the available options.\n\nThe list continues at length: insurance, financial management, electronic banking, a full deck of credit, debit and stored value cards, and much more. Any Liberty Bank representative would be delighted to provide additional details. And every product we offer is backed by something no other financial institution can provide: Liberty Bank customer service, where every client is treated with the highest respect, value and attention to detail.\n\nEmpowering the Community\nLiberty Bank\\'s success over the years has elevated it to a lofty status in the banking world – yet its roots remain deep in its community. Believing that education is the future for our young people, Liberty sponsors the annual Support Our Schools initiative to help schools generate additional funds for supplies and activities, as well as the annual Liberty Track Meet that awards scholarships to talented student-athletes. Liberty is also a strong, longtime supporter of The College Fund, and contributes to many other worthy causes throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to direct financial support, Liberty Bank officers and staff members give countless hours of their time each year, providing expertise, counseling and sometimes just a helping hand to individuals and organizations in every community we serve.\n\nFor many years, Liberty\\'s motto has been \"Doing Well While Doing Good.\" This means focusing financial services and resources on those people and places that have traditionally been overlooked. The result of this has been Liberty\\'s \"Outstanding\" CRA rating for ten consecutive years. Simply put, we build people\\'s dreams while building a stronger community and a stronger bank.\n\nBank Power\nIn 21st century America, money is not just a purchasing mechanism, it is power, freedom, and the key that opens the door to opportunity, both business and personal. Over the course of three decades, Liberty Bank and Trust has built substantial financial power for itself and its legions of customers through innovative services, community outreach, sound banking practices, and a lot of hard work.\n\nToday, Liberty Bank is nationally recognized for its strength, leadership and business acumen. One of the five largest African-American-owned financial institutions, Liberty is a corporate partner of Fortune 500 companies, and a major supplier of financial services to government and government agencies throughout Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThis page provides important information about Liberty\\'s products and services, as well as its institutional capabilities and history. But the only true way to know Liberty Bank and Trust is to experience its power firsthand, to become its newest partner on the road to success.\nThe Liberty Foundation is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit corporation which was organized by Liberty Bank and Trust Company in 1993 to facilitate the bank’s philanthropic housing and education initiatives including, but not limited to, assisting in the implementation and support of community-based endeavors that are designed to improve the quality of life, expand access to secondary and higher education, and to increase the availability of affordable housing in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge areas of Louisiana and in Jackson, Mississippi. Its purpose is to have a positive impact on the people and the communities which Liberty serves, primarily by supporting education, neighborhood restoration, and affordable housing. The Foundation serves as a catalyst, providing seed resources that others are empowered to nurture, harvest and re-plant. Its objective is to make its community self-sustaining. Since 1993, the Liberty Foundation has raised and donated more than  million.\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3wofawj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.06081,29.99694]}},{"properties":{"name":"M Square University of Maryland Research Park - 2.3M SF- 6,500 net new jobs","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> MSquare University of Maryland Research Park During the past three to five years, the University of Maryland has made tremendous progress in a number of important areas. Rapid advances in research, education, and service have propelled the University into the top tier, and we are now ranked 17th among national public research universities according to the U.S. News &amp; World Report. This year, the University of Maryland received approximately 52 million in direct research funding. On average, each faculty member brings in 45,540 in research funds each year.\n\nThe University of Maryland\\'s close proximity to Washington, D.C., grants us the opportunity to interact closely with nearby federal research agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). As a result, the University is able to work closely with government researchers and the policy-makers who guide federal research initiatives. Much of our research funding comes from federal sources, and the collaboration between the University and the federal government has enabled the Campus to participate in a variety of incredibly important scientific areas, including food safety, secure wireless communications, nanotechnology and biotechnology, homeland security, and transportation safety. Our faculty researchers also work with the State of Maryland, and the work that they do significantly impacts the economic life of the State and the surrounding region. The creation of a new research park, the 128-acre University of Maryland Enterprise Campus (also known as M Square), has already had significant impact on the University\\'s ability to attract new research activities and businesses to the area. Private funding is also central to our research programs, and many large corporations use the University\\'s broad expertise in science, engineering and business to design and build better models and products for consumers and industry.\n\nThe momentum of recent years has poised the University of Maryland to take leadership in shaping the research university of the 21st century. By virtually every measure of quality, the University of Maryland has gained national recognition as one of the fastest rising comprehensive research institutions in the country. It is, indeed, a very exciting place to be. You are cordially invited to visit the College Park campus.

Adjacent to the University of Maryland, ranked among the nation\\'s top 20 public research universities, and located just 8 miles from the Nation\\'s Capital, the University of Maryland Research Park offers flexible space locations from incubator space for start up companies to build to suit options for larger technology clients in Maryland\\'s largest research park.\n\nThe park is served by the Washington Metro Subway and a commuter rail station providing service to both Washington DC and Baltimore, Maryland. The park\\'s location serves to link physically and programmatically university researchers, students and staff with federal laboratories and private sector companies.\n\nKey technology clusters at the park include: homeland and national security (the DOD-funded Center for Advanced Study of Language and the National Foreign Language Center); environmental and earth sciences (the NOAA National Weather and Environmental Prediction Centers) and food safety and food security (the FDA Center for Food Safety, Maryland Center for Food, Nutrition, and Agricultural Policy and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service).\n\nOther facilities near the park include the headquarters for the nation\\'s leading physics societies (American Center of Physics) and emerging private technology companies in fields from medical devices to information security.\n\nThe park is located in a HUB zone, with a mixed use housing and retails options scheduled for construction at the College Park/University of Maryland Metro station and adjacent to the park.\nMaryland\\'s intellectual property is here. M Square, a 130-acre research park adjacent to the University of Maryland, offers a wealth of advantages including access to the brainpower, facilities and partnerships within a top-ranked research university; proximity to major labs and federal agencies; and a prime, inside-the-beltway location next to the College Park/UM Metro station. Once completed, M Square will be the largest research park in the region with over 2.5 million sq. ft. of public and private research,lab and incubator space. \n\nM Square currently has space available with another 75,000 square feet under construction and deliverable in late 2005. \n\nTo learn more about partnership opportunities available at the University of Maryland and with M Square, contact Brian Darmody, Assistant Vice President of Research and Economic Development at bdarmody@umd.edu or call 301.405.1990.\nRecently (2006) signed 270,000 SF lease with NOAA.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa44kmh4e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.929188,38.981864]}},{"properties":{"name":"Metro Shops","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> The Washington Post\n\nRetail Near Metro in Hyattsville\n\nBy Dana Hedgpeth\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, October 31, 2005; \n\nThere are more than a dozen Metro stations in Prince George\\'s County, but unlike at stops in Fairfax and Montgomery counties, there is no private development near the stations on land owned by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\n\nThat\\'s about to change. Prince George\\'s County officials and developers held a groundbreaking ceremony last week to mark what will be the first private mixed-use development of office, residential and retail on about 20 acres owned by WMATA at the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station near East West Highway and Belcrest Road in Hyattsville.\n\t\n\nThe 60 million project will be developed in phases over the next three years. It will include a 300,000-square-foot office building and 260 luxury apartments, which will rent for ,500 to ,700 a month. It also will have about 130,000 square feet of retail, including a Staples, Bally\\'s Total Fitness and Circuit City, according to the lead developer of the project, Taylor Development and Land Co. of Miami. The developer also plans restaurants and other small shops for the center.\n\nThe project comes as the area\\'s retail offerings are starting to improve, with the multimillion-dollar renovation of the Mall at Prince George\\'s and the addition of movie theaters and a grocery store at the nearby University Town Center project.\n\nConstruction on the retail part of the new complex will start in the first quarter of next year and be completed in the second quarter of 2007. Residential construction will start in the next month and be done in 2 1/2 years, according to MCF Investment Co. of Silver Spring, which is doing that part of the project.\n\nWork on the large office building will begin in the first quarter of 2007, and Taylor Development officials said they are seeking a federal government agency as a lead tenant for that building. The developers will lease the land from WMATA for 99 years.\n\n\"We\\'re excited we\\'re at a point where we can get moving on our project and get it built,\" said Jennifer Rademacher, a vice president at Taylor Development.\n\nIn the same way that many Prince George\\'s residents express chagrin that their county lacks high-end and fashionable retailers, county officials and local developers have shown frustration that their county has not seen the intense development that has grown up around such Metro stations as Ballston in Arlington and Grosvenor in Montgomery County.\n\nSome say the uncertainty of the market in Prince George\\'s made developers leery of doing deals. Others privately blame WMATA for being bureaucratic and cumbersome in how it does its land deals, although they said they are nervous about criticizing the agency publicly because they want to land future deals with it.\n\n\"For market reasons, developers headed to other parts of the region,\" said Rosalyn Doggett, a senior development staffer at WMATA.\n\nAt least five other projects are planned on WMATA-owned land in Prince George\\'s, according to WMATA officials.

It was there that he learned to play the cornet.\n\nArmstrong is but one of a host of noted jazz musicians to train at the Colored Waif\\'s Home, and later at Milne, to which he was a friend throughout his life.\n\nIn a city that long ago demolished Armstrong\\'s birthplace, along with Storyville, the neighborhood where early jazz developed, and the original waif\\'s home, Milne stands as one of the last physical connections to the city\\'s musical past, and many wonder if it will have a place in the new city. Other than the landmark plaque placed by a national music group, it was hardly noted in the old one.\n\n\"You might say this is the second, if not the third, opportunity to do something with a Louis Armstrong site where the opportunity has been missed,\" said Bruce Boyd Raeburn, curator of the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane University here. \"A lot of the old jazz sites have been torn down to make new parking lots.\"\n\nMr. Raeburn added, \"The track record on preserving jazz-related sites is pretty dismal for New Orleans.\"\n\nYet this is a city that is probably more dependent on the marketing of jazz than any other, as tourism is one of the few engines of the local economy. In an acknowledgment of that, the city renamed its airport after Armstrong in 2001. But when asked about the cultural importance of the Milne site, the city official overseeing arts and entertainment said he did not know much about it. Mayor C. Ray Nagin\\'s office did not return calls for comment.\n\nIn the chaos of dealing with an acute housing shortage, a coming mayoral election and tens of thousands of displaced residents, city officials have had little energy or resources to deal with issues like the arts or historic preservation.\n\nBut it is precisely at times like these, local activists say, that pieces of the culture slip away — especially in areas like Gentilly, where mostly modest homes line quiet streets that in feeling and geography are miles away from better known destinations like the French Quarter and the Garden District.\n\n\"It certainly is a chance once again for a rebuilt New Orleans to seize an opportunity that in the past it did not seize, and to actually help its own cause,\" said Lee Hampton, executive director of the Amistad Research Center, an archive for the history of African-Americans and other ethnic groups, at Tulane. \"Certainly I think it would be worth preserving and worth the effort put into upkeep. I think it could actually repay the city in its interest to outsiders, to tourists.\"\n\nLong neglected, Milne was not in pristine shape before the storm and had not housed children since the 1980\\'s, becoming instead the setting for after-school social service programs and athletics. The home, not far from the London Avenue Canal, which breached the levees in two spots, flooding Gentilly and surrounding neighborhoods, had capacity for 80 boys before it closed as a residence.\n\nThe home was named for a Scottish philanthropist, Alexander Milne, who arrived here in the late 1700\\'s and provided money for the care of troubled children in his will after making a fortune in bricks and hardware. \n\"The problem with the city now is, where do we place our priorities?\" said Tad Jones, a local historian and co-producer of the annual Satchmo Summer Fest, a celebration of Armstrong\\'s music. \"Since we\\'re not getting much direction from the city or the feds, all the local homeowner associations in Gentilly and around the lake are coalescing and talking about how to revitalize the neighborhoods. That\\'s a good thing and a bad thing because we\\'re not all on the same page.\"\n\nOver the decades, not everyone in solidly middle-class Gentilly has been thrilled about having a haven for troubled youth in the area. Some wanted Milne done away with years ago. Others want to see it come back just as it was, as a scaled-down social service and recreation center. Still others want at least part of it to be a memorial to Armstrong and a reminder of what can happen when a poor child gets a chance at a better life.\n\n\"Louis Armstrong is the poster child for that,\" Mr. Raeburn said.\n\nOfficials said the city was negotiating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to determine how much federal money might be available for the site. The city holds a 99-year lease on the property from the Milne Trust, a private foundation. Part of the complex has been gutted, and the roofs are protected by blue tarp.\n\nArmstrong was born to a teenage mother in a neighborhood so notoriously dangerous, even by New Orleans\\' rough port-town standards, that it was called \"the battlefield.\" He was largely abandoned by his father and dropped out of grade school, and entertained people by singing and dancing for change around the brothels of Storyville.\n\nHe occasionally got into trouble with the police, but around Storyville, he also got to hear the likes of Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton, pioneers of early jazz.\n\nPeter Davis, the music teacher who invited Armstrong to play in the waif\\'s home band, retired from Milne in 1949 and died in 1971.\n\nArmstrong wrote about Mr. Davis in his memoir, \"Satchmo: My Life in New Orleans.\"\n\n\"Every day I practiced faithfully on the lesson Mr. Davis gave me,\" Armstrong wrote. And later: \"All in all, I am proud of the days I spent at the Colored Waif\\'s Home for Boys.\"\n\nRichard Winder, director of the city\\'s Department of Human Services, which controls the site, said that these days, \"We\\'re in limbo.\"\n\n\"We don\\'t know where we are, post-Katrina,\" Mr. Winder said.\n\nStill, as a former superintendent of the home, he could not imagine losing Milne. \"Those worries should be removed down the line,\" he said, \"once we get some normalcy in this city.\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3xwmo7h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.05304,30.01411]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mosaic at Metro Affordable Apts - 264 units (HUD)","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> Mosaic at Metro - Hyattsville -264 unitsMosaic at Metro\n264-Unit, Affordable Apartment Community\nClark Realty Builders, LLC was selected to construct this 264-unit HUD apartment community in Hyattsville, Maryland.

Originally named \"Baptist Bible Institute,\" New Orleans Seminary was the first theological institution to be created by direct action of the Southern Baptist Convention. It was originally created as an undergraduate institution modeled after Moody Bible Institute. Gradually, the school began to move toward graduate level training, and in 1946 the Convention renamed the institution \"New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.\"\n\nThe school was the fulfillment of a century-old dream of Baptists to establish a missionary training school in New Orleans as a gateway to Latin America, and as a mission center in the ungodly city of New Orleans. In 1914, P. I. Lipsey, editor of the Mississippi Baptist Record, wrote an impassioned editorial favoring the creation of a theological school in New Orleans: \"A seminary (in New Orleans) would plant the Baptist cause in this city in a way that would immediately command the attention and the respect of all. It would be planting the siege guns at the enemies’ gates.”\n\nBaptist Bible Institute opened its first session in October 1918 under the leadership of Byron H. DeMent, who served as president of the BBI from 1917 to 1928. “The Baptist Bible Institute is preeminently a child of providence and prayer,” DeMent said at his inauguration. Since that day, New Orleans Seminary has been known as “The School of Providence and Prayer.”\n\nOthers who have served as president of the school are William W. Hamilton Sr. (1928-42); Duke K. McCall (1943-46); Roland Q. Leavell (1946-58); H. Leo Eddleman (1959-70); Grady C. Cothen (1970-74); and Landrum P. Leavell II, nephew of Roland Leavell, (1974-95). On February 23, 1996, Dr. Charles S. “Chuck” Kelley, Jr., of Beaumont, Texas, was elected unanimously as the seminary’s eighth president. Prior to his election he had served at the seminary for 13 years as the Roland Q. Leavell Professor of Evangelism and most recently as the director of the Seminary’s Leavell Center for Evangelism and Church Health.\n\nFrom its beginning until 1953, the school was located at 1220 Washington Avenue, in the heart of the Garden District of residential New Orleans. The current campus, at 3939 Gentilly Boulevard was purchased in 1947. The landmark entrance gates and fence from the Garden District mansion now are located on the front block of the Gentilly campus. The current property, once a 75-acre pecan orchard, has been transformed into a beautiful campus with 12 additional acres and more than 100 buildings. More than 20,000 men and women have prepared for ministry at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.\nOur Doctrinal Commitments\n\nAll the faculty members of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary subscribe to the school\\'s historic confession, the Articles of Religious Belief, and the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.\nOur Locations\n\nThe main campus in New Orleans is on a 87 beautiful tree-covered site in suburban New Orleans. However, the Seminary also is committed to making quality theological education as accessible and affordable as possible to as many ministers as possible. Therefore, New Orleans Seminary operates many extension center campuses across the Southeast.\nGraduate extension centers are located in:\n\n    * Pineville, Louisiana\n    * Shreveport, Louisiana\n    * Clinton, Mississippi\n    * Birmingham, Alabama\n    * Decatur (Atlanta area), Georgia\n    * Albany, Georgia\n    * Graceville, Florida\n    * Jacksonville, Florida\n    * Orlando, Florida\n    * Pensacola, Florida\n    * Miami, Florida\n\n\nUndergraduate extension centers are located in:\n\n    * Baton Rouge, Louisiana\n    * Lake Charles, Louisiana\n    * Shreveport, Louisiana\n    * Jackson, Mississippi\n    * Birmingham, Alabama\n    * Athens, Alabama\n    * Albany, Georgia\n    * Decatur, Georgia\n    * Jacksonville, Florida\n    * Miami, Florida\n\nNOBTS makes theological education accessible by a number of innovative delivery systems as well. On campus classes are offered in a wide variety of scheduling options throughout the week, as well as night class and weekend options. Many extension center classes are taught by Compressed Interactive Video (CIV) by faculty from the main campus. Internet classes are offered at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Short-term one week courses (academic workshops) are offered throughout the year.\nOur Faculty\n\nThe Seminary faculty consists of approximately 60 full-time faculty members. Their academic excellence is exemplified in the fact that they have earned a total of over 75 master\\'s degrees from 7 different seminaries and 15 universities, and over 55 doctoral degrees from 6 seminaries and 6 universities. Their ongoing research is reflected in the Seminary\\'s research centers and institutes, as well as numerous publications and presentations. The full-time faculty is supplemented by over 100 adjuctive faculty.\n\nThe NOBTS faculty also has unusual experience in ministry. The faculty averages over 15 years each in ministry experience in local churches and mission settings, including a number of pastors, education ministers, and music ministers; nine former international missionaries; two former directors of missions; and a state convention executive director. Others have served in counseling ministries and social work mission centers. Almost all of them are currently involved in some expression of ministry. That\\'s why we call NOBTS \"The Church Place.\"\n\nOur Seminary faculty is committed to doctrinal integrity. Each faculty member subscribes to our doctrinal statements, the Baptist Faith and Message and the Articles of Religious Belief.\nOur Enrollment\n\nTotal student enrollment was over 3,600 students in the 2002-2003 academic year, making NOBTS among the largest seminaries in the world. Approximately 1,900 of these students are located primarily on the New Orleans campus; the others are at extension centers (though part of their work is normally completed on campus). The student body comes from 39 states and 39 different nations of the world. The three home states represented by the most students are Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. For more information about how to enroll in the Seminary, contact the Student Enlistment Office.\nOur Funding and Endowment\n\nAbout half of the approximately 6 million annual Seminary budget is provided by the SBC Cooperative Program. The support of the Cooperative Program is an annual allocation equal to the income of over 00 million of endowment. The Cooperative Program is the financial lifeline of the seminary.\n\nTotal Seminary endowment is about 0 million, including about 0 million in the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary endowment and about 0 million in the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary Foundation endowment.

This condominium is a uniquely designed project that takes full advantage of its site while serving as an anchor and iconic image along this mixed-use project’s primary retail corridor.\nPlaza Lofts Twenty-Two Condominiums was designed by WDG Architecture of Washington, DC. The design is bold and eye-catching, yet contextual. A balance few buildings of this type and size achieve. Because of its existing site conditions, the building has been able to benefit from the unique use of long span structural steel design. The resulting twenty-two living environments are “one of a kind”.\nTo receive updates and additional information go to <a href=\"http://www.plazalofts22.com\">www.plazalofts22.com</a>\n\nThe Washington Post\nApril 9, 2007\n\nHip Lofts to Bring Glimmer of Zinc to Hyattsville\n\nThe word \"zinc\" conjures up vitamins, batteries, pennies.\nBut lofts?\nIn a section of Hyattsville not particularly known for hip architecture, developers plan in coming weeks to begin installing curved, low-gloss, gray zinc walls on the front and back of a 22-loft building under construction at the University Town Center in Prince George\\'s County.\nThe five-story structure -- the first floor will be occupied by a restaurant -- is one of the first residential buildings in the Washington region to install walls made of zinc, a metal that industry experts say is emerging nationwide as a desirable alternative to traditional materials such as copper or less expensive masonry.\n\"It has a pleasing gray tone and it weathers quite well,\" said Bill Zahner, author of a book on metals and president of A. Zahner Co. of Kansas City, which manufactures custom architectural and ornamental metals.\n\"The technology on how to use the metal correctly has really come together in the last five years, he said. \"If they\\'re put up correctly they can last 100 years, and they\\'re fully recyclable.\"\nSome institutions, including Howard University, have installed zinc walls on buildings. Metal salesmen say some developers in the Washington region have inquired about zinc or plan to install it in new multi-unit residential buildings or single-family homes.\nThe loft building in Hyattsville, the Plaza Lofts 22, is nestled among five office buildings; 112 condominiums that are under construction; a 244-unit student apartment building; restaurants and a movie theater. Those buildings are made of brick or precast concrete.\n\"This is our jewel building,\" said Chris Hanessian, chief operating officer for developer University Town Center LLC. \"The zinc doesn\\'t discolor. It just holds up naturally.\"\nZinc\\'s reactions with compounds in the atmosphere allow it to effectively heal itself when scratched, like human skin.\n\"All the other buildings focus in on this building,\" Hanessian said. \"Thousands of office workers look down at the building. Student housing looks down at the building. It\\'s a focal point.\"\nMatt Lamb, senior designer with WDG Architecture of the District, who worked on the Hyattsville project, said another benefit of zinc is that it is lighter in weight, which will put \"less stress\" on the underground parking garage.\nHyattsville, a city of about 16,000, has an eclectic population that includes a concentration of artists.\nBut struggling artists, in all likelihood, won\\'t be able to afford lofts in the building, which also has an environmentally friendly green roof with vegetation, Hanessian said. The one- and two-bedroom units, slated to be completed by fall, range from 00,000 to 50,000, and about 80 percent are already sold.\nMichael Jung, a manufacturer\\'s representative for Umicore Building Products USA, which sold the French-made zinc for the Hyattsville project, said of the metal\\'s growing popularity in the United States: \"I call it the oldest new metal on earth. It\\'s beautiful stuff. It\\'s more expensive than steel and aluminum. In price it\\'s equal to that of copper.\"\nBut he said some universities have used it, in part, to save money.\n\"They can afford to save money,\" he said. \"It\\'s like buying a Mercedes-Benz. It\\'s a lot of money upfront, but hey, it\\'s still working years later.\"\nInstalling this particular zinc, which is mixed with traces of copper and titanium, won\\'t be a snap.\nDean Jagusch, project manager for Roofers Inc. of Baltimore, said that between prepping the building and the walls and cutting out spaces for windows, the installation will take a crew of eight about two months.\n\"It\\'s a unique kind of job,\" he said\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa40wpsxc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.95271,38.96768]}},{"properties":{"name":"Port Towns CDC ofc.- 4217 Edmonston Rd., Bladensburg","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Port Towns CDC ofc.- 4217 Edmonston Rd., Bladensburgweb site has a lot of information!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa43230od"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.933653,38.942012]}},{"properties":{"name":"Port Towns Elementary School - 5 million - 2004","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 4351 58th Ave., Baldensburg, MD 20710Port Towns Elementary School offers an educational program that fosters a love of learning while providing serious instruction in the academic disciplines such as math, reading, and technology. \n\nPort Towns School  is beginning its second year as a neighborhood school and has grown significantly over the past year.

City \nofficials expect the two projects to set off a wave of \nredevelopment along the Route 1 Corridor, which has \nalso been the focal point of planning since the area \nwas designated by the state as an Arts &amp; Entertain- \nment District and a Community Legacy Area. \nHyattsville hopes to transform the area into a vibrant \ncommercial and residential downtown.

HIP, which specializes in \nworkforce housing, is working with the City and for- \nprofit partners on a 5 million redevelopment called \nRenaissance Square that will have rental apartments, \ncondominiums and a YMCA.

Both projects will include live- \nwork space for artists. \nThe State has much at stake in Hyattsville’s Route 1 \nCorridor revitalization project, which will help the City \nreestablish its traditional downtown and stimulate \neconomic development. \nContact: \nDarsey Nicklasson, City of Hyattsville, 301.985.5000. \nChuck Gates, Maryland Department of Planning, \n410.767.3370. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa47ct4kn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.943114,38.955138]}},{"properties":{"name":"Riggs Road Shopping Center DC 20011","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 300 Riggs Road, Washington, DC 20011Tiger Market- IGA\nvacant as of 11/03/2006\n3.6 miles from Colmar Manor\nbuilt after WW II<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa43dcyt8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.002278,38.957011]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rite Aid and Papa John's","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3vppyg7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9805574417,38.9719883961]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rite-Aid 6130 Baltimore Ave., 20737 - 2.5 miles","description":"Posted by RufuslRite-Aid 6130 Baltimore Ave., 20737 - 2.5 milesRite Aid built in 1998 by Rick Maggin,\nnext to McDonalds,\njust south of East West Hwy - Route 410<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3zlylq3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.939429,38.962267]}},{"properties":{"name":"Safeway Hamilton St - 1.5 miles from Colmar","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3511 Hamilton St., Hyattsville, MD 20782store closes and moves in Summer, 2008 to University Town Center on East-West Hwy in Hyattsville.\nStore was built in 1982. 30K SF.

Many people get up early before work to get a fresh cup of their favorite coffee and maybe a bagel or two. The Starbucks on East West Highway is co-owned by Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson of basketball fame.\n\nMagic and his company the Johnson Development Corporation (JDC) entered a joint venture with Starbucks known as the Urban Coffee Opportunities or UCO. The venture UCO is meant to bring good (and expensive) Starbucks coffee to urban communities that retail chains would not usually do business. Currently there are around 29 UCO locations around the United States. The Starbucks on East West Highway in Hyattsville is one such store.\n\nTHE TRIP\nAs you are heading towards the Starbucks you will probably notice the convenient location. Right across the street from the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro Station, it is an adequate way to wake up in the morning. Wake up early in the morning, head to Starbucks, have a nice (and I might add again expensive) cup of coffee, use the Kiss &amp; Ride on the Metro, and be on your way to work.\n\nWhen you actually enter the Starbucks you will automatically notice the enthusiastic employees that have no problems serving the customer. The employees themselves said that they are pretty happy to be working at Starbucks and said that it is not a burden to come and work there. Elmo Caceres is the Starbucks employee interviewed. Surprisingly, he enjoys his work (many people don\\'t). He knows a bit about the Starbucks itself. Elmo takes pride in Starbucks being named as one of the top 100 places to work according to Fortune magazine, as he stated.\n\nIn fact we found all of the employees to be very friendly and willing to help us whether it be getting information about the store or getting a cup of coffee. The store itself is very well kept. People begin sprawling in and out as their need for caffeine arises.\n\nStarbucks will occasionally hold live music shows, the genre of music played is often jazz. Starbucks itself is often quite crowded in the morning, so you might be able to understand why Starbucks is such an important part of the business economy around the area. Thanks to the success of Starbucks, more retail businesses are attempting to come into the community. Even though the Starbucks Corporation may not have realized it before, they probably do now, they are an important asset to business in and around Prince George\\'s County. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa46i36nf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.953263,38.965982]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks-Greenway shopping Center, Greenbelt","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 7541 Greenbelt Road 20770 Greenway Shopping Center\n7541 Greenbelt Rd.\nSpace 16\nGreenbelt, Maryland 20770\n(301) 220-2029 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3ubk9nf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.877518,38.992772]}},{"properties":{"name":"Target","description":"Posted by Rufusl<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa469pm41"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.08893,33.20078]}},{"properties":{"name":"Target Store","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3thtelx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9558382034,38.9690856089]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Mall at Prince George's County EW Hwy","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> The Mall at Prince George\\'s CountyThe Mall at Prince Georges is located in Prince Georges County, Maryland, just 8 miles from the northeast corner of Washington, D.C.

The mall recently underwent a full-scale renovation and added a 136,000 square foot Target store in October 2004.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa49h2sj3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.958113,38.968418]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Mall at Prince Georges","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Hyattsville honing a new image\nThe Washington Times\nJune 5, 2007\n    \nThe flurry of development near the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro stop in Hyattsville, including last weekend\\'s opening of Hyattsville\\'s first movie theater in decades, has sparked a grass-roots campaign among city officials and developers to get the word out about the changes in the city.\n\nUniversity Town Center, Belcrest Center and the Mall at Prince George\\'s, which share a corner at East-West Highway and Belcrest Road, and the city of Hyattsville are exploring options to give the new commercial district an identity.\n\n\"Our joint effort has been to brand that commercial corridor as one vibrant area for shopping, for living and for a place of business,\" said Bill Gardiner, mayor of Hyattsville.\n\nThe developers have floated ideas such as forming a business improvement district and renaming the Metro station -- which is called Prince George\\'s Plaza after the mall\\'s former name -- to something that combines all aspects of the commercial corridor. But ideas are still in the early stages.\n\nAbout two years ago, the city of Hyattsville got the ball rolling. The City Council voted to establish a marketing task force, which last year released a new logo and slogan -- A World Within Walking Distance -- for the city.\n\nHyattsville, once known for its collection of car dealerships along Route 1, is also commonly misidentified as a large \"Hyattsville area\" -- sometimes identified with crime, Mr. Gardiner said. In reality, it\\'s a three-square-mile city with 18,000 residents.\n\n\"We need to toot our horn a little bit and make sure people understand there is a small, incorporated community -- the city of Hyattsville, which has a lot to offer in terms of the diverse housing stock, people from around the world and walkable communities,\" Mr. Gardiner said. \"Not to take away from the other areas around us, but we want to try to make sure people know the incorporated community of Hyattsville has its own identity.\"\n\nThe developers clearly have an incentive to help the city refine its image, too.\n\nThe city \"would really like to see a branding of that area [on East-West Highway]. We would, too; it helps the whole area,\" said Jennifer Rademacher, chief operating officer at Taylor Development and Land Co., which is building Belcrest Center, a 22-acre mixed-use project at the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station.\n\nShe wants them to make East-West Highway into a destination, similar to town centers in Herndon, Reston or Bethesda.\n\n\"I think you\\'re going to attract people from outside the area that way,\" she said. \"We have the Metro station, that\\'s great. But we want to bring in more people, more money, more everything into this area.\"\n\nThat\\'s starting to happen.\n\nUniversity Town Center\\'s student housing building, Towers, has been open for one academic year. Restaurants such as Old Dominion Brew House, Southern-themed Carolina Kitchen and Three Brothers Italian Restaurant are scheduled to open in August.\n\n\"There\\'s a real revitalization of this area ... that\\'s really catching on now. It\\'s tremendous,\" said Tim Taylor, vice president of leasing at Prince George\\'s Metro Center, which is developing University Town Center.\n\nThe Royale 14 Cinemas -- the first in Hyattsville in more than 30 years, according to Mr. Gardiner -- will anchor an entertainment destination at the center.\n\n\"Hyattsville specifically seems to have been underserved in terms of a true movie-going experience,\" said Rhonda Cook, director of real estate for Consolidated Theatres.\n\nCircuit City, the first tenant at Belcrest Center\\'s retail component, Metropolitan Shops, is scheduled to open later this month. Also at Belcrest, 260 apartments are slated to open late this year and construction is scheduled to start in September on 300,000 square feet of office space. The development has a letter of intent from Marriott International Inc. to build a Marriott Courtyard hotel on the site.\n\nIn 2004, the Mall at Prince George\\'s completed a renovation that increased the square footage to 1.1 million. Last year, Marshalls and Ross Dress for Less opened in the mall. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa45e3wnj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9573402405,38.9676174873]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Pointe at Cheverly Luxury Condominium","description":"Posted by RufuslThe Pointe at Cheverly Luxury CondominiumDifferent people want different things.

For over four decades PGMC has been at the vanguard of efforts to expand residential, retail and office space to create a new, sophisticated urban center in Northern Prince George’s County.\n\nIn addition to many important state and federal agencies such as the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Financial Management Services (FMS), and the Department of Social Services (DSS), University Town Center tenants are drawn from diverse segments of the community. Tenants include institutions advancing education, arts, music, technology, medicine, science and more. Other UTC tenants include Prince George’s Community College; University of Maryland University College; centers for the arts; a music school; many medical and dental offices; and the Business Technology Growth Center, an incubator for start up companies.\n\nUTC is proud to be home to a number of companies who have been tenants of PGMC for ten, twenty, and thirty or more years.\n\nThe University Town Center Management Team has been working together collectively for more than twenty years. They are a cohesive unit of professionals dedicated to making UTC the place to be.\n\nNew Office Building dedicated in Hyattsville\n\nThe newest office building at University Town Center, a 200,000 square foot headquarters building for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a Department of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was officially opened on March 10th in Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\nThe new seven-story building, designed by Weihe Design Group, provides consolidated headquarters space for NCHS, which is the nation’s principal health statistics source. The University Town Center unveiled its especially commissioned outdoor sculpture, called \"Images of America,\" by renowned artist Phillip Ratner. This signature piece consists of four units, each 12 feet high and five feet wide, displaying images of personalities, events, and concepts portraying different aspects of American history. Also unveiled at the ceremony were replicas of 18 documents representing key aspects of the founding and growth of the United States.\n\n725,000 sf Of Mixed-Use Space Now Under Construction At University Town Center In Hyattsville, MD\n\n0 Million Construction Contract Signed for Unique College Student Residence, Parking Garage\n\nHyattsville, Maryland, April 2004. Ground has been broken for 725,000 square feet of mixed-use space at University Town Center (UTC) in Hyattsville, Maryland. Between now and early 2006, the existing 1.3 million SF office complex, located across the street from the Prince George\\'s Plaza Metro station, will add a unique 16-story residence for some 900 college and graduate students, a 16-screen movie theater, and over 250,000 SF of retail space. \n\nFrom the Ground Up\nHyattsville Complex Adds Restaurants to Mix\n\nBy Ylan Q. Mui\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, June 12, 2006; Page D03\n\nThe 60 million University Town Center development in Hyattsville is entering its final stages, with several restaurants signing deals that developers hope will turn the 56-acre site into an entertainment destination in Prince George\\'s County.\n\nThe project is off East-West Highway, about a mile from the University of Maryland and near the Hyattsville Metro station. It is already home to four office buildings with roughly 5,000 workers, mainly from government agencies.\n\t\nThe developer, Prince George\\'s Metro Center Inc., wants to channel the foot traffic from those buildings into several restaurants and retailers. Old Dominion Brewpub recently agreed to rent 10,000 square feet. Other restaurants to open include Tokyo Sushi, Mongolian Grill and Salad Creations.\n\nA New York-based coffee and wine bar and a seafood restaurant are also negotiating for space.\n\nConsolidated Theaters is building a 14-screen cineplex. Safeway has begun construction of one of its new \"lifestyle\" stores. Madison Retail Group, which is leasing the project, said it expects to announce more tenants soon.\n\nOne of the goals of the project is to attract higher-end retail to Prince George\\'s County. Residents have long complained about the lack of sit-down restaurants and upscale shopping in one of the country\\'s wealthiest predominantly African American counties.\n\nWearing a hard hat, Prince George\\'s Metro Center Inc. President Herschel W. Blumberg, 82, walked through the construction area last week and imagined the end product: wide sidewalks, landscaped greenery and plenty of people.\n\nA preview party for the project\\'s eight-story condo building was held last week. Construction is to begin at the end of this summer on another condo building, with a curved zinc facade and a loft-like atmosphere. A 910-bed student housing complex will open in the fall, intended to draw tenants from the University of Maryland and Howard and Catholic universities, among others.\n\nThe project should be finished within a year, with the exception of the Safeway, which is expected to open in 2008.\n\nThe Mall at Prince George\\'s, near Blumberg\\'s site, has Target, Old Navy, JCPenney and Hecht\\'s as anchors. Home Depot is nearby. \"This area is changing dramatically,\" Blumberg said. \"We don\\'t mind the competition.\"\n\nBlumberg bought the land in 1954. He built office complexes but was unable to put together the mixed-use development he envisioned.\n\nNow that the tide is turning, Blumberg said he is glad that he kept the property. As he walked the site, he showed off the slabs of concrete that will become patios for the condos and the steel beams that will hold up the building\\'s walls. From the top of the student apartments, the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral could be seen near the horizon.\n\"He had this dream for 50 years,\" Tim R. Taylor, vice president of leasing for Prince George\\'s Metro Center, said of Blumberg. \"He wanted to see it come to fruition.\"\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa44ita88"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.951482,38.971388]}},{"properties":{"name":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742","description":"Posted by RufuslUniversity of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742The University of Maryland, College Park, is a public research university, the flagship campus of the University System of Maryland, and the original 1862 land-grant institution in Maryland. It is one of only 61 members of the Association of American Universities (AAU). In keeping with the legislative mandates of 1988 and 1999, the University of Maryland is committed to achieving excellence as the State\\'s primary center of research and graduate education and the institution of choice for undergraduate students of exceptional ability and promise. While the University has already attained national distinction, it intends to rank among the very best public research universities in the United States. To realize its aspirations and fulfill its mandates, the University advances knowledge, provides outstanding and innovative instruction, and nourishes a climate of intellectual growth in a broad range of academic disciplines and interdisciplinary fields. It also creates and applies knowledge for the benefit of the economy and culture of the State, the region, the nation and beyond.\n\nAs the flagship of the University System of Maryland, the University shares its research, educational and technological strengths with other institutions and their constituencies in the USM and throughout the State. The University\\'s academic programs and expanding computer and information technology infrastructure serve many audiences, and the entire State has access to and depends on the University\\'s libraries. In conjunction with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, the University serves the State\\'s agricultural needs through the Maryland Cooperative Extension and the Agricultural Experiment Station. The University delivers continuing education programs that are consistent with its research mission and core competencies to an increasing number of degree-seeking and professional audiences. Using technology, the University provides selected quality programs to audiences worldwide to share its knowledge and extend and enhance educational opportunities. The University also provides administrative support to other USM institutions in the areas of accounting, communications, engineering and architectural services, environmental safety, personnel management, and purchasing.\n\nThe University values the Ph.D. and terminal professional degrees such as the M.B.A. as its signature degrees, but it also awards a wide range of bachelor\\'s, master\\'s and other doctoral degrees. Degree programs are offered in agriculture and natural resources, architecture, behavioral and social sciences, business and management, computer, mathematical and physical sciences, creative and performing arts, education, engineering, health and human performance, humanities, journalism, life sciences, information studies, and public affairs. Its faculty achieve national and international renown for their research and scholarship, serve society at a distinguished level, are innovative and creative teachers, and participate in the tradition of shared governance. The highly qualified academic, professional, and non-exempt members of the staff provide both support and leadership for the University\\'s educational, research, and service activities.\n\nThe University counts among its greatest strengths and a major component of its excellence the diversity of its faculty, students, and staff. It is committed to equal educational opportunity. It strives to hire a diverse faculty and staff of exceptional achievement through affirmative action, to celebrate diversity in all of its programs and activities, and to recruit and retain qualified graduate and undergraduate minority students.\n\nINSTITUTIONAL CAPABILITIES\n\nThe University of Maryland has a clear vision of its future as a nationally distinguished public research university. To achieve this goal, the University expects to perform and be funded at the level of the public research institutions that have historically been the very best. Five such AAU members serve as the University\\'s peers: the University of California-Berkeley, the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign, the University of California-Los Angeles, and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. With increasing numbers of nationally- ranked graduate programs, a distinguished faculty, and research leading to the discovery of knowledge, the University is in a position to provide graduate education at the forefront of research and scholarship, which will attract the most highly qualified graduate students. The University also provides enriched and challenging undergraduate educational experiences, including a core arts and sciences curriculum, opportunities for undergraduate research, living-learning communities such as College Park Scholars and the nationally renowned Honors Program, and other unique, intensive, and innovative programs such as Gemstone and Civicus.\n\nThe University of Maryland shares its research, educational and technological strengths with businesses, government and other educational institutions. With productive scholars and researchers of the highest caliber, the University will continue to raise the entire level of business and commerce throughout the State. Because of the depth of knowledge possessed by the faculty across many disciplines, the University of Maryland is uniquely positioned to forge relationships with corporations, non-profit organizations, other educational institutions, local school districts, and major federal agencies, laboratories, and departments. Because of the breadth of strength in many disciplines, the University of Maryland is at the forefront in advancing knowledge in areas that increasingly depend on multi-disciplinary approaches. The University of Maryland serves as a hub of knowledge from which flow cultural, intellectual, and economic benefits to the State and region. University of Maryland faculty share with many segments of society the fruits of knowledge and foster and participate in an entrepreneurial culture that is essential to the development of new industries based on knowledge. Faculty are a resource for federal, state, and local governments in shaping public policies on a variety of social concerns. They are leaders in the preservation and interpretation of history and culture, innovators in the creative and performing arts, and major contributors to the advancement of knowledge in biology, mathematics, computer and physical sciences, information science and technology, and engineering. The University of Maryland is a leader in research on teaching and learning that contributes to educational reform in the State and the nation, provides future administrators and teachers with up-to-date knowledge of the best pedagogical methods in all disciplines in an increasingly diverse educational system, and is innovative in providing pathways to teacher certification.\n\nINSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES\n\nIn accordance with the 2000 State Plan for Higher Education, the University System of Maryland Strategic Plan, and the 2000 Strategic Plan for the University of Maryland, the University of Maryland will:\n\n   1. Continue to elevate the quality of undergraduate education by providing enriched educational opportunities and personally fulfilling and challenging academic curricula that prepare all graduates for productive roles in society; by remaining the school of choice for the most talented students in Maryland and for outstanding out-of-state students by strengthening efforts to recruit students who will contribute to and benefit from an enriched educational environment; by improving the conditions for their enrollment and success, including enhanced advising; by increasing retention and graduation rates; by enhancing and promoting the training of teachers by engaging faculty from the arts and science disciplines in teacher training, by increasing the pathways to certification, and by mentoring of new teachers; by working to increase the availability of financial aid to ensure access to all qualified students; and by systematically integrating the use of information technology into its instructional programs so that all faculty and students can fully exploit new technology as an essential tool in teaching and learning;\n\n   2. Build a strong, university-wide culture of excellence in graduate and professional education, research, scholarship and creative and performing arts by increasing the number and proportion of its faculty who are regarded by their national and international peers as being among the best in their disciplines; by continuing to improve the excellence of its best research and graduate programs while also increasing the number of programs of recognized excellence; by increasing the University\\'s success in recruiting, developing, and placing outstanding and diverse graduate students; and by developing and facilitating access to scholarly information in all formats to support cutting-edge research, scholarship, teaching, and learning;\n\n   3.

Greater New Orleans, with more than a fourth of the state’s population, was without a public college or university until that time. As a branch campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LSUNO was conceived as a liberal arts college for commuting students, which might within a few years develop into a true urban university.\n\nAn ideal campus site was acquired when the United States Navy abandoned its air station on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain in late 1957 and the Orleans Levee Board leased it to the LSU Board of Supervisors. A quick renovation of barracks, service clubs, and other existing facilities made it possible to begin classes in September 1958, a year ahead of the original schedule. The inaugural convocation was held in a vacant aircraft hangar. This event marked the opening of the first racially integrated, public university in the South. A total of 1,460 students, all freshmen and double the number originally anticipated, arrived for this occasion.\n\nBy September 1961, when the new school had become a full four-year institution, the enrollment exceeded 3,000, and the faculty had grown from the original 63 to 150 members. A Junior Division had been established for the academic administration of freshmen, and senior academic divisions had been established in liberal arts, in sciences, and in business administration. Dr. Homer L. Hitt, the first employee and the chief administrative officer, had been promoted from Dean of LSUNO to Vice President of LSU in Charge of LSUNO.\n\nTwo new permanent buildings, the Liberal Arts Building and the Sciences Building, and a central utilities plant were completed and in operation by the time of the first commencement in the spring of 1962. The architectural style, established by master planners, was described as a modern adaptation of Louisiana tradition. The first commencement was held in a circus tent temporarily erected on the campus for that purpose. The initial class of graduating seniors numbered 115.\n\nIn the summer of 1962, the senior academic divisions were designated colleges. In 1963, a school of education was established, as well as an evening division and a graduate division. The Vice President in Charge was designated Chancellor, following the establishment of an LSU System of Higher Education. This signaled the end of LSUNO’s status as a branch of the Baton Rouge campus. The school of education became the College of Education in 1964. In 1966, the graduate division became the Graduate School.\n\nTo the original 178-acre site, a 17.5-acre strip along its western boundary was added in 1963. This land was also acquired from the Orleans Levee Board, and it brought the total campus acreage to 195.5. Still more acreage was obtained in 1964, half a mile east on the Lakefront, when the United States Army abandoned its Camp Leroy Johnson facility and the Levee Board made this site, too, available to the University. A 50-acre parcel of this 150-acre site was released to the Gulf South Research Institute in 1965. The remaining 100-acre East Campus subsequently became the location of a Special Education Center, various outdoor sports facilities, and a multipurpose Senator Nat G. Kiefer/UNO Lakefront Arena.\n\nIn September, 1969, when the enrollment exceeded 10,000, LSUNO became the second- largest university in Louisiana. By this time it had developed into a large academic complex embracing several colleges, schools, and institutes, offering graduate work in many different fields and awarding both the master’s and the Ph.D. degree. Moreover, a residence hall for both men and women had been completed. In February, 1974, the LSU Board of Supervisors approved a name change, and LSUNO became the University of New Orleans. The new name more accurately defined the institution as the metropolitan campus of the LSU System.\n\nBy the fall of 1983, UNO had an enrollment exceeding 16,000 and had five senior colleges: Liberal Arts, Sciences, Education, Business Administration, and Engineering, in addition to its Junior Division and Graduate School. It also had a School of Urban and Regional Studies; a School of Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Administration; a School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering; and various centers, institutes and divisions for specialized research. A new Metropolitan College offered courses at off-campus locations in the evening hours, as well as credit and non-credit work in the evening on the campus. It also administered the nation’s largest summer program in Europe, UNO Innsbruck, which had been a continuing success since the early 1970s. In an administrative reorganization in 1988, the Junior Division was replaced by a system that enrolled all incoming students in one of the senior colleges or schools.\n\nCurrently, the UNO main campus contains twenty-three permanent buildings plus a dormitory, a housing complex for married students and a complex of contemporary, apartment-styled, student-housing units.  Land has been set aside for a new dormitory complex and fraternity and sorority houses. The Chemical Sciences Building opened in 1997, a state-of-the-art Recreation and Fitness Center opened in 2001, and the Homer L. Hitt Alumni and Visitors Center (named for our founding Chancellor) opened in 2003.  The Alumni Center is built around a red brick smokestack, one of the few reminders of the naval air base that became the UNO main campus.  Completion of Kirschman Hall, which will house the College of Business Administration, is expected in Spring 2005. A six building, University-sponsored Research and Technology Park is adjacent to the main campus.  The East campus, approximately one mile from the main campus, houses athletic fields, the Alumni and Development Center, and the Senator Nat G. Kiefer UNO Lakefront Arena and is the location for a planned Teleplex Building that will house both of New Orleans’ public television stations, a public radio station, and video broadcast training space for UNO students. UNO owns satellite campuses in downtown New Orleans, in the suburbs of Jefferson Parish, and in Slidell, in neighboring St. Tammany parish. UNO’s Ogden Museum of Southern Art is located in the Arts District near the central business district.  UNO is in the process of revising its Master Plan to include additional, state-of-the art student housing, a new University Center, phase two of the Research and Technology Park, and new landscaping and student-centered outdoor learning spaces.\n\nThe University of New Orleans has grown to become a major urban research university. Categorized as an SREB Four-Year 2 institution, as a Carnegie Doctoral/Research University-Intensive, and as a COC/SACS Level VI institution, its students now enjoy a broad range of academic programs nearly one-quarter of which are at the master’s or doctoral level. In addition, extracurricular activities, including NCAA Division One intercollegiate athletics, an extensive program of intramural sports, and frequent exhibits and programs in music, drama, ballet, and the fine arts round out the student experience. Culturally, socially, economically, and intellectually, the University of New Orleans is one of the major assets of the City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana. The University has conferred over 66,000 degrees since the first graduating class of 118 in 1962.

Lincoln New Town, a 176-acre mixed-use development. Tenants will include Costco (151,700 sq. ft.), Shoppers Food Warehouse (67,500 sq. ft.), Staples and Target (123,735 sq. ft.). The Peterson Companies will development the retail component of Ft. Lincoln to include a mix of neighborhood and regional retailers, restaurants and other service providers. Plans call for approximately 2,000 parking spaces and for the retail portion to be completed in 2009.

Peterson is a prolific suburban retail developer; Washington Gateway would be its first retail development in D.C.\n\nThe 350,000- to 400,000-square-foot power center could break ground this fall and be completed in late 2005. With the three potential tenants, the project would be about two-thirds committed, says Paul Weinschenk, vice president of retail at Peterson (www.petersoncos.com).\n\nOnce those deals are worked out, attention will turn to signing a couple of retail stores in the 15,000- to 20,000-square-foot range, filling 30,000 to 40,000 square feet more in smaller shop space and landing up to four restaurants.\n\n\"We\\'re getting there,\" Weinschenk says. \"We\\'re telling a story to the retailers, and helping to educate them about the market and letting them know there is income to be spent.\"\n\nThe average household income in Northeast is 6,000 a year. And about 135,000 vehicles a day pass the site on New York Avenue and 50,000 a day pass along South Dakota Avenue.\n\n\"If it\\'s designed correctly and managed correctly -- and the mix is set up properly -- these centers [in lower-income areas] are very successful ... ,\" says Gary Rappaport, president of The Rappaport Cos. (www.rappaportco.com) in McLean.\n\nHe should know. Rappaport bought the 300,000-square-foot Penn Mar Shopping Center in Prince George\\'s County about seven years ago. He\\'s since added 100,000 square feet with tenants such as Shoppers Food, Starbucks and Marshalls.\n\n\"Today, we\\'re sitting there with half a dozen retailers who want to be there with Target across the street,\" he says.\n\nThe same kind of successes could lie ahead for Washington Gateway.\n\n\"That is a very underserved marketplace,\" says retail broker Richard Lake, a principal at Madison Retail Group (www.madisonretailgroup.com). \"Those folks have been forced to go outside the city for goods and services.\"\n\nIn 2001, Peterson signed a deal with Fort Lincoln Newtown, which holds development rights for the site. Before that, Fort Lincoln had tried for eight years to develop the site. Federal Realty Investment Trust also took a stab at it, as did Trammell Crow.\n\nThough it can sometimes be a challenge to convince retailers of a market\\'s viability, Lake says, \"once they get into that density with a captive audience, it\\'s incredible the volumes they do.\" \n\narticle from 2004\nDevelopers at the gate for Costco-anchored center\nWashington Business Journal -\nby Eleni Kretikos\nSenior Staff Reporter\n\nDevelopers are pushing to break ground this year on Washington Gateway, a 8 million shopping center in Northeast D.C. that would bring Costco to the District.\n\nBut first, they have a few important issues to hammer out with the city.\n[0]\n\n\nIn December, the D.C. Council approved 0 million in tax-increment financing for the 390,000-square-foot shopping center, which is bounded by New York and South Dakota avenues and 33rd Place, near the entrance to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.\n\nNow the developers and the city are working on the development agreement, a process that could be completed in the next 45 days.\n\nWashington Gateway is envisioned as the commercial center of the Fort Lincoln area. Development is planned on all but about 40 of its 265 acres, but that\\'s likely to change soon.\n\n\"It\\'s now a matter of the deals coming to fruition,\" says Tony Freeman, chief executive of the National Capital Revitalization Corp. (www.ncrcdc.com), which is overseeing the development in Fort Lincoln.\n\nFreeman says he\\'s looking for preliminary site and infrastructure work on Washington Gateway to begin later this year. If that happens, retailers are expected to start opening in late 2006 and into 2007.\n\nFairfax-based Peterson Cos. (www.petersoncos.com) is developing the 43-acre site with private developer Fort Lincoln Newtown, which holds the development rights.\n\nIt\\'s been a long time in coming. Before 2001, D.C.-based Fort Lincoln Newtown had tried for eight years to develop the site. Federal Realty Investment Trust also took a stab at it, as did Trammell Crow Co. So far, Peterson\\'s formula seems to be working.\n\nIn addition to Costco, which is expected to generate annual revenue of 50 million, Shoppers Food Warehouse and Staples have signed letters of intent for Washington Gateway. There are also free-standing sites for two sit-down restaurants.\n\nAlong with the much-needed retail stores, Fort Lincoln is likely to see residential development in the near future.\n\nIn August, Pulte Homes, Fort Lincoln Newtown and the Concordia Group are projected to break ground on 209 three-level townhouses marketed to moderate-income buyers; most will be priced below 00,000. And a nonprofit, trying to pin down its financing options, has proposed a high-rise senior housing complex close by.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa464miw0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.952834,38.920622]}},{"properties":{"name":"Washington Gateway -New Costco - 2008 - 151,700 with grocery and pharmacy","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Washington Gateway -New Costco - 2008 - 151,700 with grocery and pharmacyHow Costco Became the Anti-Wal-Marthttp://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/business/yourmoney/17costco.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=8b31033c5b6a6d68&amp;ex=1279252800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss\n\nA Costco warehouse store in Tigard, Ore. The company is challenging the idea that discount retailers must pay workers poorly.\nPublished: July 17, 2005\n\nISSAQUAH, Wash.\n\nJIM SINEGAL, the chief executive of Costco Wholesale, the nation\\'s fifth-largest retailer, had all the enthusiasm of an 8-year-old in a candy store as he tore open the container of one of his favorite new products: granola snack mix. \"You got to try this; it\\'s delicious,\" he said. \"And just .99 for 38 ounces.\"\nDefying the Analysts\nPeter Yates for The New York Times\n\n\nSome 60 feet away, inside Costco\\'s cavernous warehouse store here in the company\\'s hometown, Mr. Sinegal became positively exuberant about the 87-inch-long Natuzzi brown leather sofas. \"This is just 99.99,\" he said. \"It\\'s terrific quality. Most other places you\\'d have to pay ,500, even ,000.\"\n\nBut the pièce de résistance, the item he most wanted to crow about, was Costco\\'s private-label pinpoint cotton dress shirts. \"Look, these are just 2.99,\" he said, while lifting a crisp blue button-down. \"At Nordstrom or Macy\\'s, this is a 5, 0 shirt.\"\n\nCombining high quality with stunningly low prices, the shirts appeal to upscale customers - and epitomize why some retail analysts say Mr. Sinegal just might be America\\'s shrewdest merchant since Sam Walton.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with Costco\\'s business strategy. Some Wall Street analysts assert that Mr. Sinegal is overly generous not only to Costco\\'s customers but to its workers as well.\n\nCostco\\'s average pay, for example, is 7 an hour, 42 percent higher than its fiercest rival, Sam\\'s Club. And Costco\\'s health plan makes those at many other retailers look Scroogish. One analyst, Bill Dreher of Deutsche Bank, complained last year that at Costco \"it\\'s better to be an employee or a customer than a shareholder.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal begs to differ. He rejects Wall Street\\'s assumption that to succeed in discount retailing, companies must pay poorly and skimp on benefits, or must ratchet up prices to meet Wall Street\\'s profit demands.\n\nGood wages and benefits are why Costco has extremely low rates of turnover and theft by employees, he said. And Costco\\'s customers, who are more affluent than other warehouse store shoppers, stay loyal because they like that low prices do not come at the workers\\' expense. \"This is not altruistic,\" he said. \"This is good business.\"\n\nHe also dismisses calls to increase Costco\\'s product markups. Mr. Sinegal, who has been in the retailing business for more than a half-century, said that heeding Wall Street\\'s advice to raise some prices would bring Costco\\'s downfall.\n\n\"When I started, Sears, Roebuck was the Costco of the country, but they allowed someone else to come in under them,\" he said. \"We don\\'t want to be one of the casualties. We don\\'t want to turn around and say, \\'We got so fancy we\\'ve raised our prices,\\' and all of a sudden a new competitor comes in and beats our prices.\"\n\nAt Costco, one of Mr. Sinegal\\'s cardinal rules is that no branded item can be marked up by more than 14 percent, and no private-label item by more than 15 percent. In contrast, supermarkets generally mark up merchandise by 25 percent, and department stores by 50 percent or more.\n\n\"They could probably get more money for a lot of items they sell,\" said Ed Weller, a retailing analyst at ThinkEquity.\n\nBut Mr. Sinegal warned that if Costco increased markups to 16 or 18 percent, the company might slip down a dangerous slope and lose discipline in minimizing costs and prices.\n\nMr. Sinegal, whose father was a coal miner and steelworker, gave a simple explanation. \"On Wall Street, they\\'re in the business of making money between now and next Thursday,\" he said. \"I don\\'t say that with any bitterness, but we can\\'t take that view. We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now.\"\n\nIF shareholders mind Mr. Sinegal\\'s philosophy, it is not obvious: Costco\\'s stock price has risen more than 10 percent in the last 12 months, while Wal-Mart\\'s has slipped 5 percent. Costco shares sell for almost 23 times expected earnings; at Wal-Mart the multiple is about 19.Mr. Dreher said Costco\\'s share price was so high because so many people love the company. \"It\\'s a cult stock,\" he said.\n\nEmme Kozloff, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, faulted Mr. Sinegal as being too generous to employees, noting that when analysts complained that Costco\\'s workers were paying just 4 percent toward their health costs, he raised that percentage only to 8 percent, when the retail average is 25 percent.\n\n\"He has been too benevolent,\" she said. \"He\\'s right that a happy employee is a productive long-term employee, but he could force employees to pick up a little more of the burden.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal says he pays attention to analysts\\' advice because it enforces a healthy discipline, but he has largely shunned Wall Street pressure to be less generous to his workers. \n\n\"When Jim talks to us about setting wages and benefits, he doesn\\'t want us to be better than everyone else, he wants us to be demonstrably better,\" said John Matthews, Costco\\'s senior vice president for human resources.\nSkip to next paragraph\nPeter Yates for The New York Times\n\nCostco\\'s strategy of using plain spaces to sell products in bulk at deep discounts has won over many customers, said Jim Sinegal, Costco\\'s chief executive.\nMultimedia\nGraphic Defying the Analysts\nDefying the Analysts\n\nWith his ferocious attention to detail and price, Mr. Sinegal has made Costco the nation\\'s leading warehouse retailer, with about half of the market, compared with 40 percent for the No. 2, Sam\\'s Club. But Sam\\'s is not a typical runner-up: it is part of the Wal-Mart empire, which, with 88 billion in sales last year, dwarfs Costco.\n\nBut it is the customer, more than the competition, that keeps Mr. Sinegal\\'s attention. \"We\\'re very good merchants, and we offer value,\" he said. \"The traditional retailer will say: \\'I\\'m selling this for 0. I wonder whether I can get 0.50 or 1.\\' We say: \\'We\\'re selling it for . How do we get it down to ?\\' We understand that our members don\\'t come and shop with us because of the fancy window displays or the Santa Claus or the piano player. They come and shop with us because we offer great values.\"\n\nCostco was founded with a single store in Seattle in 1983; it now has 457 stores, mostly in the United States, but also in Canada, Britain, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Wal-Mart, by contrast, had 642 Sam\\'s Clubs in the United States and abroad as of Jan. 31.Costco\\'s profit rose 22 percent last year, to 82 million, on sales of 7.1 billion. In the United States, its stores average 21 million in sales annually, far more than the 0 million for Sam\\'s Clubs. And the average household income of Costco customers is 4,000 - with 31 percent earning over 00,000.\n\nOne reason the company has risen to the top and stayed there is that Mr. Sinegal relentlessly refines his model of the warehouse store - the bare-bones, cement-floor retailing space where shoppers pay a membership fee to choose from a limited number of products in large quantities at deep discounts. Costco has 44.6 million members, with households paying 5 a year and small businesses paying 00.\n\nA typical Costco store stocks 4,000 types of items, including perhaps just four toothpaste brands, while a Wal-Mart typically stocks more than 100,000 types of items and may carry 60 sizes and brands of toothpastes. Narrowing the number of options increases the sales volume of each, allowing Costco to squeeze deeper and deeper bulk discounts from suppliers.\n\n\"He\\'s a zealot on low prices,\" Ms. Kozloff said. \"He\\'s very reticent about finagling with his model.\"\n\nDespite Costco\\'s impressive record, Mr. Sinegal\\'s salary is just 50,000, although he also received a 00,000 bonus last year. That puts him at less than 10 percent of many other chief executives, though Costco ranks 29th in revenue among all American companies.\n\n\"I\\'ve been very well rewarded,\" said Mr. Sinegal, who is worth more than 50 million thanks to his Costco stock holdings. \"I just think that if you\\'re going to try to run an organization that\\'s very cost-conscious, then you can\\'t have those disparities. Having an individual who is making 100 or 200 or 300 times more than the average person working on the floor is wrong.\"\n\nThere is little love lost between Wal-Mart and Costco. Wal-Mart, for example, boasts that its Sam\\'s Club division has the lowest prices of any retailer. Mr. Sinegal emphatically dismissed that assertion with a one-word barnyard epithet. Sam\\'s might make the case that its ketchup is cheaper than Costco\\'s, he said, \"but you can\\'t compare Hunt\\'s ketchup with Heinz ketchup.\"\n\nStill, Costco is feeling the heat from Sam\\'s Club. When Sam\\'s began to pare prices aggressively several years ago, Costco had to shave its prices - and its already thin profit margins - ever further.\n\n\"Sam\\'s Club has dramatically improved its operation and improved the quality of their merchandise,\" said Mr. Dreher, the Deutsche Bank analyst. \"Using their buying power together with Wal-Mart\\'s, it forces Costco to be very sharp on their prices.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal\\'s elbows can be sharp as well. As most suppliers well know, his gruff charm is not what lets him sell goods at rock-bottom prices - it\\'s his fearsome toughness, which he rarely shows in public. He often warns suppliers not to offer other retailers lower prices than Costco gets.\n\nWhen a frozen-food supplier mistakenly sent Costco an invoice meant for Wal-Mart, he discovered that Wal-Mart was getting a better price. \"We have not brought that supplier back,\" Mr. Sinegal said.\n\nHe has to be flinty, he said, because the competition is so fierce. \"This is not the Little Sisters of the Poor,\" he said. \"We have to be competitive in the toughest marketplace in the world against the biggest competitor in the world. We cannot afford to be timid.\"\nSkip to next paragraph Multimedia\nGraphic Defying the Analysts\nDefying the Analysts\n\nNor can he afford to let personal relationships get in his way. Tim Rose, Costco\\'s senior vice president for food merchandising, recalled a time when Starbucks did not pass along savings from a drop in coffee bean prices. Though he is a friend of the Starbucks chairman, Howard Schultz, Mr. Sinegal warned he would remove Starbucks coffee from his stores unless it cut its prices.\n\nStarbucks relented.\n\n\"Howard said, \\'Who do you think you are? The price police?\\' \" Mr. Rose recalled, adding that Mr. Sinegal replied emphatically that he was.\n\nIf Mr. Sinegal feels proprietary about warehouse stores, it is for good reason. He was present at the birth of the concept, in 1954. He was 18, a student at San Diego Community College, when a friend asked him to help unload mattresses for a month-old discount store called Fed-Mart.\n\nWhat he thought would be a one-day job became a career. He rose to executive vice president for merchandising and became a protégé of Fed-Mart\\'s chairman, Sol Price, who is credited with inventing the idea of high-volume warehouse stores that sell a limited number of products.\n\nMr. Price sold Fed-Mart to a German retailer in 1975 and was fired soon after. Mr. Sinegal then left and helped Mr. Price start a new warehouse company, Price Club. Its huge success led others to enter the business: Wal-Mart started Sam\\'s Club, Zayre\\'s started BJ\\'s Wholesale Club and a Seattle entrepreneur tapped Mr. Sinegal to help him found Costco.\n\nCostco has used Mr. Price\\'s formula: sell a limited number of items, keep costs down, rely on high volume, pay workers well, have customers buy memberships and aim for upscale shoppers, especially small-business owners. In addition, don\\'t advertise - that saves 2 percent a year in costs. Costco and Price Club merged in 1993.\n\n\"Jim has done a very good job in balancing the interests of the shareholders, the employees, the customers and the managers,\" said Mr. Price, now 89 and retired. \"Most companies tilt too much one way or the other.\"\n\nMr. Sinegal, who is 69 but looks a decade younger, also delights in not tilting Costco too far into cheap merchandise, even at his warehouse stores. He loves the idea of the \"treasure hunt\" - occasional, temporary specials on exotic cheeses, Coach bags, plasma screen televisions, Waterford crystal, French wine and ,000 necklaces - scattered among staples like toilet paper by the case and institutional-size jars of mayonnaise.\n\nThe treasure hunts, Mr. Sinegal says, create a sense of excitement and customer loyalty.\n\nThis knack for seeing things in a new way also explains Costco\\'s approach to retaining employees as well as shoppers. Besides paying considerably more than competitors, for example, Costco contributes generously to its workers\\' 401(k) plans, starting with 3 percent of salary the second year and rising to 9 percent after 25 years.\n\nITS insurance plans absorb most dental expenses, and part-time workers are eligible for health insurance after just six months on the job, compared with two years at Wal-Mart. Eighty-five percent of Costco\\'s workers have health insurance, compared with less than half at Wal-Mart and Target.\n\nCostco also has not shut out unions, as some of its rivals have. The Teamsters union, for example, represents 14,000 of Costco\\'s 113,000 employees. \"They gave us the best agreement of any retailer in the country,\" said Rome Aloise, the union\\'s chief negotiator with Costco. The contract guarantees employees at least 25 hours of work a week, he said, and requires that at least half of a store\\'s workers be full time.\n\nWorkers seem enthusiastic. Beth Wagner, 36, used to manage a Rite Aid drugstore, where she made 4,000 a year and paid nearly ,000 a year for health coverage. She quit five years ago to work at Costco, taking a cut in pay. She started at 0.50 an hour - 2,000 a year - but now makes 8 an hour as a receiving clerk. With annual bonuses, her income is about 0,000.\n\n\"I want to retire here,\" she said. \"I love it here.\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa484hxs5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.954594,38.919687]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wegmans Grocery Store -- Woodmore (Petrie)","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Wegmans Grocery Store<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa3v6nzvo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.847391,38.912007]}},{"properties":{"name":"West Hyattsville Metro TDDP- West Hyattsville Commons","description":"Posted by RufuslWest Hyattsville Metro District Plan (TDDP)This project will update the 1998 West Hyattsville Transit District Development Plan (TDDP) to implement the recommendations of the 2003 West Hyattsville Metro TOD Strategy completed in FY 2003.

It’s a very bright, forward, progressive feeling.\"\n\nIt’s hard to imagine things were quite that promising back in 1997.\n\nBut it was then, when event the most forward-thinking developers weren’t considering the North Philadelphia neighborhood, that Fort Washington-based Westrum began acquiring the land, bit by bit, for what would eventually become Brewerytown Square.\n\nIt was no safe bet. Westrum named the development in honor of the neighborhood’s historic beer-brewing tradition, which earned it the name Brewerytown in the late 19th century, but the neighborhood in the late 20th century was known more for its many problems: High crime, a depleted residential base and, eventually, a whole lot of abandoned buildings.\n\nStill, Westrum saw promise and value in the area, which was located ideally, they believed, between Fairmount Park, Kelly Drive, the Art Museum and Center City.\n\n\"Just look at the map,\" said Tom Hewell, a Westrum community manager. \"We’re close to everything – close to the major road arteries, close to all the major cultural things and close to the other more wellknown areas of Philadelphia that have seen such a rise in real estate over the past 15 or 20 years. It just seemed like a home run to build on some of these blighted blocks and turn them into affordable homes.\"\n\nSo they did just that. In all, Westrum would buy 17 urban acres – no small feat, especially considering not one single resident was displaced – before beginning work on Brewerytown Square itself, a community of 144 townhouses at 31st and Girard Avenue.\n\nBrewerytown offers something that other neighborhoods can’t, said Hewell: High-quality homes at an affordable price.\n\nKnowing that their new development wouldn’t have the cachet of the city’s more prominent neighborhoods, Westrum smartly decided to put the Brewerytown homes on the market for a price that might attract first-time homebuyers – exactly the kind of people who were increasingly being priced out of Center City and other neighborhoods.\n\n\"The majority of our buyers are firsttime buyers,\" Hewell said. \"In Philadelphia right now, it’s not easy to buy a condominium for anything less than 00,000, or 00,000 or 00,000, and that goes right up to  million. We put ourselves in a niche where we’re an affordable residential community close to everything else, except we’re establishing a whole new part of Philadelphia, which has now become Brewerytown.\" Brewerytown Square Brewerytown’s combination of location and affordability is exactly what attracted Pierson, who began his home search last winter after deciding to leave his home in Maple Shade, NJ, to move closer to his daughter. He was looking to at the real estate listings one day when he came across an ad for Brewerytown Square which, until then, he had never heard of.\n\nHe visited the community first to look at a rental unit, and then began wondering if he should buy instead.\n\n\"I immediately liked [the community],\" he said. \"But then I thought, ‘Why should I rent if I could buy? I went down to speak with the people n the sales center, and told them if I was going to buy we had to have settlement before May 1, because that’s when my lease ran out.\"\n\nThat was in March.\n\nBy April, Pierson had his home.\n\n\"They really accommodated me,\" he said of Westrum.\n\nHewell said Westrum has gone out of its way to make new residents feel at home – and with good reason. The developer needed to sell homebuyers on a community that is, admittedly, on the edge of some rougher areas. Then Westrum had to get them to stay and, ideally, convince others to move in, too.\n\nWestrum also knew, Hewell said, that for new residents to feel at home in their new community, they couldn’t be alone there. The last thing Westrum wanted was to get into a situation where one or two buyers would move into an otherwise empty development.\n\nTo keep that from happening, Westrum \"did a lot of buzz marketing,\" Hewell said, focusing especially on young professionals. The idea was to create a pent-up demand leading up the opening of sales.\n\n\"It was a blighted area,\" Hewell said. \"A couple of streets down from us it was maybe a little worrisome for some people. But the idea was to move in a real community, really fast.\"\n\nThe plan worked. When sales finally opened, the community’s first 12 homes, priced in the mid-00,000s, sold in a day. Deposits quickly followed for homes that had yet to be built. Demand has been strong ever since.\n\n\"We were the most affordable option, for a first-time house, for a lot of the buyers,\" Hewell said. \"These people were renting in the Fairmount Park or Art Museum area, paying in rent pretty close to what their mortgage would be.\"\n\nThe neighborhood’s increasing popularity can be seen mostly plainly, Hewell said, in home prices, which have increased to the mid-00s. As of the latest count, Westrum has contracts of 76 of the 144 homes at the site. Critical mass is being achieved.\n\n\"You have a sense of community now,\" Hewell said. \"It’s not just one or two people living here. There are people coming and going from work. A year ago, we had 12 people in one building – we only had one building up. Now we have six buildings up. It’s a lot like an instant community.\"\n\nPierson agrees.\n\nHe said he knows all of his neighbors by name. These new neighbors have bonded, he said, in the feeling that they’re doing something wonderful both for a neighborhood that needed a boost and for the city in general.\n\n\"The location and the people are great,\" he said. \"It’s a great community. We all get along. We have this sense of being pioneers, because its’ almost historic living here. It’s a real transition from what it used to be – and I don’t mean the neighborhood. It’s about the vacant buildings that are being torn down, and the sense that we’re making a new community. It’s exciting that there’s such a future in this area.\"\n\t\t\n\t\n\n \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa41nrt4h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.18691,39.97738]}},{"properties":{"name":"Woodmore Towne Centre","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Woodmore Towne CentreFrom the Ground Up\nMore Retail Coming to Prince George\\'s\nBy Dana Hedgpeth\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, March 21, 2005;\n\n\nPrince George\\'s County may be getting some of the trendier retailers that civic leaders and local shoppers long have sought.\n\nA team of developers bought 245 acres at the Capital Beltway and Route 202 in Landover and plans to turn it into a complex of homes, offices and moderate- to high-end retailers that sell furniture, clothing and specialty items.\n\n\n\nLandover Mall, where only a Sears store remains, may soon find itself across the Capital Beltway from new retailers. (Robert A. Reeder -- The Washington Post)\nPetrie Ventures Inc. of Annapolis, Erwin L. Greenberg Commercial Corp. of Owings Mills, and Hovnanian Land Investment Group (formerly Washington Homes) bought the property from the former Rouse Cos. of Columbia (now part of mall operator General Growth Properties).\n\nThe developers said they plan to put single-family houses, townhouses and condominiums, up to 1.5 million square feet of office space, and about 700,000 square feet of retail on the property, one of the area\\'s last unclaimed parcels.\n\n\"It\\'s an important site because it\\'s very close to the Beltway, and it\\'s another opportunity for us to attract unique retailers to the county,\" said Kwasi G. Holman, president of the county\\'s economic development corporation.\n\nPrince George\\'s County officials have been working to attract varied retailers. A few years ago, Landover Mall closed, leaving only a Sears, Roebuck store open there. The mall sits across the Beltway from Petrie\\'s project. Just a few miles south of Petrie\\'s project in Largo, there is a new, town-center-style shopping center called the Boulevard at the Capital Centre. It has a DSW Shoe Warehouse, Sports Authority, Circuit City and a movie theater.\n\nAlthough Petrie\\'s development team said it has not filed plans with zoning officials, it expects to build some first-floor shops with condos above them, according to Walt Petrie, chairman of Petrie Ventures.\n\nNot that the new development is likely to bring luxury merchants to Prince George\\'s. \"There\\'s a lot of people who want me to put a Saks Fifth Avenue or a Neiman Marcus in here, but it will be more moderate-priced shopping,\" Petrie said. A Trader Joe\\'s grocery store? \"That\\'s not out of the question,\" he said, and there also are likely to be neighborhood services such as a gym and dry cleaner.\n\nConstruction is expected to start at the end of the year, with completion in mid-2007.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62aa44w96cc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.841125,38.923626]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/228794","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rufusl","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rufusl","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/228794","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":246,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=228794,platial:user=rufusl","published":"2010-03-02T17:00:00Z","id":26217}
