His design was unanimously chosen out of 700 designs entered in a competition. People developed mixed feelings about the Eiffel Tower. A petition of 300 names opposed to construction of the tower. Despite the oppposition, construction began in 1887. It was completed in 1889 for the Exhibition of Paris. \r\n\r\nThe tower is made completely of iron and weighs 7000 tons. It reaches a height of 1,052 feet and was the tallest structure in the world until 1930 with the construction of the Chrysler Building. The Eiffel Tower was actually about to be destroyed in 1909 because it was accused of having no important use. It was saved due to its antenna used as a vital telegraphy service. Its antenna is also used for radio and television transmissions.
