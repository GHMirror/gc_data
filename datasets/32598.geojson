This ride leaves from Rt. 410 (East West Highway) and Beach Drive (near Candy Cane City) every Saturday morning at 7:10 am. The ride meanders to the Massachusetts Avenue hill from Goldsboro, then pace-lines out to the Old Anglers Inn hill (on MacArthur), and down into Great Falls Park and back out. Thereafter some riders retrace their path down MacArthur making a left turn for the ascent up Brickyard Road, while other riders head down Falls Road. The ride regroups at Brickyard Road and Falls Road. There\\'s one final push coming in on Democracy Boulevard before the ride heads back to East West Highway and Beach Drive. This ride ends when riders get back to East West Highway and Beach Drive. Often some riders veer off in Potomac Village and go out to Poolesville or Sugarloaf, making for a 60+ mile ride (the regular loop is about 40 miles). As with all rides, the rules for this ride are respect for fellow riders, motorists, and pedestrians, and observing all traffic signs.Approximate Distance/Time: 40 miles/2.5 hours.
