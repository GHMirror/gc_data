While the mass deportations of the civilian Armenian population was carried out in the spring and summer of 1915 and were completed by the fall, the systematic slaughter of the Armenians had started earlier with the murder of the able-bodied males already drafted into the Ottoman armed forces. By expropriating the movable and immovable wealth of the Armenians, the CUP also looked upon its policy of genocide as a means for enriching its coffers and rewarding its cohorts. The elimination of a commercially viable minority fulfilled part of the nationalist program to concentrate financial power in the hands of the state and promote greater Turkish control over the domestic economy.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6okctzkrkyd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.243322,38.963745]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aldies Grocery Store","description":"Posted by Oleander4000 market st phildelphia pa 19143An excellent place to stock up on necessary supplies when preparing to dig into the bomb shelter built into the basement.
