This data is from Esri's Updated Demographics (2010/2015) database. \n\nThe geography depicts states at greater than 25m scale, counties at 1m to 25m scale, Census Tracts at 250k to 1m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 250k scale.\n\nThe map is designed to be displayed with a semi-transparency of approximately 50% for overlay on other basemaps, as reflected in the map legend.\n\nEsri's Updated Demographics (2010/2015) â€“ Population, age, income, sex, race, and marital status are among the variables included in the database. Each year, Esri's data development team employs its proven methodologies to update more than 2,000 demographic variables for a variety of geographies.
