One person believes the video was staged with a lazer pen on a black carpet. \r\n\r\nAnother Borras resident said they could remember a series of UFO sightings over Borras Airfield 20 years ago, mentioning they had seen green lights similar to the ones in the video over the by-pass a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=3065718<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6g3c5d71v04"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.96914,53.06025]}},{"properties":{"name":"27/07/07 - Massive cash deal for Reds","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.eveningleader.co.uk\">Leaderonline</a>WREXHAM FC bosses have today revealed a major new sponsorship deal with one of the UK\\'s best known breweries.\r\n\r\nThe club unveiled the deal, reputed to be worth a six-figure sum to the League Two outfit, with Marston\\'s.\r\n\r\nSubject to board approval, the brewery has agreed to sponsor the Mold Road Stand, at The Racecourse, for the next five years.\r\n\r\nFormerly the Pryce Griffiths Stand, after the ex-Wrexham FC chairman, the name was changed last year.
