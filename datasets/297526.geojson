The estimated number of working days in the year (250) is in line with other research in the field. This number assumes that the typical full-time employee works a 5-day week - indeed, the 1995 Survey of Work Arrangements showed that 75% of full-timers had a 5-day week - and is entitled to all statutory holidays (around 10 days a year). Thus, the potential annual labour supply of a typical worker would be 52 weeks multiplied by 5, less 10 statutory holidays, or 250 days. This allows the days lost per worker in a year to be calculated.","geography":"4","2011":null,"id":"aa6qwoc97fb1","absence rates":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"sex":null,"geography":"Source:","2011":null,"id":"aa6qwohtff2o","absence rates":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"sex":null,"geography":"Statistics Canada.
