Easily agitated stomach? Aversion to dairy? Sweet tooth? Allergic to flour? Babycakes will cater to all of your exhorbitant demands, you gentle stomached, vegetarian, vegan-friendly New Yorker. The chocolate chip cookie is one of best I\\'ve had, I didn\\'t even notice that it lacked anything, because well, it didn\\'t! Try it as a chocolate chip frosting sandwich (.75). The frosting is actaully the best part about this place; you can even buy frosting shots for a dollar. As for the yummy cupcakes (.50), you can kiss gross-ass too sickly-sweet Magnolia\\'s goodbye and opt for their gluten-free lemon which is more moist than the wheat free variety. Both are great. Actually, another great thing about this place is that it\\'s so heavily branded-- it has an old fashion 50\\'s style bakery sign that flashes out front, and old school bar stools and counter. I like to personally sit in the window cushion, eat my cupcake and peruse the copies of Star and Teen Vogue that the bakery girls have so kindly supplied.  \n\nPS. The employee uniforms are the cutest; striped pink minidresses with white collars and puffed sleeves!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxnt5wfw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.988907,40.717827]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brown Cafe","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/photo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 61 Hester St., New York, NYWhen I lived on Orchard, i was like, hey, there\\'s no where to hang out except on the stoop and watch old chinese people walk by with their cups of milk tea. Where can I go for hipster spotting and a cup of Euro-style strong ass cappucinos and cute barista? Well, I spoke too soon, and Brown popped up. Like all things in Manhattan, it was a great little secret while it lasted, then it became \"Manhattanized\", and now every body goes! Even people who are not from the hood! Though i think it ridiculous to travel all the way down here for it. I mean, i\\'m force to go here because I have nothing else! \n\nAnyway, enough about me. The staff are great-- stylish art-school drops. There is the cute Australian guy barista, cute Australian waitress who also doubles at Babycakes (read my review), the super nice wavy brown hair-ed girl who is like uber dime store chic, and the cool Filipino dude, who is dating the blond Australian girl. As you can tell, i spend way too much time there. \n\nPrices are decent, similar to starbucks (.95 or so for a cap), but their best drink is the Ice Mocha. I know the mochacinno frappacinos gross at Starbucks, but at Brown they make the espresso, pour it over over, and then pour chocolate syrup on it. YUM. It not too sweet but has the right amount of strong coffee + milk. \n\nFood is what I like to call basic gourmet \"diner fare\"-- meaning plain eggs, smoked salmon, crusty bread, butter. That kind of stuff. Euro-breakfast. Baked eggs w/ smoked salmon + fresh ricotta is good, comes with a mescun-type salad. Simple, plain, hangover food. Don\\'t except high cuisine, but good ingredients and simple preparation. \n\nThe clientele range from normal people, trust funders, celebs (ok i saw Reese Witherspoon\\'s love interest from Sweet Home Alabama there, and he got quicker service than us) there, older arty people, and hipsters. That block is developing into a DL LES hangout zone. Some designer skater hip hop type clothing store opened next door, the kind of store there the employees out number the customers 5:0, so most of them end up hang outside on the curb most of the day, checking people out. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxdqp36o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.990372,40.715729]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dumpling House","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/dumpling.gif\">118 Eldridge St, New YorkThis is where I eat when i feel destitute and poor because here  can buy you a 3 course meal! Everyone knows about the plain potstickers, which are 5 for , but have you tried the Beef sesame pancake, which is like a beef pancake triangle with pickled carrots and radishes, or my favorite which is the leek dumpling, which is like a large empanada with leeks, dried shrimp, egg, and vermacelli noodles stir-fired together on the inside, and then grilled on a Foreman-esque machine? It takes at least minutes btw. so unless you have a lot of time, remember Dumpling House maybe cheap, but if you\\'re ordering the specialities, its not that fast. The service is actually friendly, Northern CHinese are very polite! My favorite guy there is the Chinese Elvis, who wear muscle Ts, has a cigarette tucked behind the ear, and seems to give me \"table service\" in a place where it\\'s standing counters only. Also good is the hot soy milk for breakfast, and jya-jyan mein, though the Koreans I know think their version is heresy ( hey, the Chinese came up with it first!)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxlaz95p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.991783,40.718234]}},{"properties":{"name":"Happy Shabu Shabu, somewhat happy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a>54 Canal St, New York 10002Few things are more satifying than Shabu on a cold cold NY night. Maybe japanese Oden would be great too, but if you\\'re downtown, and want decent but cheap shabu, Happy is the place. The cuts of meats are not as amazing as some higher priced Japanese places, but they make up for it in the sauce variety-- you can dip in chinese bbq/ oil, Chinese black vinegar, and my fave, fermented tofu sauce, which sort of resembles Indian raita/ yogurt but is more like the blue cheese of tofu. You can also add scallions, cilantro, crushed garlic to your sauces. Satisfying but not amazing. However they do have a good variety of fruit smoothie drinks (watermelon, papaya milk).\n\nSpecial treat-- they play chinese karaoke and music videos while you eat.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxgjixfk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.99202,40.714924]}},{"properties":{"name":"Overseas Asian Restaurant Corporation","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/Nasi_Lemak.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/3549483_cd8c5f5d8d_s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 49 Canal Street, New York, NY, 10002Overseas Asian Restaurant Corporation 212-925-3233<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxqrt1ze"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.991647,40.715328]}},{"properties":{"name":"Overseas Asian Restaurant-- Malay/ Chinese","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 25 Canal St, NY NY 10002If you live in the neighborhood, or don\\'t feel like dining at the fancy new euro places down the block, Overseas Chinese is great for some Malay/ Chinese basics. Tradition lunch plate, Nasilemak (.25) is a reliable standby, with coconut rice, curry chicken, mini dried anchovies, and pickled veggies, sure to entertain any short attention span foodie. Another fave of mine is the Wonton Mee, its also like ; tradition CHinese wonton noodle soup served with dried onions. Spare ribs and spicy chinese watercress with shrimp paste is also good. The curry noodle soups are a little too thick for me though. Mee Goreng (singaporian noodle dish) is also reliable. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxj59xvd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.990412,40.714451]}},{"properties":{"name":"Raina's former L.E.S apt with the shower in the kitchen","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/IMG_3732.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 27 Orchard St, NY 10002this is my former apartment; it was one of those typically Manhattan places with exposed pipes and... strange, cramped, with a shower in the living room! Yes, my shower was adjacent to my range, and next to the kitchen sink, and if i wanted to, shower and saute at the same time! There was also no good place for Acorn\\'s litter box, so I\\'d put it in the shower, and take it out every time i wanted to bathe. Hence the show would smell like cat poo. Even though it was tiny, I liked the feel of the apartment; it had lots of light, roof access (top floor), it was the \"penthouse\" so to speak. In the summertime most of the residents, mostly older chinese women and their grandchildren, would leave their doors open and lights off throuhout the day. I could see clear through their entire apartments; they had peeling linoleum floors and walls packed with crap. Their places were darker, seemingly smaller, and unrenovated than mine, which had had new floors, a newish kitchen, and repainted walls. I had 2 a/c units (by accident), modern furniture and lived alone; Other people in my building didn\\'t have A/C, and keeping the doors open would help circulate air, kitchen smells, and basically add another of \"window\" to the tiny apartments. Apartments that they shared with their entire families just like the immigrants who had lives in these same tenements (with 5-10 people per apartment) a hundred years before. As a Chinese American young profession, I\\'d wonder how as Chinese people our lives in America could be world different. Still do.\n\nWalking up the stairs, I\\'d smell my neighbors cooking their dinners for their grandchildren and wished they\\'d ask me over. I\\'d also pass the single Latino gentleman on the third floor, and would hear music lessons; in his packed apartment I could see an upright piano, a computer desk, and a bed. I\\'d sometimes see him teaching the neighborhood Chinese kids guitar. When I\\'d open my apartment door  sometimes Acorn would rush out into the bonsai lady\\'s apartment across the way who\\'s door was open. In the summer, all she would do in the daytime was lay on her bed, with the lights off, fanning herself, int his tiny studio apartment filled with minuature trees. \n\nThough now i live a few blocks south of Canal, not too far away in a  nicer, larger unit, I miss Orchard St a little. When my friend Erin would stay over after a late night of drinks and dancing to Morrissey, we\\'d come back and she\\'d sleep on the couch, i\\'d sleep in mybed, and we\\'d talk until we fell asleep. We\\'d talk also while I was in bed and she was taking a shower too. In that apartment two people would always be right next to each other. Proximity brings people together, its true. Ever wonder why its always so fun to be confined in a small space with lots of people, like a slumber party? In my new place, Erin sleeps on my couch but is a good ten feet down the hall. I have to practically yodal her my secrets. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxcqm207"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.990946,40.715094]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sea &amp; Sea Seafood","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/1/seaseafishmarket.JPG\">310 Saint Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10027Fabulous seafood/ cheap by the pound! A gem. A giant fish market where you put all the seafood you want in a basket + raw veggies (okra, onions and potatoes). They take your basket, add seasoning salt, and stick the whole thing into a steamer for about 10 mins-- the result is a perfectly steamed seafood medley. They will slather a cup of liquid butter or tartar sauce over the whole concoction, but I\\'d recommend that you tell them to lighten up on the butter or no butter at all-- the seafood juices are really enough. \n\nSea + Sea is way cheap too. I usually get tilapia, shrimp, scallops and onions/ potatoes, and its usuauly under 0.  You\\'re basically paying raw seafood market prices. \n\nNo real fancy fishes here, but the basics are good enough-- Tilapia, salmon, catfish, sea bass. You can also get a bag of mussels (), jumbo shrimp, and crab legs. \n\nThere\\'s also a fried seafood bar area, aka fish sandwiches for , and frieds/ onion rings for . The fried stuff is well, a little too brown and fried, so I\\'d recommend staying with the steamed stuff.\n\nBe prepared to stand and eat however-- there have 2 park benches inside the market, but otherwise, its carryout. I liked to go to the public park nearby. \n\nA fun place to bring out of town guests!\n\nTo get there, take the 1 9 train up to 125th st. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxsr7ik4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.95236,40.811088]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trader Joes","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://1up-zine.com\" href=\"http://1up-zine.com\">Raina</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/tjoutside2.jpg\">142 East 14th Street, new york, NY(I am officially warning you of all the California references) I don\\'t even have to be in California for this. Over-educated, underpaid people of distinctive palates can go to TJs to stock up on house label snacks (spicy pecans? goat cheese chips? pizza dough?). Trader Joe\\'s \"tasters\" (I hear there are 22 of them, lucky bastards) traveled the world to find interesting combinations, recreate them in their kitchens, and package them into ready-made, frozen, or super easy to make foods. Did I mention that its all SUPER CHEAP? AND THEY DELIVER to me,  (Pike st! south of canal!) where no one else dares. Fresh Direct and Whole Foods refuses to dip below Canal while my wonderful, easy-going Angelino homie TJ will. \n\nIt’s amazing that this Trader Joes is about the same size/ floor space as a California one, when I know that they probably deal with 10x the human traffic. Most things are the same, but they are missing a few favorites, including the Trader Joe\\'s Grapefruit body wash and Shampoo. While I think the prepackaged and non-perishable foods cost about the same as in CA (except for the highly acclaimed “2 Buck Chuck,” house brand Charles Shaw which is .99 instead of the even lower wino price of .99), produce and fresh things are a little more. The Ceasar salad is .99, where as in CA, its .79. And, they feature FEWER salads than in CA -- what happened to the Reduced Fat Greek, or the Fig and Feta, the Nicoise California Style, or even the Chinese Chicken? Someone please alert me when they begin feature more salads!\n\nOh, avoid TJs on the weekends. I tried going a few weeks after it opened, one Saturday afternoon and the line wrapped around the block. You\\'d think Clap Your Hands Say Yeh was playing or something.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67fbxeedwdm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.988284,40.733613]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/226469","metadata":null,"contact_name":"raina","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:raina","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/226469","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=226469,platial:user=raina","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":50036}
