Surprisingly inexpensive for the quality, and an absolutely stunning Italian wine list...make sure to try the Lambrusco if they have it, it has finally matured as a sparkling red wine of quality and is delightful.\n\nMy last visit really was exquisite, their salumi that is locally dry aged is fantastic, as is their prosciutto selection.  If you\\'ve never experienced Burrata cream filled Mozarella, you\\'re in for a particular treat.

Housed in wonderfully restored old publishing house featuring the original brick, wood floors and metal and wood beams, it\\'s a warm and inviting environment.\n\nThe food is a great mix of casual style French and California cuisine...you must start with the Canadian styled Poutine which is potato wedges fried and covered with fontina and an rich beef gravy.  Also had a wonderful Monk fish with Chard and braised Ox sauce, amazing Winter Squash soup with sage oil, and Pork Belly with Poached Egg on a mixed salad...overall each dish was very well balanced and creative \"warm\" flavors you won\\'t typically find at restaurants in San Francisco.  Very creative wine list, we had the Royal Tokaji from Hungary, a nice change.\n\nMost recent trip, I went the shellfish route, SH has an excellent selection of very fresh oysters.  Also had the baked oysters which were good, but not great.  Started with a white bean soup topped with pesto which was wonderful and very well balanced.  The dungeness crab salad has an amazingly fresh appeal and is drenched in a great olive oil dressing.  The foie gras torchon was quite good quality and matched with an excellent apricot reduction.\n\nService was extraordinary, rare for a new restaurant to be this well tuned.
