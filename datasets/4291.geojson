Coastal areas placed under tropical cyclone watches or warnings are delimited by specific geographical locations known as &quot;breakpoints&quot; (e.g., a hurricane warning is in effect from breakpoint &quot;A&quot; to breakpoint &quot;B&quot;). This file consists of one or more lines connecting the breakpoints delimiting any current watches or warnings.\n\nCoastal areas placed under tropical cyclone watches or warnings\n\nThis data set displays the 5 day forecast/storm track for hurricane Hanna.
