It was a house we rented there.  \n\nI learned to actually ride a bike without training wheels by riding one with just one training wheel for a while.  Underneath the house was what looked like a giant albino toad, but was probably a dog or something.  There were a lot of cacti behind the house, some of which a neighbor asked to cut so they could eat them.  And my mom was bitten by a German Shepard (I think it\\'s name was Booboo or something like that.)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67gafb4ppoc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.262187,34.148785]}},{"properties":{"name":"First stop in California","description":"Posted by Deltayankee255 W 13th St, San Bernardino, CAI don\\'t know the exact street we lived at here, but my first California school was Lincoln Elementary.
