Minneapolis\nhttp://www.comedysportztc.com/\n$12/$10(Student)\n\nFrom Mariel L. on Yelp.com:\nI had a gut-busting time at Comedysportz. (I'm sorry ma'am, I didn't mean to spill my gastrointestinal tract on your shoe) I received a free ticket to a Comedysportz show after bravely participating in their Sound Effects skit at a work event. Anyway, Comedysportz is an improv theater with a rotating cast of hilarious comics. The actors are divided into two teams, and they challenge each other to different improv challenges and get scored on it, like a sport. I love improv because it truly reveals a comedian's mad hat skills, and it calls for great audience participation. I'm so impressed at how fast these guys think, and remember as was the case for \"Forward-Reverse\" (a crowd favorite). Other awesome 'sports' include the one with Things, Sound Effects, and the one where they tell a story one actor/word at a time. I hope to be back for more, although I'm not sure if my body can take the laughter; I just got my spleen reattached.","id":"a6kha4grkf5b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2982583333333,44.9481861111111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Intermedia Arts","description":"Intermedia Arts\n2822 Lyndale Avenue South\nhttp://www.intermediaarts.org/\n$5-10\n\nFrom Allison C. on Yelp.com:\nGreat little gallery and community arts arena!\n\nEvery time I happen upon this place, I am pleasantly impressed with the exhibit at the time. They have 2 small-ish rooms and a large entryway that they use to show themed exhibits from local and national artists. I caught the opening to a show dealing with immigration and families that was very poignant and at only $2 suggested donation, a real steal when it comes to a night at the gallery. They even fed us!\n\nWhat's more, they have a theater (never been)  and a computer lab for a wide variety of arts involvement. I came here for an open source workshop by Ken Nelson and a co-worker of mine and learned a TON about the movement and also about Intermedia's national involvement in such an important technological frontier.\n\nIf you've ever driven by on Lyndale Ave and wondered about how the exterior gets re-painted so often and in such wildly different ways (annual B-Girl Be festival), stop in and see that the inside is just as, if not more, exciting.","id":"a6kha4hcqw6y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2883185371203,44.9511991845553]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mu Performing Arts","description":"Mu Performing Arts\n355 Wabasha St. N #140, St. Paul\nhttp://www.theatermu.org/\n$0 ($5 suggested donation) limited seating so get reservations\n\nFrom Mu performing Arts on Yelp.com:\nSpecialties\n\nAsian American Theater and Taiko Drumming.

I saw their 'Somewhat Sci-Fi Variety Show' last month and the 'Kinetic Kitchen' last weekend.  Dance isn't really my thing, ballet even less so.  However I have to say I enjoyed both shows.  The performers didn't take themselves too seriously, while still being professional about it.\n\nThe theater is in a converted firehouse with seating for maybe a couple hundred-ish.  A good solid wood floor and decent lighting and sound.  The shows were just $10, all of which goes to the performers...they pass a basket during the intermission to kick in for the operating costs of the Theater itself. I think this is an awesome model.\n\nThere's supposed to be some parking right there, but I've found it overly simple to park across Lake St in the Target lot.  There's eats in the neighborhood from Midori's a block away down to all the chains being literally within sight.","id":"a6kha4bmytye"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2342860000841,44.9480289999349]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rosetown Playhouse Community Theatre","description":"Rosetown Playhouse Community Theatre\n2660 Civic Center Dr, Roseville\nhttp://rosetownplayhouse.org/\n$7-12\n\nFrom RPCT's website:\nWe produce two shows each year with professional directors and staff and casts of various ages.
