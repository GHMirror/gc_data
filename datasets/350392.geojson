Population density is the number of people per square mile. It is calculated by dividing the total population count of geographic feature by the area of the feature, in square miles. The area is calculated from the geometry of the geographic feature in projected coordinates. The geography depicts states at greater than 25m scale, counties at 1m to 25m scale, Census Tracts at 250k to 1m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 250k scale. The map has been designed to be displayed with semi-transparency of about 50 0.000000or overlay on other base maps, which is reflected in the legend for the map.
