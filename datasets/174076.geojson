With the full AFP command taking the charge of controlling the situation, no untoward incidents and armed violence was recorded.\n\nIn Maimbung Kulasi, at around 5:25pm in the afternoon, gun shooting was undertaken. After was a harsh argument of two contesting party of Governor Tan’s son and the Maldisa Clan. A fire coming from unidentified direction hits the polling place where the wife of Sakur Tan situated and so the tension flared up. Voting was disturbed but no casualty was reported. As of late evening that day, Samir Tan (son of Governor Tan) is leading on the mayoralty post against incumbent mayor Najib Maldisa. (Tan-Maldisa has long standing clan conflict/Feud – rooted also by political violence – when allegedly Sakur Tan ordered to kill the brother of Najib Maldisa then a vice governor of Sulu.) Potential eruption of armed conflict was on high level. Most of the neighboring barangay of Maldisa’s area evacuated the place.\n\nTupay Loong, a candidate for Congressman in first district under the ticket of Lakas Kampi CMD of Sakur Tan, slapped his elder brother Hussin Loong who ran for mayor in Parang under Arbison’s party. Sources disclosed that Hussin Loong suffered from nose bleed. Elections in the municipality was successfully ended with no armed violence recorded, and Sakur Tan got the highest casted vote (Benjamin Loong is a party mate of Arbison overruled by Tupay as his elder brother, he only delivered less than 10% of votes out  of 20,000 registered voters in Parang).\n\nOmar municipality is one of the controlled municipalities of Arbison. A 6:00pm report stated that Hadji Ahamad (incumbent mayor) managed to deliver 95% of total votes to Arbison. A fist fight was also recorded in the municipality. The proclamation of winning candidates was held in the municipal hall with no resistance from other candidates.\n\nSome clustered precincts in Indanan declared failure of elections at the same time, and one PCOS machine was destroyed by brother of mayoralty candidate Hussin Ahajan in Barangay Bunot. Two other clustered precincts were not opened because of violence possibility, so the BEI decided to close and declared failure of election. No proclamation was made till the time the report was submitted. Fortunately no armed violence was recorded, except for isolated fist fights.\n\nPeaceful election was observed in all barangays in Jolo. No untoward incidents were reported and Mayor Amin was officially proclaimed.","verified":"YES","longitude":121.839181,"id":"a64ee8ew6o7y","location":"Tongkil, Sulu","incident date":"6/1/2010 1:25"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[121.839181,6.020419]}},{"properties":{"latitude":14.954722,"category":"8.

One of the letters dated April 26, 2010 contains the following message:  “It seems that you are not truthful and serious in serving the public.  We found out that you continue your alliance with the enemies of democracy, progress and peace-the CPP-NPA-NDF and its Partylists.  Your alliance with them is an admission that you are one of them who adheres to the non sense of communism.  WITH THIS LETTER IS A BLACK RIBBON THAT WILL REMIND YOU THAT YOUR LIFE, AS WELL AS YOUR FAMILY, IS ONLY A PRIVILEGE.  IF DEATH BECOMES YOU, MAY YOU REST IN PEACE.”  It can be recalled that this is exactly the content of the letter received by KABATAAN Partylist 3rd nominee Atty. Katrina Castillo and the subject of UA No: 2010-04-03.\n\nThe second letter suggests that Jory Porquia ignored the warning by continuing his alliance with the CPP-NPA and its Partylists, thus he is now considered an enemy of democracy, and it ended with the veiled threat of “the rest is up to us.”\n\nThe MAKABAYAN Coalition strongly believes that the threat and intimidation of its members and volunteers in several parts of the country are state-sponsored as evidenced by the discovery of a vehicle with plate number PJF 185, used by the people distributing black propaganda materials against the coalition and its members in Davao City in Mindanao, as registered under the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency or NICA, which is headed by National Security Adviser and presently the Secretary of National Defense, Mr. Norberto Gonzales.","verified":"YES","longitude":122.561313,"id":"a64ee8rrpeku","location":"Brgy.

Section 2 (4), Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution provides: No officer or employee in the civil service shall engage, directly or indirectly, in any electioneering or partisan political activity.\n\nHe also said that the Civil Service laws implement this constitutional ban by stating that civil service officers and employees cannot engage in any partisan political activity except to vote. Section 55, Chapter 7, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 provides: Political Activity. — No officer or employee in the Civil Service including members of the Armed Forces, shall engage directly or indirectly in any partisan political activity or take part in any election except to vote nor shall he use his official authority or influence to coerce the political activity of any other person or body.\n\nLikewise, the Omnibus Election Code penalizes civil service officers and employees who engage in any partisan political activity except to vote. Section 261 (i) of the Omnibus Election Code states: Prohibited Acts. — The following shall be guilty of an election offense: (i) Intervention of public officers and employees. — Any officer or employee in the civil service, except those holding political offices; any officer, employee, or member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, or any police force, special forces, home defense forces, barangay self-defense units and all other para-military units that now exist or which may hereafter be organized who, directly or indirectly, intervenes in any election campaign or engages in any partisan political activity, except to vote or to preserve public order, if he is a peace officer.\n\n\"The operation is called 'Zero Campaign' which clearly means that the AFP is plotting to ensure that we get zero votes in the provinces. Among the areas where the 'Zero Campaign' is already being implemented are Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Lanao del Norte and some parts of Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental and Agusan del Sur,\" Ocampo said.\n\nOcampo said that the attempts of the AFP to demonize him and undermine his chances to win in the senatorial elections were not surprising. \"But we will not take this sitting down. We will work hard to frustrate these military operations that aim to stop progressive candidates from winning in the polls. In the meantime, the Comelec should take immediate action and lay initiate sanctions against the AFP,\" he said. #","verified":"YES","longitude":125.608921,"id":"a64ee8lah0oi","location":"Davao City","incident date":"4/12/2010 1:26"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[125.608921,7.08586]}},{"properties":{"latitude":14.583333,"category":", ,","incident title":"Staff of Antipolo Rep.

He was grazed when a bullet hit his jacket.\n\nGatlabayan is challenging incumbent Mayor Danilo Leyble for the mayoralty post.\n\nAccording to Gatlabayan, he and his staff noticed that some men were removing his campaign posters at around about 3 a.m. and policemen nearby were not doing anything to stop them, the report said.\n\nThe policemen covered their faces and removed their nameplates when Gatlabayan’s staff approached them.\n\nLater in the day, Gatlabayan’s staff went to the congressman’s plastic factory after receiving reports that his posters and streamers were being removed from the area.\n\nOn their way to the factory, they noticed that a streamer was being taken down at a nearby school. Shooting erupted when Gatlabayan’s staff tried to stop the men from removing the streamer, and Traseño was wounded in the incident. The suspects fled the scene.\n\nGatlabayan’s staff was reportedly refused entry when they tried to report the incident at the Antipolo City police station. They also noticed that the vehicle the suspects used was parked near the police station, but when questioned, the police accused the the congressman's staff of destroying the police vehicles instead, the report said.\n\nGatlabayan is considering the filing of charges against Antipolo City policemen, particularly those who supposedly protected the men taking down his campaign posters.\n\nIn a separate interview on Balitanghali, Philippine National Police spokesperson Chief Supt.
