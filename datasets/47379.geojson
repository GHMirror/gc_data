It is one of the New Saigoku Pilgrimage of 33 Temples, which was newly selected based on Prince Shotoku’s idea of “harmony” as a priority over all other virtues. In 724, after the death of the prince, the emperor Shomu ordered to build a temple to repose the soul of Prince Shotoku. The temple was burned down by the attack of Nobunaga Oda during the Warring States period, but it was rebuilt by Hideyoshi Toyotomi. If you go up the stone steps, you will see the South Gate. Walk through the gate, and then you will see the houtou (a treasure pagoda), the main hall, and the Shoryo-den (a memorial hall of Prince Shotoku) on your left. In the back of the precinct is the Prince Shotoku’s tomb. Shoryo-den is a designated Important Cultural Property. The principal image worshipped inside is said to be Prince Shotoku’s life-size statue when he was 16. It is said to have been placed in the ancient Imperial Palace in Kyoto but donated to this temple by the emperor Gotoba in 1187. Around the temple there are a lot of places associated with Prince Shotoku. You will be impressed by the length of the history all through which people have paid respect for the Prince. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbvemwdcb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[135.639668,34.518648]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gohyaku Rakan","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\">Souteelak</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_local_history_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is by far my favorite place in Tono. Several hundred years ago a monk took it upon himself to carve 500 reliefs of Buddhist disciples onto large rocks on this mountainside. Around 380 still remain, eroded over the centuries and covered in moss.

I actually prefer this one because since it is not well-known, you will have a more private and personal experience. Konsei-sama is apparently a regional animist (with some connections to Shinto) deity that oversees many aspects of life--particularly fertility (it\\'s hard not to notice it\\'s clearly-phallic shape). It is said that housewives that scrub Konsei-sama with their kitchen scours will have their back pains relieved.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbv6ep1ux"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[141.517853737,39.3205125359]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Wax Bar","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\">Souteelak</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Woot woot!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbvfalph1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.376440763,47.6721210259]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tono Furusato Village","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\">Souteelak</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> A remade classic-style example of how villages in Tono used to look like.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbv88ixow"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[141.54266417,39.3959849093]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tono Youth Hostel","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\" href=\"http://souteelak.wordpress.com\">Souteelak</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 岩手県遠野市土淵町土淵１３－３９－５Run by the sweetest older couple ever!
