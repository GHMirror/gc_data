Any excess funds from the non-profit operation are donated to the Salvation Army. Includes several rare machines like Impacto (from Spain, only two known to exist), Black Gold (only one known to exist), and Pinball Circus (prototype only). [Steven F. Scharff, 03/05/2007]\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada - Pinball Hall of Fame\n\nVegas resident Tim Arnold has been collecting vintage pinball machines for years, in hopes of eventually creating a museum. Since 2006, the Pinball Hall of Fame is the first step in creating that museum. Housed in a strip mall off the strip, the Hall of Fame has a small part of Tim\\'s collection available for play at their original prices.
