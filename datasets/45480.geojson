This is where more than six hundred converts were baptised into the faith in the pond on the farm. John and his wife Jane were originally members of the United Brethren and they were introduced to the Mormon faith by Wilford Woodruff, who had come across to England from America. Wilford arrived at Worcester in a horse-drawn carriage and then he walked the fourteen miles or so to the farm at Castle Frome, to talk with John and Jane Benbow.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gs6uf8z8ak"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.48857,52.12653]}},{"properties":{"name":"Briarfield","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=545232791\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=545232791\">Ziksby</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/briarfield_.JPG\">home of the Pettifor family during the period 1925-1960<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gs6ubg0a90"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.31854,52.11188]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gadfield Elm Mormon Chapel","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=545232791\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=545232791\">Ziksby</a>Gadfield Elm Chapel, in Worcestershire, was of great significance in the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the British Isles, acting as the focal point of Church activity for thousands of Latter-day Saints until the majority emigrated to the USA to fulfil their dream of building a new Zion in the United States of America. In 1840 President Brigham Young preached at Gadfield Elm which, at the time, was the only Latter-day Saint chapel in the world. \r\n\r\nThe chapel was built in 1836 by a fundamentalist Christian group, the United Brethren, and was deeded to Wilford Woodruff, on behalf of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1840 by John Benbow and Thomas Kington. \r\n\r\nAlmost the entire congregation of the United Brethren joined the church by baptism in 1840.  As the new converts heeded the call to gather to Zion the building became redundant and was sold, with the proceeds being used to assist with the emigration of the Saints. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gs6u5tm68j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.29207,51.97893]}},{"properties":{"name":"Herefordshire Beacon","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=545232791\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=545232791\">Ziksby</a>From Brigham Young\\'s Diary .....\r\n20 May 1840 -- Brothers Woodruff, Richards and myself went on to the top of the Herefordshire Beacon, where, after prayer, we held a council and agreed, that, since we had obtained £250 from Brother John Benbow, and £100 from Brother Kington, towards publishing the Book of Mormon and Hymn Book, I should repair immediately to Manchester, and join the brethren appointed with me as a committee, and publish 300 copies of the Hymn Book without delay.
