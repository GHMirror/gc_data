The bugle will be flying a kite (if permitted). In the meantime, some practice will be necessary. In other kite-related news, this blog post by M Johnson demonstrates attaching a mobile phone to a kite, and videoing the results! The bugle feels that this shows a high degree of trust in both the strength of the mobile phone, and skill of the kite flier… Not sure my “controlled landings” would be up to this…\n\nAriel kite photography has been a big thing on the web for a while- I remember reading about someone who built a camera timer based on an ice-cube and an elastic band - when the kite is in the air, the ice-cube melts, forcing a piece of wood to press the shutter on the camera (this back in 1999, before mobile phones and digital cameras were cheap as Blackheath fish &amp; chips). Just found the page - it’s a bit dusty, but if you blow on it a bit, you should be able to find it behind this link.\n\nIf anyone has any examples of Blackheath ariel photography, please let me know!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6oggvvimtur"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.00729560852051,51.4693009897]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blackheath Farmers Market","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\">Blackheathbugle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> The Blackheath Farmers Market is held every Sunday from 10am-2pm in Blackheath Station Car Park. There are delicious breads (the rosemary bread is the best), a weird and wonderful mushroom stall, general fresh veg stalls, eggs, butter, yoghurt, milk, chickens - all ready to cook and be eaten.

This seems to be its default state whenever I try to go there. However, if you can remember when it is open (not Mondays, Wednesdays or Sundays), it can be much more use than its small size might suggest:\n\nThe Death of Grass by John ChristopherI recently became interested in a book called “The Death of Grass” by John Christopher. It is out of print, and was recommended on a literary blog called The Age of Uncertainty. I looked on abebooks.co.uk, as this is usually the best place to find obscure books cheaply. They wanted £20 for a paperback, or £60 for the hardback version!\n\nSo then I went to the Lewisham Library page, and looked up the book using their online catalogue search. My book appeared! I reserved it online, and a few days later I received a note through the post (how quaint) saying that it was ready for collection - all for the princely sum of 50p! So Blackheath’s library is bigger than it may appear. It’s a great book incidentally - about the world’s food supplies being wiped out by a virus that attacks all forms of grass (an online version is here).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6oggvjbop10"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.00953525304794,51.4660126604]}},{"properties":{"name":"Blue Plaques in Blackheath - Arthur Eddington","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\">Blackheathbugle</a>This plaque belongs to Arthur Eddington.\n\nEddington was a mathematician and astronomer.

It was the site of the GPO Film Unit, where the film Night Mail was made:\n\nAdblock\n\nBearing in mind this was made in 1936, and was a big success, it must have been an exciting place to work.

There would be a number of things you’d have to consider… How would you store your DVDs so that your customers could find them easily? Would you perhaps take the easy way out, and arrange them by title? Or would you go the Prime Time route of arranging them by actor, unless the director is more famous, in which case arrange by director. Unless they’re a new release in which case they’ll be at the front of the shop… On the left if they’re cheesy blockbusters, and on the right if they’re arty.\n\nHow would you publicise your shop? Maybe put some posters in the window? Some tempting images of hollywood starlets perhaps? Or some classic film posters from a bygone age? Surely if you had interestingly curved glass display windows you’d put something there… Perhaps you’d choose to stick some bright plastic letters to the glass saying “MASSIVE VHS CLEAROUT”, and leave it at that (don’t look confused - you know what VHS is… they were those tapes the size of buses that you used to tape Eldorado on).\n\nThe really odd thing about the shop is this labyrinthine lower level full to the brim with dusty VHS tapes. Why don’t they just get rid of them? Open a bar down there or something. I have never seen anyone leave that shop with anything other than a DVD in their hand.\n\nAnd then, there is the dispute. The angry sign apologising for the lack of heating… Something to do with the chip shop next door, and air vents… Anyway, I quite like it chilly… With all that velvet it starts to feel like part of a David Lynch movie.\n\nThey don’t take credit cards - the entire place seems to run on cash only. It looks like the sort of place where you should be allowed to smoke. They ask for a credit card before allowing you to take films out, which seems a bit disingenuous.\n\nThey do have tons of great films though. And a wide variety of shop assistants - some who make terrible recommendations, and some who look mockingly at the terrible films the customers choose. It’s more atmospheric than lovefilm, and you don’t get the feeling that they’re always giving you the last item on your list (probably becuase they can’t see your list - if they did, they’d just laugh at it).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6oggvp6hxje"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.00935822725296,51.4656734544]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Alexandra Assembly Rooms and Baths","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\">Blackheathbugle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Picked up a leaflet about Blackheath yesterday, which claimed that the Lloyds TSB building in Blackheath used to be a public bath, and assembly rooms. So I did a check in The Times Newspaper Archives (free to access using your library pass number), and sure enough, found this announcement on Page 18 of The Times April 7th, 1864:\n\n    Valuable Leasehold Investment.\n\n    Messrs. Ventom and Clarke will sell by auction, in three lots, at the Mart on Wednesday, April 27, by order of the Mortgagee, the following valuable leasehold property, viz. :- Lot 1. The Alexandra Assembly Rooms and Baths, Blackheath, facing the Railway Station - a handsome, modern building, lately erected in the most substantial and complete manner, comprising a splendid swimming and plunging bath, 66 by 30; also a large room fitted with three separate hot-water baths and dressing rooms, magnificent assembly room, 66 by 30, around two sides of which is a commodious gallery, small hall and ante-rooms, a reading room, and, in addition, is a kitchen, numerous bed and ante rooms and domestic offices. The above is held on lease for a period of 90 years, at a ground rent of £25 per annum, and is let to a highly respectable tenant at the exceedingly low rent of £425 per annum, on an agreement for a lease of 7, 14, 21, or 23 years.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6oggvnkxy53"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.00944137573242,51.4652791034]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Bookshop on the Heah","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\">Blackheathbugle</a>“The Bookshop on the Heath“, a wonderful place to browse, full of treasures, including a 1920s illustrated edition of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (for some huge price)… They also have a good selection of paperbacks outside too, as well as local antique maps which I have covered before.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6oggvm74nlw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.00698983669281,51.4671221638]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Case of the Disappearing Pond","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://blackheathbugle.wordpress.com/\">Blackheathbugle</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/05/0/pond_old.jpg\">We have an old map of Blackheath, from 1895, (probably bought from the wonderful bookshop on the edge of the common), which clearly shows a pond, adjacent to Pond Road, in the bottom right corner.

After walking past lots of very big houses, eventually I found this:\n\nWhere the pond used to be in Blackheath\n\nLook at the way the trees appear to have sunk into the ground. A dead giveaway.\n\nAnd:\n\nThe curve of the path around what used to be a pond in Blackheath\n\nNote the curve of the path - running in a big circle around the green.
