When an attempt is made\r\nto kill the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar (Kenneth Williams) at a\r\nRoman temple, Horsa kills Caesar's enemies, but Hengist gets all\r\nthe credit, and is made Caesar's bodyguard. Meanwhile, Mark Antony\r\n(Sid James), Caesar's best friend, becomes besotted with the\r\nEgyptian Queen Cleopatra (Amanda Barrie), but the only way to\r\nachieve his heart's desire is to kill Caesar and Hengist.\r\nBackground Notes \r\nKenneth Williams' line as Caesar, in fear of his life before the\r\nconspirators and their drawn swords, is frequently voted among the\r\nfunniest lines in British comedy. It has also been voted the\r\nall-time funniest one-liner in a film.\r\nIn one scene at Caesar's palace, when Mark Antony demands\r\nHengist to describe his 'fight' with the conspirators, he\r\naccidentally chops the arms off a statue of the goddess, Venus,\r\napparently creating the Venus de Milo in doing so.\r\nAt one point, in a vision of the future, we see Caesar stabbed\r\nwith a dagger, and he says \"Is this a dagger I see before me?\" This\r\nis a quote from Shakespeare, but is actually spoken by Macbeth.\r\nThe costumes and sets used in the film were actually taken from\r\nCleopatra starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.\r\nThe film's credits make ironic reference to the scant regard\r\npaid to historical accuracy.

The siding adjacent to the\r\narrival platform was equipped with ground frame points to release\r\nan arriving train engine.\r\nThe station is on the north\r\nbank of the River Avon, and trains crossed a bridge immediately\r\noutside it. The locomotive shed was about half a mile from the\r\nstation to the north side of the main tracks. The goods yard was on\r\nthe opposite side of the tracks from this.\r\nThe Midland Railway's Bath\r\nbranch had opened in 1869, but the river Avon bridge and the new\r\nstation were not ready, so for a year the terminus was at a\r\ntemporary station to the west of the river.\r\nThe Somerset &amp; Dorset\r\nRailway\r\nWhen the Somerset and Dorset\r\nRailway completed its Bath extension line in 1874, they connected\r\ninto the Midland line at Bath Junction, a half mile outside the\r\nstation, and in friendly co-operation with the Midland company they\r\nused the station. This created considerable additional through\r\ntraffic, and as well as heavy volumes of freight, through passenger\r\njourneys from the Midlands to the South Coast were created. Through\r\ntrains had to reverse at Bath, and the most famous of these was the\r\nnamed the Pines Express from Manchester (and at times other\r\nnorthern originating points) to Bournemouth West. Both the Midland\r\nRailway and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway opened locomotive\r\ndepots near the station on the west side of the River Avon. The\r\nMidland Depot opened in 1869 and the SDJR in 1874. Both closed in\r\nMarch 1966.\r\nQueen Square station was\r\noperated by the Midland Railway. At the grouping it passed to the\r\nLondon, Midland and Scottish Railway. For almost all of its life,\r\nit was usually referred to as Bath Queen Square station, after the\r\nprestigious square about a quarter of a mile away. It became Bath\r\nGreen Park under British Railways in 1954, and still bears that\r\nname today.\r\nParts of the distinctive glass\r\nroof were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the\r\nglazing was not re-instated during railway usage after the\r\nwar.\r\nThe atmosphere of the station\r\nwas always powerfully nostalgic, and at most times of the day a\r\nshort local train could be seen simmering in the platform waiting\r\nfor departure time. On summer Saturdays the station became very\r\nbusy, passing numerous holiday trains between northern towns and\r\nBournemouth; all of them had to be reversed in the\r\nstation.\r\nOrdinary services were local\r\nMidland trains to Bristol St Philips and Clifton Down, later to\r\nBristol Temple Meads, and S&amp;D trains to Templecombe and\r\nbeyond.\r\n \r\n<img src=\"http://i231.photobucket.com/albums/ee31/J9PUR/Bath_Green_Park_Station_interior_-_geographorguk_-_1770316-1.jpg\"> \r\nCirca\r\n1962\r\nClosure\r\nFollowing the Beeching Report,\r\npassenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last goods train ran in\r\n1971.

Two fully-bound print editions of the OED have been published under its current name, in 1928 and 1989; as of December 2008 the dictionary's current editors have completed a fourth of the third edition.\r\nDespite its impressive size, the OED is neither the world's largest nor earliest dictionary. The Dutch dictionary Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal, which has similar aims to the OED, is the largest and it took twice as long to complete. The earliest large dictionary is the Grimm brothers' dictionary of the German language, begun in 1838 and completed in 1961. The first edition of the Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca, which is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern European language (Italian), was published in 1612; the first edition of Dictionnaire de l'Académie française dates from 1694. The first edition of the official dictionary of Spanish, the Diccionario de la lengua española (produced, edited, and published by the Real Academia Española) was published in 1780. The Kangxi dictionary of Chinese published even earlier, in 1716.\r\n\r\nHowever, none of these other dictionaries has had as broad a cultural impact as the OED.

Today it has two main imprints: Oxford University Press, under which the bulk of its reference, educational, and scholarly publications appear, and the Clarendon Press, which is its \"prestige\" scholarly imprint.

You can start this ring\r\nfrom several places; the Wilton/Water Ditchampton end of Grovely,\r\nWishford and Barford St Martin but if you want to get the steepest\r\nhill climbing over early, start from Wishford. There are plenty of\r\nplaces for on road parking at Wishford.

Sinister goings on occurred here nearly 300 years\r\nback with the Handsel Sisters being murdered in the woods and\r\nthere’s yet another worrying story concerning the Burcombe\r\nWoodsman. According to various Paranormal Teams, the effects can\r\nstill be felt today whilst walking in this part of Grovely Woods;\r\nso look behind you. You should have no problems in daylight; these\r\nwoods and the surrounding well walked countryside are beautiful,\r\nfilled with interesting history, wild animals, fauna and\r\nflora.</b>\r\nWhichever route you take whilst doing the series you will reach\r\nthe trees famed in the Handsel Sisters Story. They were 4 sisters\r\nof Danish origin who lived in the Wilton area. Unfortunately for\r\nthem a strong outbreak of smallpox erupted in 1737 in Wilton,\r\nclaiming 136 lives. The local people became convinced the Hansel\r\nsisters were responsible for the deaths and accused them of\r\nwitchcraft and an alliance with the devil. Without an official\r\nhearing the sisters were marched to Grovely and were murdered by\r\nbeing bludgeoned over the head. Each was buried in the woods a\r\nlittle way apart from each other so that they could not conspire\r\nagainst their murderers.\r\nWhilst doing these caches, if you’re observant, you will\r\nsee four incredibly ancient, gnarled beech trees, three of them\r\nabout 50 yds to the South of the Roman Road, the other I believe is\r\na little closer to Wilton on the other side of the road a similar\r\ndistance into the woods. There are two theories regarding these\r\ntrees, one being they were planted to mark the sisters’\r\ngraves. The other more worrying theory is that the trees\r\nmysteriously grew on top the unmarked graves to remind the locals\r\nof their dreadful deed. Since the atrocity many sightings of the\r\nsisters have been reported over the years. I’m told there is\r\na hollow at the back of the largest tree where people leave\r\nofferings for the Handsel sisters. Removal of such will cause\r\ndisastrous consequences for the perpetrators. For your safety no\r\ncache is hidden within those 4 beech trees.\r\nFor further information on Grovely, the Handsel Sisters and the\r\nBurcombe Woodsman <a href=\"http://www.twilightshadowsparanormal.com/grovelywoods.html\">visit\r\nthis webpage</a>.\r\nYet more information is to be found at<a href=\"http://Members.lycos.co.uk/grovelywoodghosts/\">visit this\r\nwebpage</a>\r\nDuring your walk you will pass through some gates in a few\r\nplaces, including one that’s a stretched barbwire type, a\r\nlittle strength required, please ensure you close these gates\r\ncorrectly as, although not always obvious there are usually cows or\r\nsheep in the associated fields.\r\nAll caches are placed on or within a few feet of public\r\nfootpaths, bridleways, etc. You will not need to walk deep into the\r\nwoods, remember game shooting starts on Oct 1st and it would be\r\nunadvisible for anyone to be wandering about well off the paths at\r\nsuch times. You should not need to climb fences or even stiles ;\r\nthis is all legal as it’s a public right of way but be\r\ncareful if cattle or sheep are grazing. Please be very careful if\r\nyou have children and dogs along.\r\nPlease note many of the difficulty ratings for this ring have\r\nbeen adjusted due to poor GPS reception under the tree cover. If\r\nyou use the hint generally you can knock 1 off the rating.\r\nWe hope you enjoy your visit and have success with the caches.\r\nPlease don’t let the stories above worry you, Rosie and I are\r\nvery frequent visitors to these woods and we have yet to see a\r\nghost there, just Deer, foxes and other wild animals, also plenty\r\nof unusual butterflies and birds; it’s a great place.

What the\r\npenalty is for not having a permit I do not know but better to be\r\nsafe than sorry.

Later there was a monastery at Westbury, probably initially a secular one, with married clergy. This changed towards the end of the 10th century when Oswald of Worcester, in whose diocese the monastery lay, sent a party of 12 monks to follow more stringent rules at the Westbury monastery.\r\nThe current Church of the Holy Trinity dates from 1194 (although there has been a place of worship on the site since 717), with an early 13th century nave and aisles, and 15th century chancel, chapels and tower.

It opened in September 2008, after a ten year planning and building project costing £500 million\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe original chosen name 'Merchants Quarter' came under criticism due to its associations to the slave trade. The name of Cabot was chosen following a public vote taken in November 2007, and commemorates John Cabot, an Italian explorer who is closely associated with Bristol. Work began on the site in September 2005, following planning approval in December 2003. Cabot Circus comprises three multi-level pedestrianised streets, with apartment block areas. Its focal point, The Circus, has a large glass-panelled roof.

A year later and the line had stretched to Bristol. For all his engineering expertise Brunel's station design seem to have left something to be desired as all the trains stopping at the station had to cross the tracks of the down through trains.\r\n\r\nThe original station was replaced in 1860 and can still be seen if you approach from the town centre - it's the bit with the clock tower. The rest of the station was hugely revamped in 1989 with the completion of the Brunel shopping arcade which has a number of small outlets including Boots the chemist, WH Smith and, most recently, a Marks and Spencer food outlet.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Wikipedia entry T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) lost his original draft of his book \"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" at the station when he left his briefcase behind whilst changing trains at Reading.\r\n\r\nAlso according to the Wikipedia entry Reading station had a passenger throughput last year of 13.5 million. No wonder it gets a bit crowded in the rush hours.\r\n\r\nTo find the cache use the exit near the M&amp;S unit. You don't need to cross any roads.

He was a fascinating character but we are interested\r\nin the plinth on this occasion. The plinth is made of a very hard\r\nrock.It was formed when different types of rock melted and formed a\r\nnew rock when the molten rock crystallised. It has a granular\r\nstructure contain many grains. If you look closely you will see\r\nthree different materials making up the stone. There is also a dark\r\nmark on the West Face of the plinth on the left hand side near the\r\nwords \"Earl Beaconsfield” which is part of the original rock\r\nwhich did not melt when the rock was formed.\r\nThe current theory of how such a rock is formed as follows.\r\nBelow the surface of the earth on which we walked lies molten rock\r\nmagna. Floating on this sea of magna are plates of solid rock.They\r\nare the tectonic plates which are in constant movement . Where the\r\nplates meet one plate will slide on top of another plate forcing it\r\ndown into the sea of magna. The downward pressure causes some of\r\nthe molten magna to swell up in bubbles and melt some of the rock\r\nabove.\r\nThe molten rock under great pressure from the solid plate above\r\ncools slowly to form large crystals. Not all the original rock\r\nmelts and fragments of it remain in the rock which gives a clue to\r\nhow this rock formed. At a later date the newly formed crystals of\r\nrock are forced up and expand as they are under less pressure. This\r\ntwo stage process forms the rock forming the plinth. There are\r\nother theories but for the purpose of logging the rock you must\r\nanswer the following five questions.\r\n1) Name the type of stone\r\n2) Describe the three materials making up the rock and if\r\npossible give their names though this is not essential\r\n3) Give me the name given by stone masons to the dark patch\r\nfound in this rock or alternatively the scientific names for these\r\npatches of the original rock.\r\n4) Look at the Dark Patch. Is the shape of it rounded or\r\nangular. Can you give a reason for its shape?\r\n5) Look at five of the rectangular crystals in the stone.\r\nMeasure their length, average their size and then state whether the\r\nrock is coarse, medium, or fine grained using the following scale\r\ncoarse crystals over 5mm in length, medium crystals between 1-5 mm\r\nin length , or fine crystal less than 1mm in length .\r\nTo claim this earthcache as a find please post a photo of the\r\nlocation (preferably you with your GPS - with your hand pointing to\r\nthe dark patch- or just your GPS at the location) and send me an\r\nemail with the answers to the five questions, your caching name (eg\r\nLoony Londo) and your email address through my profile.\r\nAs soon as you receive my confirmation, you can log this cache\r\nas a find and upload your picture.

Working Street also appeared in “Voyage of the Damned”, it is the point where The Doctor (David Tennent) and Astrid Peth (Kylie Minogue) spoke to the paper seller (Bernard Cribbins).  If you go down the High Street Arcade, you’ll see the spot which appeared in “Ghost Machine”.

The area of Old Portsmouth used to be surrounded by defencive fortifications including walls, bastions, a moat and tall triangular constructions known as ravelins.\r\n\r\nRavelins were located beyond the city wall. Their initial function was as a fortification, however, if and when overrun, defenders could fall back and fire down into the ravelin from the wall above. The triangular shape of the ravelin would force a wave of attackers to divide before getting to the city wall.\r\n\r\nDuring the 19th century the fortifications were demolished, the site became the city's army garrison headquarters. Ravelin House, Town Mount and Gun House were built, being used to house senior army officers.\r\n\r\nThe army left the site in the 1960's and the land was transferred in 1969 to Portsmouth Polytechnic, which later became the University of Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nIn order to be accessible at all times, the cache is located on the perimeter of the park and can be retrieved directly from the pavement.\r\n\r\nPlease remember to bring your own pen or pencil in case there isn't one in the cache at the time of your visit.

Originally the Concert Hall was the Prince of Wales' stables\r\nwith the Corn Exchange being a riding school. William Porden\r\ndesigned the new stables and riding school for the Prince. Inspired\r\nby water colour pictures of India he created an incredible building\r\nin the Indo-Saracenic style with a vast glass dome (24 metres in\r\ndiameter and 19 metres high) covering the main hall. Many\r\npessimists predicted that this daring construction would collapse\r\nonce the scaffolding was removed. The stables were converted to a\r\nConcert Hall around 1860. Since this time the Corn Exchange and\r\nConcert Hall have gone through many different guises with the\r\nlatest renovation of the Concert Hall taking place in 2001/2 and\r\ncosting £22m. This rebirth was ushered in with the help of the\r\nLondon Philharmonic Orchestra, Courtney Pine, Nigel Kennedy and\r\nFatboy Slim (amongst others).

The liquid lead solidifies as it falls and by surface tension forms tiny spherical balls. The partially cooled balls are caught at the floor of the tower in a water-filled basin. The now fully cooled balls are checked for roundness and sorted by size; those that are \"out of round\" are remelted. A slightly inclined table is used for checking roundness.To make larger shot sizes, a copper sieve with larger holes is used. However, the maximum size is limited by the height of the tower, because larger shot sizes must fall farther to cool. A polishing with a slight amount of graphite is necessary for lubrication and to prevent oxidation.\r\nHistory\r\nThe process was invented by William Watts of Bristol, UK, and patented in the late 18th century.[1] Watts extended his house in Redcliffe, Bristol to build the first shot tower in 1782.\r\nThe tower was Designed by E.N. Underwood and Partners (Structural Engineers) for the Sheldon Bush and Patent Shot Company. \r\nIt is an enforced concrete structure of a concave bilateral planned form and has vertically set slit windows in the tower. Its twelve sided top has a central band of vertically set windows with a band of ventilation slits beneath.\r\n\r\nThe tower is a direct descendent of the first lead shot tower to be built, in 1782, by William Watts who invented the tower process of lead shot manufacture. Watts original tower survived in Bristol until 1968 when it was demolished as part of road widening scheme. The Cheese Lane Tower is its replacement, built for the same company for use in the same process. It is a unique 20th century shot tower and one of only 3 shot towers of any period now surviving in England.\r\n\r\nThe cache is so small it only has room for a teeny log scroll, as with all urban hides please take care and use stealth whilst searching and please make sure you replace exactly as found\r\n\r\nEnjoy the cache \r\n\r\nBristol Blues Brother\r\n\r\n* Congratulations to The Evil Poles for being FTF *","gc_num":"GC1R265","gc_placer":"bristolbluesbrother","gc_cont_icon":"micro","gc_issues":"&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;This cache has been archived.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;","gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmzp8i84"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.584917,51.452867]}},{"properties":{"name":"SideTracked-Weymouth","timestamp":{"end_time":"2008/05/05 04:00:00 -0400","original":"2008-05-05T07:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2008/05/05 03:00:00 -0400"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1","gc_placer_id":465506,"gc_name":"SideTracked-Weymouth","gc_diff_stars":"stars2","gc_short_desc":"A cache and dash placed a close to Weymouth railway station.","gc_long_desc":"The original station was opened in 1857, its use shared between the Great Western Railway and the London &amp; South Western Railway.

For centuries this natural phenomenon has attracted visitors to Bath, and led to a unique historic urban environment around the springs.","gc_long_desc":"The Springs gave Bath 2,000 years of history, beautiful Georgian architecture and Bath becoming the UK’s first World Heritage City.  The thermal waters rise from a depth of about 3000m at a rate l.l million litres/day and a constant temperature of 46.5C. The waters originated as rainwater which fell on the Mendip Hills between 20— 80,000 years ago. They reach the surface in three places in the city centre, and baths have been built over each one.  The water is heated by geothermal action and these springs in Bath emerge at the highest temperature in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons and Normans made use of the thermal waters for curative purposes.  By the late 16th century there were baths attracting the poor and leprous to the city’s hospitals and almshouses in search of healing and relief from discomfort. Visits to the city’s baths by members of the royal family and the court during the 17th century helped establish Bath as a fashionable watering place.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pump Rooms\" were the Victorians' addition to the Roman Baths. Bath was built by the Romans around its hot spring waters around 2,000 years ago. The Victorians re-discovered the Roman Baths and they have since been restored to a magnificent condition. \r\n\r\nIn order to find this cache you will need a picture at this location and to answer a question.  You must physically visit this location to log this cache. Please follow the following instructions at the location:\r\n1. Take a photograph of the entrance to the Roman Baths or Pump Rooms (opposite side of the building to the coordinates) including your GPS in the photo (do not use a photo which includes the answer to the following question).\r\n2.  Find out the answer to these questions: go to the above coordinates and find the stone wall plaque in the side street a) What does the plaque say about the first use of these Hot Springs? b) Adjacent to the plaque there is a shorter wall topped by a stone balustrade. This wall runs alongside the main bath, estimate its length to tell me the length of the Roman bath inside. (You may find your GPS is a useful tool for this measurement).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you wish to log a find for this cache then please follow the following instructions: \r\n1.  Send us your answer to the above questions.  To do this, click the link for our name above “The Wombles” and then the link marked “Send message”.

Therefore a subscription was raised to enable the building and endowment of the church.  \r\n\r\nWith the money raised, half an acre of ground was acquired and conveyed by deed into the possession of the  Registrar of the Bishop’s Court at Wells.  \r\n\r\nThis church, which was to be called Christ Church was built in the years 1817 and 1818, and was consecrated September 15, 1818. The expense of building it, including quarrying stones, carriage, and all incidentals, was about £3,900 and The Rev. Joseph Algar, M. A. at that time Curate of Frome, was nominated Minister of the said Church by the Rev. Charles Phillott, M. A.

Originally the cathedral had no tower or spire,\r\nbut there was a free-standing belltower nearby, near the co-ords of\r\nthis cache. The tower and the world-famous spire, which is the\r\ntallest medieval spire in Europe at 404 feet (128 metres), were\r\nadded around 1300 to 1320.\r\nThe original city and cathedral of Salisbury were at Old Sarum,\r\njust north of the present city. There was friction between the\r\nmilitary in the city and the clergy, however, and this led\r\neventually to the building of the new cathedral on the present\r\nsite. There is a story, probably apocryphal, that the site for the\r\nnew cathedral was chosen by having an archer fire an arrow from Old\r\nSarum, and the cathedral was built where the arrow landed.

The best option may be a paying car park,\r\nof which there are quite a few within easy walking distance.\r\nThe approach to this cache from all the nearest car parks is\r\npaved and level, and suitable for pushchairs, buggies and\r\nwheelchairs. Note though that the final few yards is grass, which\r\nmay sometimes be soft.

One version is that a giant\r\ncalled Vincent and his brother Goram both wanted to marry a\r\nbeautiful woman called Avona. Not being able to choose between\r\nthem, Avona challenged the brothers to drain a lake which lay over\r\nBristol. Vincent chose to cut a channel through the limestone hills\r\nnear Clifton, while Goram began to cut a channel through Henbury.\r\nUnfortunately for Goram, he drank one too many beers while he was\r\nworking and fell asleep, leaving Vincent to finish his channel\r\nfirst, drain the lake and so win Avona.\r\nWhen Goram woke up, he was so distraught at having lost out to his\r\nbrother, he stamped his foot in anger and in the process created\r\nanother nearby geological feature in Henbury Gorge called the\r\nGiant’s Footprint. Goram then drowned himself in the Severn\r\nEstuary. The islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm are supposedly the\r\nremains of his head and shoulder. <b>The Geology:</b>\r\nAlthough the legend makes a pretty story, in reality the gorge was\r\nformed by the river Avon which over thousands of years has eroded\r\nthe limestone creating the spectacular gorge that you see today.\r\nThe gorge runs 1.5 miles from here towards the Severn estuary where\r\nthe river eventually meets the sea.\r\nFossils show that the rock here was laid down during the\r\nCarboniferous period 350 million years ago. Firstly a layer of\r\nsandstone was deposited, followed by limestone sediments. The\r\ncliffs you see today are predominantly of limestone.\r\nGeologists have often pondered why the river Avon cut through the\r\nlimestone ridge, rather than taking the more natural route to the\r\nsea through Aston Vale towards Weston-Super-Mare. The commonly\r\naccepted explanation is that during the ice age, Aston Vale was\r\nblocked by a glacier, forcing the river to take this alternative\r\nroute.<b>To Claim This Cache:</b>\r\nPlease take a photograph of yourself or your GPSr with the gorge in\r\nthe background and post this with your log.\r\nAlso after you log your find, please email the answer to the\r\nfollowing questions to my profile:\r\n How wide is the Avon Gorge at this point?\r\n How high are you above sea level?\r\n(Tip: There are no info boards to answer these questions - instead\r\nwhy not use your GPS to find the answers?)\r\nThanks for taking the time to visit this Earthcache and I hope you\r\nenjoy your visit.","gc_num":"GC1EA1A","gc_placer":"*mouse*","gc_cont_icon":"not_chosen","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Earthcache","id":"a680bmrxo5pj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.629167,51.454617]}},{"properties":{"name":"Avon Haven","timestamp":{"end_time":"2008/07/12 04:00:00 -0400","original":"2008-07-12T07:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2008/07/12 03:00:00 -0400"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1","gc_placer_id":1392555,"gc_name":"Avon Haven","gc_diff_stars":"stars1_5","gc_short_desc":"Our second cache, on the St Philips Greenway.

The north and south sides have a central\r\ntriangular pediment supported by Corinthian pillars with the houses\r\non each end having a bowed façade.

The line was authorised in 1845, was acquired by the GWR in 1850, reached Frome in the same year, and was completed throughout in 1857. The original route of this line is that of the loop line through Frome station. This line forms the basis for today's Bristol to Weymouth route.\r\n\r\nA branch from Frome to Radstock, authorised by the same act of 1845, opened to freight traffic in 1854 and to passenger traffic in 1875. At Radstock this line connected with the Bristol and North Somerset Railway, providing a more direct route to Bristol than that provided by the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 a by-pass route was constructed, enabling through traffic to avoid Frome station and the junction with the Radstock branch, and leaving the station on a looped branch as at present. \r\n\r\nToday the station is exceptionally quiet with only one platform still in use.  A few years ago it painted a sugar-mouse pink, which is erm nice.\r\n\r\nMost of the trains server the Bristol to Waymouth route, although there are now peak services from Cardiff and London which pass through.  The most interesting of which is the 1836 ghost train which leaves Reading for Frome.

The Circus is considered to be\r\nWoods' masterpiece. Wood senior never saw the Circus completed as\r\nhe died less than three months after the foundation stone was laid.\r\nJohn Wood the Younger, was left to finish the project. With three\r\ncurved segments of equal length, the Circus has three separate\r\nentrances. The buildings have uniform facades and display three\r\norders of Roman architecture ( the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian). It\r\nis thought that the Circus was Inspired by the Colosseum in Rome\r\nbut John Wood the Elder was also influenced by Druids! The circular\r\narea of the Circus has almost the same dimensions as Stonehenge and\r\nthe 30 houses of the Circus match the 30 standing stones. The\r\nfreize includes 525 pictorial emblems representing the arts and\r\nsciences and a number of Masonic symbols.

The line closed in 1966, but some of the line has been converted into a footpath running from Twerton through Oldfield Park to Bear Flat. At Bear Flat, the railway went through the Devonshire Tunnel, then along Lyncombe Vale and into Combe Down Tunnel. Sadly, both of these tunnels are closed to the public, but the The Two Tunnels Greenway Organisation (part of Sustrans) has just secured some lottery money and planning permission to open up these tunnels and join the Linear Park to the Sustrans Path (NCN24) which exists at the other end of the Combe Down Tunnel.

His plans covered the 600 acre site\r\nof Bathwick Meadow owner by the Pulteney family, William Johnstone\r\nand Frances Pulteney, who inherited the estate in 1767. When\r\nFrances died in 1782 the entire Pulteney fortune went to their\r\ndaughter Henrietta Laura after whom the place and Henrietta gardens\r\n(Implemented to replace the planned Frances Square residential area\r\nmuch later in 1833 by City Surveyor John Pinch.) to the north of\r\nGreat Pulteney Street are named. Laura place is unusual in that it\r\njoins four streets of different sizes so it is 'lozenge' shaped.\r\nThe grandest street in the whole of Baldwins plan is Great Pulteney\r\nstreet. This street was intended to split at Sydney Gardens and\r\nrejoin beyond but only the main street we have today and 16 houses\r\nin Sydney place were completed to his design. Half way up the\r\nstreet on the left is Sunderland Street which is only one house\r\ndeep and on the right there are 3 more uncompleted roads,\r\nJohnstone, Edward and William streets. These three were designed to\r\nmeet another street, Great Annerdale, which would have run parallel\r\nto Great Pulteney Street but was never completed. Most of the\r\nfunding for these grand plans was speculative financed mainly by\r\nthe BAth City Bank, unfortunately the bank crashed in 1793 which\r\neffectively brought the development to an abrupt end.

This was the side nearest the town and so very convenient for passengers travelling into Exeter but did mean that a lot of trains had to cross in front of others.\r\n\r\nThis was not too much of a problem while the station was at the end of the line, but on 30 May 1846 the South Devon Railway (SDR) opened a line westwards towards Plymouth. A carriage shed was built for the SDR at the south end of the B&amp;ER platform but the goods sheds and locomotive sheds for both companies were to the west, between the station and the River Exe. The SDR was designed to be worked by atmospheric power and an engine house was built on the banks of the river near the locomotive shed. This was only used for its original purpose for about a year but was not demolished until many years later.\r\n\r\nThe next railway to arrive at St Davids was the Exeter and Crediton Railway on 12 May 1851, the junction of which was a little distance to the north of the station at Cowley Bridge. This line was worked by the B&amp;ER and trains were accommodated at the existing platforms. All these railways had been built to the 7 ft 0¼ in (2,140 mm) broad gauge, but on 1 February 1862 the 4 ft 8½ in (1,435 mm) gauge London and South Western Railway (LSWR) brought a line into the station from their own central station in Queen Street. The LSWR owned the Exeter and Crediton Railway and started to work the line for itself, although the broad gauge was retained for the B&amp;ER to work goods trains to Crediton.\r\n\r\nWith two gauges and four companies using the single-sided station, it was in need of remodelling. A new double-sided platform opened on the site west side of the line and the original up platform at the northern end was closed. The original platforms had all had individual train sheds covering the tracks, and the opportunity was taken to replace these with one large train shed across all the main tracks and platforms. North of the station was a level crossing and just beyond this an additional goods shed was constructed. Unlike the earlier ones it was solely for transferring goods between the trains of the two different gauges. All these buildings were designed by the Francis Fox, the B&amp;ER engineer, and the work was completed in 1864.\r\n\r\nThe B&amp;ER was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1876 and the SDR did the same thing exactly one month later. The main line from Bristol was rebuilt with mixed gauge track that allowed broad gauge trains to run through from London Paddington railway station to Penzance, while at the same time offering a standard gauge track for local trains from Bristol Temple Meads; the new line being ready by 1 March 1876.\r\n\r\nThe train shed was removed in 1912-13 and the platforms extended northwards towards the level crossing. A second island platform was provided on the west side and this entailed the goods sheds being narrowed from two tracks to one at their southern end. The middle island platform was mainly used for LSWR trains while down GWR services used the original main platform and the new island platforms. The station has remained largely in this form since, but resignalling in the 1985 saw the ex-LSWR services moved to the main platform so that down ex-GWR line services did not have to cross their path at the south end of the station. A through line between platforms 1 and 3 was removed at the same time. The new signal box was built on the site of the old atmospheric engine house and replaced three older signal boxes.\r\n\r\nThere are still many remains of the earlier stations to be seen. The main façade dates from 1864 and the Great Western Hotel dates from the earliest days, as does the southern section of platform 1. The goods shed opposite platform 6 shows the angle where the southern end was cut back in 1912, and at the northern end part of the original goods shed still stands beneath later extensions. The 1864 transfer shed can still be seen beside the line beyond Red Cow Crossing.\r\n\r\nYou are looking for a 35mm film container hidden near Red Cow Crossing, a short walk north from the main station entrance.\r\n\r\nThis is a very busy area and stealth will be required to retrieve the cache, particularly if the crossing gates are down.\r\n\r\nBe careful of the busy road junction adjacent to the cache.","gc_num":"GC1CDFA","gc_placer":"37251","gc_cont_icon":"micro","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmw5xnll"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.5431,50.731367]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ring 1 : Entombed sea lilies and William Smith","timestamp":{"end_time":"2008/07/02 04:00:00 -0400","original":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2008/07/02 03:00:00 -0400"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":220450,"gc_name":"Ring 1 : Entombed sea lilies and William Smith","gc_diff_stars":"stars2","gc_short_desc":"This cache shows Bradford on Avons fascinating geological history. This pit was specially excavated in 2007 and is famous for its fossils.","gc_long_desc":"The heyday of the canals was in the first half of the 19th century. From the 1850s onwards, trade was taken over by the railway. Whilst carrying out engineering surveys for the nearby Somerset Coal Canal, William Smith (1769 - 1839) the 'Father of English Geology' was able to work out and publish the order of strata he encountered in the excavations. He published lithographs of fossils from the Bradford Clay in his pioneering collection, which was probably made in this or a nearby quarry.\r\n\r\nAt Bradford, the Kennet and Avon canal follows the southern side of the Avon valley. The cache site is on the dip slope of the Cotswolds Hills in the mid jurassic forest marble formation, some 165 million years old. \r\n\r\nThis rock, some 24 metres thick consists of alternating limestones and clays. A thick layer of clay (Bradford Clay) occurs at this cache site above the limestones. The lower part of this clay is rich in fossil debris, derived from creatures that lived on or burrowed into the surface of the underlying limestone that formed the sea floor. Currents swept banks of broken shells around, breaking them down into shell-sand : lenses of more complete shells are found occasionally. Several different sea-floor environments are preserved in the rocks here complete with fossil fauna, buried by an influx of clay particles brought in on the current. This was probably the result of some sudden event, perhaps a river in flood, or the collapse of a pile of sediment nearby, maybe triggered by an earthquake. \r\n\r\nThe most famous fossil here is the sea-lily Apiocrinites Elegans which grew fixeed to the solid sea bed (Ancliff Oolite). The shell-sand grains that make up much of this rock were by then cemented together with calcium carbonate dissolved in the sea water to form a hard, irregular limestone pavement. This provided a variety of habitats for burrowers, borers, and encrusting sea-creatures, as well as free swimmers. The site was first described in the 16th century, when it was realised that the fossils at the base of the clay bed had, in life, been living on the underlying limestone and that the clay bed had buried his fauna. Fine specimens can be seen in the Museum in the town centre by the bridge.\r\n\r\nFossils you are also likely to find here are Brachiopods (like tiny clawshells), Rhactorhyachia, Digonella &amp; Epithyris. \r\n\r\nTo claim the cache as a find please estimate and E Mail us the length and width of the pit and the telephone number on the back of the information board.","gc_num":"GC1DRVN","gc_placer":"Gowenhouse","gc_cont_icon":"not_chosen","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Earthcache","id":"a680bmw1qgzf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.250933,51.34025]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bolt out of the Blue","timestamp":{"end_time":"2008/07/04 04:00:00 -0400","original":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2008/07/04 03:00:00 -0400"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":1392555,"gc_name":"Bolt out of the Blue","gc_diff_stars":"stars3_5","gc_short_desc":"A cache placed on the St Philip's Greenway - a great path that runs from near Temple Meads to Avon Meads.","gc_long_desc":"This is a cache placed to celebrate Bristol being declared a Cycling City; National Cycle Network Route 3 is often overlooked in favour of the much more publicised Bristol to Bath Railway path, however, I think that the Greenway, which forms part of Route 3, is just as nice, and a great place to go for a walk/cycle with the family. The path itself is mostly flat apart from a rise/steps at the end near Avon Meads (there is a ramp for bikes!), and the odd tree route making interesting hummocks in the tarmac!\r\n\r\nBristol City Council have produced a map of the cycle route, along with the Whitchurch Railway Path, also part of Route 3 and well worth a look, especially if you are on a bike.

A map for the trail can be found here: \r\nhttp://www.riveravontrail.org.uk/\r\n\r\nThis cache can be done as a nice stroll from Temple Meads, or if you fancy a break from shopping at Avon Meads, you can pop along to the site too, it is not far and a lovely walk along the river. If you drive, here is the best place to park. \r\n\r\nThe space in the cache itself is less than a 35mm film canister and there is probably no room for any geocoins, let alone swaps.

How many letters in the word? Call the answer B.\r\n\r\nNow work out the coordinates for waypoint 2:\r\n\r\nN 51 2 B . A 0 7  \r\nW 002 (B-3) 0. (A+3) (B+2) (B-A-1).\r\n\r\nOnce you are there you will find something you would never want to be inside!

The route is relatively flat but some steps\r\nare involved. The waypoints are away from the traffic but there are\r\nsome busy roads <i>en route</i> so be careful with younger\r\nchildren. You do not need to enter any buildings to complete this\r\ncache. There is 24 hour access to all sites apart from task 6 which\r\nis open approximately during daylight hours.\r\nStage 1 involves locating the \"Lady with the Veiled Face\"\r\nsomewhere in the centre of Bristol and collecting some nearby\r\ninformation that you will need for the next stage. Stage 2 involves\r\na trail round the old part of central Bristol collecting\r\ninformation that you will need for stage 3. Stage 3 is a\r\nstraightforward small cache in central Bristol. The cache is a\r\nsmall plastic box just large enough for a logbook and some\r\n<b>small</b> swaps and travel bugs.\r\nStage 1 may take a little time depending how resourceful you\r\nare. Stages 2 and 3 will probably take 2 hours in total.\r\nStage 1 - The Lady\r\n<img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/950a4f46-b47f-4bf9-a3a8-e4c7e91354a3.jpg\">Somewhere in the centre of Bristol lives the \"Lady with the\r\nVeiled Face\". No-one knows who she is or why she is veiled. You\r\nneed to find this lady. She is within a few minutes' walk of your\r\nstarting co-ordinates. The search area is a triangular part of old\r\nBristol bounded on the South by Baldwin Street, on the North-West\r\nby Colston Avenue/Quay Street, and on the North-East by High\r\nStreet/Broad Street. When you have found her stand underneath her\r\nand look for a red box containing an eleven digit number. The\r\n<b>last 7 digits</b> are <i>tuvwxyz</i>. Use the table to record\r\nyour answer:\r\nt\r\nu\r\nv\r\nw\r\nx\r\ny\r\nz \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThis is the end of stage 1. \r\nStage 2 - The Search\r\nThis stage involves some walking. Use the table at the end to\r\nrecord the answers. \r\nTask 1\r\n<b>Go to N51°27.uvv W2°35.zuy</b>\r\nLook for the third of four. Please make <b>absolutely</b> sure you\r\ngo to the correct one - there is a sequence. If you look around\r\nthere is a way of verifying which is which. What date is inscribed\r\non it? Last digit = \"a\" . \r\nJust for fun - also at these co-ordinates is a very interesting\r\ntimepiece. You may want to look for it and read the notice giving\r\nits background. But this is not part of the cache if you don't want\r\nto do this.\r\nTask 2\r\n<b>Go to N51°27.wy(z-y)\r\nW2°35.v(v-z)u</b>\r\nSometimes it's not easy to get a GPS fix here, but it should be\r\npretty obvious what you are looking for. Look up where you cannot\r\nsee the sky. Count the stone circles. Answer =\r\n\"b\" \r\nAt one corner of this building is an unusual feature. When was\r\nit moved to its present site? Last digit =\r\n\"c\"\r\nTask 3\r\n<b>Go to N51°27.(w-u)(z-y)z\r\nW2°35.zxw</b>\r\nWhat is the year it was built? Last digit of year =\r\n\"d\". \r\nTask 4\r\n<b>Go to N51°27.xwu\r\nW2°35.z(z+u)x</b>\r\nLook for two separate inscriptions that both start\r\n\"STN\". Which inscription has the lowest numbers after\r\nit? These are \"ef\". \r\n<b>Task 5</b>\r\n<b>Go to N51°26.t(u+u)w\r\nW2°35.(w+y)yt</b>\r\nLast digit of year = \"g\". \r\nTask 6 - not accessible after dusk\r\n<b>Go to N51°26.(y+w)vv\r\nW2°35.wvy</b>\r\nNear this spot is an unusual plant that never needs cutting! What\r\nis the year in which it was planted? Last digit\r\n=\"h\". \r\nAlso near this spot (40 paces or so) is a <b>small, flat</b>\r\ngravestone. You will know when you have found it because you might\r\nexpect to see 8 more besides. In which year was he (or she, or it)\r\nborn. Last digit=\"j\".\r\nThis is the end of stage 2 - you are now very near the final\r\ncache. But don't rush - please take a few moments to look inside\r\nthe building; it has a fascinating history.\r\na\r\nb\r\nc\r\nd\r\ne\r\nf\r\ng\r\nh\r\nj \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nIf you have completed this stage correctly the sum of the numbers\r\nin the above table will equal the last 2 digits of the year in the\r\nfirst part of task 6. <b>NOTE: You will need some of these numbers\r\nagain if you need to use the \"hint\".</b> \r\nStage 3 - The Reward\r\nThe final cache location is nearby at N51°26.(a+e)(g+j)(c-h)\r\nW2°35.(d+j)(j-h)(b+d). \r\nPlease be careful as

Please avoid\r\nacting suspiciously whilst searching for it, and if challenged,\r\nexplain about geocaching** Unfortunately because of the security\r\nsituation it is not possible to place caches within 200ft of\r\nWestminster Cathedral so this is about the nearest I can place a\r\ncache.\r\n\r\n    The Cathedral site was originally known as\r\nBulinga Fen and formed part of the marsh around Westminster. It was\r\nreclaimed by the Benedictine monks who were the builders and owners\r\nof Westminster Abbey, and subsequently used as a market and\r\nfairground.\r\n    After the reformation the land was used in\r\nturn as a maze, a pleasure garden and as a ring for bull-baiting\r\nbut it remained largely waste ground. In the 17th century a part of\r\nthe land was sold by the Abbey for the construction of a prison\r\nwhich was demolished and replaced by an enlarged prison complex in\r\n1834.\r\n    The site was acquired by the Catholic\r\nChurch in 1884. T he Cathedral Church of Westminster, which is\r\ndedicated to the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ, was\r\ndesigned in the Early Christian Byzantine style by the Victorian\r\narchitect John Francis Bentley. The foundation stone was laid in\r\n1895 and the fabric of the building was completed eight years\r\nlater. The awesome interior of the Cathedral, although incomplete,\r\ncontains fine marble-work and mosaics. The fourteen Stations of the\r\nCross, by the sculptor Eric Gill, are world renowned. .\r\n    In the early 1970s the area bounded on the\r\nnorth by Victoria Street, on the west by Vauxhall Bridge Road and\r\non the east extending to the Army and Navy Stores was\r\ncomprehensively redeveloped and the Westminster Cathedral Piazza\r\ncreated in front of the Cathedral. The Cathedral suddenly became a\r\nhighly visible architectural monument in a major public urban\r\nsetting. .\r\n     The nearest tube stations to Westminster\r\nCathedral are Victoria Station and St. James Park, both within Zone\r\n1 of the London Transport system.\r\nThe GPS signal round the cache is poor. I have changed the clue\r\nto help cachers. Please note the cache is NOT in the piazza as the\r\ncache name states! I have put up a photograph of the view from the\r\ncache site to assit locating the cache.","gc_num":"GC1K9P3","gc_placer":"Loony Londo","gc_cont_icon":"micro","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmu5kj18"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.138967,51.496667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Way Down West 83","timestamp":{"end_time":"2010/03/12 04:00:00 -0500","original":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2010/03/12 03:00:00 -0500"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":2651169,"gc_name":"Way Down West 83","gc_diff_stars":"stars1_5","gc_short_desc":"The series starts in West Down,North Devon.","gc_long_desc":"Welcome to North Devon.\r\n\r\n      A series of 109 caches,over 20 miles,set on public footpaths and quiet country lanes.\r\n\r\n      All directions given,assume that you are following the caches in numeric order.\r\n\r\n      For parking in West Down see Way Down West 1(GC24XHH),in Blakewell see Way Down West 56(GC24Y69)\r\n      and in Marwood see Way Down West 70(GC24Y6C)\r\n\r\n      It will be muddy in places.There are two steep inclines after caches 34 and 61.\r\n\r\n      You will be lucky not to meet sheep,cows and horses.\r\n\r\n      All smallish caches contain coins to swop.\r\n\r\n      Eight waymarks are included to assist you.\r\n\r\n      Cache is a 3x3 locktop box.\r\n\r\n      After this cache you have to go through the gate to continue with the hedgerow on your left.When I placed the cache the gate had a tyre leaning against it,so I had to climb over.","gc_num":"GC24YB6","gc_placer":"kevham1","gc_cont_icon":"small","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmxpg8lc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.081617,51.141333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Flonopoly Cache 17 - The Strand","timestamp":{"end_time":"2009/01/09 04:00:00 -0500","original":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2009/01/09 03:00:00 -0500"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":1276614,"gc_name":"Flonopoly Cache 17 - The Strand","gc_diff_stars":"stars1_5","gc_short_desc":"\r\n<img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c260d366-f6b2-4201-be2a-2c37e03d9639.jpg\">","gc_long_desc":"Welcome to FireLanterns-onopoly, or Flonopoly for short.

Little Comfort Farm(01271 812414) where you can fall out of bed,do the whole circuit and be back in time for your evening meal.\r\n\r\n      Cache is a 3x3 locktop box.\r\n\r\n     TRACKABLES\r\n     I know it will take cachers a long time to log their finds but may I ask that if you place/take a trackable could you please log that find as soon as possible.Thanks,

Through demolition and rebuilding over the years in an already congested district, available land was at a premium. This meant that every opportunity to snatch a little extra was seized upon, leaving the access to Brydges Place as little more than a crack in the wall. Although the passage has been here since the early 17th century it started life under the name of Dawson's Alley. At the beginning of the 19th century it appears to have been known as Taylor's Yard - indicating an area of rather larger proportions - and by 1875 the name had changed to the present Brydges Place. The reference is to George Brydges, Lord Chandos, who was the forces Paymaster and an ancestor of the Duke of Chandos. \r\n\r\nFor the mischeivious it is also a great place to dart out from unexpectantly and startle innocent tourists!","gc_num":"GC20KBV","gc_placer":"loobcom","gc_cont_icon":"other","gc_issues":"&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;This cache has been archived.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;","gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmtqrd23"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126883,51.51025]}},{"properties":{"name":"Way Down West 103","timestamp":{"end_time":"2010/03/12 04:00:00 -0500","original":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2010/03/12 03:00:00 -0500"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":2651169,"gc_name":"Way Down West 103","gc_diff_stars":"stars1_5","gc_short_desc":"The series starts in West Down,North Devon.","gc_long_desc":"Welcome to North Devon.\r\n\r\n      A series of 109 caches,over 20 miles,set on public footpaths and quiet country lanes.\r\n\r\n      All directions given,assume that you are following the caches in numeric order.\r\n\r\n      For parking in West Down see Way Down West 1(GC24XHH),in Blakewell see Way Down West 56(GC24Y69)\r\n      and in Marwood see Way Down West 70(GC24Y6C)\r\n\r\n      It will be muddy in places.There are two steep inclines after caches 34 and 61.\r\n\r\n      You will be lucky not to meet sheep,cows and horses.\r\n\r\n      All smallish caches contain coins to swop.\r\n\r\n      Eight waymarks are included to assist you.\r\n\r\n      Cache is a 3x3 locktop box.","gc_num":"GC24YCM","gc_placer":"kevham1","gc_cont_icon":"small","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmxe8gyk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.116483,51.15595]}},{"properties":{"name":"Way Down West 104","timestamp":{"end_time":"2010/03/12 04:00:00 -0500","original":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2010/03/12 03:00:00 -0500"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":2651169,"gc_name":"Way Down West 104","gc_diff_stars":"stars1_5","gc_short_desc":"The series starts in West Down,North Devon.","gc_long_desc":"Welcome to North Devon.\r\n\r\n      A series of 109 caches,over 20 miles,set on public footpaths and quiet country lanes.\r\n\r\n      All directions given,assume that you are following the caches in numeric order.\r\n\r\n      For parking in West Down see Way Down West 1(GC24XHH),in Blakewell see Way Down West 56(GC24Y69)\r\n      and in Marwood see Way Down West 70(GC24Y6C)\r\n\r\n      It will be muddy in places.There are two steep inclines after caches 34 and 61.\r\n\r\n      You will be lucky not to meet sheep,cows and horses.\r\n\r\n      All smallish caches contain coins to swop.\r\n\r\n      Eight waymarks are included to assist you.\r\n\r\n      Cache is a 35mm film case.\r\n\r\n      After Way Down West 104 there are two ways to get to Way Down West 105.You may go across the field which means going over 3 stiles,the middle one is usually surrounded by mud.Then again you may just follow the lane gently down the hill.I myself only crossed the field the first time I walked the series.","gc_num":"GC24YCR","gc_placer":"kevham1","gc_cont_icon":"micro","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmnaxhfp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.119233,51.156167]}},{"properties":{"name":"Way Down West 105","timestamp":{"end_time":"2010/03/12 04:00:00 -0500","original":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2010/03/12 03:00:00 -0500"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":2651169,"gc_name":"Way Down West 105","gc_diff_stars":"stars1_5","gc_short_desc":"The series starts in West Down,North Devon.","gc_long_desc":"Welcome to North Devon.\r\n\r\n      A series of 109 caches,over 20 miles,set on public footpaths and quiet country lanes.\r\n\r\n      All directions given,assume that you are following the caches in numeric order.\r\n\r\n      For parking in West Down see Way Down West 1(GC24XHH),in Blakewell see Way Down West 56(GC24Y69)\r\n      and in Marwood see Way Down West 70(GC24Y6C)\r\n\r\n      It will be muddy in places.There are two steep inclines after caches 34 and 61.\r\n\r\n      You will be lucky not to meet sheep,cows and horses.\r\n\r\n      All smallish caches contain coins to swop.\r\n\r\n      Eight waymarks are included to assist you.\r\n\r\n      Cache is a 2 inch cylinder.","gc_num":"GC24YCW","gc_placer":"kevham1","gc_cont_icon":"small","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmreegda"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.120583,51.157467]}},{"properties":{"name":"Church Micro 977 -

This is the site of the former St John’s Church and Graveyard, built in 1769. On 28th April 1768, Edward Byrom laid the foundation stone for the church in memorial to his farther. Ecclesiastical Commissioners handed over the church to Manchester City Council in 1930 such that it be laid out as an open space for the benefit of the locale. The Church itself was demolished in 1931, though 2 stained glass windows were transferred to St Anne’s Church (St Anne’s Square) where they still remain. The gardens then became a city park. \r\n\r\nThe park continues to provide a pleasant green space in the centre of Manchester and in 1998 was awarded a Green Flag Award for achieving the national standard for parks and green spaces. Currently present are formal lawns, flower and herbaceous bedding, ornamental planting, a well laid out footpath plan and plenty of seating and picnic areas. At the original entrance to St John’s church stands a central monument to the church and the 22000 people buried in its grounds. On this monument is also a panel dedicated to the memory of William Marsden who presided over the committee which obtained the Saturday Holiday for Manchester in 1843. \r\n\r\nThe area has several trees and is surrounded by high rise buildings, therefore the GPS signal may be unreliable. Our given coordinates may not be precise so We’ve encrypted a very detailed description of how to get the cache in the hint. If you find the park, this hint should be enough to locate the cache. \r\n\r\nThe area should be fairly low on muggles, but people do use this place to sit and relax.

The unfulfilled intention was for a through station with services to the City.\r\n\r\nThe name on opening was 'Waterloo Bridge Station', from the nearby Waterloo Bridge across the Thames. In 1886 it officially became 'Waterloo Station' reflecting the long-standing common usage, even of some L&amp;SWR timetables.\r\nAs the station grew it became increasingly ramshackle, a little-used railway line even crossed the main concourse on the level and passed through an archway in the station building to connect to the South Eastern Railway's smaller station, now Waterloo East, whose tracks lie perpendicular to those of Waterloo. Passengers were confused by the layout and by the two very close stations called 'Waterloo'. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics. In Jerome K. Jerome's book Three Men in a Boat no one at Waterloo knows the wanted train's platform, departure time or destination.\r\n\r\nExtensive reconstruction between 1900 and 1922 gave 21 platforms and a concourse nearly 800 feet (244 m) long. The main pedestrian entrance, the Victory Arch, serves as a memorial to company staff who were killed during the two world wars. Damage in World War II required considerable repair but entailed no great changes of layout.\r\n\r\nOn privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s, ownership and management of Waterloo passed to Railtrack, and subsequently to Network Rail.\r\nPlatforms 20 and 21 were lost as part of the site of Waterloo International railway station which from 1994 to 13 November 2007 was the London terminus of the Eurostar international services. Construction necessitated the removal of decorative masonry forming two arches from that side of the station, bearing the legend \"Southern Railway\". This was subsequently re-erected at the private Fawley Hill Museum of Sir William McAlpine, whose company built Waterloo International. Waterloo International closed when all Eurostar services transferred to St Pancras railway station with the opening of the second phase of \"HS1\", High Speed route 1, formerly known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link or CTRL.

It is the seventh busiest rail terminal in London.\r\nThe site is a historic one, having served as the London terminus of\r\nthe Great Western Railway and its successors since 1838. Much of\r\nthe current mainline station dates back to 1854, and was designed\r\nby Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The site was first served by\r\nUnderground trains in 1863, and was the original western terminus\r\nof the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground\r\nrailway.\r\nDespite its historic nature, and the need to preserve many of its\r\nfeatures, the complex has recently been modernised, and has added a\r\nnew role as the terminus of the dedicated Heathrow Express service\r\nto Heathrow Airport. The complex is in Travelcard Zone 1.<b>Location</b>\r\nThe station complex is located in, alongside and under a long thin\r\ncity block bounded across the front by Praed Street and to the rear\r\nby Bishop's Bridge Road, which crosses the throat of the main line\r\nstation on the recently replaced Bishop's Bridge. The west side of\r\nthe station is paralleled by Eastbourne Terrace, whilst the east\r\nside is constrained by the Paddington arm of the Grand Union Canal.\r\nThe main line station is located in a shallow cutting, a fact that\r\nis obscured from the front by the frontal hotel building, but which\r\ncan be clearly seen from the other three sides.\r\nThe station's location is something of a back street one, with none\r\nof the bounding streets being major traffic thoroughfares. The\r\nsurrounding area is largely residential, and contains many of\r\nLondon's hotels. Until recently there has been little in the way of\r\noffice accommodation in the area, meaning that most of Paddington's\r\ncommuter traffic interchanges between National Rail and the London\r\nUnderground to reach its eventual destination in the West End or\r\nthe City. However, recent redevelopment of nearby derelict railway\r\nand canal land, marketed as Paddington Waterside, has resulted in a\r\nnumber of new office complexes in the area.<b>History</b>\r\nThe first station to open in the Paddington area was a temporary\r\nterminus for the Great Western Railway on the west side of Bishop's\r\nBridge Road. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near\r\nMaidenhead, began at Paddington in 1838. After the opening of the\r\nmain station in 1854, this became the site of the goods depot.\r\nAfter years of dereliction, it is now being redeveloped as part of\r\na mixed residential and business area called Paddington\r\nWaterside.\r\nThe main Paddington station between Bishops Bridge Road and Praed\r\nStreet was opened in 1854 and was designed by Isambard Kingdom\r\nBrunel who was later commemorated by a statue on the station\r\nconcourse (known as \"The Lawn\"), despite the fact that much of the\r\narchitectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt.\r\nThe glazed roof is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans,\r\nrespectively spanning 20.70 m (68 ft), 31.20 m (102 ft) and 21.30 m\r\n(70 ft). The roof is 213 m (699 ft) long, and a particular feature\r\nof the original roof spans is the presence of two transepts\r\nconnecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were\r\nprovided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches\r\nbetween the tracks within the station. However, recent research,\r\nusing early documents and photographs, does not seem to support\r\nthis belief, and their actual purpose is unknown.\r\nThe Great Western Hotel was built on Praed Street in front of the\r\nstation in 1851-1854 by architect Philip Charles Hardwick, son of\r\nPhilip Hardwick (designer of the Euston Arch). The station was\r\nsubstantially enlarged in 1906-1915 and a fourth span of 33 m (109\r\nft) was added on the north side, parallel to the others. The new\r\nspan was built to a similar style to the original three spans, but\r\nthe detailing is different and it does not possess the transepts of\r\nthe earlier spans.\r\nOn Armistice Day 1922, a memorial to the employees of the GWR who\r\ndied during the First World War was unveiled by Viscount Churchill.\r\nThe bronze memorial depicts a soldier reading a letter which was\r\nsculpted by Charles Sargeant Jagger and stands on platform 1.\r\nIn 1961, the decomposing body of a male child was found in a case\r\nat the station. Paper stuffed into his mouth was the cause of\r\ndeath. His identity has never been discovered.\r\nA very early construction by Brunel was recently discovered\r\nimmediately to the north of the station. A cast iron bridge\r\ncarrying the Bishop's Bridge Road over the Paddington Arm of the\r\nGrand Union Canal was uncovered after removal of more recent brick\r\ncladding during the complete replacement of the adjacent bridge\r\nover the railway lines at the mouth of the station.<b>The Station Today</b>\r\nToday Paddington has 14 terminal platforms, numbered 1 to 14 from\r\nwest to east. Platforms 1 to 8 are located below the original three\r\nspans of Brunel's 1854 train shed, whilst platforms 9 to 12 are\r\nlocated beneath the later fourth span. Platforms 13 and 14 are\r\nwithin the Metropolitan Railway's old Bishops Bridge station,\r\nimmediately alongside the two through platforms, numbered 15 and\r\n16, used by the Hammersmith &amp; City Line of the London\r\nUnderground.\r\nPlatforms 6 and 7 are dedicated to the Heathrow Express, and\r\nplatforms 13 and 14 can only be used by the 2 or 3 car Turbo trains\r\nused on local services. All the other platforms can be used by any\r\nof the station's train services. However in normal usage the\r\ntendency is for long distance trains to use the western platforms,\r\nand local trains (including Heathrow Connect) the eastern\r\nones.\r\nThe station concourse stretches across the head of platforms 1 to\r\n12, underneath the London end of the four main train sheds.\r\nPlatforms 13 and 14 can be reached directly from the country end of\r\nplatform 12, or from the footbridge which crosses the country end\r\nof the station and gives access to all platforms.\r\nThe area between the back of the Great Western Hotel and the\r\nstation concourse is traditionally called The Lawn. It was\r\noriginally unroofed and occupied by sidings, but was later built up\r\nto form part of the station's first pedestrian concourse. The Lawn\r\nhas recently been reroofed and separated from the concourse by a\r\nglass screen wall. It is now surrounded by shops and cafes on\r\nseveral levels.","gc_num":"GC1AW9J","gc_placer":"speedybeale","gc_cont_icon":"micro","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Traditional Cache","id":"a680bmr96fj8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.175117,51.51595]}},{"properties":{"name":"Time At The Bar - The Market Inn","timestamp":{"end_time":"2009/06/14 04:00:00 -0400","original":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2009/06/14 03:00:00 -0400"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars1_5","gc_placer_id":1971719,"gc_name":"Time At The Bar - The Market Inn","gc_diff_stars":"stars2","gc_short_desc":"Located in Winchester city centre.

It started of\r\nas a marshy island the ancient Isle of Thorns or Thorny Island. It\r\nwas formed by rivulets of the River Tyburn, which entered the\r\nThames near the lowest point where it could be forded from the\r\nnorth bank at low tide. It was described in a purported charter of\r\nKing Offa in 785, which is kept in the Westminster Abbey muniments,\r\nas a \"terrible place\"\r\n  The name Westminster is a contraction of the words\r\n\"West Monastery\". However over the next 300 years, the monks of the\r\nAbbey tamed the brambles, until by the time of Edward the Confessor\r\nit was \"A delightful place, surrounded by fertile land and green\r\nfields\". This area was the orchard for Westminster Abbey.\r\n  Unfortunately it suffered a fall from grace and was\r\nreferred to as the Devil's Acre. Well into the 19th century this\r\narea, was one of the country's worst pits of crime and despair.

Using information taken from these paintings, it will be\r\npossible to work out the co-ords for the final cache (the given\r\nco-ords are just for the National Gallery itself!). There are a lot\r\nof paintings to look at, so I'm only making you look round two\r\nsections of the gallery! Paintings from c1250 to 1500 are in the\r\nSainsbury Wing, and those from 1500 to 1600 are in the main\r\ngallery. It's probably a good idea to look around the earlier\r\npaintings first, entering the gallery at the Sainsbury Wing\r\nentrance.\r\nThe final cache is now a 35mm film canister and is hidden a short\r\nwalk (about a third of a mile) away.

This large horsey battle scene is one of three panels that show\r\nincidents from the same battle; the other two are in the Louvre in\r\nParis and the Uffizi in Florence. \r\nWhat year was the battle that is depicted here? (third digit of\r\nyear plus 2 = <b>E</b>) \r\nF. This saint was out hunting one day when he came across a stag\r\nwith a crucifix hanging between its antlers, and promptly converted\r\nto Christianity.

There are large\r\nlifts with low-level controls giving access to Level 2. This\r\nentrance is most convenient for taxis and set down and pick up, and\r\nclosest to the parking bays. For more information, please see\r\nhttp://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/plan/access/default.htm\r\nIt is possible to get next to the final cache in a wheelchair, but\r\nif you find it difficult leaning down to reach something near the\r\nground then you might like to ask a geo-friend to help (besides\r\nit's a nice excuse for a meeting to tour round the gallery, have\r\nlunch etc if you're in London for the day!\r\n<img src=\"http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif\">)</i> \r\nFollowing very helpful comments from other cachers, I have decided\r\nagainst including a link to Puzzlechecker for this cache, as it\r\ncould allow people to skip doing the research for the last couple\r\nof paintings and simply guess the co-ords instead. However, I'm\r\nhappy if people want to email me to check they have the correct\r\nco-ords if they need to - I can be contacted through my profile.\r\n\r\nMASSIVE thanks to CurryKev for replacing the cache and helping me\r\nto get this online again :-)","gc_num":"GC157TB","gc_placer":"tonibunny","gc_cont_icon":"micro","gc_issues":"&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;This cache has been archived.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;","gc_type":"Unknown Cache","id":"a680bmwm7zjm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.128183,51.50845]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Smallest(?)

He afterwards became a successful merchant in London and, in 1732, a trustee of James Oglethorpe’s Georgia colony. In 1735 he sponsored a colony in Nova Scotia for unemployed artisans. As a great philanthropist Coram was appalled by the many abandoned, homeless children living in the streets of London. On October 17, 1739 he obtained a Royal Charter granted by George II establishing a \"hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1742-1745, the Foundling Hospital was erected in Lamb's Conduit Fields, Bloomsbury. It is said to be the world's first incorporated charity. William Hogarth was among the first governors of the hospital.

Around her was a cloak - a threadbare garment\r\nthat had once been red, but was now a dull, dirty colour. The\r\nexpression on the face was a deeply painful one, and was evidently\r\nthe result of an agonizing death. The gash across the neck was\r\nsituated very slightly above the breastbone; it was at least six\r\ninches in length, over an inch in width, and was clean cut. The\r\nlower portion of the body, however, presented the most sickening\r\nspectacle of all.

The deck was originally laid with wooden planking, later covered with asphalt.\r\n\r\nRoller mounted \"saddles\" are employed at the top of each tower to allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge. Though their total travel is minuscule, their ability to absorb forces created by chain deflection prevents damage to both tower and chain.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHidden in busy part of Bristol, on a sunny day there can be hundreds of people around.

I have also provided a numbered list below, which should make sense as you walk around, although the list order is random. At each waypoint, find the appropriate mapping between the letter (e.g. Waypoint A) and a digit in the list (e.g. Dill's=7); then substitute your values into the formula for the final coordinates (e.g. A=7).

Take time to look at the intricate external carvings and sculptures. At certain times, guided tours of the interior can be attended, where the murals of Ford Madox Brown can be seen.

There\r\nare other reasons of course – the local gentry preferring to have a\r\nclear view of their estates, or the general running down of a\r\nparticular site over the years, or in the Highlands of Scotland the\r\ndesire of landowners to run sheep rather than people over their\r\nlands. \r\nWhat is common is that these desertions usually took place long\r\nago. More modern sensibilities react badly to moving entire\r\npopulations from where they have lived for generations.\r\nHere in Wiltshire, within 10 miles of Swindon, is a village that\r\nwas depopulated within the last 100 years.\r\nSnap was first mentioned as Snape in the 13th Century. Always\r\nsmall, it did have a school in the early 19th Century, although it\r\nwas subsequently moved to a nearby village. Nothing much ever\r\nhappened here and it would seem that the adult population of around\r\n25 remained fairly constant over the 600 years of its recorded\r\nhistory.\r\nSnap fell victim to sheep farming – villages existed primarily\r\nto give housing to workers on arable farms – livestock farming,\r\nparticularly sheep, doesn’t require a settled workforce in close\r\nproximity to the fields. The agricultural depression of the late\r\n19th Century and the desire of rural dwellers to share in the\r\nprosperity of the towns hastened the flight from the land.\r\nBut there was also a villain of the piece – Henry Wilson,\r\nbutcher, of the nearby village of Ramsbury. In 1905 Wilson bought\r\nthe 2 largest farms in the village which had been untenanted since\r\n1890. He needed them to house his large flocks of sheep. This\r\nencouraged the departure of the remaining villagers and in 1909\r\nonly 2 people remained. In 1914, the last remaining villager,\r\nRachel Fisher, an elderly woman, was persuaded to move to Aldbourne\r\nand Snap was deserted and abandoned.\r\nThe local MP described the actions of Wilson as oppressive and\r\ntyrannical. He was successfully sued by Wilson’s sons. The more\r\nthings change, the more they stay the same.\r\n<i>\"The site of Snap is, today, a moving place full of that\r\npeculiar melancholy which is often evoked by places that have been\r\ninhabited for centuries past but which are now deserted.

The side footpath does have a couple\r\nof steep steps down off it which you’d have to carry a buggy down\r\n(not too difficult). \r\nYou’ll need to solve a clue first, the co-ordinates given are of\r\nthe car park near the abbey, not the cache. The clue is: “In which\r\nyear was brass first made at Tintern”? You’ll find the answer near\r\nthe car park/abbey, though what you are looking for is made of\r\nbronze not brass! Use that 4 digit year to work out the clue.\r\nThe cache co-ordinates are: N51°41.a6b', W02°40.x7y where a = the\r\nfirst and last digits of the date added together, b = the third\r\ndigit divided by two, x = the third digit and y = the last number\r\nminus the third number.\r\nParking can be difficult in Tintern, especially in the summer.\r\nThere is additional parking along the road and also at the Old\r\nStation (April to October only).\r\nOnce you’ve got the co-ordinates the best way is to go down to the\r\nriver and follow the footpath ‘The Tintern Trail’ upstream – you’ll\r\nsee why as soon as you get to the river!\r\nThe Abbey Mill has a nice tea room/restaurant and there are many\r\nreally good pubs in Tintern. The little gift shop (by the\r\nabbey/Anchor Inn) sells locally made ice-cream – try the Welsh\r\nGold!! \r\nOh, if they are there, say hello to the donkeys!","gc_num":"GCMDB6","gc_placer":"The Blorenges","gc_cont_icon":"small","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Unknown Cache","id":"a680bms1kbxa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.677883,51.697317]}},{"properties":{"name":"Station Surprise","timestamp":{"end_time":"2007/02/12 04:00:00 -0500","original":"2007-02-12T08:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2007/02/12 03:00:00 -0500"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars2","gc_placer_id":598714,"gc_name":"Station Surprise","gc_diff_stars":"stars1","gc_short_desc":"An easy multi with a very short walk.

She was murdered on 8 September 1888.\r\nAnnie was in her 40s working as a prostitute at the time of her\r\ndeath. In the early hours of 8 September, she had an argument with\r\nthe night watchman at her lodging house in notorious Dorset Street\r\n(see cache No 5) about the fact she spent her money on drink rather\r\nthan rent. At 5.30 am Elizabeth Long spotted Annie by cache\r\nlocation with a man and overheard him ask \"Will you?\" \"Yes,\" Annie\r\nwas heard to reply... Shortly thereafter, Albert Cadoch passed the\r\nwooden fence which separated his yard from the murder site. He\r\nheard a woman crying \"No!\" and something falling against the\r\nfence… <i>The Daily News</i> of 10 September 1888 described\r\nthe scene as follows:-\r\n<i>\"Chapman was of the same class as Mary Ann Nicholls, and she\r\nwas butchered in much the same way. If there was a difference, it\r\nwas in favour of the earlier victim. The head of Annie Chapman, the\r\nlatest, had been nearly severed from her body by one stroke of a\r\nsharp knife, and her person, mutilated in a manner too horrible for\r\ndescription had been disposed about her in a way that suggested a\r\ndelight in the slaughter for the slaughter's sake.”</i> In\r\nfact, Annie Chapman had been disembowelled.\r\nAnnie’s murder happened not long after Mary\r\nNicholls’. A pattern was beginning to emerge… as\r\n<i>The Daily News</i> put it, “there can no longer be any\r\ndoubt that we have to deal with some form of malignant insanity. A\r\nmonster is abroad.”\r\nThe street of Annie’s murder still exists under its\r\noriginal name.

Lizzie was frequently\r\narrested for drunk and disorderly behaviour and worked as a\r\ncharlady and, occasionally, as a prostitute when money was\r\ntight.\r\nThe weather the night of September 29 was showery and windy.\r\nThroughout the evening, Lizzie was spotted kissing and carousing\r\nwith several different men, including, it is sometimes conjectured,\r\nthe Ripper himself. At 1am Louis Diemschutz entered Dutfield's Yard\r\non Berner Street. His horse reared and refused to enter. Diemschutz\r\nsuspected something was in the way but could not see because the\r\nyard was pitch black. He probed with his whip and came into contact\r\nwith a body. Lizzie’s throat had been cut (newspaper reports\r\nclaimed her head was almost severed from her body) and the corpse\r\nwas still warm, two flowers pinned to her dress and her hands\r\nclutching some sweets… It is thought that Diemschutz had\r\ndisturbed the Ripper at his gruesome work.\r\nCertainly Jack disappeared into the night in the direction of\r\nthe City. It would seem his blood lust was not sated by\r\nLizzie‘s death for the frenzied murder of Catherine Eddowes\r\n(see cache no 4) took place later that same night.\r\nIn the late 19th century, Berner Street was largely residential.\r\nIt was described in <i>The Daily News</i> as \"a narrow,\r\nbadly-lighted, but tolerably respectable street\". Today Berner\r\nStreet has been renamed. Dutfield’s Yard no longer exists but\r\nit is still possible to stand at the cache site and imagine\r\nDiemschultz’s terrible discovery.\r\n<b>QUESTION:</b> A school now occupies the site of\r\nDutfield’s yard.

It is thought the Ripper killed\r\nher in a fury following his failure to mutilate the body of victim\r\nno 3, Elizabeth Stride, less than an hour before.\r\nLike all his victims, Catherine was a prostitute and in constant\r\nneed of cash. During the early evening of 29 September, she had\r\nbeen in a drunken state doing fire engine imitations in Aldgate\r\nHigh Street. Catherine was arrested for disorderly behaviour but\r\nwas released from Bishopsgate police station around midnight on 30\r\nSeptember. She was last seen close to the cache site talking to a\r\nman in a not unfriendly way having probably meandered down\r\nHoundsditch… Catherine’s mutilated body was discovered\r\nshortly thereafter by a policeman in the southwest corner of a\r\nnearby square, the site of cache No 4. The inquest report spelled\r\nout the horror of her demise:-\r\n<i>\"The body was on its back, the head turned to left\r\nshoulder… The abdomen was exposed. Right leg bent. The\r\nthroat cut across. The intestines were drawn out to a large extent\r\nand placed over the right shoulder. A piece of about two feet was\r\nquite detached from the body and placed between the body and the\r\nleft arm, apparently by design…. Body was quite warm. No\r\ndeath stiffening had taken place. She must have been dead most\r\nlikely within the half hour…. The face was very much\r\nmutilated.\"</i>\r\nThat two such dreadful murders took place on the same night\r\nwithin a small area sent shudders of fear through the frightened\r\ncommunity and the press into a frenzy. The grisly yet precise\r\nmanner of Annie Chapman’s and Catherine Eddowes’s\r\ndeaths implied that the killer had medical knowledge. The police\r\nseemed helpless to act. \"The most agonizing of the East-end\r\nmysteries is the mystery of the utter paralysis of energy and\r\nintelligence on the part of the Police,\" opined <i>The Daily\r\nNews</i> in its coverage the next day.\r\nToday the cache site bears little resemblance to its Victorian\r\norigins apart from the cobbled stones. At the time of\r\nCatherine’s murder, the square was bordered by warehouses,\r\nterraced houses and a synagogue. Catherine’s body was\r\ndiscovered in front of three small cottages whose frontages faced\r\non to the street bearing the same name as the square. Access to the\r\nsquare was through a series of small lanes and covered passages.\r\nCatherine’s body was discovered just beyond the wall next to\r\nthe flower beds and benches… it still known to this day as\r\n\"Ripper’s Corner\".\r\n<b>QUESTION:</b> A priory was established in this square in\r\nwhich year?

Being part of what the Rev. Barnett called the\r\n\"wicked quarter mile\", it fell within H-Division of the\r\nMetropolitan Police and was one of the streets that was double\r\npatrolled. Charles Booth, an early sociologist who surveyed London,\r\nproduced his poverty map in 1887. Dorset St achieved the lowest\r\nranking, shaded black and described as vicious and\r\nsemi-criminal,\"</i> (see <a href=\"http://www.casebook.org/index.html\">Jack the Ripper’s\r\n<i>Casebook</i> for further information</a>). Co-incidentally,\r\nVictim #2, Annie Chapman, also lived in lodgings further along the\r\nsame side of Dorset Street.\r\nKelly was last seen at about 3am on 9 November 1888 entering her\r\nlodgings in the company of a man who wore a felt hat over his eyes\r\nand a massive gold chain in his waistcoat with a large seal with a\r\nred stone hanging from it. Kelly’s mutilated body was\r\ndiscovered the next morning by the slum landlord who had come for\r\nthe rent peering into the window when no answer to his loud\r\nknocking came from within.\r\nBy a sad irony, <i>The Daily News</i> reported that at the\r\nentrance to Miller’s Court <i>\"there loomed grimly through\r\nthe murky air a partly torn down bill announcing a reward of\r\n£100 for the discovery of the murderer on the last\r\noccasion.\"</i> The reporter breathlessly continued his sorry\r\ntale:\r\n<i>\"The body was so horribly hacked and gashed that, but for the\r\nlong hair, it was scarcely possible to say with any certainty that\r\nit was the body of a woman lying entirely naked on the wretched\r\nbed, with legs outspread and drawn up to the trunk. The ears and\r\nnose had been slashed off, the flesh cut from one cheek, and the\r\nthroat cut through to the bone. In addition to this, the abdomen\r\nhad been ripped as in previous cases, several of the organs having\r\nbeen removed from the trunk and laid on the table beside the\r\nbed… In addition to the various mutilations this described\r\nthere were miscellaneous cuts and slashes about the person of the\r\nunfortunate young woman, as though her fiendish assailant, having\r\nexhausted his ingenuity in systematic destruction, has given a few\r\nrandom parting strokes before pocketing his weapon and going out\r\ninto the night.\"</i>\r\nToday Dorset Street has disappeared - it still exists but has no\r\nofficial name and is pedestianised. One side of Dorset Street is\r\nnow a car-park. Miller’s Court, which was on the opposite\r\nside of the street, no longer exists - the area is now occupied by\r\nthe back entrance to the London Fruit Exchange, the murder site\r\nbeing approximately half-way between the series of large green\r\nroller doors.\r\nConsider a visit to <i>The Ten Bells</i> while you are in the\r\nvicinity.

Prosperity may be\r\nchanging the character of the East End yet the melancholy air left\r\nby years of crime and poverty remains as you wander its\r\nstreets.\r\n<b>Victim 6???: Martha Tabram</b>\r\nMartha Tabram was murdered on 7 August 1888 in George’s\r\nYard, Whitechapel. Like the \"canonical victims\" (as they are\r\ncalled), Martha worked as a prostitute. She was last seen on the\r\nnight of her death in the company of two soldiers. Martha was\r\ndiscovered lying on the first floor of George’s Yard\r\nBuildings (a small tenement at the back of Whitechapel's Toynbee\r\nHall) in a pool of blood.\r\n\"Revisionist Ripperologists\" insist that Martha was not one of\r\nJack’s victims but it is important to note that at that time,\r\nmany believed that Tabram was in fact among his tally. <i>The\r\nTimes</i> of 10 September 1888, for example, referred to \"the\r\nslayer of TABRAN, NICHOLS, and CHAPMAN\". Tabram is now rarely\r\nincluded in the list of the Ripper's victims primarly because she\r\nwas stabbed to death by a large sharp implement (possibly a bayonet\r\nor sword) and she was not mutilated or disembowelled.\r\nAside from chronology and vicinity (she was killed less than\r\nhalf a mile from, and within a month of, Mary Nichols), why should\r\nMartha Tabram be considered as one of the Ripper’s victims?\r\nSome argue the position of her body is a clue: like Nichols,\r\nChapman and Eddowes, Martha was discovered lying on her back, her\r\nclothes dishevelled around her. The manner of her death is also\r\ntelling: the inquest was told that \"the bonnet was at the back of\r\nthe head. There was great disfigurement of the face. The throat was\r\ncut across and her stomach ripped open\".\r\nYet there is also evidence against: it seems that Tabram was\r\nmurdered by a right-handed killer when most Ripperologists believe\r\nJack was left-handed. So was Martha murdered by Jack the Ripper?\r\nWho knows… but it is possible.\r\nWhat cannot be denied is the sad fact that the fate of Jack the\r\nRipper’s victims was not unique. Many whores working in the\r\nEast End at that time were killed in violent circumstances. There\r\nwere many poor and destitute women who had no choice but to turn to\r\nprostitution to survive and to pay for the small comfort of a glass\r\nof gin. If it weren't for Jack the Ripper, the tale of Martha\r\nTabram would be lost forever and no-one would care. Nobody knows\r\nwhere she is buried and the man who hurt her was never caught.\r\nIt is for this reason that I have placed this cache. Cache 6 is\r\ndedicated to Martha Tabram and the other forgotten women that have\r\nno notoriety to ensure their memory stays alive. We all know the\r\nsaying - there but for the grace of God go I…\r\nToday George’s Yard no longer exists and the street itself\r\nhas been renamed. One way to access the murder site is to walk\r\nthrough one of Whitechapel’s famous covered passages past a\r\npub frequented by some of Jack’s victims (including Martha on\r\nthe night of her death) - and by some suspects too.\r\n<b>QUESTION:</b> The site of George’s Yard Buildings is\r\nnow occupied by a large modern red-brick building called\r\n\"<i>[blank]</i> House\".

You can start this ring\r\nfrom several places; the Wilton/Water Ditchampton end of Grovely,\r\nWishford and Barford St Martin but if you want to get the steepest\r\nhill climbing over early, start from Wishford. There are plenty of\r\nplaces for on road parking at Wishford. If you'r a patron of either\r\nthe Royal Oak or The Swan at Stowford I guess you could par in\r\nthere carpark but it may be as well to ask the Landlord\r\nfirst.<b>WARNING for those of a\r\nnervous disposition this is not a series to be attempted at dusk or\r\ninto the night. Sinister goings on occurred here nearly 300 years\r\nback with the Handsel Sisters being murdered in the woods and\r\nthere’s yet another worrying story concerning the Burcombe\r\nWoodsman. According to various Paranormal Teams, the effects can\r\nstill be felt today whilst walking in this part of Grovely Woods;\r\nso look behind you. You should have no problems in daylight; these\r\nwoods and the surrounding well walked countryside are beautiful,\r\nfilled with interesting history, wild animals, fauna and\r\nflora.</b>\r\nWhichever route you take whilst doing the series you will reach\r\nthe trees famed in the Handsel Sisters Story. They were 4 sisters\r\nof Danish origin who lived in the Wilton area. Unfortunately for\r\nthem a strong outbreak of smallpox erupted in 1737 in Wilton,\r\nclaiming 136 lives. The local people became convinced the Hansel\r\nsisters were responsible for the deaths and accused them of\r\nwitchcraft and an alliance with the devil. Without an official\r\nhearing the sisters were marched to Grovely and were murdered by\r\nbeing bludgeoned over the head. Each was buried in the woods a\r\nlittle way apart from each other so that they could not conspire\r\nagainst their murderers.\r\nWhilst doing these caches, if you’re observant, you will\r\nsee four incredibly ancient, gnarled beech trees, three of them\r\nabout 50 yds to the South of the Roman Road, the other I believe is\r\na little closer to Wilton on the other side of the road a similar\r\ndistance into the woods. There are two theories regarding these\r\ntrees, one being they were planted to mark the sisters’\r\ngraves. The other more worrying theory is that the trees\r\nmysteriously grew on top the unmarked graves to remind the locals\r\nof their dreadful deed. Since the atrocity many sightings of the\r\nsisters have been reported over the years. I’m told there is\r\na hollow at the back of the largest tree where people leave\r\nofferings for the Handsel sisters. Removal of such will cause\r\ndisastrous consequences for the perpetrators. For your safety no\r\ncache is hidden within those 4 beech trees.\r\nFor further information on Grovely, the Handsel Sisters and the\r\nBurcombe Woodsman <a href=\"http://www.twilightshadowsparanormal.com/grovelywoods.html\">visit\r\nthis webpage</a>.\r\nYet more information is to be found at<a href=\"http://Members.lycos.co.uk/grovelywoodghosts/\">visit this\r\nwebpage</a>\r\nDuring your walk you will pass through some gates in a few\r\nplaces, including one that’s a stretched barbwire type, a\r\nlittle strength required, please ensure you close these gates\r\ncorrectly as, although not always obvious there are usually cows or\r\nsheep in the associated fields.\r\nAll caches are placed on or within a few feet of public\r\nfootpaths, bridleways, etc. You will not need to walk deep into the\r\nwoods, remember game shooting starts on Oct 1st and it would be\r\nunadvisible for anyone to be wandering about well off the paths at\r\nsuch times. You should not need to climb fences or even stiles ;\r\nthis is all legal as it’s a public right of way but be\r\ncareful if cattle or sheep are grazing. Please be very careful if\r\nyou have children and dogs along.\r\nPlease note many of the difficulty ratings for this ring have\r\nbeen adjusted due to poor GPS reception under the tree cover. If\r\nyou use the hint generally you can knock 1 off the rating.\r\nWe hope you enjoy your visit and have success with the caches.\r\nPlease don’t let the stories above worry you, Rosie and I are\r\nvery frequent visitors to these woods and we have yet to see a\r\nghost there, just Deer, foxes and other wild animals, also plenty\r\nof unusual butterflies and birds; it’s a great place.

Failing that depending on your chosen route, if it’s not your lucky day, it could take as many as 17 finds to gather the values; good luck.\r\n\r\nBe warned comfortable footwear and walking boots are advisable when attempting the Ring. Some paths and tracks are steep in places for short distances and can be very muddy and rutted, particularly in the winter or after heavy rain. \r\n\r\nAll caches are placed on or within a few feet of public footpaths, bridleways, etc. You should not need to climb fences or even stiles, although you will be required to open and close a couple of field gates; this is all legal as it’s a public right of way but be careful if cattle or sheep are grazing.

Well, this is the closest high vantage point to the city centre, and sights such as Royal Crescent, Bath Abbey, etc are easily visible within the panorama. And why the worst ? Because the foreground is dominated by the grotesque 70’s shopping centre known as Southgate. It’s due to be redeveloped soon, so if you’re lucky you’ll see a building site instead. If you feel so inclined, take a picture and perhaps we’ll end up with a sequence showing the demolition &amp; rebuilding. Exactly where you come across the view depends upon which bits of tree growth B&amp;NES Council have trimmed back, and whether you’re doing this in summer or winter.\r\n\r\nAt Waypoint#2 – which just might be the best viewpoint – look for John Street.

On Friday March\r\n31st 1876, just after 2 p.m., a local train passed on the up line\r\ntowards Bath. It is considered possible that this train shook and\r\nso dislodged a big boulder. A few minutes later, on the opposite\r\nline, the West of England express from Paddington known as the\r\n'Flying Dutchman' (then the fastest train in the world) was\r\ntravelling towards Bristol at 50 m.p.h. There are two tunnels on\r\nthis part of the line, and as the express came out of the Bristol\r\nend of one of them its fireman saw a huge stone lying right across\r\nthe rails. In the same fleeting moment he saw a man trying to move\r\nit. By a superhuman effort the man managed to clear the line in\r\nspite of the enormous weight of the stone and so saved the whole\r\ntrain from almost certain disaster, for there is little doubt that\r\nit would have de-railed and rolled down the bank into the River\r\nAvon. However before he could get clear himself the engine struck\r\nand threw him a distance of eight or nine yards. On being picked up\r\nhe breathed just once and then quietly died. The train had been\r\nsaved by the courage of a man called Jack Chiddy, who at 47 lived\r\nin Hanham with his wife and seven children. A curious Brunel relic,\r\nthe Apple Stone is the name of the huge bolder that was taken from\r\nthe St Anne's Tunnel in Brislington and preserved by Brunel in\r\nmemory of Jack Chiddy. It is now clearly visible from Woodland\r\nRoad. .. but its plaque bears no mention of John Chiddy. Bristol\r\nUniversity had hoped to credit the Victorian hero, but British Rail\r\nhas no record to support his tale of heroism. Whilst steam trains\r\nrarely come this way, it is still exciting to stand here and\r\nwatch/listen to the trains come past.

Don’t feel constrained to start here, as access is possible from Hanging Langford via the Hollows footpath and from Baverstock; plus loads of other place if you want a really long walk. \r\n\r\nWhen walking the Ring series  each cache contains a vital bit of information, a value of A to E. As these values are repeated several times over the series, in theory you could have the required information with only 5 finds, although unlikely unless you are prepared to do much homework before you start. Failing that, depending on your chosen route, if its not your lucky day, it could take as many as 17 finds; good luck.\r\n\r\nIn order to find this Golden cache you must collect the values of A, B. C, D &amp; E. from the lids or log sheets within the series caches. If you want to do this Golden cache with the minimum number of finds on the ring that is possible by studying cache listings. Each listing contains a single clue to which letter is contained within a given cache; however, that process may take you a considerable time, possibly longer than walking the ring itself which is about 4 hours on a good day.  Be warned boots are advisable.

The canal company opened the quarry in 1803 against the advice of John Rennie.  His original estimate for building the canal was seriously exceeded, mostly because of the use of sub-standard stone, which the proprietors were insisting upon.\r\n\r\nA few years later the mine was on the market.  The Sherborne, Dorchester and Taunton Journal (23 April 1857) advertised the site as follows:-\r\n\r\n“FREESTONE QUARRY, NEAR BATH\r\n\r\nTO BE LET With Immediate Possession\r\n\r\nThe Celebrated MURHILL QUARRIES, ... Together with the right of WORKING THE CAPITAL BEDS OF FREESTONE, ... will be let ... a large Wharf and Landing Crane, on the bank of the Kennet and Avon Canal, ... with an Inclined Plane for delivering the Stone on the Wharf, from which there is direct Water Communication with London, Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea and South Wales. ...”\r\n\r\nThe limestone from Murhill Quarry was poor in comparison with materials worked further to the north.  However, despite the quality, stone was extracted and used through this section of the Kennet and Avon.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of the history, on with the cache.  From the suggested parking area take the footpath that leads down the hill to the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal.  Once at the bottom of the hill you need to carefully follow the footpath alongside of the Canal until you reach Waypoint 1.  As always, please take extra care with small children and dogs through this section.\r\n\r\nYou will find a bench commemorating the life of a certain Paul Joseph Rigby.  In time-honoured fashion, label the dates from the inscription A – H.  You should now have 8 numbers.\r\n\r\nComplete the equation to obtain the final cache coordinates.\r\n\r\nN.51. (A+E) (D) . (A+C) (E+H) (G-H)\r\nW.002. (C-A-E-H) (F-E-H) . (C) (C+A+H) (D)\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve calculated the final coordinates the rest, as they say is down to you.  The cache itself is a small Tupperware box in a camo bag.  Please re-hide carefully.\r\n\r\nAfter finding the cache and to complete the ‘loop’, simply carry on up the footpath until you reach civilisation.  Then turn left and follow the generally very quiet road back to the car.  However, as with the canal section, please ensure that small children and dogs are kept under a watchful eye, roads are roads after-all.","gc_num":"GC19JKW","gc_placer":"TeamSP","gc_cont_icon":"small","gc_issues":null,"gc_type":"Multi-cache","id":"a680bmy2wpif"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.2959,51.344833]}},{"properties":{"name":"Longwell Green Mega Series #5","timestamp":{"end_time":"2009/03/28 04:00:00 -0400","original":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","granularity":"hour","time":"2009/03/28 03:00:00 -0400"},"gc_terr_stars":"stars2_5","gc_placer_id":2187344,"gc_name":"Longwell Green Mega Series #5","gc_diff_stars":"stars2","gc_short_desc":null,"gc_long_desc":"This is number 5 of a 24 caches set up in a 7.43 mile circular walk most of the caches are set up in a distance ranging from 0.2 - 0.35 miles.

You may also like to take along some bread to feed the ducks.","gc_long_desc":"Nunney Castle is a small French style castle surrounded by a deep moat built for Sir John Delamare in 1373. A veteran of the Hundred Years War, Sir John would later become Sheriff of Somerset.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil Wars (1642-51) Cromwells men used cannons to blast a great hole in the North wall of the castle forcing the garrison to surrender. The damaged wall finally collapsed in 1910.\r\n\r\nDue to its small size and ruined interiors, there is not a great deal to see of the castle, but surrounded by the moat, it is an attractive feature in a pretty village.\r\n\r\nThe posted co-ordinates above take you to a sign.

The cache also starts off next to a busy road before finding the path. The cache is a small 1.5l Tupperware box.\r\n\r\nThe path runs along the route of the old Somerset and Dorset Railway Line than ran from Green Park station in Bath to Bournemouth. The line closed in 1966, but some of the line has been converted into a footpath running from Twerton through Oldfield Park to Bear Flat, and is known as the Linear Park. At Bear Flat, the railway went through the Devonshire Tunnel (447 yds long), then along Lyncombe Vale and into Combe Down Tunnel (1 mile long). Sadly, both of these tunnels are closed to the public, but the linear path does continue between the two. An organisation has been formed – The Two Tunnels Greenway which is campaigning to open these tunnels to the public, and to continue the linear path/cycleway all the way from Bath to join the Sustrans Path (NCN24) which exists at the other end of the Combe Down Tunnel. For more details see www.twotunnels.org.uk\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** As of 12th Dec 07, Sustrans Connect2 of which the Two Tunnels Project is a part, won the People's Lottery £50M vote. This now means that opening up the tunnels is much more of a possibility. Also planning permission was recently granted for the project.

The basic riff of the song was borrowed from the Homer Banks song \"(Ain't That) A Lot of Love\", written by Banks and William Dean Parker and later covered by blues musician Taj Mahal in 1968. The song was originally a hit in 1967 (UK #2; U.S. #7), when Steve Winwood, lead singer of the Spencer Davis Group at the time, was only 19 years old.
