Moving to Albany was almost like coming full circle.  My first apartment in Albany was a basement apartment in a row house on a street of late 19th century brick houses and brownstones in a neighborhood called Center Square.  It\\'s a great neighborhood.  In the snow it feels like something out of a Dickens novel.  Some of the houses have beautiful ironwork railings.  As evening deepens, you can imagine it by gaslight, the occasional horsedrawn carriage clopping slowly up the hill.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a632ya1pqtx9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.765381,42.653145]}},{"properties":{"name":"Albany Home #2","description":"Posted by Circus123 Ryckman Ave, Albany, NYWhen my partner decided to move in with me (all the way from Boston), we decided we couldn\\'t live together in my little one-bedroom basement apartment.  Especially since she was bringing two cats into the arrangement.  I\\'m not sure how we found this place; I think there might have been an ad for it in the paper.  In any case, it turned out that the previous occupants had been on vacation for a month before the move-out date, so I had to move in on the same day that they were moving out.  Their words of wisdom for me regarding the apartment?  \"Good luck.\"  I wanted to ask what they meant by it, but they said the place was fine.  I moved in (thanks to the help of a few good friends), and a week or two later I went to Boston, helped my partner load up her stuff, and we came back together.  The apartment was okay, but it turns out the landlord was not very responsive.  And he had several violations registered with Buildings &amp; Codes (I still remember the police Lieutenant saying, \"What are those other two doors up there?  What do you mean there are six apartments in this building?  He only has four registered...\").  We lost a neighbor to carbon monoxide poisoning (she didn\\'t die, she moved out), and the neighbor after her managed to blow up the oven (this was after we left).  We spent a year in this apartment.  I\\'m so glad we moved.  There is one thing I miss, though: the hallway.  Our younger cat was a kitten when we were living there, and she\\'d race up the hallway, chirping to herself, skid into the living room, and race back down to the bedroom.  It was more entertaining than television.

I sped back to Boston from Albany, paid off the ring she\\'d chosen ages ago (and on which I\\'d been making steady payments for months), went the library, and laid out some clues--envelopes containing cut up postcards with more clues written on the back.  When everything was set up, I sat back and watched as she went through my little Amelie-inspired treasure hunt kind of thing, and at the end, I met her on the front steps of the BPL with the ring in my pocket and proposed.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, it also happened to be Buddha\\'s Birthday.

When we did move, the quarters were much larger (I used to joke that the quarters at Dix were \"eighths\" because they were so small), and the two posts really couldn\\'t be any different.  Ft. Dix was a dry, hot hell in the middle of nowhere; Ft. Monmouth was green and set in a pleasant (and affluent) historic area near the Shore.  Our quaters on Ft. Monmouth were located across the street from the parade grounds, which were liberally fertilized by Canada geese for much of the year.  At the eastern end of the grounds was a square of concrete--a helicopter landing pad.  Visiting generals would be flown in by choppers that would land there (I remember seeing a lot of Hueys).

It was one of my first landmarks in Albany because of its distinctive UFO-like shape (and I\\'m sure this is the case for many transplants to the area).  Turns out it\\'s quite a nice performance space--two intimate auditoriums and not a single bad seat in the house.\r\n\r\nI was once told that there were three or four other buildings like this one in the world, and this is the only one left standing, the others having collapsed due to structural failure.  I don\\'t think this story is true (and the little bit of research I\\'ve done on it failed to turn up any evidence in the story\\'s favor).\r\n\r\nShows I\\'ve seen here so far: STREB!, Savion Glover (twice), the Dresden Dolls.\r\n\r\nShows I\\'m kicking myself for missing: Martin Sexton, the Indigo Girls.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a632ya9a1lxb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.758602,42.650406]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Orpheum","description":"Posted by Circus<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1 Hamilton Pl, Boston, MAI saw Martin Sexton play here.  It was an absolutely mindblowing show--I\\'ve never seen a two-person act with such depth and resonance.  His live CD, Live Wide Open, has since become one of my absolute favorites.

It\\'s very different from the coffee shops where I usually hang out, but the coffee\\'s good and the staff is excellent and occasionally they even play good music.  ;)  In all seriousness, there are few places in Albany that feel as comfortable and familiar to me as this place.  Good food, good coffee, free wifi, and plenty of space make this an almost ideal place to hang out and read or browse the \\'net on a rainy day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a632ya5qewo4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.829284,42.678744]}},{"properties":{"name":"We are here.","description":"Posted by Circus<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a632ya3fzm9e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.8103,42.65433]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/224117","metadata":null,"contact_name":"circus","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:circus","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/224117","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":37,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=224117,platial:user=circus","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":31013}
