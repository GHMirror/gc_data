This is because oiling a bird is a potential criminal offense. The feather sample and the bird (if it dies) are considered state evidence. After the bird is examined, there is a minimum of a 48 hour Oiled_murre_photo waiting period before it is washed. This is because it needs to be healthy enough to withstand the stress of being washed. When birds in the wild are oiled, their overall health rapidly deteriorates. They are debilitated either by the toxic effects of ingesting oil, or by exhaustion and starvation. Therefore, the chance that an oiled bird will survive decreases, as the length of time until the bird is rescued increases.\n\n<img src=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/oiled_murre_photo.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\">\nToday, the oiled Murre that came in on Saturday was ready to be washed. He had been hydrated, fed, and medicated for a couple days and appeared to be healthy enough. The black oil on the bird felt hard and caked on. It smelled very toxic. It was so sad to see such a beautiful, innocent creature in such a decrepit state. The actual washing (see video) took about a half hour and used a couple hundred gallons of water! The bird was very weak afterwards and was given IV fluids. He was then put in a specially designed, net bottom cage, with a warm dryer.\n\nThere are many different types of oil that can contaminate birds. One way to help decrease the amount of oil in the environment is to keep your car well-maintained to prevent oil and fuel leakage on the ground and in water. Or better yet, walk, cycle or even take the bus whenever possible!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b8b76x3ndw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/03/06 Handling a Brown Pelican","description":"Posted by Chris4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, caAn interesting question came up today about whether rescued birds know that you’re Handling_egrettrying to help them. The answer is usually a definitive, “no.” However, today at the IBRRC, a Snowy Egret, who was a former patient, returned and was hanging around outside. He appeared to be oiled. The rehab supervisors lured him into one of the outside aviaries by leaving a trail of fish to the door. He was then given his intake exam and evaluated for oiling. This sick egret probably came back because he knew the IBRRC was a good place to get some fish. JaySnowy_egret Holcomb, the director of the IBRRC, told me a story about another Egret who also returned to the center. He went right into the building and up on the couch. He had been cut all the way up his body. The bird seemed to know that the IBRRC was a safe place to go when he was hurt. However, most of the birds that are rehabilitated are pretty stressed and most likely see us as very large predators. Proper handling techniques help to minimize this, and help protect the handler and Pelican_in_peli_box_2the bird. Some people have compared their perspective to being abducted by aliens! It must be pretty scary for them, but the alternative, falling victim to predators, is pretty grim.\n\n<img src=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/oiled_murre_photo.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\">\n\n\nI also assisted with the intake of a Brown Pelican today. He was found on a beach with a possible injured wing. Handling a pelican proved to be a pretty tricky feat for a newcomer! Pelicans don’t seem that big until your right up next to them! While Michelle examined him, I had one one finger in between his bill and the rest of my fingers holding it closed. Since pelicans have undeveloped nostrils, holding their bills completely closed would prevent them from breathing. My other arm was wrapped around his body, which felt surprisingly like bubble wrap! They feel like bubble wrap because pelicans have internal air sacks beneath their skin and in their bones that aid in buoyancy. It was also pretty scary because he was a feisty bird. But at the IBRRC, feisty is considered to be a good sign...the meaner the better! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b8b7kwvkh6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/04/06 Washing an Oiled Snowy Egret","description":"Posted by Chris4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, caToday, for the first time, I assisted with the washing of an oiled bird. The Snowy Egret that had been readmitted to the IBRRC was healthy enough to undergo the washing procedure. I was really excited Egret_after_wash_1to be able to help. However, I was pretty nervous because I know you only have one shot to remove the oil from a bird. One wash is very stressful and can be life threatening for a bird. Making a mistake and leaving oil on the bird is not an option.\n\nDuring the wash, I assisted Jay Holcomb by handling the bird. Holding the bird and feeling its heart beating in my hands was like nothing I’ve ever experienced. You literally have the bird’s life in your hands. That is a huge responsibility. \n\nThis Egret was another bird that was the victim of incidental oiling. This is oiling that is result of regular human activities. This particular bird had food or vegetable oil on him that probably came from the back of a restaraunt. The washing of this one bird took so much time, care, and so many resources. It’s astounding to think of this being done on a grand scale, which would be the circumstances in an oil spill.\n\n<img src=\"http//pgbrands.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/egret_after_wash_1.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b8b7jndg0d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/05/06 Ruddy Duck Release","description":"Posted by Chris4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca<img src=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/ruddy_duck_hissing.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\">\n\nThe Ruddy Duck that had been attacked by a cat last week was ready for release today! She had needed a five day course of antibiotics. Cat claws carry bacteria Ruddy_duck_hissingthat can cause serious infections in birds. If you like ducks, you would love a Ruddy Duck. They are small and stout, only about a foot long. The Ruddy Duck at the IBRRC was a female. She had a grayish brown body with a dark bill and a dark cheek stripe. The males are really cool looking. They have a rust colored body, a blue bill and a white face with a black cap. They are so cute! And the best part about them is that when they’re angry, they hiss at you. I love the fact that they are so little and defenseless, but they still put up a fight! Apparently they hatch with an attitude problem. They come out of the egg hissing. I think Ruddy Ducks are my new favorite bird. I\\'m so happy that she was able to be released today (see video).\n\nIn the afternoon, I assisted Julie Burco, a Veterinarian and PhD candidate from UC Davis, with something that I chose not to post any pictures of... a necropsy. It was pretty gruesome. However, I am not that squeamish of a person, and as a biologist, I found it pretty interesting. Julie is researching better ways to test for Aspergillosis, a fungal infection. This is very important work because it is a life threatening infection in the airways of birds. This fungus is everywhere in the environment, but causes problems in birds (or even people) with compromised immune systems. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b8b76g03zw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"10/06/06 My Last Day","description":"Posted by Chris4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, ca<img src=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/bald_spots_murre.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\">\n\nToday was my last day at the IBRRC. I assisted Megan with washing of another oiled Murre today. Megan gave me an overview of all the proper holds to do when washing a bird. I felt more confident this time, since this was my second time assisting with a wash. During the wash, Megan Bald_spots_murre noticed that the oil had burned away some of the bird\\'s feathers. Oil can also burn the bird’s skin. This is so sad. It must be very painful for them. This Murre had crude oil on his feathers. One way he might have been contaminated is through sunken ships off the coastlines. These ships can seep oil and contaminate birds for years and years. One particular sunken ship is located off the coast of Santa Cruz and has been seeping oil for the past 2 years, and possibly the past 30 years!\n\nJay Holcomb had “coincidentally” asked everyone what their favorite dessert was yesterday. So today at lunchtime, the IBRRC staff presented me with an angel food cake with chocolate icing…yummy! They also gave me a certificate of adoption for the Ruddy Duck that we released yesterday. The adoption program at the IBRRC allows people to sponsor a bird, and in turn, watch the bird\\'s finalIbrrc_staff evaluation and Federal banding. They then get to accompany the IBRRC staff to the bird’s release at a local site and actually open the cage to set the bird free! The donations raised from the adoption program help fund the rehabilitation program and go directly to animal care.\n\nI feel so grateful that I was able to have a glimpse into an extraordinary world that is ordinary to these special people. The people who work in animal rehab have a passion and deep yearning to help these injured animals. It was wonderful to be in the presence of people who really make a difference. The next stop in my adventure is the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, CA.

There were three new patients today, including two Mallard Ducks and a Western Gull. There was a female brown pelican in the intensive care unit that required a lot of care. She was severely emaciated with a broken wing. Megan, the rehabilitation assistant manager, alternated fluids with gavage (tube) feedings throughout the day.\n\nThe Murres that we cared for yesterday were doing much better today. One of the Murres was brought in two weeks ago with oil spots that caused her feathers to lose their waterproofing. She was then unable to feed because of the risk of freezing in the water. Also, since aquatic birds are not meant to spend so much time on land, she developed sores on her feet and hocks. She was washed with Dawn to remove the oil and the rehab supervisors bandaged her feet. This gave her a chance to work on her waterproofing by Bandagedmurre_20_2preening herself without hurting her feet. She was then put in a warm pool so she could work on wet spots on her feathers without getting too cold. Finally, she was transferred to the cold pool where birds normally preen intensively for several minutes (see video). Today, she was swimming in the cold pool and eating fish with the rest of the Murres. It was great to see that all the hard work and care paid off.\n\nThis Murre was th e victim of incidental oil. This occurs from oil that gets into the waterways from regular human activities, instead of a major oil spill. One way to help prevent this is to avoid topping off at the gas pump. This can cause gas to spill onto the ground. The residue can then end up in the ocean where these animals live. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b8b79z0psn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.083822,38.228354]}},{"properties":{"name":"9/29/06 Imping Gives Birds with Broken Feathers a Chance","description":"Posted by Chris4369 Cordelia Road, fairfield, caThere was good news at the IBRRC today. The Murres that we had been rehabilitating were going to be prepared for release tomorrow! In addition to their regular care and rehabilitation, they all had to be tagged with federal bands. This is a US Fish and Wildlife leg band that is used to identify and monitor the bird after release to its natural habitat.\n\nSince the Murres are now able to eat solid food, they are fed night smelt. Nightsmelt_1Most of the patients at the IBRRC are fed this type of fish because of its very low oil content. Sources of oil are eliminated in every area possible. Fish and vegetable oils are very hard to remove from feathers. That\\'s why it\\'s important to place cooking oils and fats in a sealed container in the garbage instead of pouring them down the kitchen drain.\n\n<img src=\"http://pgbrands.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/murres_feeding_1.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\">\n\nToday I learned about a very specialized practice called imping. This involves grafting donor feathers onto the shaft of broken feathers of birds that would otherwise have no chance of survival (kind of like a hair transplant). This practice gives the birds a chance to survive in the wild until their natural molting process replaces the broken feathers. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t work well on diving birds because the glue that is used for grafting breaks down. Maybe someone will invent something that will hold in the water.

I am not sure what BBC meansÑperhaps Òbuy better clothesÓ because you can certainly do that for less here. The displays are so good and the clothes in such top condition that at first I wasnÕt completely sure these were used things.  The buyers certainly edit with good taste. Insider tip: new stuff comes in on Thursdays and sometimes on Monday. This is one of several stores with the same owners but the salesperson told me this location got the best stuff. Prices are surprisingly affordable. They had a large collection of cowboy shirts for  each and many bowling and Hawaiian shirts. I also saw reasonably priced Kimonos and leather jackets. I bought a black cowboy shirt  () with snaps and a fabulous black sheer crepe shirt () that my fashion forward friend coveted.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b8b7ent1hg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.493747,34.017553]}},{"properties":{"name":"BUFFALO EXCHANGE","description":"Posted by Chris<img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2381/2164575965_ec06a601a3.jpg?v=634\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 131 N.

The hour and the fact that it was Greek independence day conspired to make the city nearly silent and smogless under a starry sky.  \nLight was rising in the east as I arrived at the pass between the Acropolis and Filopappou hill. The fence around the Acropolis was locked - opening time was still hours away - so I wandered up onto a rocky outcrop offering an open view to the west.\n\nAthens is a white city - the buildings are white with little exception, and it is surrounded on three sides by mountains of white stone. I brought out my Wallace Stevens as the basin filled with light - some phrases: \"the ancient tree in the centre of its cones\"... \"squeezing the reddest fragrance from the  stump of summer\".\n\nThe pinkishh sunlight crept down over the mountains to \nthe sharp edge of the city. It seemed a fractal cubist landscape out of Esher. Two men joined me on the  rock. One looked steadily down, holding his arm, and it seemed was bleeding, while the other spoke seriously to him.\n\nThey departed, the sun reached my perch, and 100 yards behind me a small crowd gathered as the time for the opening of the gates of the Acropolis  approached.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6b8b7gzga08"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.723227,37.97235]}},{"properties":{"name":"Berda Paradise Thrift Store","description":"Posted by Chris<img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2381/2164575965_ec06a601a3.jpg?v=236\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 3506 W.

Some experienced, some virgin vendors (I mean their first time out, you canÕt buy virgins here) sell antiques, vintage clothing, crafts and junque in the school parking lot. The last two times I was there, there were bands and some decent food for sale. Admission is .00 but worth every penny for the people watching even if you do not buy anything.

The Inn was originally called Hoff\\'s Mill, named for an early founder of the area now known as Pittstown. The Lawrence Hoff farm was a large holding, which included the property where the Kingwood Presbyterian Church now stands. Pittstown was known, in fact, as Hofftown in the 1700\\'s. The name was changed during the revolution to honor William Pitt, Earl of Chatham. \r\n\r\nIn those days, the local tavern served as an informal Town Hall and community center. Local taverns like the Hoff\\'s Mill Inn also served as stagecoach stops, mail delivery points, and lodging for travelers.\r\n\r\nThe tavern was reopened in 1800 by Moore Furman. Furman had purchased most of the village prior to the Revolution. He was Deputy Quartermaster General for the Revolutionary Army and used Pittstown as his supply depot. During the war, Pittstown was important in furnishing supplies to General Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Inn was almost completely destroyed in a fire in 1913. Known then as the Century Hotel and owned by L.N. Burnham, the entire contents were destroyed, leaving only the 18\" walls. According to a letter written by Mr. Burnham\\'s daughter, the bartender had left a lantern atop a whiskey barrel in the cellar, which then exploded. The building was gutted but the owners rebuilt the interior, repointed the stone walls, and were back in business in 7 months. Still open and operating today!

I donÕt know who they originally belonged to, but I am glad they are mine now. I bought a Todd Oldham pieced vest that was priced at 8 at The Address (I am sure it was at least 00 to start) but I found it in the very back marked down to 4. I also found another patched silk vest that was a wonderfully unique. And by buying the second one for 5, I got a third piece free, an Escada blazer with an iridescent finish.
