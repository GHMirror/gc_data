It\\'s such a great, human-scale town. Nice people, nice atmosphere, great food. Sergio\\'s is an example of what I mean. It\\'s exactly like the Italian stores my mother took us to as kids. Her favorite was the Italian Food Center on Grand Street in NYC and I think Sergio can go toe to toe with that place any day. They have great home made Mozzarella. They have wonderful bread. The cold cuts are the premium brands and their salads are fresh and made in house. They have daily specials that are put up on a chalk board - just like you would if you owned a place like this. My favorite dish is a regular sandwich made with either grilled or breaded and fried chicken, mozzarella, peppers on a semolina roll (I think it\\'s a number 7). My wife and i split one for lunch on Saturdays - dousing it with balsamic vinegar and washing it down with San Pelligrino. Try it, you\\'ll like it.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tlqpqif6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.477455,40.892193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks - Basking Ridge","description":"Posted by Dougherj<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 655 Martinsville Road, Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920coffee, small excursion from path to GRC\r\nOn way, pass 287 to next exit (Liberty Corners Rd), take left (N)\r\nComing back, Exit from 287 at Mt Airy Rd, take south to Starbucks, then I-78\r\n908-626-1945<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tlsl5vwp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.575568,40.651793]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks - Denville","description":"Posted by Dougherj<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 2 Broadway, Denville, New Jersey 07834 Near Italian place 973-983-7881 \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tm0e628a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.478619,40.892707]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks - New Paltz","description":"Posted by Dougherj<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> 1 Plattekill Ave, New Paltz, NYCoffee 845-256-9815 \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tlsixfit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.084721,41.747843]}},{"properties":{"name":"Take I-287N","description":"Posted by Dougherj<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tloqpufn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.649117,40.641459]}},{"properties":{"name":"Take I-78 east","description":"Posted by Dougherj<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tlu9dz8p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.42891,40.553331]}},{"properties":{"name":"Turn Right at Buhrmaster Rd, left at River Rd.","description":"Posted by DougherjBest path to River Road<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tlxdypra"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.804479,42.764579]}},{"properties":{"name":"Turn onto I-87 to Albany","description":"Posted by Dougherj<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a740tlq5r8u1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.161749,41.118709]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/4170","metadata":null,"contact_name":"dougherj","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:dougherj","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/4170","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":16,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=4170,platial:user=dougherj","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":42585}
