Following the purchase of the estate by the new Kingdom of Italy in 1872 (to remain a royal preserve until 1946) the excavation were taken up again from 1874 until about 1913, during which almost the whole of three blocks and two sides of the forum square were uncovered. The work was systematic, with a railway line to carry off spoil and archaeologists from the state antiquities service on hand, such as Pietro Rosa, Antonio Pasqui, and Rodolfo Lanciani, and may have been well documented at the time. The only records yet found, however, are some photographs taken when a large black-and-white mosaic was lifted in sections and installed in the Museo Nazionale Romano in Rome in 1903-11 (it was returned to the estate in 2004). Lanciani included a short account in his popular book Wanderings in the Roman Campagna (1909) and sent two brief written reports to the London journal The Athenaeum in 1911-13; a few notes and sketches exist among his personal papers in the Istituto Nazionale di Archeologia e Storia dell\\'Arte in Rome and in the Vatican Library. Otherwise, the principal sources are the remains still visible on the ground, left exposed at the end of the excavations. Although buried in dense vegetation and under tree cover which has grown up over the site in the last hundred years, many walls are standing to considerable heights.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Classics/LaurentineShore/VicusAugustanus/VC_Bibliography.html\">Bibliography</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j7r8s2nj3x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.33619,41.71739]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/91415","metadata":null,"contact_name":"fhg1711","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:fhg1711","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/91415","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":5,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=91415,platial:user=fhg1711","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":46939}
