I was impressed that it did a nice pace of business on New Year\\'s Day when other spots have closed up for the holiday. It was a pleasure to dig into this ground beef delight. Mark and I brainstormed ideas on how to replicate the rice - butter, saffron, curry, something? This dish reminded me of my first taste of koufta sandwiches in Paris. Just around the corner from our flat in the 3rd arrondisment, a Lebanese food stand kept serving food past 1 AM. It was the perfect antidote to jet lag. I ended up boxing Mark\\'s dish, the kifta meal, simply because I loved the sauce - savory blend of butter-like herbs and broth.\n\nDuring my DC quarter, I always had a craving for koufta and now I think I found a new place in Kansas to cure my new craving for kifta. It\\'s probably a good thing I didn\\'t give up meat for the New Year. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dk6eb4fwgb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.23593,38.965414]}},{"properties":{"name":"Applebees Pit Stop in Hays, Kansas","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/applebees.jpg\">4101 N Vine St, Hays, KSSpring 2005...\nSo by day 3, Mark and I agreed to do more touristy things.

A football match played on the television set and tables were crowded with families and double dates. Cozy, but not loud. I ordered the 3 tacos entree with a few bottles of Dos Equis. My tacos were loaded with chroizo, carne asada and carnitas. The tomatillo sauce burnt my lips off...painful, but a tasty burn.The chroizo tasted spicy and crispy. The carnitas were too dry and stringy for my taste. My favorite taco was the carne asada with the meat all smoky, juicy and a little greasy.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dk6ehlbich"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.743561,39.0162]}},{"properties":{"name":"Frances O'Dooley's Irish Pub","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/boxty.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/oatmealapple.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/1/clover.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 1930 SW Westport Dr, topeka, ksO\\'Dooley\\'s features live Irish music on Fridays... and the crowd joins in with hoots, refrains and to-the-beat clapping. It sounded like the \"Irish Rebel\" indulged in some American pub tunes as well. I ordered Guinness for my appetizer. For my main dish, I had an Irish Boxty with steak and mushrooms. The steak is slathered in a super-rich sauce. It\\'s all wrapped up in a potato pancake - which helps soak up the dense flavors.\n\nLast fall, I also enjoyed this oatmeal apple crisp while watching the Sunflower Showdown with a KU-friendly crowd. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dk6eor8647"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.756676,39.031823]}},{"properties":{"name":"Globe Indian in Topeka","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/globalindian.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/01/0/globalindian_2_.jpg\">117 SE 10th Ave, topeka, ks 66612In Feb. 2006, we checked out the Globe Indian restaurant in downtown Topeka. One of the photogs said it had a great lunch buffet. This place had a great selection of dishes. Service was a bit slow for the the small population of diners - but I think that’s because they didn’t have enough waiters working. The Spinich Paneer was quite tasty. The cheese had a nice chewy texture to sop up the greens.\n\nThen my favorite dish - Chicken Tikki Masala. It’s a great introduction entree to Indian cuisine. Not as spicy as some places…A cheesy tomatoe sauce with the marinated chicken. I loved dipping the paneer nan (cheese bread) into the sauce….and both dishes were great as microwaved leftovers.\n\nOverall - Globe Indian is a user-friendly spot - it’s a good idea for folks who haven’t tried Indian food. It has familar flavors integrated into complicated spices. If anyone wanted to go veggie in Topeka - Globe Indian has some fantastic choices for the hippie in all of us. It’s not gourmet (at least not with the dishes I’ve tried in California or London) - but it could become comfort food for me. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6dk6eg7189e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.675521,39.045848]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ixtapa","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\" href=\"http://brain.queenkv.org\">Queenkv</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/ixtapa.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/0/ixtapa2.jpg\">2016 W. 23rd St., Lawrence, 66046I had a tasty Mexican dessert at Ixtapa. Since I spent my honeymoon at the beach resort town of Ixtapa, Mexico, I wondered if I\\'d find entrees from the region inside this Lawrence restaurant, like tritas or pozole. But I found nothing outside of your typical American-Mexican menu, tacos, burritos and nachos. Still, I enjoyed this fried ice cream dish. The bread crumbs stayed warm around a ball of vanilla ice cream.

We started off with an assortment of crostini. This one is topped off with white anchovies. OK - I typically don\\'t order anchovies...but I remember having white anchovies as a starter dish with Susan and Tom at the Blue Plate in San Francisco. When served up with olive oil - the white anchovies had a lovely smoky flavor. Not too fishy. I wasn\\'t disappointed with my crostini at Ole Tapas - a clean flavor, with smoky tones. Biting into the crunchy white bread and the fleshy fish became a delicious blend of textures and hearty flavors in my mouth.\nWe also had the house meatballs - in a creamy saffron sauce. Yummy!

Our car blocked the northbound traffic as we attempted to play \"Frogger\" through the opposite lane of traffic and into Rosa\\'s parking lot. I think it was worth it.\n\nI ordered the Torta Combo with carnitas. I\\'ve tried two other Mexican restaurants in Topeka and both disappointed me with their dry and stringy carnitas dishes. Rosa\\'s Torta had succulent pork pieces marinated in savory sauce with a touch of citrus goodness - laid out on a toasty bun. I also enjoyed the fried potatoes with the extra guacamole. Then our server asked if we had room for dessert. We said maybe and he brought out sopapillas. I usually want to share my dessert but this was one of the few times I could finish up my own serving of sopapillas - drizzled with honey and cinnamon.

I went over to Seabrook Tavern on 21st for lunch yesterday.\n\nFriendly folks serving up greasy American burgers and sandwiches. Seabrook\\'s is for people willing to ignore the diet and settle down for some classic meaty meals. And there must be something healthy about the homemade potato chips. (I hope) ... maybe a basket of chips lack the same mix of synthetic ingredients, MSG and whatever else is tossed into name brand chips. Maybe. Our dining party consisted of my hubby and myself - so we passed on the mega \"Specks Burger\". I once saw Washburn fans devour a Specks Burger a few months ago. It looked like a burger that demanded respect and a hearty appetite.\n\nI had the 1/4 lb House Burger - with American cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms heaped on top that yummy patty.
