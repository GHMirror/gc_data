The food is somewhat okay, but when you want to play soccer or volleyball in the sand the workers are all for it!

What can I say? Well my family and I were all planning to go down there to watch my parents get married, but we went right after Hurrican Emily, so they didnt. There was two feet left of the beach, and we stayed for a week, which was way too long. Although we did find this little whole in the wall place off the side of a cliff. My dad, my brother(who at the time was 8), and myself all jumped off this fifty foot cliff straight into the ocean. It was scary, but amazing all at the same time. After you jumped you had to swim into this cave, where apparently pirates found a lot of treasure and they used to stay there all the time, and climb back up on this really big ladder. We also climbed Dunn River Falls while we were down there, It was pretty cool, but something I would not advise doing twice.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ptu1jktps0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.3657226562,17.9578321023]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jos Van Dyke","description":"Posted by Anastasibarnes7To be honest I went here with my family just to go to the bars there.

I have actually decided to take a year off college and live down there for the year and work as a bartender at the bay. The second time we went was because of the cruise, and we knew exactly where we wanted to go, and spent the whole day there. The thing I love most about this place is you can walk out into the ocean and see your feet and the fish that come up to you or around you, and the sand in the ocean is really soft.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ptu1inlwft"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-64.7946166992,17.7042116416]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/293356","metadata":null,"contact_name":"anastasibarnes7","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:anastasibarnes7","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/293356","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=293356,platial:user=anastasibarnes7","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":46461}
