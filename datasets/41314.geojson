In Latin America there is poverty and definately some heartache, but it is also a smorgasbord of culture.

There are a bunch of lagoons spread out all over the place, some of which you can swim in.  Then a short drive away there are a bunch of petrified sand dunes that you can climb all over.  Also, we stayed in a hotel with AC (whoah) and had a party with a mariachi band and bbq and everything.  Great fun.  Oh yeah, and our bus got stuck in the sand and we got to stay an extra night.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67f389to3m4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-102.56836,27.91677]}},{"properties":{"name":"Guanajuato","description":"Posted by Jfishe16<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/DSCF0357.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/DSCF0363.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/DSCF0359.JPG\">guanajuatoI went to Guanajuato for the International Cervantino Festival.

Also, they have lots of museums, including one of mummies.  I thought this would be cool, but it was actually pretty gross.
