May be the best one!\n\nMaranjab\n\nWe were 11, in 3 cars, and we really were tired...\n\nWe really had a lot of fun in that trip.\nYou see just our \"before sleeping\" time, after a whole day of activity, started from 3:30am!\nWe had a long travel from Tehran to Kashan, and then to Maranjab (about 320km - 3 links are 3 flickr maps); Then we were in a salt lake, in sand dunes, in an ancient caravansary, in a camel farm, in some desert jungle, and some other interesting places inside desert that day, and in night time, after we found that we got lost in desert, two shepherds found us, and invited us to their humble house, which is the room you can see in this shot.\nYes, we seem to be very tired, but we were really enjoyed that day.\nYou can ask all attendants. Everyone whom I asked this question, answered that \"it was his/her best trip all over his/her life\"...!\n\nYes, it looks uncomfortable here. Too small, not so clean, no place for lie down. But this was their best!\nOur hosts were two poor shepherds, and this room was their house. I don\\'t think that any of us could forget their kind hospitality. They didn\\'t have anything, but they brought us and gifted us all their \"any things\"...\nThey shared their food with us. One of them played a hand made instrument and sanged an Afghan song for us. They brought us thier super young (1 or 2 days old) gouties just for play and to be happy with.\n\nHere is Mojtaba\\'s small video from the same place at the same time. You can here Jafar playing his hand made instrument, and visit the whole room:\nvideo.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6124232689752761106\n\nI really missed those two kind shepherds........................................ :\\'(\n\nYou can see all of us (except me and Mojtaba) in this shot.\n\nThe reason for uploading this memorable shot is that Kelly has uploaded some of her own photographs of this place, and eagered me for looking back to that old album, and start uploading some of them.\n\nCheck Kelly\\'s shots of Iran here:\nwww.flickr.com/photos/kellyphotos/sets/72157594519162885/\n(Yet they\\'re all from Maranjab desert)\n\nAnd my own set:\nwww.flickr.com/photos/hamed/sets/72157600049074276/\n\nSome other related worth-to-click links are:\nMy Meetups Collection\nTag search for Flickr meetups\nTag search for group shots\n\nI don\\'t want to explain the situation. I think Kelly\\'s captions and descriptions are perfect, and it\\'s better for me to keep quiet :)\n\nStart Kelly\\'s story here:\nwww.flickr.com/photos/kellyphotos/380619457\nand click \"the story continues\" to continue. I think the story has more than 50 parts up to now!\n\nThanks Kelly! <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6avvhv3spk1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.619218,41.867176]}},{"properties":{"name":"social","description":"Posted by Jeffreykolar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/12/0/social.jpg\">Houtmarkt 62, 7201 KM Zutphen, NetherlandsLocation_01:\n\\'t Volkshuis\n\nHoutmarkt 62, 7201 KM Zutphen, Netherlands\n+31 575 513580\n\nLocation_02:\n   \nscript type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\ndeviantART.pageData={\"for_Cookies\":{\"link\":\"http://search.deviantart.com/?section=browse&amp;qh=boost:popular age_sigma:24h age_scale:5&amp;q=social\",\"label\":\"Search: social\",\"q\":\"social boost:popular age_sigma:24h age_scale:5\",\"offset\":\"0\",\"qx\":\"1\"},\"user\":{\"symbol\":\"\",\"username\":\"\"},\"xwatch_uname\":\"mi4\",\"fullview\":{\"width\":\"700\",\"height\":\"467\",\"src\":\"http://fc05.deviantart.com/fs8/i/2006/165/b/5/_this_fine_social_scene_by_mi4.jpg\"},\"smallview\":{\"width\":300,\"height\":200,\"src\":\"http://tn3-2.deviantart.com/fs8/300W/i/2006/165/b/5/_this_fine_social_scene_by_mi4.jpg\"},\"deviationid\":\"34748277\",\"catpath\":\"photography/journalism/misc\",\"pimp_deviation_artist\":\"mi4\"}\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6avvi1zjaih"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[6.196216,52.14115]}},{"properties":{"name":"sound","description":"Posted by Jeffreykolar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/12/0/sound.jpg\">Sound, Shetland IslandsLocation_01:\nSound, Shetland Islands\nUK\n\nLocation_02:\nTags\n\n Bronica\n EC-TL\n Nikkor\n 50mm\n f2.8\n Portra800\n Zenza Bronica\n 120 film\n Medium Format\n 6x6\n Square\n Kodak\n simon\n hairy\n relax\n Dog\n Close Up\n Basenji\n portrait\n SOE\nAdditional Information\n\n © All rights reserved\nTaken on May 8, 2007\n317 people call this photo a favorite\nViewed 4,937 times\nThis photo is public<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6avvi3fsnra"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.171701,60.143145]}},{"properties":{"name":"study.","description":"Posted by Jeffreykolar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/12/0/study.jpg\">745 W Main St Watertown, WI 53094Location_01:\nMaranathata Baptist BibleAddress:\n\n745 W Main St\nWatertown, WI 53094\n(920) 261-9300\n\nLocation_02:\nStudy Rug - Floral (3\\'6\"x5\\'6\") \n\n98.99\nQuantity:  \n\n\n\n\nSign-in for 1-Click\n\n\n\nAdd to TargetLists - alternate view.\n \n\n \nAvailability :\nUsually ships within 3 to 5 days\nThis item is available online, but is not available in stores.\n\n\nThere are 4 buttons in the next section, to make the tab readable click it and navigate past the buttons.

The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act requires that at least 33 percent of international HIV-prevention funds support abstinence-until-marriage programs. These programs withhold information about safer sex, condoms, and the risks of HIV transmission within marital relationships —information that could save the lives of millions of young people in AIDS-affected countries throughout the world. I therefore urge you to support legislation that would redirect this spending toward proven interventions that guarantee young people complete information about HIV prevention, including the use of condoms.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6avvi1ynnfp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.781175,36.054434]}},{"properties":{"name":"you","description":"Posted by Jeffreykolar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/12/0/you.png\">Location_01:\nInto You\n\n144 St. John St\nLondon, EC1V 4UA, UK\n\n+44 20 72535085\n\nLocation_02:\nYouChoose   |   Debates\nThe Issues\n Education  Energy  Healthcare  Immigration  Iraq  The Economy\n \n Democrats\n\nJoe Biden\nIntroduction \n\nHillary Clinton\nIntroduction \n\nChristopher Dodd\nIntroduction \n\nJohn Edwards\nIntroduction \n\nMike Gravel\nIntroduction \n\nDennis Kucinich\nIntroduction \n\nBarack Obama\nIntroduction \n\nBill Richardson\nIntroduction \n Republicans\n\nRudolph Giuliani\nIntroduction \n\nMike Huckabee\nIntroduction \n\nDuncan Hunter\nIntroduction \n\nJohn McCain\nIntroduction \n\nRon Paul\nIntroduction \n\nMitt Romney\nIntroduction \n\nTom Tancredo\nIntroduction \n\nFred Thompson\nIntroduction <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6avvhwbo1e2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.104549,51.534364]}},{"properties":{"name":"you","description":"Posted by Jeffreykolar<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/12/0/you_2_.png\">144 St. John StLocation_01:\nInto You\n\n144 St. John St\nLondon, EC1V 4UA, UK\n\n+44 20 72535085\n\nLocation_02:\nYouChoose   |   Debates\nThe Issues\n Education  Energy  Healthcare  Immigration  Iraq  The Economy\n \n Democrats\n\nJoe Biden\nIntroduction \n\nHillary Clinton\nIntroduction \n\nChristopher Dodd\nIntroduction \n\nJohn Edwards\nIntroduction \n\nMike Gravel\nIntroduction \n\nDennis Kucinich\nIntroduction \n\nBarack Obama\nIntroduction \n\nBill Richardson\nIntroduction \n Republicans\n\nRudolph Giuliani\nIntroduction \n\nMike Huckabee\nIntroduction \n\nDuncan Hunter\nIntroduction \n\nJohn McCain\nIntroduction \n\nRon Paul\nIntroduction \n\nMitt Romney\nIntroduction \n\nTom Tancredo\nIntroduction \n\nFred Thompson\nIntroduction <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6avvhzfrrzr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.454356,40.594287]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/73007","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jeffreykolar","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jeffreykolar","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/73007","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":55,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=73007,platial:user=jeffreykolar","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":29121}
