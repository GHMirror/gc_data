Castillo de San Marcos \nstands today as the oldest fort in the United States. This fort was built over 100 years after the founding of St. Augustine, the oldest city in the U.S. today. The city and fort were founded by the Spanish, who remained in Florida until 1821.\n\n     In all its history, the fort has never been taken by force. However, it has been occupied by the Spanish, British, and Americans. This fort has been well-preserved, and represents the battle between the aforementioned nations for control of Florida. \n\n     The fort overlooks Matazanas Bay, and was built to protect Spanish treasure fleets. It walls are made of coquina and stand 33-feet high, 12-feet thick. The fort has a moat and drawbridge. It was made a national monument in 1924, and ever since then it has been one of the lasting impressions of St. Augustine, Florida, withstanding the colonizing of our nation, preserving every step of our history.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccvg51bqs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.314722,29.894444]}},{"properties":{"name":"Christ Redeemer Statue","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/r1.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/0/r2.JPG\">Rio de Janeiro     Overlooking Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Christ Redeemer statue is one of the world’s best known monuments. It stands as a representation of Jesus with his arms wide open. The statue is 38 meters tall. One hand weighs about five tons. The statue sits atop the Corcovado mountain, also known as the humpback mountain.\n \n     The statue finds its early beginnings in 1859. Father Pedro Maria Boss, awed by the beauty of the mountain and its surrounding area, suggested that a religious monument be built to honor Princess Isabel. The dream became idea in 1921. \n     After many years of planning, in 1927, construction began after years of modeling. The final design was created by artist Carlos Oswald and sculptor Paul Landowski. The statue was inaugurated on October 12th, 1931. Since then, it has become a symbol of the city, welcoming all the many visitors. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccvh1582n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-43.2,-22.909999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Church of the Divine Wisdom (hagia sophia)","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/1240428213_52c4b6a4ba.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/2255671517_186be455f0_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/1241294488_43bfc15c57.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/1241295370_7bf7a3f6f6.jpg\">Hagia Sophia was built by Justinian in 532 A.D., completed in 537 A.D. Its architecture reflects that of the advanced 6th century Byzantine capital. Before the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, it was one of the world\\'s greatest churches. The ottomans converted the church into a mosque, painting over paintings of the holy family. In 1935 it became a museum. Today the Christian mosaics have been uncovered and stand next to the 15th-century Muslim renovations. \r\nThe most significant architectural highlights of the Hagia Sophia is the 105-ft dome towering about 200 ft above when you enter, and the elaborate mosaics, common to the Byzantine style.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccvcwlsnh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.15625,37.4399740523]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Castillo","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/326078907_7545f2e878.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/el_castillo.JPG\">Chichen Itza, MexicoEl Castillo, the Pyramid of Kulkulkan, is located in Chichen Itza, a site containing some of the most intact ruins of ancient Mayan civilization.\r\nThis pyramid is a lasting symbol of Mayan myth and natural astronomical cycles. Two of the four sides of this 79-foot high structure have been restored. It has 365 steps, one for each day of the year. There are 91 steps in each of the four sections, which is repersentative of the 91 days between the phases of the solar cycle; winter solstice, spring equinox, summer solstice, and fall equinox.\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1000 A.D., it is now famous for a phenomenon which occurs at the fall and spring equinox. The light and shadows of the setting sun, give the appearance of a snake winding its way down the pyramid. The ancient Maya may have viewed this as their god Kulkulkan, the feathered serpant. The minds of the ancient Maya at the creation of this wonder is a mystery, a mystery adding to the appeal of this pyramid.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccv8bxhje"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.449444,20.641539]}},{"properties":{"name":"Giant Ferris Wheel","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/2135653836_40428ce0df.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/317102230_dd036ebd5c.jpg\">Vienna, AustriaThe Giant Ferris Wheel located in Prater’s Amusement Park in Vienna, Austria is one of the most well-known symbols of the city, with over 750,000 visitors a year. It was built in 1897, originally constructed by British engineer Walter Basset. It has been updated several times, especially after the war. Because it was esteemed so much by the Viennese people, it was one of the first buildings they rebuilt. Although at the time Ferris Wheels such as Riesenrad, as it is known by natives, were commonly found in London, Paris, and Blackpool, it is the only one to survive from its era.\r\n\tThe structure weighs 430 tons overall, standing at a height of 34 meters. Light effects have been added so that the clock flashes on the hour the correct number of times, alerting the city the time. From the top, there is a view of the entire city. It was constructed to celebrate the 50th jubilee of Emperor Franz Joseph I.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccvdewaut"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.37,48.220001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meenakshi Temple","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/106091763_4787638a13.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/2055577111_c9182de46e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/153519489_b157cfb876.jpg\">The Meenakshi temple is a Hindu temple in the Tamil Nadu city of Madurai, named after the Princess Meenakshi in Hindu mythology.  \r\nThe temple is within a high-walled enclosure, surrounded by smaller shrines and halls. \r\nIt is most known for 12 towers at the four corners of the gateway entrance with solid granite bases, covered with stucco figures of deities, mythical animals and monsters painted in vivid colors.\r\nThe East Tower has 1011 sudhai figures.

Montgomery, and the center of inspiration for <u>Anne of Green Gables</u>, as well as other books of hers. In Cavendish one can visit the home said to inspire the book. It is Canada\\'s smallest province, but also one of the most visited. Its sustenance is mainly tourism and agriculture. The island has been home to the Mi\\'kmaq, an aborigine tribe, the French, and the British. About 62 percent of the population is rural. The first european to set foot on the island, Jacques Cartier, called it \"The most beautiful stretch of land imaginable\". The island is a tourist trap with over 800 km of beaches, rocky red cliffs, and quaint towns. \r\n\r\nIt has been called the \"Garden of the Gulf\", the \"Million-Acre Farm\", the \"Cradle of Confederation\", and \"Spud Island.\" It is called \"Million-Acre Farm\" and \"Spud Island\" because of its rich, red soil suitable for agriculture, such as potatoes. Also, over half the island is in use for farming. It is called the \"Cradle of Confederacy\" because its largest city, Charlottetown, was home to the 1864 conference which sparked the Canadian confederacy. It is called \"Garden of the Gulf\" because of its location in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and its beautiful landscape. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccvgr9edx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-63.19083,46.496384]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sistene Chapel","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/472685513_1505436dfb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/1829264075_357f8da661.jpg\">The Sistene Chapel is famous for elaborate murals by Michelangelo Buonarroti. On the ceiling, famous scenes from the book of Genesis are painted, while the end wall contains scenes from the Last Judgement. The side walls contain portraits of Moses, Jesus, and popes painted by Florentine painters in 1481. The Sistene Chapel was designated by Pope Sixtus IV in 1475 to be the Pope’s chapel and the site of elections. On August 15th, 1483 it was dedicated.\r\n\tIn 1508, Pope Julius II della Rovere appointed Michelangelo to paint the ceiling. Michelangelo was at first unhappy about it. He considered him first a sculptor, not a painter. He had to stop working on the pope’s tomb, so he could paint the twelve apostles and some other decorations. He got very into it and ended up painting over 300 other ornaments. He worked on the project from 1508 to 1512, under severe conditions and pressure. He was called back in 1535 to work on the Last Judgement when he was in his sixties. His work stands today as a symbol of attention to detail and some of the greatest art work to ever be created.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccvc3ggvt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.452981472,41.9029637741]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stonehenge","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/45953745_e0f9143c16.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/stonehenge.JPG\">One of the most famous ancient mysteries lies in Britain, on the Salisbury Plain. Stonehenge is now a site of ruins. Some say it used to be an astronomical observatory. Others would call it a burial site.\r\nIt is a monument which seems to have been designed to allow observation of solstices and equinoxes. Stonehenge is made up of 30 upright stones in a circle surrounding a smaller inner circle. Its creation dates back to about 2800 B.C.\r\nStonehenge is an amazing monument, because of how difficult its construction would have been. The stones used were transported many miles from the quarry, using primitive tools.\r\nIt was built in 3 stages. The first around 3100 B.C., a circular ditch and a ring of 56 pits were dug. About 1,000 years later, mysteriously the huge pillars were transported from Southern Wales and placed in two rings around the center. Because its origin and creator is so unknown, many people link stonehenge with crop circles and \"other worldly visitors\".<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccva75xw2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.79626464844,51.0914480214]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Temple of Heaven","description":"Posted by Michellej011<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/1813013467_37a4953705.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/851839518_46773906f2.jpg\">The Temple of Heaven is located in Beijing, China. It was first built in 1420. It was used in during the Ming and Qing dynasties to worship heaven and pray for bumper crops. It is surrounded by a wall which separates the temple into two structures- the inner and outer temples. The north side of the wall is circular, which the south side is square. This pattern is symbolic because in ancient times it was believed that heaven was round and the earth square. In 1998 it was recognized as part of the world cultural heritage list. Inside the temple are many buildings such as the Hall of Prayer for good harvests, the Imperial Vault of Heaven, the Beamless Hall, the Long Corridor, the Echo Wall, the Three Echo Stones, and the Seven Meteoric Stones. It is China’s largest standing complex of ancient sacrificial buildings.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bccvftzovw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[116.389160156,39.8844501782]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/284681","metadata":null,"contact_name":"michellej011","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:michellej011","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/284681","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=284681,platial:user=michellej011","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":49008}
