Walking around along Sumner St last night, around 11 or 12, listening to a podcast. I hear such a loud screaming sound that I take off my headphones and am standing directly in front of the tree pictured here. Some kind of feral brutality was going down.  One growling, snorting, snarling, deep, nightmarishly terrifying beast could be heard high up in the tree shaking around a terrified, squealing, shrieking, screaming animal for a duration of no less than 2 minutes.  Neighborhood dogs started barking at the noise, but no humans came to investigate. Then what had previously only been auditory exposure, changed. I saw the branches at the very top of this tree bend out, and the treetop began to shake violently. At first I thought the aggressor must be a raccoon, but the size of the disruption was more along the lines of what you\\'d expect from something almost human in scale. It was huge, it was wild.  \n\nThen the screaming stopped.\n\nThen I heard the monster descending very rapidly within the branches of this very tall tree, and started to consider what would happen if a bloody predator, of any size, came barging over the fence and towards me.\n\nThe dogs were still barking. I noticed there were a lot of dogs, behind a lot of tall fences.  In fact every house on the block was actively protecting itself from the threat of invasion.  Could this monster be a known phenomena? Known yet suppressed? After all, not a single person came to see what the noise was, what all the noise was about.  Had they learned their lesson the hard way? Should this beast be ignored?  Should I not have stopped? <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ycmgdb6ve"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.644825,45.560325]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hidden Stop Sign","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>most cars driving south on johnson miss this stop sign that is hidden way out of sight!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ycmf1xcmj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.696557,45.528434]}},{"properties":{"name":"Intersection: NW 23rd &amp; Lovejoy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a>offset tram turn, impatience, peds, bikers, sketchy<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ycmgs6hob"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698617,45.529862]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pioneer Courthouse Square","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/6/69194260_d670bae70c_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/27/63074179_cf51dbd186_m.jpg\">715 SW Morrison, Portland, OR, 97205friday march 3, 2006. pioneer square. fight begins at 7pm. rules: 1) all pillows concealed until 7pm sharp 2) only hit other people carrying pillows 3) don\\'t put anything hard in your pillow <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ycmehaqe7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.679398,45.519309]}},{"properties":{"name":"Young couple hit by car","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a>NW 23rd &amp; Quimby, Portland, ORboth might die, this just happened 2 hours ago, entire street closed down, driver was so upset she was kneeling in her own vomit screaming obscenities at herself.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ycmf3pyux"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.698724,45.533357]}},{"properties":{"name":"man jailed for making a crosswalk","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://www.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02_04/muncie.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> w north street &amp; dicks, muncie, inWhitney Stump was tired of drivers ignoring stop signs at an intersection in his Muncie, Indiana neighborhood. After futile attempts to get the city to install crosswalks, Stump took matters into his own hands and painted one in at the corner of Dicks and North streets. Then he got arrested.\n\nWRTV in Indianapolis reports:\n\n    Stump, a 27-year-old Ball State University graduate student and father, says he was arrested in July on a charge of criminal mischief for creating the crosswalk at the intersection of Dicks and North streets. A police officer then warned him after he went back to touch up the paint in August, and the county prosecutor decided to charge him again.\n\n    \"If they\\'re not going to provide a safe environment for me and my community, then I believe I have a moral obligation,\" Stump told 6News\\' Ray Cortopassi on Wednesday.\n\n    Stump said he first asked the city to do the job, thinking crosswalks would get drivers\\' attentions and make them aware they needed to slow down.\n\n    \"I called the street and sign department probably a half-dozen times in the course of six months (to) a year,\" he said.\n\nThe city of Muncie says the intersection in question doesn\\'t meet the criteria for crosswalk installation because it isn\\'t near a school.\n\nStump missed a court date after he was charged the second time, which led to a 10-hour jail stint. But he says he plans to paint in additional crosswalks at the other three spokes of Dicks and North.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ycmeza08j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.403237,40.19669]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/1428","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jason","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jason","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/1428","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=1428,platial:user=jason","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48098}
