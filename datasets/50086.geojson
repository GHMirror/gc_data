Comfort food at its finest - with beautiful colorful Indian dessert cases to gaze at while eating.  Pretty hole-in-the-wall-like, but that\\'s part of what makes it good.  Very family friendly.

The gelato is fabulous, but I\\'m in love with the sandwiches (open faced tomato caprese... yummmm), great veggie soups and salads.\n\nCricket\\'s always has some fresh new kind of fresh bread ready to be drooled over and desserts to split with your lunch pal.  Super great place to rest during a shopping trip on 19th or just to grab a quaint satisfying lunch on your own.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lz46cz6gmj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.401812,29.802894]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jenni's Noodle House","description":"Posted by Happykatie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2130 Jefferson Houston txRidiculously good noodles and soups for meat-lovers and veggies alike.  HUGE vegan favorite:  the Art Car Curry.  For starters, we really love the crispy tofu sticks and dream rolls.  I think they put crack in their house soy sauce -- I have dreams about it on particularly hungry evenings.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lz46nq2s56"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.359901,29.745075]}},{"properties":{"name":"Late Nite Pie","description":"Posted by Happykatie502 Elgin St. houston txReally great veggie pizzas and subs.

Lemon potato nirvana.  The felafel is *good*, not the best ever but always satisfying.  The vegetarian grape leaves (Yolandji dolmas) are oh-so-wonderful.

Be sure to sample some of their hot tea - served just for you with ginger cookies.  One of my favorite places to eat in Houston.  They do serve some meat products, but as a vegan or vegetarian you get some really super tasty options as well.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lz46noznoi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.601179,29.784099]}},{"properties":{"name":"Star Pizza","description":"Posted by Happykatie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 77 Harvard St houston txVery fresh and tasty pizza with some great vegetarian appetizers.
