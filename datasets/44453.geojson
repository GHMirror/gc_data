It took me a while to notice it was a knitting store. That weird little street along the parking lot has a sort of no-man\\'s land feeling to it. The woman who owns the store is helpful. She has a lot of spinning supplies and it seems like a good place to go if you want to get into spinning. She only seems to sell wooden needles, which I don\\'t care for. Very few books, but the Porter Square Bookstore across the lot has a good knitting section.
