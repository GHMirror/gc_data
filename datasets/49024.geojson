Located in German-occupied southern Poland, it took its name from the nearby town of Oświęcim. The word Birkenau means \\'Birch tree\\' of which there are many surronding the Birkenau area of the complex.\r\n\r\nThe complex consisted of three main camps: Auschwitz I, the administrative center; Auschwitz II (Birkenau), an extermination camp or Vernichtungslager; and Auschwitz III (Monowitz), a work camp. There were also around 40 satellite camps.\r\n\r\nThe camp commandant, Rudolf Hoss, testifed at the Nuremberg Trials that up to 2.5 million people had died at Auschwitz. About 90 percent of them Jews from almost every country in Europe. Most of the dead were killed in gas chambers, other deaths were caused by systematic starvation, forced labor, lack of disease control, and individual executions.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ml4psnf5h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.990706,49.998918]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Colosseum","description":"Posted by Dani74<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/history7.jpg\">Rome, ItalyThe Roman Colosseum was built in 80 A.D. It was the first permanant amphitheater in Rome. The monumental building was perfect for controlling large crowds. The amphitheater can seat up to 50,000 people. There were about eighty ways to enter the coloseum. This caused easy entrance and exit flow. The amphitheater spanned over more than 6 acres. \r\n\r\nShows and circuses were often held in the amphitheater. Chariot races were the most popular event held in the Colosseum. Shows and concerts are still held at the Roman Colosseum today.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is now in a ruined condition because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum has long been seen as an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. Today it is one of modern Rome\\'s most popular tourist attractions and still has close connections with the Roman Catholic Church. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ml4xozzhy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.482323,41.895466]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Eiffel Tower","description":"Posted by Dani74<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/03/1/history6.jpg\">Paris, FranceThe Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.
