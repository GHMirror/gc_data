When King George III passed numerous taxes such as the Stamp Act, Townsend Act, American colonies were upset. King George passed these laws to show the colonies who was in charge, and to keep control. It wasn\\'t untill the tea act when colonists were furious. \r\n\r\nOne of the leaders of the the movement was Samual Adams. When the Parliment thought of a plan to fool the colonists by giving East India a monopoly so that when the colonists got the tea they would get it for a cheaper price. But the catch was the people had to pay their duty tax on the imported tea. Smart as they were colonists refused and fought against this act. This refusal plan was known to be the Boston Tea Party led by patriots in 1773, who dressed up as Indians, boarding the ships to dump the boxes of tea out onto the harbor.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvsf8u0h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.022095,42.313337]}},{"properties":{"name":"Breckenridge","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/11_29_2005_17.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/11_29_2005_01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/11_29_2005_06_4_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/12_8_2004_(3)_03.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/S4020184.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/S4020270.jpg\">Breckenridge, COBreckenridge, CO is the farthest place in the U.S. i\\'ve been to. I was about 12 years old when I stayed in Breckenridge. It was Thanksgiving and it had been my first time returning, since I was about 3 years old. I was an expert in skiing, but after a couple trials and falls I got the hang of it. We stayed in a house located on top of Green Mountain. The altitude was extremely high and took atleast 2 days to adjust to.\r\n\r\nBecause the altitude level was higher than usual, new born babies have to have oxygen tanks for atleast 2-3 weeks. The family we stayed with said that the highest temperature they experienced was about mid 60\\'s to low 70\\'s. Being there a week was enough of experience to me since snow super cold weather was happening every day. That week my family went to serve Thanksgiving day to homeless people in the city. My dad and I got to serve in a restauraunt called the Blue Moose. I was in Breckenridge for only a week and I was put in the newspaper! It was an amazing experience, and I would love to stay in the snowy place again. Probably only a week though. :D  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjw41ctbd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.037778,39.481667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Charleston, SC, USA","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Fort_sumter.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/waterfront_fountain.jpg\">Charleston, SC, USACharleston, South Carolina has been one of my favorite places I have ever visited. I went to see my aunt who lives there when I 13. Since I love the south and I have been to a majority of the southern states, I was excited about visiting Charleston. Since I enjoy History alot it was extremely interesting to know and see all of the sites from the Civil War. I got to see the cannons, and Fort Sumter, in which the \"first shot\" of the war was located. \r\n\r\nEach house in Charleston was very bautiful and the house where i stayed at was over 200 years old! If only those walls could talk. I love seafood and South Carolina is one of the best places to get it. The restuarants I went to were on the harbor in Charleston, and each place was unbelievable! There was one park in the downtown area where alot of the battles took place. They had alot of monuments and statues for certain Generals, and battles that were won. Charleston is one of the prettiest states I have ever been to. I hope that I will be able to return again someday. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvynps8c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.931111,32.776389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Colosseum","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/colosseum_5_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/audience_of_colossiem.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/insdie_it.jpg\">Rome, ItalyI picked the Colosseum because I know that it played a big role in history during the galdiator times. It was originally named Flavian Ampitheatre. The building of it began around 70 AD, and later was finished around 80 AD. It is astounding to me because of how long ago it was built and that it is still standing today. When it was completed it could fit over 50,000 people. The audience that filled the stadium like figure came to see entertainment from their time. \r\n\r\nThrough weathering and erosion the colosseum\\'s majority of architecture is still standing. When gladiators came to fight, their lives were up to the emporor to choose if they should live. The emperor himself had his own special box seat, where he would watch a bloody battle take place. Gladiators either would fight ferocious beasts, or other gladiators. When the battle had gone on long enough for the emporer, he would give a hand gesture, (thumbs up or down), to determine if the gladiator should live or die if he hadn\\'t already done so. Today the colosseum can be visited and toured by travelers.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvz4ndef"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.491798,41.890777]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ford Theatre","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Balcony_in_Ford%5C's_Theatre.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/newspaper.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\">Â Washington, D.C.Located in Washington, D.C. is Ford Theatre. This place is significant in history because it was were one of America\\'s greatest presidents, Abraham Lincoln, was assassinated. John Wilk\\'s booth was an actor and was all against the ideas of Lincoln during the war. Lincoln went to Ford Theatre to watch a show called Our American Cousin, with his wife Mary Todd. \r\n\r\nJohn Wilks Booth went to the balcony in which Lincoln was watching the show. Booth shot Lincoln in the head on April 14, 1865. John was able to jump off of the balcony and escape even though he had broken bones in his left leg. Lincoln was rushed to to a boarding house across the street where he died the next morning on April 15, 1865. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvqalgn2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.036667,38.895]}},{"properties":{"name":"Invasion of Normandy","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/normandy_landing.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Normandy.jpg\">Omaha Beach, FranceOn June 6, 1944, operation Overlord or the Invasion of Normdany was one\r\nof the most significant battles in WWII, fought by the U.S. against Nazi, Germany. Over 6,000 American soldiers died in the first few days of battle. It was the beginning of the turning point of the war in Europe, for the allied forces. \r\n\r\nOn Omaha Beach, the allied forces re-etablished a beach head so that the outcome of the battle would push the Nazis to the East. President Eisenhower wanted a \"full victroy- nothing else.\" Invasion of Normandy \r\nwas one of the bloodiest battles in histrory. When allied forces landed on the beach in waves, German forces were waiting behind hedroes and concrete bunkers.

When hurrican season came nobody was expected for this mass destructive hurricane. Only one day of this brutal storm was enough to ruin New Orleans. Another historical moment in New Orleans was the Battle of New Orleans. General Jackson who later became president Andrew Jackson, defeated the British in this battle. The battle was from the time of 1814-1815. \r\n\r\nOne historical event outside of New Orleans was the Louisianna Purchase. The United States purchased millions of acres from the French for pennies on the dollar. \r\n\r\nNew Orleans was also a key city to be held during the Civil War. The Union controlled a blockade outside in the Gulf of Mexico that ran along the entire Eastern seaboard and was known as the Anaconda. It kept the Southern states from re-supplied by outside resources such as the English and French.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvxol61n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.075,29.954444]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palace of Versailles","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/inside.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/palace_of_versailles.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/waterfront_fountain_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Marie.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/King_Louis.jpg\">ParisGoing to Paris and visiting the Palace of Versailles was a sacred memory for me. When I was 9 I traveled to Paris, and got to stay in a hotel right by the Palace. It was a breath-taking, overwhelming place to be at. This humongous 18,000 sq. meter palace is unforgettable, and really comes to mind when you hear the word \"palace\".\r\n\r\nThe history behind the Palace was started when King Louis the XIII originally had a hunting lodge and expanded it out to be a small version of the Palace. It was when King Louis XIV came to power and built on more and more through his reign. The most known history of the Palace was when King Louis XVI and his wife Queen Marie Antoinette came to the throne. His years in the palace were from 1765-1793. He was in reign for a shorter time than his ancestors were. At the end of his reign was when he lost favoritism. It was the time of the Revolution, and he had little sympothy to the people of France. The common people of France began to hate the king because they soon lost alot of their money from his taxes that were passed. \"Let them eat cake\" pretty much sums up the king and his wife\\'s attitude toward their people. His era soon came to an end, and was exectued with his wife and family on January 21, 1793. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvvfrm60"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.351019,48.856662]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palace of Versailles","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09When I was 9 I went to Paris, France.

Louis XIV began adding on and making the Palace its design and total size of about 18,000 sq. meters it is today. The humongous u-shaped Palace was so breath taking, because of how large and old it is. \r\n\r\nA famous part of history to the Palace, other than the Treaty of Versailles in WWI, was the reign of King Louis XVI, and his wife Queen Marie Antoinette. His reign fell in the time of 1765-1793. He was the King of France during the Revolution in 1789. During that time he came to be hated, mostly among the poorest citizens because of his attitude toward the French citizens and the taxation he passed. \"Let them eat cake\" was Marie Antoinette\\'s famous line in her reign and summed up her and her husbands attitude toward the common people. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvwtczco"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.120318,48.804715]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pearl Harbor","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/USS_arizona.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/pearl_harbor1.jpg\">honoluluDuring WWII, a surpirse attack from the Japanese was planned against the U.S. Before the attack the U.S. had not entered the war. Roosevelt was still wanting America to be isolated, to fight only in desperation. On December 7, 1941, around 7:30 a.m. the first wave of planes hit the harbor. Satellites had actually seen planes comming in, but they thought it was only U.S. planes coming from a practice routine.\r\n\r\nA battleship called the USS\r\nArizona was attacked in one of the plane waves. American Navy and Marine casualties were over 2,800. Japanese sank or destroyed 18 of our ships. Even though it was a severe attack and hurt the U.S. Navy and Marine corps, we were able to sustain and fight back, in which we won WWII. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6cnjvtjcv2x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.858333,21.306944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Twin Towers","description":"Posted by Anakinlover09<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/attack_of_9_11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/Before_9_11.jpg\">New York, NYOn September 11, 2001, one of the most tragic historical events occurred in New York City. Thought I have never been to New York, I would love to visit, and experience being in the city where 9/11 took place. The twin towers were a symbol of New York. \r\n\r\nNew York City is one of the most popular cities being visited by American citizens and tourists from other countries. New York in general is popular, and had a large population increase near the late 1800\\'s to the mid 1900\\'s. Ellis Island was the island where many immigrants came to from all over the world because they heard that America was the place to be. In which more freedom and job openings were available compared to their original home. Also located in Ellis Island is one of the most known symbols that represents the U.S. It is the Statue of Liberty.
