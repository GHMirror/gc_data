He had a diet largely of sausages and waffles,\" Dr. L. Stephen Coles, founder of the Gerontology Research Group at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Friday.\n\nThe 5-foot-7, 140-pound Johnson died of pneumonia Wednesday at his Richmond home in Northern California.\n\n\"A lot of people think or imagine that your good habits and bad habits contribute to your longevity,\" Coles said. \"But we often find it is in the genes rather than lifestyle.\"\n\nJohnson, who was blind and living alone until his 110th birthday when a caregiver began helping him, built the Richmond house by hand in 1935. He got around using a walker in recent years.\n\nJohnson was the only living Californian considered a \"supercentenarian,\" a designation for those ages 110 or older, Coles said. His group is now in the process of validating a Los Angeles candidate who claims to be 112 years old.\n\nColes participated in an autopsy Thursday that was designed to study Johnson\\'s health.\n\n\"All of his organs were extremely youthful. They could have been the organs of someone who was 50 or 60, not 112. Clearly his genes had some secrets,\" Coles said.\n\n\"Everything in his body that we looked at was clean as a whistle, except for his lungs with the pneumonia,\" Coles said. \"He had no heart disease, he had no cancer, no diabetes and no Alzheimer\\'s.\n\n\"This is a mysterious case that someone could be so healthy from a pathology point of view and that there is no obvious cause of death.\"\n\nThe family was in favor of an autopsy. Relatives said Johnson wanted them to allow it if it would help science.\n\nBorn May 1, 1894, Johnson\\'s father managed the Baltimore and Ohio Railway station in Philadelphia.\n\nJohnson was working in 1917 as a mail sorter for the U.S. Post Office when he was drafted into the Army. The war ended a year later, and he never served in combat.\n\nTwo years later, he and his wife moved to Northern California.\n\n\"It was a great adventure in those days. We were young and wanted the experience,\" Johnson said in a March interview with the Contra Costa Times.\n\nThe couple settled in Fresno and remained there until 1935, when they bought property in Richmond. They used lumber salvaged from dismantled buildings to build their house.\n\nDuring World War II, Johnson worked at the Kaiser shipyard in Richmond and later managed the heating plant at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland.\n\nHe remained in good health and continued driving until he was 102, when his vision began to fail.\n\nJohnson\\'s wife died in 1992 at the age of 92.

Debelius III said the defendant, Raymond Hugh McNealy, 44, committed a \"disgusting\" and \"demeaning\" act when he allegedly exposed himself to his neighbor and her 8-year-old daughter June 7.

(AP) - The first town ever auctioned on eBay soon will be back up for sale on the online auction site.\n\nNearly two years after he bought the tiny town of Bridgeville, Orange County financial adviser Bruce Krall said Friday he plans to re-auction the Humboldt County hamlet on eBay next month.\n\n\"Due to family reasons, I\\'m pretty much tied to Southern California for the foreseeable future,\" Krall said. \"We can\\'t move up there. It only makes sense to pass it on to somebody else.\"\n\nKrall said the auction will open April 4 with a minimum bid of .75 million - more than twice what he paid for the 83-acre property about 40 miles southwest of Eureka.\n\nBridgeville, a picturesque village with about 25 people on the Van Duzen River, sparked a bidding war in 2002 when it became the first town ever put up for sale on eBay.\n\nThe buyer, who won the auction with a .78 million bid, never came to see the property and the deal fell through. The property was eventually posted on traditional real estate listings, and Krall bought it for about 00,000 in May 2004.\n\nSince then, Krall said he\\'s invested \"multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars\" to restore old buildings, remove dilapidated structures and clean up mounds of garbage. He also found new tenants for the houses and received a conditional use permit for a riverfront resort.\n\n\"It\\'s come full circle,\" Krall said. \"Now it\\'s been fixed up, and I think it\\'s actually ready to be sold on eBay.\"\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62o7ngx9j5g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.549351,40.468566]}},{"properties":{"name":"Woman Crashes Teaching Dog to Drive","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/1/driving_cosmo.jpg\">(08-28) 17:19 PDT BEIJING, China (AP) --\n\nA woman in Hohhot, the capital of north China\\'s Inner Mongolia region, crashed her car while giving her dog a driving lesson, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday.\n\nNo injuries were reported although both vehicles were slightly damaged, it said.\n\nThe woman, identified only be her surname, Li, said her dog \"was fond of crouching on the steering wheel and often watched her drive,\" according to Xinhua.\n\n\"She thought she would let the dog \\'have a try\\' while she operated the accelerator and brake,\" the report said. \"They did not make it far before crashing into an oncoming car.\"\n\nXinhua did not say what kind of dog or vehicles were involved but Li paid for repairs.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62o7nhmy8fw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[112.1484375,41.0462168145]}},{"properties":{"name":"Woman Hires Men to Rob Her Husband","description":"Posted by Bianca2000<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3/4476172_f0d142e764_m.jpg\">Nashua, N.H.

A box of X-rated fortune cookies was mistakenly delivered to a fundraiser hosted by a Brooklyn politician.\n\nThe 350 cookies stuffed with \"the most graphically lurid\" fortunes got mixed up with a batch of 1,750 cookies ordered for the Chinese New Year event, Borough President Marty Markowitz said Friday. Some guests \"were stunned, to say the least.\"\n\nThe annual event - to raise money to send poor children to summer camp - was attended by some 700 guests Tuesday evening, but only about 80 were still there when the dirty cookies were opened, Markowitz said.\n\nThe borough president was on the second floor of the two-level restaurant when a guest \"yelled to me from the first floor: \\'Marty, did you order these cookies? Did you see what\\'s inside them? I think you better get your butt down here!\\'\" Markowitz said.\n\nMarkowitz, who was not wearing his glasses, had the \"fortunes\" read to him by some of the guests.\n\n\"I\\'m sure they were meant for a raunchy bachelor party,\" he said. \"They were not cutesy. Triple X to say the least.\"\n\nHe said his office had given the restaurant 10 slogans about Brooklyn to insert into the fortune cookies, and 1,400 were delivered correctly.\n\nThey contained such G-rated boosterisms as: \"Brooklyn - The 10th Planet,\"\"Brooklyn - it\\'s more than a freak\\'in tree,\" and \"Brooklyn - it\\'s like an everything bagel.\"\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community
