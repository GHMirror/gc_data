To get to Milford Sound is an experience in itself.  You pass through a mountain valley with sheer rock faces with trees clinging to them.  There are waterfalls at such great heights that the water just becomes rain by the time it reaches ground.  Milford Sound is a fjord.  Which means that it was formed due to glaciation.  The fjord is filled with sea water. It also receives most rainfall in New Zealand.  Fresh water flows in and settles on top of salty sea water (which is also heavier).  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6djitumvt7p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[167.93152,-44.67647]}},{"properties":{"name":"Petronas Tower, KL","description":"Posted by Anupjindalkualalumpur Suria shopping center and Petronas tower in KL<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6djiu3mq0qq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[101.712821,3.156199]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sulimaniye - Istanbul","description":"Posted by AnupjindalS<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6djitz16emo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.963845,41.016118]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sultanahmet - Istanbul","description":"Posted by Anupjindalsultanahmet - istanbulNice area to stay right next to Topakapi Palace, Haga Sofia, Blue Mosque<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6djiu8g97h6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.975652,41.002852]}},{"properties":{"name":"Topkapi Palace - Istanbul","description":"Posted by Anupjindal<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6djitzoz0zy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.98541,41.01122]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ubud","description":"Posted by Anupjindalubud, indonesiaUbud\\'s lush green hills, paddy fields and unique culture make it a heady combination. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6djiu8510pt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[115.260002,-8.52]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/232315","metadata":null,"contact_name":"anupjindal","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:anupjindal","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/232315","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=232315,platial:user=anupjindal","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":46189}
