She agreed and I couldn't be happier, she's so pretty and I wanted to capture that in an image.   \nSo before we started the dancing we shot some beauty shots.  I wanted to get her fire hot red hair moving so I had my friend Bea hold a fan below her and blow both sides of her face.  I shot this with a longer lens, a 70-200mm at 1/20th of a second to get enough ambient to blur in the hair movement.  McNally shows the technique off quite a bit and I can see why now.  I really like the 3D feel the background blur creates of her hair in motion.\nStrobist info:  One light for this one, a Ranger Quadra with Deep Octa at camera right.  Studio overhead lights were on creating some ambient.\nModel:  Julia H.\nPhotographer:  Pete Tsai\nMUA:  Cait O.\nHair:  Lizzi H.\nAssistants:  Critter, Bea, and Piotr","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/petetsai/5367335090/","id":"5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.649666,41.85328]}},{"properties":{"title":"One Day When I Grow Up","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5367338398","published":{"end_time":"2011/01/18 10:13:42 -0500","original":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 07:13:41 -0800","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/01/18 10:13:41 -0500"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/jhdennis/\">Flint Foto Factory</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhdennis/5367338398/\" title=\"One Day When I Grow Up\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5207/5367338398_9c8a077ef4_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"One Day When I Grow Up\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhdennis/5367338398/","id":"6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.65312,41.986406]}},{"properties":{"title":"Macro snowscape","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5366703975","published":{"end_time":"2011/01/18 10:03:44 -0500","original":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 07:03:43 -0800","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/01/18 10:03:43 -0500"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/froboy/\">froboy</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froboy/5366703975/\" title=\"Macro snowscape\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5123/5366703975_4fabc9a590_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Macro snowscape\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froboy/5366703975/","id":"7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.587241,41.786463]}},{"properties":{"title":"Misery Loves Company","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5366713847","published":{"end_time":"2011/01/18 10:07:42 -0500","original":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 07:07:41 -0800","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/01/18 10:07:41 -0500"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/romeobanias/\">benchorizo</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/romeobanias/5366713847/\" title=\"Misery Loves Company\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5203/5366713847_8d662b861e_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"154\" alt=\"Misery Loves Company\"></a>\n\nThis was taken Uptown by Foster Avenue Beach. Just bad weather yesterday. Not too cold but with a steady drizzle that seemed to last all day. Planned to do some skyline shots but ended up with this. I loved how the lighthouse and the tree seemed to look like they're keeping each other company during the cold winter months. Also, I contemplated converting this to B&amp;W but it really didn't make that much difference since everything looked gray anyway. So, here it is in all it's vivid glory. :)\nPlease <a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=5366713847&amp;size=large\">View On Black</a>

The pizza's great. You'll thank me later.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21373843@N05/5912455136/","id":"a62vh0942iia"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.625846,41.877948]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5911885941","title":"Picture 040","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 10:31:35 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 07:31:34 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 10:31:34 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/64159117@N08/\">Club Chicago</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/64159117@N08/5911885941/\" title=\"Picture 040\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5231/5911885941_9fdcdbb430_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Picture 040\"></a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/64159117@N08/5911885941/","id":"a62vh0mmej9o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.639688,41.878732]}},{"properties":{"title":"Day 7 Fruit-003.jpg","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912834370","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 12:48:47 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 09:48:46 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 12:48:46 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/ajdoudt/\">ajdoudt</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajdoudt/5912834370/\" title=\"Day 7 Fruit-003.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5912834370_c1f13a76b8_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"135\" alt=\"Day 7 Fruit-003.jpg\"></a>\n\nThis slot machine sucks.

We staked out our spot on the edge of Belmont Harbor hoping to catch the Navy Pier  fireworks (on right) but ended up with a bonus. It so happened  that there was another fireworks display coming from nearby (maybe the Lincoln Park Zoo or Diversey Harbor) and we were treated to two shows at the same time. And the best part, it was not crowded at all. Had to crop out some heads at the bottom of the frame.<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=5912700910&amp;size=large\">View Large</a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/romeobanias/5912700910/","id":"a62vh07hncdt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.633293,41.942103]}},{"properties":{"title":"morning ride","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912148829","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 12:03:57 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 09:03:56 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 12:03:56 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/12021972@N04/\">63 Images</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12021972@N04/5912148829/\" title=\"morning ride\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5076/5912148829_a643f7c779_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"morning ride\"></a>\n\noak st beach, chicago il","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12021972@N04/5912148829/","id":"a62vh0ludedv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.624385,41.904652]}},{"properties":{"title":"Exteriors - Evening","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5896558813","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 13:00:00 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 09:00:00 -0700","granularity":"hour","time":"2011/07/07 12:00:00 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/bossbob50/\">bossbob50</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bossbob50/5896558813/\" title=\"Exteriors - Evening\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5896558813_2f16fedd7b_m.jpg\" width=\"210\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Exteriors - Evening\"></a>\n\nIt gets complicated. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GqqRrn-Z9U\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GqqRrn-Z9U</a> - Land of One Thousand Trances\n1. Sometimes it is the people on the street that catch my eye and I try to catch them in my viewfinder..\n2. Other times it is the geometry of the scene - the buildings, streets, angles, lines and the one-thousand-and-one tiny details that form a cohesive, yet fluid and ever-changing whole.\n3. Then at others it has something to do with the quality and color of the light: its harshness, its softness, the way it envelopes the scene, bringing forth certain details, muting others.\nOften, it is a combination of things - all of which I either don't know or of which I am unaware. I am looking in the viewfinder and it is all a mix of shape, color, form and movement. Apparently, after all of these decades shooting, my brain is able to sort things out - even if my eyes cannot quite, as I often get results I find interesting as starting points.\nA final, important-to-critical aspect of an image like this - at the time it is taken - is sound. It is a mix of human, city and natural sounds that intermix so uniquely, deeply, yet subtly that over time for us city people, the sounds of real nature and solitude come across as too quiet, odd, jarring or disorienting. \nI use music to convey what I hear when I'm taking shots such as this: the drone of traffic and machine, the hum of conversation and shuffling feet, the whoosh of wind, the ebb and flow of movement, the rhythmic sounds of urban construction and renovation projects conducted in the distance. Such as the music attached.\nThis is right across the street from my office. Its shapes, action, colors and light catch me often as I leave work, and I have to stop, dig out the camera and catch a few shots. As they were not planned, or consciously considered moments, I usually forget them, and into the folder \"to be worked on\" they go.\nThere is one final thing influencing my taking of such shots, the work of an extraordinary street-photographer named Joewig: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joewig/5217401105/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/joewig/5217401105/in/photostream</a> (Joseph Wigfall).  He works people, almost exclusively, while, in general I tend to combine people and their environment with aspects of structure holding my of the comp than the humans. But, what Joewig does is in my heart and I'm trying to do more of it.\nTextures by: Flypaper ~ <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/flypapertextures/\">www.flickr.com/groups/flypapertextures/</a>\n                      Skeltalmess ~ <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/skeletalmess/sets/72157624093222741/\">www.flickr.com/photos/skeletalmess/sets/72157624093222741/</a>\n                      Distressed Jewell ~ <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jewellofdistressed/\">www.flickr.com/photos/jewellofdistressed/</a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bossbob50/5896558813/","id":"a62vh09q0rsh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.620215,41.892662]}},{"properties":{"title":"Wednesday Fireworks","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912025157","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 11:20:09 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 08:20:08 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 11:20:08 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/12243177@N05/\">1 Johnny</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12243177@N05/5912025157/\" title=\"Wednesday Fireworks \"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5311/5912025157_e6ac2d90c0_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Wednesday Fireworks \"></a>\n\nChicago, IL \n7-7-2011","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12243177@N05/5912025157/","id":"a62vh09ev109"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.60292,41.892566]}},{"properties":{"title":"_0028023.JPG","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5912013481","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 11:16:13 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 08:16:12 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 11:16:12 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/59651704@N00/\">Disguised as Meat</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/59651704@N00/5912013481/\" title=\"_0028023.JPG\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5040/5912013481_b880306b8c_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"_0028023.JPG\"></a>\n\nthis picture was uploaded directly from my camera, i guess that makes the camera a blogject <a href=\"http://www.goodfello.com\">read more about the project</a>","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/59651704@N00/5912013481/","id":"a62vh08gqxoj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.640007,41.93275]}},{"properties":{"title":"Summertime Street Life","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5880181642","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 11:11:03 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 08:11:02 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 11:11:02 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/light_seeker/\">Viewminder</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/light_seeker/5880181642/\" title=\"Summertime Street Life\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5228/5880181642_1200eeec0d_m.jpg\" width=\"159\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Summertime Street Life\"></a>\n\nIt's been the most awesome summer so far...\nMan...

hour\" setting. I wanted long shadows, a fuzzy horizon, a sun, orange sky. I knew the light had to be from the back from a previous challenge on backlighting so there are three lamps all pointing toward the orange paper away from Farmer Smurf. \nI tried using a bit of yellow paper, but it didn't work out so I ended up with just two sheets of orange, which are more orangey than this photo shows, at a right angle to each other. Green paper in the foreground. The sun was created with a small flashlight. handheld just above Farmer Smurf's head but pointing at the same spot you see here.\nI used the Canon 60mm close-up lens (my favorite of all lens) set on f/2.8. White balance was set to \"cloudy\" which gave it more orangeyness. I manually focused on Farmer Smurf's tail.

words they say\nWhich we won't understand\n\"Don't accept that what's happening\nIs just a case of others' suffering\nOr you'll find that you're joining in\nThe turning away\" \nIt's a sin that somehow\nLight is changing to shadow\nAnd casting it's shroud\nOver all we have known\nUnaware how the ranks have grown\nDriven on by a heart of stone\nWe could find that we're all alone\nIn the dream of the proud \nOn the wings of the night\nAs the daytime is stirring\nWhere the speechless unite\nIn a silent accord\nUsing words you will find are strange\nAnd mesmerised as they light the flame\nFeel the new wind of change\nOn the wings of the night \nNo more turning away\nFrom the weak and the weary\nNo more turning away\nFrom the coldness inside\nJust a world that we all must

Abandoned City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana. HDR\"></a>\n\nThe city of Gary, Indiana was founded as a booming steel city as the twentieth century passed, and areas downtown saw the construction of several impressive buildings during these prosperous early years. In 1925, a cornerstone ceremony took place at 577 Washington St. to commemorate the construction of a Gothic Revival church called City Methodist. It was completed 21 months later, at the cost of one million dollars - $385,000 of which was contributed by the United States Steel Corp. (which also founded the city). Elbert Gary, the chairman of U.S. Steel and origin of the city's name, donated a Skinner organ as well. The Bedford limestone structure consisted of a 50-foot tall sanctuary nave and elaborate stonework, and was able to seat 950 worshipers; City Methodist had a congregation of nearly 3,000 members in its heyday. The building was also home to Seaman Hall - a 1,000 seat auditorium, and a gymnasium with a full size basketball court. Storefronts were built into the building, with hopes that the income would offset the enormous maintenance costs.\nDuring the 1920s, Pastor William Seaman rallied against the power of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, and welcomed black worshipers into City Methodist during a time when African Americans were not permitted in \"white churches.\"\nGary entered a downward spiral during the 1960s, like many other industrial cities during the period. As U.S. Steel employment dwindled, the residents of Gary moved to nearby suburbs; then as jobs left downtown, city many residents moved out altogether while crime and poverty rose. By 1973 the church's congregation had only 300 members and by 1975 the Methodists moved out of the structure. A second congregation occupied the building until they left in the early 1980s; some storefronts and office space was utilized for a while but soon the entire campus was completely abandoned.\nCity Methodist was burned in the Great Gary Arson of 1997, resulting in a large portion of the roof collapsed or missing. It is now owned by the city of Gary, and its future remains unclear.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/slworking/5914992354/","id":"a62vh0jmg4p6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.736213,41.957071]}},{"properties":{"title":"Sanctuary.

She likes everything fancy so fills her life with frills and lace and glamour. JoJo is Fancy Nancy's little sister. For many, many books she wasn't even given a name. I love her bright face and happy smile. She stands next to the kitchen sink by my radio ... the only doll in the kitchen. She sees most of my photo taking, my cooking and dish washing, my eating, my Sudoku puzzling, my bill paying, my cat feeding, my tax preparing ... a great deal of my life. If I could only keep one doll, it would be JoJo.<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/ourdailychallenge/discuss/72157627143733550/\"><b>Portrait</b></a> - Our Daily Challenge\n98# of 365","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rigib/5915376396/","id":"a62vh0dhw5wq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809901,41.957152]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5915365516","title":"Water Play 2.","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/08 07:55:42 -0400","original":"Fri, 08 Jul 2011 04:55:41 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/08 07:55:41 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/afunkydamsel/\">afunkydamsel</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/afunkydamsel/5915365516/\" title=\"Water Play 2.\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6052/5915365516_8513fe4839_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Water Play 2.\"></a>\n\nFolks splashing around in the water at the Millennium Park fountains.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/afunkydamsel/5915365516/","id":"a62vh0n34prk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.622527,41.88267]}},{"properties":{"guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5915293036","title":"the_fall_of_chrysallis","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/08 07:08:50 -0400","original":"Fri, 08 Jul 2011 04:08:49 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/08 07:08:49 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/francemalate/\">francemalate</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/francemalate/5915293036/\" title=\"the_fall_of_chrysallis\"><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6047/5915293036_ee08fd385d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"the_fall_of_chrysallis\"></a>\n\nafter the earth's destruction in 2012 a new utopic city emerged now known as Chrysallis.

On my way I passed a decent looking sports bar called \"insiders\" (decent for being in the basement of Macy's). And then the non-descript corridor went by a few weird shops, a Subway sandwich place, and then there was this elevator that said, \"Elevator to Chicago Cultural Center.\"\nUh Excuse me? \nCertainly this sign could not be telling the truth. I love riding different elevators. So I took this one wondering where in the world it would drop me off in the Cultural Center. The elevator slowly rose up, and then paused and nothing. I thought I was stuck. In an unknown elevator. Good thing I have a mozzarella cheese sandwich for sustenance. A few seconds later when I thought I was going to be stranded forever and ever, the elevator continued rising a little bit more. \nThe doors opened up and there was the north lobby of the Cultural Center! Talk about twilight zone experience! Talk about transformers space bridge! There I was. Standing right at the entrance of the Cultural Center. I exclaimed out loud, \"WOW! THAT WAS TOTALLY WEIRD!\" A couple sitting in the chairs by the elevator looked up from their books and then looked back down. \nI took a few photos even though those chair people readers were in my way. I didn't care. I wanted a photo of the this space bridge elevator. Then the helper dude at the helper dude desk looked kinda bored, and i looked kinda excited.
