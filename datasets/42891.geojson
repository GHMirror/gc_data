The conservative congregation is known to be egalitarian and participatory, while remaining traditional. Mishkon events and services are known for their emphasis on music, food, spirit, and accessibility. The community is intimate and friendly, with approximately 200 member families. Our vibrant community appeals to those who respect tradition while remaining open to new thoughts and ideas. Much like its Venice environment, its unique character attracts many artists, writers, social workers, and intellectuals, who serve as an extended family for each other.

The World Headquarters can be found at the head temple of our denomination or the Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha, Hongwanji found in Kyoto, Japan. The head, or mother temple is often simply referred to as \"Nishi Hongwanji.\" The Venice Hongwanji continues to be actively involved in the Southern District Council, the B.C.A., and the activities of the Hongwanji in Japan.
