Riding in the Volkswagen bug of my mother and her new husband, who has presumably replaced my father, we are listening to AM radio when my favorite song comes on. My stepfather remarks that he has read that rock music exerts a strange and evil power over young people by locking into the rhythm of their heartbeats. I silently vow eternal allegiance to youth and rock.\nThe Turtles concert was the first live music event I had ever attended aside from the Philadelphia Orchestra Young People\\'s Concert in Robin Hood Dell. I was enchanted when singer Mark Vollman - the fat one, I think - lifted up his t-shirt and actually swung his hairy belly at the audience in time to the music. My mother was disgusted when I told her about this. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a74r62s2et11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.537204,41.520751]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/221308","metadata":null,"contact_name":"radananita","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:radananita","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/221308","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":17,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=221308,platial:user=radananita","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":42255}
