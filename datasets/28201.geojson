For the past five years, Takeru Kobayashi of Japan has won the Fourth of July contest. Kobayashi holds the world record with 53 and ½ Nathan’s Famous hot dogs and buns in 12 minutes. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ztviwuqet2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.908611,33.414722]}},{"properties":{"name":"7/4 Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest Circuit","description":"Posted by Kmikeym<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/belt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/streetsignsmall.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/45196.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/1/logo_2_.gif\">1310 Surf Ave, brooklyn NYDate: 07/04/2006\nLocation: Brooklyn, NY\nDiscipline: Hot Dogs\nTotal Prizes: Coveted Mustard Yellow Belt\n\nSummary\nCompetitive eaters, that increasingly celebrated breed of American athlete, will once again travel the nation in an effort to win a regional hot dog-eating contest and the chance to compete in the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest, an event that has been held each year since 1916 in Coney Island, NY, according to legend.\n\n“The tradition of the Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog-Eating Contest epitomizes the joy and celebration of the Fourth of July,” said Wayne Norbitz, president and COO of Nathan’s Famous. “We believe that there is significant undiscovered eating talent in America and that a 2006 champion may well offer our nation new hope for glory.”\n\nFor the past five years, Takeru Kobayashi has won the Fourth of July contest. In 2004, Kobayashi broke his own world record by downing 53 and ½ Nathan’s Famous hot dogs and buns in 12 minutes. The coveted Mustard Yellow International Belt, the World Cup of competitive eating, has been held by Japanese competitors six of the past seven years, and many patriotic eating fans feel the belt should be on American soil.\n\nAll registration for the regional contests is conducted through NathansFamous.com, and registration has recently been closed due to overwhelming response.
