It is a partnership park that stretches from the headwaters of the Blackstone River in Worcester, Massachusetts to the Narragansett Bay in Providence, Rhode Island. \r\nIt’s a kind of virtual park – a living landscape where its long and nationally pivotal history is still visible through thousands of structures in distinctive landscapes and accessible through the living memory of its residents. \r\n\r\nThe American Industrial Revolution began in the Blackstone River Valley. It changed the landscape of the Valley and transformed life in America. The Blackstone River provided the waterpower for the birth of industry in America with its 438-foot drop over a 46-mile length. Even today, the Valley retains its “wholeness” as a unique landscape with a concentration of historic, cultural and natural resources that represent 18th and 19th century industrial production in America. \r\n\r\nRecognizing its national significance, Congress established the John H Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor Commission in 1986 to assist in protecting and celebrating the Birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about the Corridor, how we work as a partnership park, what we look like, and where you might want to visit, you might start by asking “What’s a Corridor?”\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l77xbwgwym"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.514516,42.00007]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bloomington, IL","description":"Posted by Tmweber525 BROCK DR, Bloomington, IL<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l77xhzk0rn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.025053,40.483262]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boston African American National Historical Site","description":"Posted by Tmweber Boston, MALocated in the heart of Boston\\'s Beacon Hill neighborhood, the site includes 15 pre-Civil War structures relating to the history of Boston\\'s 19th century African-American community, including: the African Meeting House, the oldest standing African-American church in the United States.

Grant, victorious Union commander of the Civil War, includes the tomb of General Grant and his wife, Julia Dent Grant.

Grant\\'s tenacity and boldness led to victories in the Battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga and Robert E. Lee\\'s surrender at Appomattox, scenes depicted by mosaics in the tomb. In 1866 Congress awarded Grant his fourth star making him the first full General of the Armies. \r\nA grateful nation twice elected Grant to serve as President of the United States, from 1869 to 1877. Grant\\'s accomplishments include signing the act establishing the first national park, Yellowstone, on March 1, 1872. After the Presidency, Grant settled in New York City. Ulysses S. Grant died of throat cancer on July 23, 1885 in Mount McGregor, New York, and was laid to rest in New York City on August 8th. \r\n\r\nApproximately 90,000 people from around the country and the world donated a total of over 00,000 towards construction of his tomb, the largest public fundraising effort ever at that time. Designed by architect John Duncan, the granite and marble structure was completed in 1897 and remains the largest mausoleum in North America.
