After the quake I was asked by some doctor friends to lead a trip to do medical work there so on the 4th day after the quake we went in.  I am back in Haiti now preparing for the next visit of the same group. \nStory:\nLast night a small camp of 1200 people were forced off the property they were camped on.  This was a camp that we had provided medical help to. This was done at night and with no warning.  1200 people moved out in darkness with no place to go many children many wounded were put out into the night. What is worse it was done by a supposed Catholic group at Villa Manrese.  The people were living behind the building on a flat spot of ground.  They were a very organized group and were in a safe place.  They had a small school there for the children.  They had food that they shared.  The directors name at Villa Manrese is Pere Andre Paul Grraud. I do not know what he knows about this but he was there in the house above the camp.  I have video of before and after this was done. I understand the need to remove the people from the property but the way they went about this must be reported.  This sort of thing has to be addressed and exposed to the world.  These people were treated like cattle and by fellow Haitians of a Catholic group. \n\nI am leaving Haiti Thursday for the DR but will be back in 2 weeks.  I will gladly share the video with you.\n\nTom Parsons \n509-3434-7816 Haiti\n829-362-0013 in DR","link":"http://www.healthmap.org/ln.php?391197&amp;hq&amp;2","id":"127"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.679459,18.94161]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://www.healthmap.org/ln.php?391197&amp;hq&amp;3","title":"Forced removal of 1200 people from Villa Manrese, Haiti","published":{"end_time":"2010/03/04 01:21:01 -0500","original":"Thu Mar 04 01:21:00 -0500 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/03/04 01:21:00 -0500"},"description":"Not Yet Classified &amp;mdash; Avenue Jean Paul I, Port-au-Prince, Haiti&lt;br/&gt;Back ground:\nI am a retired Firefighter doing some relief work in Haiti.
