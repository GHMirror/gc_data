I had the priviledge of tilling the soil in this garden one year. Thanks Richa. This was my first larger garden experience. I had a six by twenty foot space to work with and plant what I wish. I had to clear the spot and turn the sod as it had become overgrown. I planted watermelon, squash, purple pole beans on a crucifix I salvaged from the basement of the apartment I was living in, lemon cucumbers (yellow and roundish), and tomatoes. The plot went pretty wild that summer and the garden was eventually overrun by the transient community in the area, but we got a bumper crop of beans! I donated my harvest to the Hard Times Cafe, a local group of homeless folk who gathered to cook, eat, and dicuss their situation. I had one watermelon that made it and it was given as a birthday present to one of the chaps at the Cafe. All in all it was a good summer project and a lot of fun to boot!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img
