Instead, you\\'ll find: \"Beautiful shaded seaside grounds, scenic ocean views, public pier, bandstand for concerts, picnic areas, beaches, children\\'s rides, activities and many eateries.\"...as well as the old-school classic coin-op video arcade! (my personal favorite Salem destination) They\\'ve got Pac Man, they\\'ve got Space Invaders, they\\'ve got Centipede...and many many more games from the golden age of video games, as well as around 10 pinball machines, air hockey, and a bunch of other games too. There\\'s also a seperate building full of play-for-tickets style games like Skee Ball - fun for the whole family!
