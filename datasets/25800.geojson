By reconsidering design assumptions for the future, the building seeks to reverse the tragic (if unintended) consequences of the first Industrial Revolution.

We also offer fuel in 5 gallon containers called carboys that give you the freedom of fueling whenever and wherever you like. Many of our customers fill up their tanks and then stock up with 10-20 gallons in carboys, so they only come to the Oasis every month or two and minimize their driving to get fuel. The carboys cost  for the container plus the cost of the 5 gallons of fuel.\nBioFuel Oasis was founded in 2003 to provide greater access to biodiesel, a renewable fuel that reduces harmful tailpipe emissions.

There is a main dining room that seats 100 guests and a private dining room that seats 25.

Modeled after small mom and pop restaurants found throughout Italy, the menu changes daily, driven by the offerings of local producers.  The wine list, like the food, focuses exclusively on Italy and California.\n\nThe setting and service both are imbued with the vibe of the restaurant\\'s Mission neighborhood. Friendly, tattooed and incredibly knowledgeable, the servers have been recognized as \"do(ing) their job better than many tuxedoed traditionalist.\" Delfina was awarded \"Best Service\" in San Francisco\\'s 2003 reader\\'s poll.

Burke, Inc. has been reliably delivering premium diesel fuel, motor oil and gasoline to fleets and industry throughout the Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island area. \n\nWhile Detroit offers several variations of new Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV) that average over 50 miles to the gallon, independent fuel marketers are introducing \"Biodiesel,\" a healthier, renewable energy solution that seems to be meeting just about everyone\\'s approval. The Burke Gas Station on Beacham Street in Chelsea is the first station in the state of Massachusetts to offer biodiesel products  Biodiesel B20 at the pump and Biodiesel B100 in drums and pails. \n\nBiodiesel is a clean, diesel fuel substitute made from soybeans, canola, and recycled cooking oil from restaurants. It can be burned safely in any standard, unmodified diesel engine, either in pure form (B100) or in a 20% blend (B20) with 80% petroleum diesel. Most truck manufacturers recommend using B20 in their engines. Pure biodiesel is completely biodegradable, and poses minimal concerns to soil and water contamination. Biodiesel is also non-toxic to plants, animals and humans. On the performance side, biodiesel\\'s higher cetane rating results in excellent engine performance and fuel economy. Biodiesel has outstanding lubricity characteristics. Blend ratios as low as 1% can provide up to 30% more lubricity over conventional diesel fuel. And a higher flash point means it\\'s safer to handle. \n\nAs one of New England\\'s largest suppliers of diesel fuel, gasoline and motor oil products, Dennis K. Burke is proud to be first in bringing biodiesel to Massachusetts.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigb16u2jd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.047724,42.39452]}},{"properties":{"name":"Denver Biodiesel","description":"Posted by Luisdb1005511 Washington, Denver Co 80216<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigb6m0qvj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.97827,39.796728]}},{"properties":{"name":"Denver Biodiesel","description":"Posted by Luisdb1005511 Washington, Denver Co 80216Denver Biodiesel cooperative provides biodiesel at prices competitive to petroleum diesel.

Washington Street, Athens, GA 30601From the Farm 255 website:\n\n\"Farm 255 is a restaurant that seeks to reconnect food to its roots &amp; people to their food. We serve local, seasonal, &amp; sustainable food for supper nightly. In addition to the Farm we manage Full Moon Farms, a 7-acre organic/biodynamic farm in Athens. Unlike the owners of any other restaurant we know of, we are the folks sowing turnip seeds in the morning and cooking turnip greens in the evening. We supplement our harvests with those of other local family farmers and ranchers that avoid harmful chemicals and practice sustainable agriculture. Our menu, based on seasonal shifts in the field, changes as often as the weather. Our meat comes from pasture-raised animals &amp; is hormone &amp; antibiotic free.

The City of Portland has adopted LEED™ as the basis of design for all of its new construction.\r\n\r\nAs a green building, Hillsdale Library offers many benefits, including: environmental protection (reduced air and water pollution, reduction in solid waste creation, and minimized depletion of natural resources); economic advantages (reduced operating costs and optimized economic performance over the life of the building); and health and safety benefits (better indoor air quality, decreased harmful pollutants indoors and out, and increased personal satisfaction). \r\n\r\nTo achieve LEED™ certification, Hillsdale Library incorporates many environmental design elements that significantly reduce or eliminate the building\\'s negative impact on the environment, while providing an inviting, friendly and comfortable place for library users of all ages. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigayg2t84"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.693654,45.479109]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hoffman's","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\" href=\"http://www.iheartfarms.com/\">Tanabutler</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1102 Pacific Avenue, Santa Cruz, CA, 95060Hoffman\\'s 831-420-0135\n\nJune and Ed Hoffman, longtime Santa Cruz residents, returned to Santa Cruz in 2000 to set up an exciting new bakery café with a full service dining room serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, breads, tortes and pastries, many of which are French inspired.

In 1985 we founded Del Cabo, a project in Baja California established to assist small growers by teaching organic growing practices, management and organizational skills and connecting them to markets in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Our Del Cabo line includes a year round supply of basil and specialty cherry tomatoes.\n\nOur commitment to organic farming is rooted in our belief that the use of chemical fertilizers and toxic pest control materials are detrimental to our health and the health of our planet. Healthy soil is the cornerstone of organic farming while chemical inputs destroy organisms needed to build a healthy soil. A healthy soil is critical to producing healthy plants and a healthy environment. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigb1p8ixp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.043612,36.982946]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jardiniere","description":"Posted by Transfairusa<img src=\"http://www.kuleto.com/PhotosandRestaurantGraphics/Jardiniere_baranddining.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 300 Grove St., San Francisco, CA, United Statesfair trade<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigau5oqaw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.421537,37.778017]}},{"properties":{"name":"Just Food","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.farmaid.org\" href=\"http://www.farmaid.org\">Farmaid</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 208 E. 51st Street, NY 10022Just Food was founded in 1995 in response to three major challenges: the loss of family farms, the rise of hunger, malnutrition, and diet-related disease, and the lack of economic opportunity in underserved neighborhoods.

Its fertile soil and Mediterranean climate translated into an abundance of fresh produce as well as treasured seafood and game. Legend tells that Kokkari is the site where Orion, a mighty hunter and a young man of gigantic stature and great beauty, fell in love with the daughter of the King of Chios. For the love of her, Orion foraged the island for wild game and seafood to prepare elaborate banquets in celebration of their love.

Nor did she want to give Seattleites a little extra bounce in their step as the winter gloom sets in.\n\nShe pointed to a mound in the rubber sidewalk, raised by the roots growing from one of the red maple trees on the shady, lush street of small houses on Eighth Avenue South, between South Rose and South Thistle streets.\n\nAcross the street, where the sidewalk is concrete, the growing roots of another tree had already cracked it. \"That (sidewalk) was just put in about a year ago,\" Ellis said.\n\nThe rubberized sidewalks are more elastic, so instead of cracking, they stretch, and have to be replaced less often and are cheaper to fix, Ellis said. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigb8ggc8f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.330833,47.606389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rubber Sidewalks, Santa Monica","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://audioperfume.com\" href=\"http://audioperfume.com\">Hive</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/12/0/SJ05.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Santa Monica, CAThe popularity of Southern California\\'s most destructive curbside shade tree is starting to bounce back--thanks to rubber sidewalks.\n\nLeafy ficus trees have helped cool neighborhood roadsides for decades. As they have grown, though, their stubborn roots have created safety hazards by pushing concrete sidewalk slabs out of the ground.\n\nThat has prompted repair crews throughout the region to chop down rows of the dense, green-canopied trees. Replacement trees have generally been slower-growing and scrawnier-looking.\n\nBut street maintenance workers in Southern California will soon be stretching the life expectancy of the ficus by using flexible sidewalks made from recycled automobile tires.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigaz1nsg5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.490278,34.019444]}},{"properties":{"name":"Russell Transportation Yard","description":"Posted by SystemBioDiesel Refueling Station, Private - government only. 1700 Galleria Drive, Henderson NV 89014. 702-799-8755. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigb566rki"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.058606,36.078192]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rymes Propane &amp; Oil - Greenfield","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:Ajv5QUfVZSvahM:autoblog.it/uploads/wheat.jpg\">BioDiesel Refueling Station, Public - credit card at all times \n775 W Forest Road, Greenfield NH 03047\n603-228-2224 \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6aigazl0vx6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.881086,42.950262]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rymes Propane &amp; Oil - Peterborough","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:F5zE-C44Bhv4RM:www.pca.state.mn.us/artwork/mnenvironment/winter2005/biodiesel-greenlight.jpg\">BioDiesel Refueling Station, Public - credit card at all times\n10 Depot Street, Peterborough NH 03458\n603-924-9084 \n\nn April, 2004, Rymes Propane and Oil, with the support of the NH Department of Environmental Services, opened five Biodiesel stations and became the first heating supplier in the state of New Hampshire to break into the market for alternative fuel.

The new restaurant takes this vision even further in its new environment, designed by Olle Lundberg, overlooking the San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe food, relaxed atmosphere, riesling-driven wine list, full bar with premium brands and fresh squeezed juices, and hard-to-find Chinese teas all speak to the restaurant\\'s originality and commitment to quality. Our to-go store called \"Out the Door\" is now open in the main hall of the Ferry Building, around the corner from the restaurant.
