The Portus Project is a continuation of a successful research collaboration between the University of Southampton, the British School at Rome (BSR), the University of Cambridge and the Soprintendenza di Beni Archeologici di Ostia.\nThe Portus Project includes multiple seasons of survey in the land lying to the south of the port, as well as the excavation of a central area within the port itself, in order to provide answers to a number of key questions about Portus\\' character and development, its regional context and relationship to Ostia, and its connections to other ports in Italy and the Mediterranean.\nThe excavation will apply an integrated suite of techniques not generally used on complex Mediterranean sites with major structural remains, including digital recording and visualization. This exceptionally rich and challenging site provides young academics and students with experience and training in site and survey techniques, electronic data-capture and in the identification and analysis of artefacts, fauna and botanical remains.

Following the purchase of the estate by the new Kingdom of Italy in 1872 (to remain a royal preserve until 1946) the excavation were taken up again from 1874 until about 1913, during which almost the whole of three blocks and two sides of the forum square were uncovered. The work was systematic, with a railway line to carry off spoil and archaeologists from the state antiquities service on hand, such as Pietro Rosa, Antonio Pasqui, and Rodolfo Lanciani, and may have been well documented at the time. The only records yet found, however, are some photographs taken when a large black-and-white mosaic was lifted in sections and installed in the Museo Nazionale Romano in Rome in 1903-11 (it was returned to the estate in 2004). Lanciani included a short account in his popular book Wanderings in the Roman Campagna (1909) and sent two brief written reports to the London journal The Athenaeum in 1911-13; a few notes and sketches exist among his personal papers in the Istituto Nazionale di Archeologia e Storia dell\\'Arte in Rome and in the Vatican Library. Otherwise, the principal sources are the remains still visible on the ground, left exposed at the end of the excavations. Although buried in dense vegetation and under tree cover which has grown up over the site in the last hundred years, many walls are standing to considerable heights.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Classics/LaurentineShore/VicusAugustanus/VC_Bibliography.html\">Bibliography</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a66zg2trrax3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.33619,41.71739]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/112193","metadata":null,"contact_name":"system","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:system","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/112193","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":26,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=112193,platial:user=system","published":"2010-03-04T17:00:00Z","id":32553}
