She developed this passion from garage sale “treasure hunting” excursions taken with her mother as a child. As she got older, Dalia realized that she also had a natural talent for decorating and design. With this combination of talent and passion as her guide, she started her own antique, clothing and women’s services store in Abilene, Texas. Dalia attributes the quick rise and success of her business to her relentless hard work along with the efforts of her husband and two children. When she first started Stokes and Company 5 years ago, it was a small booth inside of an antiques mall. “My husband persuaded me to follow my dreams, so I opened the booth. Within 6 months, it tripled in size; 6 months after that, we expanded to our own location. After 5 years, we moved from a 1200-square-foot store to our current location, nearly three times that size,” she says. Without the persistent dedication of her family, who have done everything from manage the business to repairing its buildings, Dalia believes this success would never have been possible. Stokes and Company offers its customers used and reupholstered furniture, antiques, home décor items, and clothing for women. She says that her business takes old furniture and, using her natural eye for design, repairs it to give it a “new life.” In her own words, “I feel like my business is like a jewelry box: you’ll never know what you can find when you go in there. That’s what sets me apart from others.” She believes that the unique service she provides and her store’s constantly changing inventory compel her clients to return to Stokes and Company. In the future, Dalia hopes to continue offering her customers one-of-a-kind service while expanding her business to cater to the everyday needs of women. In its new location, Dalia has split the store into two parts: one for the antiques and furniture shop and the other to serve as a studio to create custom pieces for customers. She also added a waxing salon to bring her business closer to the goal of catering to the diverse needs of her women customers. With this loan, Dalia will expand her inventory to fit the needs of her business’ new space. While the move to a 3500-square-foot location is necessary, this means that her current inventory covers only about 1/3rd of that space. After realizing that a commercial bank would not fit her business needs, Dalia reached out to Kiva's partner ACCION Texas-Louisiana. With this loan, Dalia will not only continue to serve her loyal clients, but she will expand her services to meet the needs of an even more diverse part of her community.

The good humored, enterprising and resolute father of eight says so far the experience of engaging in this kind of business has been fulfilling. He began as a small-scale subsistence farmer, but it soon occurred to him that he could make significant ends meet by selling staple crops such as bananas, coffee, maize and millet, all of which command high prices in the food markets in most parts of Western Uganda. Once that thought took hold, Allan made painstaking arrangements to set forth in this business, purchasing more banana stems, maize and millet seeds to plant. Upon harvesting, he was able to transport his foods for sale in nearby food markets, earning a monthly income of 80,000 shillings  At length, Allan has seen the rewards of this business and he remains ever-determined to solidify his niche in the food markets. To do this, he knows he has to further improve and modernize his farming gardens. Allan reckons this will come to fruition upon receiving this Kiva loan, with which he intends to purchase higher grade manure and mulches to apply on his farms.

More about Tajikistan and IMON International Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. IMON's History Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She chose to become a landlord because she felt that she could own this business, work full-time until it took a foothold, and still devote time to her three children. Bertha realized she wanted to own rental property while sitting on the porch of her rented apartment in Houston, Texas. As she looked at the ugly façade of her complex, she began to visualize the numerous ways in which the building could be improved. After a short time, she says, she had a crystal clear idea of how to turn the run-down complex into a beautiful, flourishing community. With this dream as her motivation, Bertha decided to take a courageous leap. With only her experience as a renter as her guide, she called her landlord to discuss purchasing the complex. Six months later, Bertha was the owner of Bertha’s Homes and landlord of a newly purchased community of apartments. The first thing she attended to, she says, were the immediate, smaller repairs needed on the five units in her complex. Now, she is beginning to hire companies to repair the larger, structural issues with the building such as the weak foundations and old windows. Raising a family, learning the ins and outs of a new business, and working a full-time job hasn’t been easy. Bertha has had to grapple with a system of building permits and city officials, which, at one point, threatened to condemn her buildings and bankrupt her business. She says that her biggest business success to date was convincing the city that she would make the needed repairs to bring the buildings up to code. With this loan, Bertha will pay for the repairs to the major structural problems with her building. Without it, she says, she would have lost her business because, though she had enough saved for the minor repairs, she could not afford to pay the companies she hired to do the larger, most necessary ones. Though she says that every cent from her day job as a cook at a restaurant turns into a new investment in her business, Bertha remains satisfied and happy with her decision to become a landlord. She advises others to not get discouraged and to keep on trying until you have reached your goals. Getting started is the most difficult part, she says, and “if a door doesn’t open, it is because it’s not the one that will lead you to success. That’s the way I look at it.”  ","link":"http://www.kiva.org/lend/313067","id":"a622ttuyiqhh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.5,39.76]}},{"properties":{"guid":"4992d760d68678eaf9c9742674b11696","title":"Rona Manojo : Philippines","published":{"end_time":"2011/07/07 14:10:08 -0400","original":"Thu, 07 Jul 2011 11:10:07 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/07/07 14:10:07 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/lend/314119\"><img src=\"http://s3-1.kiva.org/img/w100h100/804178.jpg\" alt=\"photo\" title=\"Rona Manojo\"></a><b>$425 of $700 raised.</b> Started raising funds on Jul 7, 2011  Rona is 36 years old, married and has one child.

Meanwhile, her daughters stay in the kitchen cooking the corn that they will later take to grind to prepare the delicious tortillas.

More about Tajikistan and IMON International Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. IMON's History Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The tools used are the compressor, welder and some keys. This loan will allow for faster delivery of orders. For Luis, his intent is to keep all the necessary materials and tools in the shop in good condition, because these are the means to carry out his work, which in turn gives him income for his family.

She now enjoys doing business because she almost solves all of her problems and is able to assist her husband in taking care of the home.

She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 250,000 SLL. She is convinced that in acquiring this loan, her shop will expand more than before, and she even hopes to establish another outlet so that she can assign one of her brothers to be selling there.

Virgilio prides himself in serving seniors in his Hispanic community by offering them reasonably priced, high quality products. His aim, he says, is to help these seniors provide respectable, well-crafted monuments for their loved ones that fit into their small and often fixed-income budgets. Virgilio’s business, which he began 15 years ago, makes stone memorial monuments for cemeteries. The ideas to start his business came to him while working at a funeral home, during which time he started to create monuments for the customers there. When people began to comment on how much they liked his work and asked for more of his products, Virgilio opened the doors to Del Angel Monuments. Currently, he sells his products directly to members of the Hispanic community and has contracts with various cemeteries in his area. The business has grown enough in the past 15 years to support two full-time employees and two others who are on-call. However, even with these employees, the amount of sketching, measuring, and designing necessary to fill his monument orders was causing Virgilio to work ten to twelve hour days, including weekends. As a result, he decided to modernize his business, utilizing cutting-edge computer design equipment to save time and allow his business to take on more orders. Virgilio used his loan to purchase a computer system called Monu-Cad, worth $15,000, which allows him to map out the design of his products on the computer. It dramatically cuts down on the amount of work he has to do; he says what used to take 24 hours can now be done in an hour and a half. His is the only business that offers that type of quick service in his town, and he is now able to produce and sell significantly more products. In the future, Virgilio hopes to continue offering the affordable, reliable products for his community members along with gaining more large contracts with cemeteries. Since his loan freed up a lot of time that would otherwise be spent hand-designing his products, he believes that he can now truly begin growing into larger markets. His 15 years in business has led Virgilio to offer the following advice on frugality and fiscal responsibility to aspiring business-owners: “You can’t live a luxurious life because your business will claim it; you have to be cautious with your expenditures.” With this knowledge and his newly modernized workplace, Virgilio hopes to continue serving the monument needs of his customers and his community.

Cruz tells us that her goal is to continue to invest in her business to make it grow a lot more, since she wants to have a cellular phone store so that she can have more income.

More about Tajikistan and IMON International Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. IMON's History Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She says that obtaining her license to practice public notary was the simple part; the difficult part was building up her reputation and gaining clientele. One of the ways that Patricia has been able to build clientele is by offering several more services than the average public notary, including income tax filing, income tax preparation, mailing services and immigration paperwork. As a native Spanish speaker, Patricia is also able to provide access to all of these services for the Hispanic communities in the Texas-Mexico border city of Brownsville, where her business is located. Because many of her clients are not educated in the complexities of the government documents necessary to stay and work in the U.S., access to translations of these documents is of the utmost importance to them. She partially attributes her loyal clientele to her ability to provide these much needed services. Patricia feels that her business has had two major successes so far. The first was the speed with which Loop Services was able to expand its clientele base. The second was a letter she received from the Internal Revenue Service thanking her for all of the people that she has helped with her business. Of this letter, she says, “(the letter) made me really happy because I enjoy helping my customers in whatever they need, even if it is just translating something for them.” In the future, Patricia hopes to expand her business to offer still more services and employment to her Brownsville community. She hopes to begin offering payment services for bills, money transfers, and money orders. Currently, she employs one other person, but she hopes that the expansion of her business will allow her to offer more employment to those who need it. With this loan, Patricia bought a post box, painted her office, purchased two desks, and installed an office alarm system. She is in the process of dividing her office space into two different offices, reserving one side for public notary and the other for the services she wishes to add. The loan will also pay for the equipment and licenses needed for these new services. Finally, with the remaining money, Patricia will invest in publicity for her business to bring in more clients. Her experiences in business have led Patricia to advise new entrepreneurs never to lose hope. She says, “I always saw my business as a job; you work to provide good customer service, and, if you’re doing well, the clients will come back.” With this simple, yet effective, business philosophy, Patricia hopes to continue expanding her business and serving the community around her.

More about Tajikistan and IMON International Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. IMON's History Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

One of the members of this group is Amada. She is 20 years old, single, and completed only two years of secondary school. She tells us that now she lives with her parents and two of her brothers. Ever since she left school she started to work, but since her community is small there are not a lot of job opportunities so she decided to start her own business selling pork meat. She makes her sales on Wednesdays, but the day before she offers her meat to her friends and neighbors in the community. The next day, after seasoning the pork, she delivers her orders. She tells us that selling pork is a difficult and arduous business because days before she has to go out to the other towns to buy the pig that she will prepare, and at times it is very difficult to find a pig and she has to go very far from Playa Vicente. But she is a very tenacious woman, since she has to support her family and also her youngest brother, who has a hurt leg. Amada needs this loan to invest in the purchase of pigs, feed and plastic bags to make her sales. She tells us that she hopes that with this loan her business will prosper.

The staff is comprised of Israel, his father and his brother. With a true entrepreneurial spirit, he states that the reason for starting his business was, simply, that “nobody was hiring.” With combined 40 years of experience, Israel and his family were able to take the grim reality of the economic downturn and turn it into a business opportunity. The road to a successful business, Israel says, hasn’t been an easy one. When he opened his business, which offers a wide range of automobile services from mechanical repairs to body work, it was located in a small shop in a residential neighborhood that wasn’t a prime location for a body shop. The most successful business choice Campos Auto Repair has made since it opened was moving from its original shop in Rueda, Texas, to a larger shop in Dallas. Of this choice, Israel says, “We took a leap of faith and moved to Dallas, and we just started growing based on referrals alone.” While he is happy about the business’ success in its new location, Israel is constantly driving to grow and expand the services he offers. “In the future, I would really like to offer full-service everything – state inspections and alignments in a year or two, and, eventually, one or two other locations,” he says. Getting to this future goal involves tireless work from Israel and his family – the shop is open for business 7 days a week, and Israel is typically there from open to close. With this loan, Campos Auto Repair was able to attain the operating capital needed to begin working in its new location. A large portion of the loan was used to install the plumbing systems necessary to get certified by the state. The remainder allowed Israel to buy an inspection machine, which will be used to further him toward his goal of turning Campos Auto into a full-service shop. Israel’s business ethic is rooted in a dedication to good customer service. The advice that he gives to aspiring business owners is that “the biggest thing is return customers; always take care of your customers, and in return they will take care of you.” This loan has allowed Israel to continue doing work he loves, expand his family business and continue to reliably serve the automobile needs of his Dallas community.

Rose believed she could be a business owner and she had the markings to have success at her grasp. This was 20 years ago. To get her food sales business on its feet, Rose had to play many trump cards. That belief in her own worth was, needless to say, already playing in her favor, but she needed to back it up with hard work, determination and building relationships with many people including potential money lenders. Once the stage was set, she took root and has never looked back. She sells foods such as bananas, cassava, maize, beans, rice, etc. in food markets in Lugazi. Rose also does farming as a side source of income. Weekly, her food sales business is worth 100,000 net profits. With this loan, she says she is going to purchase more foods such as maize, cassava, cabbage, rice, beans to resell.

Margarita's group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity. Her community is a batey, where most of the citizens are Haitians who emigrated to work in different industries in the Dominican Republic. This group is composed of 15 Haitian businesswomen. Margarita has had her business for around a year. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing bread, jam, cheese, fruits, sugar and snacks for her food stall, where she will add more meals, such as rice, beans and meat to sell for lunch. Her profits will be used as savings because her children will start school again in about 3 months and she need the money for their school supplies. Margarita makes her home in a simple structure with her four children and her long term partner. She says that her most difficult challenge is to educate and raise her children in a foreign country and to provide what her spouse can't. By working and selling, she helps to bring income to her household. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying to cook and have fun with her family by watching tv and doing other activities.
