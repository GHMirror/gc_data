It was started by one person—-me, Martin Kelley—-in my home office in 1995. Almost eight years later, it’s won accolades and attention from the mainstream media but has remained largely invisible to progressive foundations and much of the old peace movement.\n\nThe past eight years have seen countless “New Media” projects burst on the scene only to wither away. Yet Nonviolence.org continues without any funding, attracting a larger audience every year. As the years have gone by and I’ve found the strength to continue it, I’ve realized more and more that this is a ministry. As a member of the Religious Society of Friends I’m committed to spreading the good news that war is unnecessary. In my personal life this is a matter of faith in the “power that takes away occassion for all war.” In my work with Nonviolence.org I also draw on all the practical and pragmatic reasons why war is wrong. \n(For more details please go to original url above)\n    <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6396o6bn4s6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.202445,39.959732]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bring Them Home Now","description":"Posted by Paiges<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/0/front_060501iwomickiedee.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> 216 S Meramec Ave St. Louis, MO 63105PLEASE HELP US BRING THEM HOME NOW!\n\nFor over two years, the Bring Them Home Now! campaign has been a voice speaking to and speaking for military families, veterans, troops on active duty and the millions who want them home.

It is structured around a national office in Saint Louis, MO and comprised of members across the country organized in chapters or as at-large members. There is an annual convention in August for members from across the nation. Members receive periodic VFP publications.\n\nThe organization includes men and women veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, other conflicts and peacetime veterans. Our collective experience tells us wars are easy to start and hard to stop and that those hurt are often the innocent. Thus, other means of problem solving are necessary.\n\nVeterans For Peace is an official Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) represented at the UN.\n\nWhether or not you wish to participate in chapter activities, please consider becoming a Veteran For Peace member. As an organization, we are what our members make us. You can be part of that effort. Help us put an end to war.\n   \nWe draw on our personal experiences and perspectives gained as veterans to raise public awareness of the true costs and consequences of militarism and war - and to seek peaceful, effective alternatives.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6396o6t7ft9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.339927,38.64733]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/6183","metadata":null,"contact_name":"tracy_the_astonishing","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:tracy_the_astonishing","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/6183","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":12,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=6183,platial:user=tracy_the_astonishing","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":46406}
