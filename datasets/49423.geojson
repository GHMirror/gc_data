November 16 - 22,  2008 we are headed to Donetsk. Every year over 6000 children are born in Ukraine with genetic heart disease, a dramatic increase since the   Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986.  Over half of these will not receive the surgery they need to survive.  Our  program works because we combine life saving surgeries with local training, so that Ukrainian surgeons in rural areas can build expertise to save the youngest and most complicated cases.  We plan three more surgical missions to Ukraine thorough the end of 2008, and we hope  -- with your support -- to continue the program in 2009.

Training and professional development of local physicians is an important part of the program ... this means that your donations not only save lives during surgical missions, but contribute to the training of local medics so that lives can be saved year round. As always, our long term objective is to create self-sufficiency, not dependency.\n\nIn May 2008, we sent a volunteer surgical team to Kharkiv, Ukraine, where 17 young lives were saved. Through the end of 2008, we will send three more teams to Odessa, Donetsk and Kyiv for surgical and training visits.\n\nWhen we started our program in Belarus, more than 7000 children were on the waiting list for surgeries . . . now that number is down about 2400. We hope to duplicate this success in Ukraine, where 6000 children are born every year with genetic heart disease. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a620nbvwc8xg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.5901031494,53.9023154722]}},{"properties":{"name":"Life saving kid's heart surgeries, Kharkiv","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://chernobyl.typepad.com\" href=\"http://chernobyl.typepad.com\">Kathyr</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/07/4/P6060971.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> Every year over 6000 children are born in Ukraine with genetic heart disease, a dramatic increase since the   Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986.
