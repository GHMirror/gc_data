The cumulative periods begin at the start of the forecat period and extend through the entire 5-day forecast period from 0-120 hours. The 64 knot, 120 hour cumulative surface wind speed probabilites are used to assess the overall risk of experiencing winds of at least 74 mph (64 knots) at a location during the period between hour 0 (the beginning of the forecast) and day 5 (120 hours). This data is based on the official National Hurricane Center (NHC) track, intensity, and wind radii forecast, and on NHC forecast error statistics for those forecasts variables during recent years. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the use of these data.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"POINTID":{"max":2960054,"mean":2925437.61538462,"variance":460283080.25641,"stdev":21454.2089170496,"min":2890052,"median":2930051},"PWIND120":{"max":0.1,"mean":0.1,"variance":0.0,"stdev":0.0,"min":0.1,"median":0.1}},"features":[{"properties":{"POINTID":2890052,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630my2qdopf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.0,26.5]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2890053,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630mygt619h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.0,27.0]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2900052,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630myazq6rv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.5,26.5]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2920050,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630my4mzfyr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.5,25.5]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2920055,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630myezkdrd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.5,28.0]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2930050,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630my4o3k0i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.0,25.5]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2930051,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630myac8yez"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.0,26.0]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2930054,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630my3tcpfd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.0,27.5]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2930055,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630my1raxzu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.0,28.0]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2940054,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630my9p6e11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.5,27.5]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2940055,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630mye0fx8b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.5,28.0]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2950054,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630mycp9gyn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.0,27.5]}},{"properties":{"POINTID":2960054,"PWIND120":0.1,"id":"a630my7c7qpb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.5,27.5]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/","metadata":"http://C:\\Users\\Margot\\Desktop\\FortiusOneStuff\\NOAAHurricaneData\\WindSpeedProbabilities\\2009090412_wsp64knt120hr_halfDeg.shp.xml","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"National Hurricane Center","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":13,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"hurricanes,knots,nhc,probabilities,speeds,storms,winds","published":"2009-09-04T12:00:00Z","id":15771}
