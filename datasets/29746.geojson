(I\\'m just saying that to establish our geek cred. It doesn\\'t have much to do with anything, really.) I was surprised when I got to the venue to discover that the Center for New Words was holding the reading in a tiny room of the YWCA in Central Square.  The room was way too small. I had to sit on the floor under the podium, which I actually didn\\'t mind at all. I really was just plain surprised. I hope that they manage to make some kind of arrangements with some of the <a href=\"http://portersquare.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp\">local book stores</a> around town for the future.\n\n<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/154/354311986_ddd5fc7cf8_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/354318349_7963ac93e9_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/144/359643665_0fbd5620fb_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/123/359643699_9db7153096_m.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.charlieanders.com/\">Charlie\\'s</a> essay was great. It was all about discovering herself as a geeky policy wonk at the same time as she discovered herself as a woman (Charlie is transexual). It was funny and very well written. She seemed nervous, but who wouldn\\'t be. She had on some adorable sequined Mary Janes. I thought I had gotten a picture of them, but I guess not.\n\n<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/137/359643916_e40580e623_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/131/359643880_acaab33847_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/359643838_5a1b50a11e_m.jpg\">\n\nNina Simone Dudnick read her essay \"Sex and the Single (Woman) Biologist.\" She was a good reader. The essay was part about sexism in the Harvard Medical School and part about how men won\\'t go out with scientists, which is ironically quite sexist. \n\n<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/164/359644035_9c8709f645_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/359644005_540ec12418_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/163/359643964_f0ab5bab4f_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/359659633_1da3c96446_m.jpg\">\n\nJustine and I spent some time over a plate of nachos after the show talking about this. Being smart has never prevented me from getting laid. Granted, I\\'m not a scientist. But Justine is, and she has had no shortage of male admirers, and even three marriage proposals. Justine was sort of bristling about this essay after the reading. The sexist idea that men don\\'t want to be with smart women really irked her, mostly because she has never found it to be true. I have to say that I concur. There are some irredeamable, emotionally retarded, insecure, sexist douche bags out there, but who wants to go out with them anyway? These are the guys who moulder in cranky bachelorhood and are generally more to be pitied than to be reviled. For the most part, the boys are all right. About the power structure in Harvard Medical School being sexist I don\\'t doubt it, and the part of her essay which dealt with that was very interesting.\n\n\nDiana Husmann, an undergraduate student at MIT read her essay, \"The Dress,\" all about being a girly-outdoorsy geeky girl.\n\n<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/134/359644143_6ec4fd09b0_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/151/359644106_0385298479_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/146/359644059_4f31546f4d_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/131/359659596_b86b6e1ca1_m.jpg\"><a href=\"http://www.techsploitation.com/\">Annalee Newitz</a> read last, excerpts from her essay, \"When Diana Prince Takes off her Glasses.\" I\\'m a fan of Newitz, which is the reason I dragged myself out of the house to go to the reading. I\\'m looking forward to reading the whole essay. It\\'s about role models and mentoring for young women and the insidious ways in which sexism can make you paranoid, among other things.\n\n<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/160/359644334_442bd259fe_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/359644255_e830f9e26f_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/147/359644211_8fa1536b68_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/137/359644304_933a684b32_m.jpg\">\n\nAnnalee ended her reading with the words \"we rule,\" which caused a sort of comic quiproquo during the qa. The first question came from a woman who was not a native English speaker and she asked, \"If you rule, what are you fighting about?\"\n\nWhile the question came partly from a misunderstanding of American idioms, it is true that there are a lot of women I know who think that the fight against sexism is over, and that we won. It\\'s important to appreciate what our mothers and grandmothers did to get where we are today, but it\\'s also a mistake to think that sexism is a thing of the past. Sexism also is not a male-only problem. It\\'s incredibly complicated. \n\nAnother thing Justine and I talked about was the way a sexist attitude becomes so ingrained in young women that they adopt the kinds of postures toward other women that they\\'ll eventually be be fighting themselves. She and I were both tomboys growing up. Sort of honorary males, until puberty (and a little beyond). I always had a couple really wonderful female friends, but for the most part, I thought women were stupid. If there were men and women having a serious conversation, I would tend to tune out the women. Some time in my early 20s, I was cured of this misogyny but I feel a bit of shame about it still. \n\nThis kind of internalized, subconcious sexism against ourselves is maybe the most wretched form I know. After the reading I thought a bit about my own female role models. Mother, older friends, relatives, fictional heroes, teachers. Some of my first female role models were three heavy metal girls who took me under their wing when I started high school. They may not seem like likely role models for me or even good role models, but that\\'s not really true. These girls, who were 17 and 18 years old, were strong. They were powerful. They were rebellious, sexual, outspoken, funny, and confident. They were never ignored and they didn\\'t take any shit. \n\n\n\n\n\n******\n\nDate: January 11, 2007 @ 7 PM\nWhat: Reading for She\\'s Such A Geek: Women Write About Science, Technology &amp; Other Nerdy Stuff, edited by Annalee Newitz and Charlie Anders (Seal Press 2007)\nLocation: The Center for New Words, 7 Temple St., Cambridge, MA\nAdmission: Free\n\nCo-editors Annalee Newitz and Charlie Anders will read from their new anthology, She\\'s Such A Geek, and discuss the growing role of women in the sciences, fandom, gaming and other areas.

The films were really wonderful. The first one was a film version of the popular book <i>Harry the Dirty Dog</i>. The next film was a great version of <i>There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly</i>, which has been a favorite of mine for my whole life. I mean... what a punch line. \"She died, of course.\" In this version the different creatures were chasing each other around and... well you had to be there. I can tell just trying to start describing it that I\\'ll never be able to portray the sheer, unfettered comedy of it.\n\nMy favorite film was called <i>A Windy Day</i>. It was basically an edited recording of two sisters playing pretend games with a beautiful simple animation drawn over it. Brilliant. Made me want to record Vigo and Rowan. I wonder it its ethical to record children without telling them about it. I think if I get their permission to use it for an art project it would be all right.\n\nThe last movie was about a big pack of Labrador Retrievers living out in the hills somewhere. It showed puppies being born. Pretty amazing.\n\nVigo has a wonderful time and afterward, we went to Algiers and he had a hot chocolate. It was wonderful being out just the two of us. He\\'s such an interesting person, and we don\\'t get the time always for him to talk to me and tell me what is going on with the rest of his life, especially at school. We had a long talk about \"bad words.\" I find the idea of \"bad words\" very annoying. I also hate that he\\'s being given the idea that anything at all having to do with bodies is taboo. At the same time I understand that it\\'s annoying to be in a room of five-year-olds who are laughing hyterically about poop and farting. But a while back, Vigo told me that \"penises are bad.\" That pretty much stopped me in my tracks. \n\nGotta keep on top of that deprogramming!\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ccae.org/\">Get Tickets</a>\n\nCinema Circus: A Family Film Festival at 9:30, 11:30\n\nCCAE and the Brattle are, once again, collaborating to offer alternatives to modern media for children of all ages.

The evening will begin with a talk by the artist at 7:15 PM and follow with a panel discussion.\n\nObject of Desire is the third chapter in World of Awe, and online travelogue (www.worldofawe.net) that chronicles a search for lost treasure in a parallel world called Sunset/Sunrise. The project imagines a post-gender and post-national protagonist. Born from an observation that language defines borders and territory on the Internet, Object of Desire examines these borders, as the chapter is written in three languages: English, Arabic and Hebrew. Challenging the notion of fixed territory, thirteen scenes of the online project download from servers in four locations-—in Ramallah, Tel Aviv, Izmir and New York.\n\nObject of Desire has four web addresses by which to enter:\nNew York: http://www.eyebeam.org/objectofdesire\nTel Aviv: http://digitalartlab.org.il/objectofdesire\nRamallah: http://www.donialrahba.ps\nIzmir: http://www.nomad-objectofdesire.net\n\nDuring the artist’s talk, Yael will guide the audience through several scenes, point to memes born in the Middle East and Mediterranean that are present in contemporary culture, and describe how three geographies—physical, virtual and fictional—overlap in this project.\n\nFor the panel, Yael invited colleagues to consider how the Internet enables the emergent of a post-national identity alongside burgeoning nationalism and the strengthening of nation-states by globalization. The evening will conclude with a Q&amp;A.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639f9btvt9z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.998019,40.756143]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oct 27, 2007. 10AM-4PM.

I drove from my house to Harvard Square via Belmont. I have no sense of direction. Most of the time I was driving I had *no idea* where I was. At one point I screamed an incredibly long, roaring, throat-rending scream in the car which kind of frightened me. I almost cried.\n\n\"Why no map?\" you must be wondering. Well, you see, it\\'s like this. The printer is in the \"office\" which is still filled with boxes we haven\\'t unpacked yet, and the light bulb in the \"office\" is burned out. I wanted to go up and print out a map, but I was afraid of the dark. Yes, afraid of the dark. So I wrote down the directions, looked intently at the map for a while, and went off on my way to loserdom.\n\nThe up side is that I found a miraculous parking space in Harvard Square. Unheard of on a Friday night. If I had had to go back home defeated because I couldn\\'t find a parking space, I really would have been sad. That actually happened to me once, in Boston.\n\nThe friends I was supposed to meet at the show came to the square and we had a nice dinner together. \n\n\n\nJanuary 18 – March 4, 2007 \nOpening Reception: Friday, January 26, 6-8pm \nGallery Talk: Sunday, February 4, 2pm \n\nATTENTION: Please consider yourself invited to TRANS AM, a three person show of paintings at the New Art Center in Newton, MA, featuring ** Jason Chase **, ** Will DiBello **, and ** Scott Listfeld **.

Her emotionally-charged body of work, a distinctive mix of abstraction and figuration, delves into childhood memories and the struggles of everyday life. Utilizing a variety of materials—wood, bronze, marble, steel, rubber, and fabric—she crafts highly symbolic and personally cathartic objects that reference the body, sexuality, family, trauma, and anxiety.\n\n\"All my work…all my subjects, have found their inspiration in my childhood.  My childhood has never lost its magic, it has never lost its mystery, and it has never lost its drama.\" – Louise Bourgeois\n\nAmong the works in the exhibition are a rare, early painting and more than 25 works on paper, which will be rotated over the course of the exhibition (new groupings will be presented on May 22, August 28, and November 26). The selection of sculptures spans the entirety of her career and ranges from a hand-stitched figure made with the artist\\'s old clothing to Spider (1996), a spindly bronze arachnid that looms more than 10 feet tall. The breadth of work in Boston allows us to chart Bourgeois\\'s artistic shifts, as well as make links between themes that have long consumed her.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639f9276ciw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.044662,42.352412]}},{"properties":{"name":"Visual Music Marathon, April 28, 2007.","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Picture_45.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Picture_44.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Picture_43.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 120 Forsyth Street, Boston, MA 02115<a href=\"http://www.music.neu.edu/vmm/schedule.html\">Full Schedule and awesome preview video</a>\n\nOver 300 works from 33 countries were submitted to the Marathon.

I spent the entire time inside the show and by the time I got out, it was too late for me to get my free cocktail.\n\nThe show is set up in on a chronologically linear path, which is not a particularly creative way to do things, but more pedagogical. I enjoyed that and thought it was not a bad decision on the part of the curator. The lighting was very, very low on the show. I wonder if there is more light in the daytime. It\\'s a shame to dull the colors of her work in bad lighting. \n\nWalking through the show, I felt inspired, saw a lot of little ideas I\\'d like to use, and then felt a bit depressed knowing that I haven\\'t any time at all to make things these days. Or at least not as many things as I would like. It is a great feeling, though to turn on the designing lights in my brain for a couple hours and give the part of me that uses those ideas a bit of exercise.\n\nThe crowd was very mellow and mostly dressed to the hilt. Lots of corsets, of course. If ever there was an opprotunity to haul out the corset, well, this was it. The person with the best get up was wearing a buffalo-head hat. There were a couple drag queens in pastel-colored victorian wigs who were pretty remarkable, also.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a639f92a1btd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.467324,37.771633]}},{"properties":{"name":"✓ Boredoms concert with Birgit and Sam July 7, 2007, 4pm","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/1/Picture_165.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/1/Picture_166.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/07/1/Picture_167.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Update:\nI went to this, but the line was so slow and long that I didn\\'t want to wait in it with Vigo, so I took him down to the river to get ice cream.
