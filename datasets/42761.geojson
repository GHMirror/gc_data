Open up a new bar with a swankier vibe right around the corner, of course. Within walking distance of Daddy\\'s, the Well maintains the sexy atmosphere of its predecessor, but adds a shot of sophistication. Keyhole doorways, intimate booths and cushy seating against one wall encourage a let\\'s-get-to-know-each-other mood. Making new friends is easy because the jukebox volume is set low enough so you can actually hear what you\\'re saying. Good thing, since it can be quite a mood-breaker when the songs switch from Sinatra to N.W.A. Get there early to pick your own soundtrack and order some finger food. Stick around when they dim the lights and you won\\'t make it home until last call. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75gy1q9lpea"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.325586,34.098004]}},{"properties":{"name":"lounge 217","description":"Posted by Sleepyfroggie<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/91e14b5856eb5ba762c76e0e2932d2fd.jpg\">217 Broadway, Santa Monica, CANo sign and no light bulbs make this Santa Monica lounge the perfect place for romance on the hush-hush.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a75gy21maetr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.495352,34.013843]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/226138","metadata":null,"contact_name":"sleepyfroggie","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:sleepyfroggie","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/226138","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":16,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=226138,platial:user=sleepyfroggie","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":42761}
