The mansion is described as \"a gracefully imposing structure, clad in mellowed pink stucco and white piazzas. \"It is one of the most grand and gracious edifices on the South Battery.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the main mansion is still a private residence belonging to Kat and Drayton Hastie, who are direct descendants of an 1874 owner, Andrew Simonds, eleven guest rooms are located in the mansion\\'s Carriage House, and in the raised basement of the main house, which are located around the garden area. These rooms are open to visitors to stay, known as the Battery Carriage House Bed and Breakfast Inn.\r\n\r\nThree Rooms in the raised basement; Original servants\\' housing - These three rooms have king beds and are the largest available in the inn. They face the Battery and the small front garden. \r\n\r\nRoom 3 is the largest but has no windows or view, except the window located in its sitting room, which is an old vaulted room which may have been a wine cellar or a cistern for the main house. This room is naturally really dark, when the lights aren\\'t on. \r\n\r\nVarious out buildings were connected together to the Carriage House sometime in the early 20th century. Rooms located in the old Carriage House are described as being cozy and romantic, furnished with antiques / antique replicas.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pivhbnt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.93266,32.770765]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cancun, Mexico","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/tbb_cancun02_729933.jpg\">Cancun, Mexico<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pcs5emh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.830001,21.17]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chance encounter #3, An Open Book, Columbus, OH","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a>641 N.

It\\'s architecture is described as being a  \"Flemish Gothic\" design, blending Gothic and Romanesque styles. \r\n\r\nTom and I visited this grand, imposing building, and it does have an aura and feeling about it of being the home of restless spirits; an unmistakable sense that both Tom and I recognized immediately.  It would fit in nicely as the main building in a spooky ghost yarn or an Adams Family movie.\r\n\r\n Designed by Architect E. O. Fallis, this large, 113,000 square ft., rectangular building, which sits sideways on its lot, opened in 1905 as the new teaching convent for nuns in the the Ursuline Order of the Sacred Heart, St. Ursula Academy. In 1922, the Mary Manse College was established here, and finally became a retirement home for nuns.\r\n\r\nWhen the retirement home closed, the building stood vacant for a few years until 1985, when a man with a dream, Pat Tansey, rented the woe be gone building and Gerber House, in hopes of creating a community art center. The Collingwood Arts Center was started, while rescuing these classic buildings from decay, and saving them from a wrecking ball in their future. At some time, the property was bought outright from the Ursuline Order.  A third Victorian, next to the Gerber House was also bought. It is currently being restored.\r\n\r\nThe Collingwood Arts Center is divided into 4 sections: Gerber House, a Theater Wing, a Dorm Wing for artists, and Studio Wing.  The basement is used for storage and laundry facilities. The Attic was the place where the work rooms of the convent were located and was built to be light and airy.\r\n\r\nGerber House - This 1872, three storied Victorian mansion, plus attic and basement, is located right in front of the main building of The Collingwood Arts Center, connected via a passageway from the basement to the towering Arts Center building just behind it. There is a staircase from the 2nd floor of the main building which leads to the 2nd floor of the Gerber House as well. \r\n\r\nThis lovely, white painted-brick mansion was the dream child of a local merchant, Christian Gerber, who spared no expense in building this showcase of 19th century craftsmanship. Featuring elegant parlors with 15 foot high ceilings, solid walnut doors, ornate carvings, the white marble rococo revival fireplace mantels, and walnut staircases are just a few of the bells and whistles that Gerber had built into the decor and design of this house.  Unfortunately, He had construction nightmares in that the mansion wound up costing twice as much than the original estimate. \r\n\r\n Three years later, in 1875, Gerber found himself to be \"financially over-extended\", from not only overspending way above his means, but also because Toledo was suffering from a economic slow-down.  Gerber wound up declaring bankruptcy.  \r\n\r\nThroughout the decades, this lovely Victorian was the family home of The Ketcham and Laskey families, before it was bought by the the Ursuline Order of the Sacred Heart, and then the Collingwood Arts Center, who restored this mansion to its former glory.\r\n\r\n  Today, the parlors remain open to the public for art exhibitions, small conferences and meetings, and other functions. The second and third floor rooms are rented to artist residents of the Collingwood Arts Center.\r\n\r\nThe Theater - The Collingwood Arts Center has a glorious, 600 seat theater auditorium with a balcony, created in the Flemish Gothic and Romanesques styles with Neo-Baroque embellishments in two crowns over the box seats at stage left and right.  The Theater is covered with a stained-glass dome.  The acoustics are stunning, making it a favorite place for orchestras, ensembles, recitals, chamber music, theater arts productions and other small-group performances in the arts. \r\n\r\nThe  studio wings are located in the old classrooms and the rooms for rent are found throughout the spacious, rectangular Gothic structure.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\"

src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/mi_kalamazoo_sanitorium_I9756.jpg\">1500 blakeslee ave, kalamazoo, michiganAfter hunting down this address, Tom and I looked through the surrounding security heavy duty chain-linked fence, topped with barbed wire, and studied this four story, 45,000 sq foot institutional facility made up of a variety of brick buildings, and marveled at its woe be gone appearance of neglect, complete with broken windows. There it sits, on a prime piece of real estate of several \"rolling acres\", a huge red elephant located in a slightly run-down, yet clean, well-kept neighborhood. If this was located in an upscale neighborhood, the homeowners association, not to mention the art jury would be screaming bloody murder!  Not only is it a huge eyesore, but it also gives off a really creepy aura, giving us both the feeling that something was watching us from one of is many broken windows.\r\n\r\nThis wasn\\'t always the case. In 1954, this 2.5 million dollar facility was once the home of the state of the art Southwest Michigan Tuberculosis Sanitorium, offering the latest treatments known, for the once deadly killer, Tuberculosis, including the newest antibiotics developed which were quickly kicking the disease in the pants, curing people who would\\'ve died if they had lived in the 1920\\'s and early \\'30\\'s. \r\n\r\nTheir successful program changed the future of this building, as patients were actually cured and sent home. Even with all the mental patients with TB from all over Michigan in its care, by 1966, there were only 69 patients. So, 108 long time care, elderly patients, who no longer needed to be treated for mental illness were transferred from the Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital to spend the rest of their years under the care of this facility.  It was no surprise, then, that the Sanitorium as a Tuberculosis care center was shut down in 1969, and turned over to the Michigan Department of Mental Health, who gave it to Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital. \r\n\r\nFrom 1969 through 1990, this institution kept up the proud tradition of  offering the best to its patients, including a varied gerontology program for seniors battling senility and other geriatric patients, who were in various states of physical decline. They were treated well by the staff and there was no evidence of abuse.  By 1990, the numbers again had fallen to the lowest level ever, and the hospital was closed for good. It was in great shape, and just needed the right organization to move in. The Department of Mental Health &amp; The Department of Management and Budget were in charge of finding the right party. At first, several organizations were interested, but \"no action was taken.\"\r\n\r\nOne serious offer came in 1990, from the K-PEP organization, which offers a private, non-profit program alternative to jail for non-violent offenders, 17-25 years old.  Many in the surrounding community were not pleased, fearing the invasion of shady influences at a time when their neighborhood was fighting to stay ahead of urban decline, and undesirables entering their streets for illegal activities. This plan was nuked.\r\n\r\nAnother serious offer didn\\'t come until 7 years later, by Western Michigan University, but the deal fell through because of the huge asbestos problem which exists throughout this 1954 structure.  No one wanted to fork over the money to fix the problem, which would of been expensive.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pixn5s5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.606184,42.299674]}},{"properties":{"name":"Las Angeles","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/LA_2_.jpg\">las angeles, ca<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pcns0q2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.636047,34.036938]}},{"properties":{"name":"London, England","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/London_Parliament2.jpg\">london, england<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pamjd03"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.126197,51.500197]}},{"properties":{"name":"Metro Gold Course at Blacklick Woods Golf Courses","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Blacklick golf course is definitely one of the best in ohio<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pakl3uc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.801378,39.945729]}},{"properties":{"name":"Moscow","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/moscow_1.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pf5whnk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.621114,55.753673]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Rusmore","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/MtRushmore_m.jpg\">mount rushmore<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pkschp6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.459824,43.878946]}},{"properties":{"name":"New York","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/new_york_city_at_night_2_.jpg\">New York<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6p9fd3pa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.986568,40.75623]}},{"properties":{"name":"Niagara Falls","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/Niagra_Canadian_Falls_2_2_.jpg\">niagara falls<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pgi6681"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.07526,43.07711]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ozzy","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a>columbus, ohio<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pjzwzaj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.998889,39.961111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Par 3 Course at Columbus Country Club","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/Tree.jpg\">Par 3 is a great course -

Chicago St., Joliet, IL, United StatesThe beloved, glorious Rialto Square Theater came into being on May 24, 1926, opening as a movie palace and vaudeville theater; truly a \"Palace for the People\" in the highest sense of the words, two years after the ground was broken for this labor of love.  This 2 million dollar project was the inspiration of the Rubens\\' brothers, all six of them:George, Jules, Louis, Harry, Maurice and Claude. The Rubens brothers made sure things were done right, starting with the funding, picking superior architects, contractor and artisans. Wisely, the Rubens setup a well-planned organizational structure which would keep the theater running smoothly, being sure to keep their hand in its affairs, to guarantee it. All worked together to create a truly awesome, air-conditioned theater, which the people of Joliet and surrounding areas adored and enthusiastically supported with their patronage throughout the 20th and 21st century as well.\r\n\r\nA pair of Chicago-based architects, C. W. and George L. Rapp, designed the ornate outside, art-filled decorum and structure of the inside, doing such an inspirational job and having so much fun  and personal fulfillment in doing so, went on to design and build other ornate theaters throughout the mid-west.\r\n\r\nThe construction company picked for this project, surely a daunting responsibility, was Kaiser-Ducett, who also went on to be the main contractor for many of the exhibits at Chicago\\'s 1933 World\\'s Fair.\r\n\r\nThe main sculptor was the enormously talented Sicilian immigrant, Eugene Romeo of Park Ridge, Illinois, whose work can be seen also on Board of Trade, Chicago Daily News Building, Soldier Field, Merchandise Mart, Blackstone Theater, Wrigley Building and the Joliet Township High School Auditorium, though he is now gone.\r\n\r\nEugene Romeo created magnificent Greek, Roman and Byzantine sculpted architecture, decorum and works of art inside and outside the theater, making it a palace which takes one\\'s breath away in its beauty and detail, truly a masterpiece, which inspired a firm and determined loyalty from the public, the dedicated staff, the owners, and the artisans themselves who performed here.\r\n\r\nThis wonder of Illinois stood up well throughout the years, but even this building needed major restoration work by the the 1970\\'s, which would require a tremendous amount of money.  It wasn\\'t divided into a four-plex, and didn\\'t make enough money to afford the  bill to fully restore this now long in the tooth theater. YIKES! The owners were stuck between a rock and a hard place. To save the theater from a sale to land developers, the theater needed a lot of capitol!  This monumental task was undertaken by a determined community, who would not stand for this theater to have a date with the wrecking ball. \r\n\r\nA feisty, spirited group of citizens took the challenge and began the wildly successful \"Save the Rialto Campaign.\"  Dorothy Mavrich, president of The Rialto Square Arts Association, got the campaign rolling, and all stops were pulled out to offer an alternative plan to the awful thought of selling the land to developers, who would knock it down and put up who knows what!\r\n\r\nBusinessman, Christo Dragatsis, assisted in requesting and getting monetary support from the city council, the state government and federal officials. Former State Representative, LeRoy Van Duyne, was \"instrumental\" in obtaining the money needed to purchase the theater properties from the probably relieved owners, rescuing them from their awful predicament and saving the theater for the public. The Rialto Square Theater was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, becoming forever safe from destruction. \r\n\r\nRestoration and renovation work began in 1980, undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin \r\nThe Rialto Square Theater became a non-profit cultural arts center, under the direction of The Rialto Square Theater Corporation. The Will County Metropolitan Exposition and Auditorium Authority is now under the watchful eye of the Rialto Square Properties. \r\n\r\nThe Rubins brothers would be pleased that the people worked together to save their \"Palace of the People,\" restored it and now use it for dramatic and musical concerts, and for social occasions / special events as well<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6phyc1x4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.081596,41.526097]}},{"properties":{"name":"South Beach Nightclub","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/tbb_daytona04_780348.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Po Box 1390, Daytona Beach, FL<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pe9rk5r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.023,29.2105]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Louis Arch","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/St_Louis_Arch.jpg\">200 S 4th St 63102<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pc1f9ka"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.189383,38.623437]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Valentine's Day Massacre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/IL_saintvalentine_7378.jpg\">On the morning of February 14, 1929, a group of Bugs Moran\\'s gangsters were waiting in this garage, for a truck full of stolen liquor from Detroit to arrive. Johnny May, Frank and Pete Gusenburg, Bugs Moran\\'s brother-in-law, James Clark, Adam Heyer, Al Weinshank and a gangster wanna-be, optometrist Reinhardt Schwimmer, who learned too late that it was dangerous hanging with men on the wrong side of the law. \r\n\r\nAs they waited, a police car pulled up outside. (Uh oh, this wasn\\'t good!) Five men, three dressed as policemenr exited and walked into the garage with machine guns ready. All seven men were lined up against the brick wall and shot many times from the machine guns. While Capon\\'s gunmen wiped out the Northern Chicago gang, they missed Bugs Moran, who was late to the party. Bugs Moran later accused Al Capone of this vicious hit. Though there wasn\\'t any evidence to directly link Al Capone to this event, people believed Bugs.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6php6ymx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.637982,41.920848]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a>5161 Hampsted Village Center Way, New Albany, OH<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pgeodp3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.825567,40.088429]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/Dock_2_.jpg\">1187 Polaris Pkwy, Columbus, OH<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6p8hxkgm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.988411,40.142353]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a>199 E Campus View Blvd, Columbus, OH<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pl3s6sg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.009801,40.118439]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6p9maftw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.9193115234,40.1305910638]}},{"properties":{"name":"Statue of Liberty","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/liberty.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/statue_of_liberty.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Statue of Liberty, New York<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pn40pdo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.044633,40.689229]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sydney","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/sydney.jpg\">sydney, australia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pjdcc32"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.210006,-33.869998]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Captain Lord Mansion","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/captainlord1.jpg\">6 pleasant street, kennebunkport, meDescribed as a family owned and run \"Intimate East coast Inn,\" this white, 1812 three story mansion has been made into a rather elegant Bed and Breakfast Inn. Specializing in being known as one of the most romantic get-away spots, it enjoys being located in a quiet neighborhood, \"filled with meticulously preserved Colonial homes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Romance is evident in all the details and special touches found in the luxurious guestrooms.\"\r\n\r\nEvery suite has many nice touches, including Memory books, King &amp; queen size beds, Down comforters and pillows, Fine European oil paintings, Gas burning fireplaces (all rooms), Fresh flowers and live plants,Wine glasses and corkscrew, Free bottled water and sodas, and CD player with romantic cds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mansion has a spiral staircase that leads up to an 8 sided cupola located on the roof, that offers a spectacular view.\r\n\r\nThe main gathering / dining room is decorated with antiques, two lovely oriental rugs, and features a rather large fireplace, with pair of high-back wing chairs and a camel-back sofa to sit on and enjoy the fire and good conversation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory: \r\n\r\nCaptain Nathaniel Lord, who had made his money through the fruits of his shipyards in Kennebunkport, built this fine mansion in 1812, but died before he could move into it. The Lord family lived in this lovely mansion until 1972, when it became a boarding house for older / elderly women. In 1978, the mansion was remodeled into a Bed and Breakfast Inn. \r\n\r\nManifestations: \r\n\r\nThe first reported appearances of the ghostly resident became public knowledge soon after the mansion opened for business as a Bed and Breakfast Inn. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln Suite \r\n\r\n* An apparition of a woman who is dressed in a nightgown drifts and floats through the Lincoln Bedroom Suite in the mansion, often when it is occupied by the living. A young couple on their honeymoon got an unexpected thrill of seeing this night gown clad woman float through their bedroom, and then disappear into the wall. \r\n\r\n* This entity has also been seen on the spiral staircase that leads up to the cupola. \r\n\r\nWho is this ghost, and why is it here? \r\n\r\nMany think that it is the ghost of the wife of Captain Lord. The traditional name given the haunted room now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the mansion, was the Wisteria Room, which means \"remembrance of the dead,\" which may mean that she may have been haunting this room for a while. Or, perhaps this room was her room when she was living, and she could be upset that the living changed its name, and /or that they are now renting out HER room. Also in many cases, hauntings begin after a renovation of an old building happens\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pddds35"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.474111,43.35879]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Duke Mansion","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/dukemansion3.jpg\">400 Hermitage Rd, Charlotte, NCJon Avery\\'s wife was confined to a mental hospital, while Jon Avery and his mother and sisters lived at White Oaks. When a young, female writer came over to do a story on the historical mansion, they were really attracted to each other, and started a friendship, that was moving into a love relationship The young woman put the breaks on it, when she realized that he would never leave his sick wife, and she didn\\'t want to become more involved any further in this doomed romance. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis news devastated Jon Avery who had fallen deeply in love with her. He got her to promise to meet him a year later at 11:50 PM, dead or alive in the circular garden near the fountains and brick terrace. After this initial meeting, he got her to promise to come back one more time the following year, dead or alive. \r\n\r\nHowever, this young woman became engaged, and didn\\'t think it proper to meet him alone, so she brought along her room mate. She arrived at 11;50 pm, but no one was there. Her room mate stood at a discreet distance as to be able to watch her in the strong moon light, but not intrude. If he didn\\'t show up by 12:00AM, she decided to leave. At nearly 12:00 AM, She started to hear his soft, distinctive footsteps, but the customary sound of his polio -induced foot dragging was only slight, and his steps were so slow! She watched him slowly come off the terrace and come toward her. He was dressed in dark formal dress clothes. When he moved almost right past her, she reached out to stop him, but he moved right through her arm , and turned to her and mouthed the words, \"Dead or alive!\" She heard his voice clearly in her head, but no sound came out of his mouth. \r\n\r\nIt seems that poor Jon had died a few days before the scheduled meeting, and had told the people by his bedside, \"Dead or Alive? Will I make it?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6phv9ej8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.827688,35.202306]}},{"properties":{"name":"The house","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a>531 BridgefordGet great free widgets at <a href=\"http://www.widgetbox.com\">Widgetbox</a>!<img width=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"http://runtime.widgetbox.com/syndication/track/042e8698-d569-4c8a-bc14-5cd679a35a01.gif\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6peny74h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.299903,38.788938]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tokyo","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/3/imagining_tokyo_3_2_.jpg\">Tokyo, Japan<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pm5z0pn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[139.766663,35.700001]}},{"properties":{"name":"Victorian Theatre","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/oh_victoria_2353.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> dayton ohDescribed as a beauifully restored, marble-fronted, ornate gilded Victorian Theater, with a glorious interior, wonderfully restored. there is balcony and orchestra &amp; stage seating, with the old fashioned box seating on both the left and right sides of the stage\r\n\r\nHISTORY:\r\n\r\nSeveral times in its history, this building has survived several threats to its existence.

Two years later, The Turner Opera House reopened triumphantly, offering high class adventures into the theatre and opera world.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, the city of Dayton and The Turner Opera House were heavily damaged by a monster flood, but both recovered because of the determined citizens of the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1918, another fierce fire gutted the building. Yet, in the next year, the building was rebuilt and reopened as The Victory Theatre.\r\n\r\nBy 1967, the downtown area was suffering from urban decay, and the theatre was in deplorable condition. It was reduced to being a run-down movie theatre. Nothing much had been done to keep it up for 48 years. It was given a date with the wrecking ball, but was saved in the nick of time by a group of citizens, led by a fiesty woman, Mrs. Kettering, who knew how to make things happen. They worked hard to get the theater named as a historic landmark, which gave this grand old theater a reprieve.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Ketering wasn\\'t done yet. She became the driving force to get the city council to revitalize not only the historic downtown area in the 1970s, but the renovation of this grand old theatre as well. \"Mrs. Kettering tied the  million Kettering family donation to the Victoria Theatre renovation and expansion in the 1980s, to the creation of a performing arts center in the block surrounding the theatre. Less than two weeks after Mrs. Kettering\\'s death, the owner/operator of the Victoria unveiled the Benjamin and Marian Schuster Performing Arts Center at Second and Main.\"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built

It was the brainchild of Levi T. Scofield who designed the prison with beauty and a church-like aura, with the hopes of encouraging and inspiring the incarcerated to experience a spiritual renewal, forsake their harmful life style and repent their wrong doing. \r\n\r\nScofield gave it his best shot. He created 250,000 square feet of massive stone granite building using a blend of Victorian Gothic, Richardsonian, Romanesque and Queen Anne, a most impressive place. It houses \"the world\\'s tallest, free-standing steel cell block, with 6 tiers, 12 ranges, 600 cells. \r\n\r\nToday, The Ohio State Reformatory Museum and its buildings &amp; front area are surrounded by a huge mother of all fences. There is a new federal minimum security prison built on the property behind the museum, on land that used to be part of the Ohio State Reformatory. The parking lot for the new prison sits beside the right flank of the museum, because part of the new prison may be in the pictures. It says in plain English, \"No photography allowed from the parking lot.\" Yes, they mean you and the guard will come rolling out in a car and ask you to stop in no uncertain terms. No pictures are allowed of the minimum security prison for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nHowever, the public can take pictures of the place from the front, on Reformatory Road. Tours are on the weekends, though they are having special Halloween events in October. The first floor houses the museum and gift shop. There are three tours offered; be prepared to climb stairs!!

Squire, who was a British-born Standard Oil executive, working for Standard Oil, with offices in downtown Cleveland. The gate house sat on Squire\\'s large 525 acre estate, way out in the country where Mr. Squire was planning to build a glorious castle mansion, patterned after the grand estates in England, bringing a reminder of home to Cleveland. \r\n\r\nThis once lovely 1890 three story gate house with a basement was built of stone, with tiffany glass, carved mouldings and elaborate European furniture and fixtures adorning the rooms. There was a living room, a hunting room for his animal head trophies, several bedrooms and a basement, making this house a nice place for a weekend retreat. They also vacationed here at times in the summer months.\r\n\r\nHISTORY:\r\n\r\nAfter poor Mrs. Squire lost her mind at the gate house, Mr. Squire lost interest in building his English castle, and sold the entire property in 1922. Eventually, the entire estate was bought by the city of Cleveland, and made into a metropark in 1925. By then, the gate house was in ruins, but the city preserved what was left. It is used for the occasional event, and open for people to just walk through the first floor, as the 2nd &amp; 3rd floor and roof are long gone, and the basement was filled in with cement.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF MANIFESTATIONS:\r\n\r\nFeargus B Squire was married to a very \"nervous woman\" who wasn\\'t very strong in the mental health department. \r\n\r\nHer stays at the gate house were torturous for her. She was scared of the quiet, the animal sounds of the country and wasn\\'t able to sleep. Eventually, she went over the line mentally from being semi-sane to being considered insane. The legend said that one night she was so terrified that she tripped over an animal trophy in the trophy room and died when she fell into a rope hanging down to the basement, breaking her neck. \r\n\r\nOn the web-site, cleveland.about.com, it is reported there that she didn\\'t actually die in the gate house, but she did loose her mind there, and died at a young age. \r\n\r\nIn the 1960\\'s and \\'70\\'s, strange people started to hang out at this park, and used the castle and surrounding area for some of their shady events.\r\n\r\nBiker gangs, devil worshipers, &amp; others doing animal sacrifices frequented this area.\r\n\r\nThere were quite a few suicides which happened in the woods and area of the castle over the years.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6pnj08zo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.695556,41.499444]}},{"properties":{"name":"test","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ta6p8f1vsy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.9989624023,40.1326910059]}},{"properties":{"name":"waverly hills sanitarium","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\" href=\"http://www.sumediaconnect.com\">Jklivin</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/ky_waverly1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/ky_waverly1_2_.jpg\">louisville, kentuckyUnfortunately, the climate and water/ land geography qualities of Louisville Kentucky offered the perfect conditions to grow the TB bacteria, which resulted in whole families coming down with this very contagious disease, which was in its heyday from 1910-1936, though it was still a threat up until the discovery of the vital antibiotic which became a formidable foe and defeated TB. This insidious disease, named the \"white plague\" eventually destroyed the lungs, slowly suffocating people who caught the TB bug. TB also sometimes infected bones and larynx. \r\n\r\nIn 1910, a small 140 bed Waverly Hills Sanitarium was opened outside of Louisville on an isolated hilly area, where fresh air blew freely, and a caring staff tried their best to nurse the afflicted back to health.\r\n\r\nHowever this \"white plague\" swept over the population, and by the 1920\\'s, TB outbreaks grew, overwhelming this small facility. It is said that more people died from TB than Americans who died in WW1. It was decided that a much larger hospital dedicated to the fighting of this horror should be added to the already existing facility. \r\n\r\nSo in 1926, a five story, stone, gothic structured, 500 bed, state of the art hospital (for its time) opened, built around the needs of patients and staff in fighting this \"white plague\" in the search for a cure. The dedicated staff also lived in residence at the hospital, dedicating their careers to the management and defeat of the TB bacteria. A major effort was made to make the public aware of the first signs of the disease, which if caught early, the patient had a much better chance of beating it.\r\n\r\nThe Sanitarium was a self-contained city, offering everything a person needs. A kitchen, barber shop, laundry, dentist, library, etc., were available on site. \r\n\r\nBecause there were no antibiotics invented yet, the standard treatment basically revolved around natural cures; lots of rest, good diet, plenty of sun and fresh air, with the idea of boosting the infected patient\\'s natural defenses. Also, as it was discovered that ultraviolet light could kill the bacteria infecting the body, so this hospital had this tool to combat the disease as well. While these methods were effective for some patients, who recovered and went home, many died in the hospital, despite the best efforts of the medical staff. \r\n\r\nIt was reported in an article found on the official web-site, that of the patients who were admitted to this TB treatment hospital, only 25% were in the first or early stages of the disease, 27% were in the second stage and a big whopping 47% were in the advanced, last stages. It is no wonder that around 60,000 people died here. The early stages are painless, easy to pass off as a bad cold. As the disease took hold of the body, pain came with the invasion however.\r\n\r\nThe staff did their very best in trying to help the sick, and found a need to come up with new medical treatments to help the people in the middle to late stages of the disease, which needed something else than the cures mentioned above. The alternative would be to just let these people die, which goes against the oath taken by doctors, and the strong drive many in the medical field have to find a cure through medical procedures.\r\n\r\nExperimental treatments and operations were performed, and much was discovered and learned about treating the TB infection in people. Some medical treatments which were developed helped and some were disastrous. They did come up with a list of surgical treatments which did help some people.
