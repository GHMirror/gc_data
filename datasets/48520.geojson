The Frio river bottom is lushly forested land breaking into the stark beauty of thick brush and rock hills. The ranch also encampasses range land offering lengthy vistas and gorgeous terrain. \r\nThe ranch is divided up into large pastures. We try to rotate which pastures we hunt on to provide less hunting pressure on the deer and to preserve the unspoiled beauty of the land. We stalk and rattle and watch the deer to decipher deer movements and patterns and we hunt from both tree stands and portable ground blinds. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrx1t9bc0m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-99.094722,28.891944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hubbards Yellowstone Lodge","description":"Posted by Akeene2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/My_21_inch_Cutt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Pretty_18_inch_Cutt.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Upper_Gardner2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/YR_Lunch.jpg\">Emigrant, MtPerched on its own mountain in the heart of Paradise Valley, the massive log lodge offers the finest fly fishing, five star cuisine, and beautifully appointed guestrooms with majestic views from the decks.
