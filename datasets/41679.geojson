Killingsworth St. Portland, OR 97217The Cascade Campus is situated in the revitalized North Portland area, offering students a centralized location and a growing list of academic programs. It is a developing urban campus, located in the heart of a historic neighborhood, and is the home of such annual festivities as the PCC Mardi Gras celebration and the Cascade Festival of African Films. Easily accessed from Interstate 5, the campus enjoys a culturally rich landscape, featuring an exciting atmosphere of expanding academic services and campus facilities.\r\n\r\nPCC purchased the land and facilities of the campus from a defunct four-year Christian college called Cascade College in the late 1960s and the new campus opened in the fall of 1971. Ever since, the Cascade Campus has become a focal point for rebirth in the neighborhood and serves local residents with needed job training, college transfer and self-improvement courses.\r\n\r\nNumerous community programs like childcare, legal aid, neighborhood associations and job referral services are located either on the campus or within easy reach of it. In addition to its traditional academic programs, Cascade also is the home of the Skill Center, which gives people of all ages a chance to learn basic education to start a new life.\r\n\r\nCascade serves over 14,000 students each year under campus president Algie Gatewood.
