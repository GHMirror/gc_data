His dad owns Buckman Labs and has traveled to over 100 different countries.  They always had great food, my favorite was always the grilled chicken hearts.  This is place where I had my first beer, first kiss, and pretty much everything else.  The best time to be there though was during the FedEx St Jude\\'s Golf Tournament when we would sneak onto the course at night and maybe take a keg shell or just mess around.  The picture is at the Golf Tournament in 11th grade and we got a lot of weird looks for our innapropriate dress at the tournament.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644tin7ybl6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.7672271729,35.0558914036]}},{"properties":{"name":"Music in May (either MusicFest or BBQ fest)","description":"Posted by Grobilio<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/IMG_0031.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Memphis in May is a staple highlight of each one of my years in memphis.

We would party in the pool house, guest house, or the middle of his land till early morning and his cook, who was on call all the time, would fix us the best breakfast ever at around 5 in the morning.  My high school eventually found out and told him that if he has one more and they find out he did then he would be expelled.  So, we had to move our parties to his farm, that had about 5 houses on the land and 10 fourwheelers that we drove party to party.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644tig8uxq7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.8646450043,35.1134494365]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Wingfield residence","description":"Posted by Grobilio<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/IMG_0633.JPG\">This house made my junior and senior year.

O yea his mom founded the Collierville animal shelter so the house was always filled with about 12 animals.

It was our sophmore and junior year when this was our oasis.  Its in the ghetto so the cops had real crimes to deal with, not underage consumption.  It didn\\'t matter though because the owners of the bar would charge a 5 dollar cover charge at the door and they would give that to the cops so there wouldn\\'t be any trouble.

It was beginning of summer going into junior year, or maybe senior year, im not sure,  and these 2 girls we knew were asked by mtv to have their party on my super sweet 16 on MTV.  I hate MTV and that show but it was incredible.  D4L was number one on the charts with Shake that laffy taffy and Triple 6 Mafia was there with Poppin My Collar and they were throwing 100 dollar bills into the crowd.  The building was packed and I dont understand why but I can not find the pictures that I took while we were there but I do have a good after party shot of my friend.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644tifrm2jn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.0489020348,35.1498280407]}},{"properties":{"name":"the Peabody Hotel","description":"Posted by Grobilio<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/IMG_0986.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> this is where we did all our tuxedo partying, but we always ended up stumbling down to beale to eat at around 3 in the morning.

The zoo was the place to walk off ur hangover or the place to pay 5 dollars and just have a great time.  Overton park is right next door, we would go play football, play ultimate frisbee, go golfing, or just have a picnic in the grass.  It has gone way down hill since those days but I will always love it.  And its only place in the entire nation that Interstate 40 stops.  They were going to build straight through it but a month before some hippie discovered that an indangered species of duck lands here once a year and it needs to stay protected.  I always thought that was pretty cool.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644tiru0whv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.9950218201,35.1512140722]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/58112","metadata":null,"contact_name":"grobilio","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:grobilio","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/58112","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=58112,platial:user=grobilio","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":46959}
