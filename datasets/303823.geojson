While President Capilouto was not in attendance, students delivered copies of a petition, a demand letter, and copies of the newspaper articles covering the vigil. Students, faith leaders, and community members stood in solidarity, heard testimonials, and sang We Shall Overcome to honor sweatshop workers. Many wept, many cheered, and all pledged their support in a decade long fight. The students were successful in scheduling a meeting with President Capilouto.","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Press2","id":"aan41wf5xrfv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.5052249626965,38.0394376962573]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"source":null,"contact_phone":null},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-16T17:39:16-04:00","id":303823}
