She has me calling the landlord, inquiring for any available single, on the bottom floor, where it\\'s quiet. Earlier this week her bathroom ceiling opened up like a sogged diaper, spilling the lodgers\\'-above shit-water into her stand-alone shower, onto her loofa, onto her toothbrush. This was in the morning too. For the minutes before discovery, tucked deep beneath covers, she imagined nightmare scenarios creating the crash--a burglar, a sexual predator, a bomb. But it was just filthy water making a mess of things.\n\nLooking at Aimee Tomasek\\'s photos in the Strimbu Gallery, I couldn\\'t help but think of Lauren\\'s water trouble, the comforting smallness of the devastation. She doesn\\'t get the kind/cruel opportunity to knit together blue FEMA tarps to make a dress, or eat sludgey, chemically-boiled food from tan MRE bags, and her refrigerator--walls away from her bathroom--isn\\'t growing mold. She also doesn\\'t get to exercise her disappointment with her housing in the way of performance art, in costume regalia, in a street parade. She could, but aren\\'t we adult enough to coast along these DIY adventures without causing a big scene?\n\nThe New Orleans of 2004 versus the New Orleans of 2006, given the tightly contextualized, framed, and referenced pieces in Tomasek\\'s work, illustrates a shift from the prankish, childish, fool-hearty fun-time of pre-Katrina Mardi Gras, with the politically-charged, ironic, and savvy skewering of post-Katrina Mardis Gras. While drag-queens and tarts dominate the content of her pre-Katrina images (images perhaps conveying just as much satire, only aimed at sexual conservatives), post-Katrina pictures show positivism, community, and a high threshold for pain, in a bent that condemns President Bush and the bureaucratic nightmare of New Orlean\\'s flood relief. \n\nBoth years photographed are linked by caucasian men with fierce jaws, strong chins, who don tiaras of rhinestone and feather. 2006 was also graced by the appearance of Federal Emergency Marie Antoinette.\n\nLauren, how to best ideologically align with the patriots in Tomasek\\'s Mardi Gras photo series, knowing we may never be so severely tested as they: stay put.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fskgirg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03974,41.4645]}},{"properties":{"name":"Interview (Swamp Ghosts)","description":"Posted by EsbrysonJust what would haunt this land that used to be under swampwater?\n\nDana rolls her eyes out of despair and says, \\'I\\'ve told you a hundred times!\\' before the mud bubbles up in the back of her mouth and she blurts: \\'The Indians! The Kankakee Indians, the namesake of all the ruined land!\\'\n\nThe Kankakee swamp, she elaborates, in vexed rote, was once considered for National Park material. Teddy Roosevelt used the Gun Club on its fringes for a layover between the MidWest and the more perilous game of the Western frontiers. He hunted birds in the marsh, because the Kankakee river fed various vibrant bird santuaries. \\'So,\\' adds Dana, \\'Roosevelt and birds could be haunting the swamp.\\'\n\nOther animals considered for ghost-status: Deer, foxes, box turtles, bobcat, polecat, otter, chipmunk, squirrel, rabbit, snapping turtle, painting turtle, salamnders and frogs. Other animals, too, like the muskrat, had I but an encyclopedia to list them.\n\nThe draining of the swamp by our fellow white men is a sticking point for Dana. \\'Dangit,\\' she says, holding a clawed hand in front of her, to both gather her thoughts and turn-over the imagined soils before us; \\'The farmers came in after the Indian\\'s were kicked off the land, OK? And they dug extensive networks of drainage tunnels for irrigation and flood control, and they leveled the swamp. And because they don\\'t rotate crops enough, OK? they\\'re now thinning the top-soil.\\' She huffs, exasperated, drops her face and her earings dingle-dangle back and forth. \\'10,000 years the swamp has existed--since the last iceage, since the Pleistocene, at least. And it took less than a quarter-century to completely remove it from the face of the planet and cover it with roads and ditches and ugly corn fields, and almost that trash dump over the sacred Indian sites--the burial mounds.\\'\n\nDana, eyes-otter bright with conflict, sighs.

That is when I was three or four, and was taken in the night to have tubes put in my ears.\n\nMy appendix was on the verge of rupture on a bus ride back from my 7th grade class trip to Washington, D.C. I didn\\'t tell anyone. The bus was so quiet, and creeping so peacefully through the Pennsylvania night, that to complain about my dying body would have been a merciless infraction against the dark glowing rest. Later, when my appendix was removed, my mother or my brothers drove me around on long, song-filled county drives, to keep my mind occupied and rumble me to sleep.\n\nI went out to Kingsbury in April of 2005 with Matt and Holly. I was in the sumblime state of healing that any other night-drive does to me. Matt\\'s rental car, Race Suzuki, was riding low and crooked--the wheelwells were busted two nights ago, when he took us and his bestfriend Cody to fishtail out on rain-slicked backroads. We went into a farmer\\'s hatch, took a wagon trail through a windsheer and half the car slid into a ditch. We got out and pushed Suzi back onto grit. She took off and Matt mawkishly laughed as he peeled away, leaving his friends in the cold mud.\n\nKingsbury was a spook story he never told us about. An abandoned military installation, the only reason for a town to be there at all, had been peeled back after the Korean war, and all the implements for making mortars and shells had been hauled out of the still-standing buildings. The fortifications, the outposts, the mess-halls, the recreation buildings all haggard and rain-rotted, like swamp-submerged skulls. The road into the complex was so over-grown with bramble and briar we drove past it twice, never angling our headlights onto its low-brush demarcation, finally tumbling onto the road blindly, where Matt intuited. We lost a chunk of the front-bumper as Suzi nose-dived into a massive pothole.\n\nHegel, Marx, Freud--if I\\'d read anything on them then, I could have prostituted their ideas for my own safety. But in this trespassing zone of rural exploration, I only felt the gloom and majesty any abandoned endeavor produces. The phenomenon has been explored extensively, mainly in the idea of the \\'uncanny,\\' the everyday turned unfamiliar, as Vidler describes, \\'the stubborn resistance of nature to the assimilation of human attributes and its tragic propensity to inorganic isolation.\\' \n\nWhen the drizzle let down, Matt and Holly and me got on top of Suzi. Matt said, \\'Let\\'s roof,\\' so that\\'s what we did. He had his leg in the driver\\'s side window, steering the car as it trundled forward, gear in drive, and I had my legs hanging off the back. Holly bravely faced forward. We roofed through the debris, stopping here and there to inspect empty lots, circles of dead trees, the resonating shimmer of an inky pond, and three gutted buildings.\n\n\n\nFixed below is a link to a youtube.com, Okkervil River\\'s music video for their song, \\'For Real,\\' off their album Black Sheep Boy.

I\\'m not sure about the \\'second chance\\' part; I feel like I was never given a first. Alas. \n\nThis gala, held in the same apartment described in \\'The Cat and Her Spaces,\\' will be chaperoned, have spiked punch, a photographer, formal wear at least four years un-worn, and girls crying in the bathroom, alone. The boys will take too much time asking their dates to dance; they\\'ll shift awkwardly and compliment one another on their boutonnières. Some of the guests may go onto the balcony and sneak cigarettes, and a few guests might attempt sexual intercourse in cars in the parking lot, and one lucky person could get a bucket of pigs blood dumped over his or her head. Well, probably not that one. The Girl\\'s Apartment has such nice hardwood floors!\n\nTruth is, Second Chance Prom: We\\'ve Come This Far is imploding all around me—friends are discussing dates, dinners, dresses, Salvation Army-bought suit coats, and plans for After-Second Chance Prom: We\\'ve Come This Far. Who will lose their virginity? (‘O, you’re still a virgin?’ ‘Um.’ ‘No. That’s fine. No pressure. But, I mean—this is your second chance.’)\n\nIn \\'The Cafes and the Carnivores,\\' I stopped just short of leaving the pet and hobby shop. That piece ended on a regal note of ambivalence. Did I want to stroke a kitten? Certainly. Was I disappointed? Some. But—there I stopped, never to disclose the happy event that came after. This was because I feared my heart would betray me...\n\nThat is: \n\nOutside the shop, a friend of mine stopped me. Tall, lanky arms one a wide chest. Brown running shorts above sleek thighs, smooth calves. Eyes blue with good humor. \n\n\\'Evan!\\' he called from down the sidewalk.\n\n‘Fuck,’ I mumbled to myself, adjusting my cap. Then I called out unabashedly to the boy, beaming, perhaps a little too excited: ‘Nate! What’s up, man?’\n\nHe trotted over. We shook hands for some reason. (My relationships seem to accrue through intimate handshakes now. Why?) \n\nWe talked about the lack of kittens. In the back of my head, I kept whispering, ‘Evan, you fucking wasteboy, you little troglodyte, you ugly fool.’ But my tongue kept making the most admirable efforts to connect—talking about running, about the community, about the assignment. And—Second Chance Prom: We’ve Come This Far. \n\nNate and I expressed some trepidation, some misgivings, but he was hiding his excitement. His mouth was wide open with glee, talking about the bad music, the dancing. ‘Those girls, he said. ‘Those boys,’ I said. \n\n\\'I don\\'t have a tux. I\\'m a little chaffed that I\\'m expected to wear a blazer.\\' I confessed: \\'I\\'m afraid I\\'ll need to get a haircut, too.\\'\n\nNate said, \\'I hear ya, I hear ya. But it\\'ll be a blast!\\'\n\n\\'You\\'re right, you\\'re right.\\'\n\nAnyhow. We parted ways. He had to go to work. I stared after, longing. It was a vulnerable, antebellum romance novel kind of longing. I felt a little sick to my stomach, how ridiculous all this had become!\n\nBut, if you can use the same powers you use to sculpt balloon arches, Prom Planning Committee, this is my top five list of who I want to ask me to Second Chance Prom: We\\'ve Come This Far:\n\nNate\nDavid\nEric\nJeremy\nKevin\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEvan\n\nP.S.

She feared I was always looking at the world with a battered eye, and spoke of it with too bitter a tongue, and, \"for such a sensible young man, I just don\\'t understand why.\" We still write to each other.\n\nMy first year in Valparaiso, my friend asked me to escort her to her sorority\\'s winter semi-formal. Even though she knew how much respect I had for our campus\\' Greek life, she thought I\\'d be a discerning date, someone that would keep his eye on her and other people, and report back with some integrity on the state of the human scenes at the little gala. Also, I wouldn\\'t try to have sex with her at the end of the night, which, it seems, a lot of people get too anxious about. \n\nThe dance wasn\\'t very fun. All the guys were too drunk to talk to, and if they weren\\'t drunk they acted drunk. The cleaning staff for Casa del Roma, the venue for this affair, must dread the clean-up after opening their doors for the kids in our University because all we do is puke in their bathrooms, in the stalls, in the urinals, and fill their wastebaskets up with shit when the toilets get taken over by people passed out.\n\nIt\\'s an impressive space—faux-glamorous, faux-Italian—with columns and a balcony area, and a dark cherry hardwood dancing floor, then vine-trellises, and cut-glass chandeliers. Jake Gatsby might cut-loose here. But it isn\\'t a complete space. Usually, whoever is on the decorating committee for these events, they string up white Christmas lights, and billowing swaths of maroon fabric, because nothing quite catches your eye in the big rooms. All atmosphere, no ambiance; all expectation, no catalyst. And there is never enough privacy. To have an intimate moment, a grope or two, or get in fight, you have to take it to the parking lot. (But no one ever takes it elsewhere: formals, inherently, formulate a preposterous stage for the melodrama of good manners and fake smiles riven down their centers, so the guts can pop out, and coil around all.)\n\nDance halls must succeed only is much as they can make their captives anxious. It\\'s implacable, uncanny, that a bus full of sorority sisters and their fraternity boyfriends, once peaceful, once so diligent at compromise and placation, air months-long grievances and secrets out on the dance floor. Two years ago, it was the vague hostility of rival lovers blooming through amaretto sours. Then someone dropped their champagne flute on the dance floor, and those girls who had relieved themselves of too-tight pumps, they got glass in their feet.\n\nSuch insanity—what triviality, arcane abuse, we will do one another when a transient location (that is, where you will only stay for a few hours) is filled with desperate intentions. Last night, after promising myself to never attend these ridiculous farces, I was feeling a lot more apologetic about my criticisms. So I said yes.\n\nAnd it ended in tears again. But this time, I was mostly outside, out of contact, lying down on a concrete recreation of greco-roman ruins very exhausted from dancing and pining, but thrilled to be living through the drama of the night—a lesbian couples\\' outing; at least three people escorted back to campus, too drunk to talk; and a beserk ping-ponging of betrayals, accumulating then leap-frogging from one body to the next.\n\n—\n\n\\'Hey--hey guy laying on the concrete...?\\'\n\nWhat.\n\n\\'Hey--are you okay?\\'\n\nPerfect.\n\n\\'Yeah you are, guy-laying-on-the-concrete. You want to smoke?\\'\n\nNo.\n\n\\'Your date ditch you?\\'\n\nNo.\n\n\\'You drink too much?\\'\n\nCould you ever?\n\n\\'Ha, that\\'s right man, that\\'s right.\\'\n\nI\\'m just looking at the stars. Trying to stay outta trouble.\n\n\\'I hear ya, man, I hear ya.\\'\n\nNice and cool out here.\n\n\\'Yeah, man, it\\'s a real nice night.\\'\n\nYeah.

Then there is Jefferson Street, Monroe, Washington, then Lafayette; a Memorial, and a Century, I think. Just in case the national history is forgotten, at least roads will have something to say of dead presidents and their conquests.\n\nBut things were cold and a little wet. Rice burners and farmers\\' trucks conversed side-by-side in the thin streets, their bodies reflected among the windows of the European-style cafes and bistros set-off on wide sidewalks. The air was stagnant with the smell of dead winter and exhaust fumes. Spring was trying her damndest, and on the lawn of the fortess-like court house, daffodills and tulips were making their way into the warming light.\n\nAnd - there is always that discreet possibility of encountering the gaze of someone sipping in a coffee shop - and holding that gaze. And in that gaze imagining the sex these perfect strangers could have over and over, utterly changing their lives, climaxing in shrieks of glass-shattering frequencies. That is, making noise enough to break all that smokey carmely dreamy glass between the interior and exterior conspirators.\n\nI\\'m uncertain, absolutely, why the pet shop doesn\\'t stock kittens. Fish and fish and more fish; tiger striped (mewling, finny), tank-cleaning (poop-eating), and lonesome (lonesome), blue tanks with blue backgrounds. \n\n\\'Ma\\'am, you guys have any kittens?\\'\n\n\\'No, not here.\\'\n\nThe shopworker shakes her head in vigourous suspicion as I write down our exchange in my Moleskin notebook.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d9fwgzzs1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.06135,41.46781]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Cat and Her Spaces","description":"Posted by Esbryson<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/blackhorror_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/cosette.jpg\">Seems silly. Long bouts of not having a cat--probably since I was in Elementary School is the last time I really owned one, or had one to feed. At the apartment lives Cosette, who is fat and depressed and gets excited only when she can eat. She coughs up enormous, pubicly torrid hairballs and has fine dandruff that sticks under my fingernails if I scratch her back too long. I jokingly obliged her, Be My Valentine? but I fazed the joke out a week before the 14th, because I was broke. And really, what can a filthy cat give back? \n\nI read cats can\\'t sublimate pleasure. After a few minutes of feeling well-kept with strokes and comfort, they get confused and start hissing. Even a purring cat will eventually forget it was having a high time, unless it falls asleep. This threshold probably has a name and can be teased into a broader application.\n\nCosette\\'s apartment sometimes has parties. I attended a Masquarade there last Friday. Felt like a real animal, with a crow mask so huge it hurt the bridge of my nose, and blighted one eye\\'s sight. \n\n\\'Oh my God, that\\'s fantastic! Can you see in that thing?\\'\n\n\\'No.\\'\n\nReaching for salsa and chips was a chore, I had no depth perception for the night. Accidentally elbowed couples standing in doorways, waved at strangers, eventually collapsed on a chair in the living room and stared beakishly at unknowers, still feeling peckish, too proud to waver the mask. I Sipped on Red Bull to give me wings. \n\nCosette hid in Tracy\\'s room under the bed. I knew exactly where she was, where she always is, and surprised myself by not creeping down to her to scare her whiskers off.\n\nWhat a terrific inversion. An animal frightened by humans dressed like animals, and hiding under the bed. When I was younger, I mentally topated where I would hide if burglars entered my home in the night. Emphatically! Only under the bed! Behind boxes of old seashells and used-up calendars, and bundles of birthday cards. Old shoes. Tender dust bunnies!\n\n\\'Cosette?\\'\n\n...\n\n\\'I\\'m sorry you\\'re so ascared. Caw, caw.\\'\n\n...\n\n\\'Aren\\'t you going to ask what I am?\\'\n\n...\n\n\\'I\\'m a crow-clock.

Their freshman year was boiling ice on the spoon, fueling their habits with reckless abandon. Winter\\'s passing complicated their adventures, the advent of snowless lawns made way for a trampoline, and their present trajectory charted a haphazzard course to this treaure.\n\nWhat were they to do with themselves? The cool air eased the leveling glow of a jealous sun. The breeze teased their elbows, fluttering the bottoms of their t-shirts.
