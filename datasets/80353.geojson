My all time favorite show was \"Barbarella\".  It was so amazingly cool, really, you should have seen it.  \n\nTip: At the Ritz you can bring your refreshments from the lobby into the theater.  I recommend buying a bottle of wine and sharing it with your friends.

Puts on some cute and entertaining shows complete with band.  A fun time with a date or a few friends.  \n\nA couple of insider notes:\n\nWhen choosing your seats, pick the high-top rail ones (see seating chart in photo section above - the left hand side dots with associated numbers i.e. 3-22)\nUpsides: you won't be feeling incredibly claustrophobic shoulder-to-shoulder with your neighbors at a long table.  This is a small venue and close seats result in neck pain.  The view is much more comfortable a higher, albeit farther, location.  You can easily get up to access the bathroom, get more drinks, etc.\nDownside:  Like sitting at a bar rail, this does not work when accompanied by a large group.    \n\nNo pressure to supplement your ticket cost with high priced cocktails.  Patience, my friend.  After intermission, they go for 2-4-1 prices.\n\nIf performing arts is your cup of tea, get yourself signed up right now for the Hennepin Theatre District Events email.  http://www.hennepinthe.../\nYou will be the recipient of informational emails about upcoming events, links for ticket sales, and most importantly, ***special 2-4-1 ticket prices***.  \nIt is also in your best interest, if you can swing it, to purchase theatre district tickets at the State Theater box office located at 805 Hennepin to avoid all those pesky Ticketmaster fees.  \n\nThe Hennepin Theatre District website (see above) is extremely detailed about all 4 theaters, Orpheum, State, Pantages, and Hennepin Stages, so that you can see their schedules, event times, histories, locations, and nearby dining suggestions.\n\nWay to go, Hennepin Theater Trust!","id":"a6fgzxi50q5m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2769722222222,44.9769027777778]}},{"properties":{"name":"History Theater","description":"History Theater\n30 East Tenth Street St. Paul\nhttp://www.historytheatre.com/\n$20-30/$15(Students)\n\nFrom History Theatre's website:\nHistory Theatre seeks to inspire, entertain and provoke audiences through the creation of new plays that explore Minnesota's past and the diverse American experience.","id":"a6fgzxaw38eo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.0976166666667,44.9501888888889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Illusion Theater","description":"Illusion Theater\n528 Hennepin Avenue\nhttp://www.illusiontheater.org/\n$25-30\n\nFrom Leslie R. on Yelp.com\nI didn't realize it until I went again last night, but I've actually been to this theater a couple of times before... it just wasn't under the auspices of Illusion Theater at the time.\n\nThe Illusion Theater is housed on the 8th floor of the Hennepin Center for the Arts, which is also home to Zenon Dance Company, Minneapolis Musical Theatre, and many other performing art companies.  The building itself was constructed in 1888 and originally housed a Masonic Temple; it now appears on the National Register of Historic Places and is a beautiful example of preserving architectural gems for functional use.\n\nThe stage at the Illusion is an \"end-on\" or proscenium space with audience members facing the performance straight on.  Seats are ample and comfortable; the area for those using a wheelchair is convenient and easy to access.\n\nThere's plenty of parking around the theater, but if there's an event going on in the area, look for parking east of Hennepin--you'll save a bundle.  On our recent visit, the surface parking lots around the theater were charging $14; just a block away we scored enclosed parking at the 50 South Sixth Street ramp for only five bucks.","id":"a6fgzxdq1olk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2736305555555,44.9790222222222]}},{"properties":{"name":"James Sewell Ballet","description":"James Sewell Ballet\n528 Hennepin Avenue Suite 215 Minneapolis\nhttp://www.jsballet.org/\n$25\n\nFrom Cassondra H. on Yelp.com:\nThe James Sewell Ballet company is doing something really unique and I am not a skilled enough writer to say exactly what it is.

Pioneering in an oeuvre that focuses on the African American experience in America, Penumbra has been a breeding ground for black playwrights, including two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner, August Wilson.\n\nEach season Penumbra sets off on an ambitious program that journeys through themes of racism and resolution, of family breakdown and repair, of self-identity and community cohesion. The stories are told primarily through black voices and images, but they also convey truths that transcend color lines.\n\nOne of the highlights of Penumbra is their compelling portrayal of the Black Nativity, which is a retelling of the Biblical classic through an all-black cast. Many locals have included the Black Nativity in their annual holiday festivities, with the same fervor paid to \"It's A Wonderful Life\" by generations of Americans.\n\nI guess that's the point of great theatrical (and filmic) experiences:  they appeal to us on multiple levels, inspiring us to see and feel our shared humanity.","id":"a6fgzx6rsgqp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.1237472222222,44.94935]}},{"properties":{"name":"Plymouth Playhouse","description":"Plymouth Playhouse\n2705 Annapolis Lane N Plymouth\nhttp://www.plymouthplayhouse.com/\n$20-38\n\nFrom Yahoo Local:\nA night at the Plymouth Playhouse provides great food, song, dance and humor all under one roof.
