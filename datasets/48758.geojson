With all my family living south its always a shock to go up north and see the people. They are almost a different breed with sing song accents. It may not be the nicest area in England to live but you really see how the common working people interact with one another and that there is much more unity with these people than your average Londoner.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a0cw45z08z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.2128,52.99635]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lausanne Swiss Run","description":"Posted by WlivseyAfter Venice we were Paris bound again to get back to the UK.

My friend and I confronted him and he refused to believe the bag was ours so I started punching him and knocking him around and then threw him off the train when we pulled into a station right infront of a guard.

We met up at these church stairs were the pub crawl starts and began the 1 hour of unlimited drinks. We came along with these Austrailians we met on the train to Rome and had a great night going from bar to bar. There was some cultural exchange with the Aussies teaching us the drinking game \"cheers buffalo\" where if you are caught holding your drink with your right hand and you are \"cheers buffalo\\'d\" then you have to down your drink immediately. Us yanks suffered terrible loses learning this game right on these steps however we\\'ve brought the game to the U.S which has started to spread on campus.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a0cvsof3jf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[12.49916,41.89729]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Club","description":"Posted by Wlivsey<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/DSC00851.JPG\">After having some rounds of scotch at the hotel we decided that we need to enjoy the night life of Paris with some club action. My friends cousin told us of this nice club on the Champ de Elysees that she went to. However she didn\\'t know that they change themes everynight and it just so happened to be Dancing Queen. Due to our conditions we didn\\'t figure this out for quit a bit when we noticed girls didn\\'t like to dance with us while the fellas got kinda close. When we ran out of the club the Metro was closed and we refused to pay for a taxi so we walked to our hotel at 3am on the Paris streets all the way back.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a0cw2jfahu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.29928,48.87268]}},{"properties":{"name":"Venice Trainstation","description":"Posted by WlivseyWe arrived in Paris at 4am with the Aussies we met.
