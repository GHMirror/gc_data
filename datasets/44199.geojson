Lamb for William Fox, who made sure his wife, decorator Eve Leo Fox, was kept at arms length.\r\n\r\nThe Fox was meant to be a part of a large office complex, which was never finished.\r\n\r\nAccording to \"Great American Movie Theaters\" by David Naylor, the Fox was similar, but more grand, in detail to two other Lamb designed theatres, the Midland in Kansas City, Missouri, and the Loew\\'s Jersey in Jersey City. The Fox was apparently copied in 1932 by S. Charles Lee for the Los Angeles Theatre. The Los Angeles looks much like the Fox, just on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nDue to the decline in people going to the movies in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Fox was demolished and replaced by a modern skyscraper. Before demolition, the interior funishings and decorations were auctioned off. The books written about the Fox demolition are now considered rare and are worth over a hundred dollars for a single copy. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInto the life of San Francisco and all California, comes the Fox Theatre, art institute of amusements, as an addition to the artistic and pleasure-loving life of this great metropolis. You enter the wide swinging doors of this great Castle of Splendor, and behold the silent magic of life\\'s mirror, the Screen, in creations of its finest magicians ...\r\n\r\n... the thousand-throated organ, now whispering in gentle melody, now reverberating in mighty thunder \r\n... the orchestra, trained musicians with fingers the soul of genius, in caprice of syncopation, in mysteries and moods of exquisite harmony \r\n... a myriad of multicolored lights \r\n... architectural beauties \r\n... soft miles of carpeted wonder in lounge and foyer, in lobby and orchestra, in lounge and balcony \r\n... Aladdin-like elevators that gently whisk you to balcony, and back again \r\n... the vast magnificence of the palace of a king \r\n... the swift and silent service of minute men, couriers of ushering attention \r\nNot king, nor emperor, nor Cress could command more!
