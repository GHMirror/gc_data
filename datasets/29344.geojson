Occasionally, near the small bridge, there is a rope swing, which is popular with the locals, but the park officials will often take it down. Popular with canoeists, the river is usually clean and warm If you go further east on Ipswich Road,  the river widens and there are more swimming opportunities. Most people park on the side of the road.\n\nSee more swimming holes at <a href=\"http://www.swimmingholes.org/ma\">swimmingholes.org</a>\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hlgui1fiq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.087637,42.573057]}},{"properties":{"name":"L Street Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/lmstreetbeach1049.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> South Boston<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hlgu3lem9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.034808,42.328696]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Cochituate","description":"Posted by Kristine<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/coch.jpg\">93 Commonwealth Road Cochituate, MA Swimming, boats, picnic areas<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hlh2q374x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.367937,42.315097]}},{"properties":{"name":"Long Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/lb02.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Nahant<a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/lynn_sh.gif\">Lynn Shores Reservation facilities map</a>\n\nThis beach has supervised swimming, a restaurant at one end, nice sand, lots of room, plenty of parking, and it\\'s a great spot for kite flying.\n\nOnly a 20-minute drive from Somerville.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hlh74dgm2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.937819,42.439516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Long Lake","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/32118541_cabd87754c.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> Acton, MAThere is a great bicycle map available from <a href=\"http://www.bikemaps.com/pktmaps.htm\">Pocket Rides</a> showing how to get to this pond from the Concord T station.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hlgzxy3j7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.467438,42.528575]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lovell's Island Swimming Beach","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/boat1.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Lovell\\'s Island, Boston HarborYou have to take the ferry to George\\'s Island and then another boat from there to Lovell\\'s.

Accessible from downtown, the HarborWalk extends along Pleasure Bay, with a detour to Castle Island. Pleasure Bay is a calm, enclosed lagoon with a sandy beach for swimming. Pleasure Bay is one of the most popular swimming and sunning beaches in the City. Foot showers and water fountains are located on-site. Because the bay is fully enclosed by the man-made Head Island Causeway, water and sediment quality are consistently high. The causeway located behind the beach provides a great walk way for strolling around Pleasure Bay.\n\nOriginally freestanding, Castle Island has been connected to the mainland since the 1930s, when streetcars brought bathers to Pleasure Bay. Fort Independence, located on Castle Island, is a five pointed granite structure. The current structure is the eighth fort to occupy this site and contains over 172,687 linear feet of hammered stone and was constructed under the direction of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer between 1834 and 1851. The fort is open during the summer months, and visitors can explore independently or take a free tour. The fort and the island are on the State and National Registers of Historic Places, and Fort Independence is a National Historic Landmark. There are views to Logan Airport and the Harbor Islands, and visitors can observe boating activity in the Harbor. The area is excellent for jogging, walking, picnicking, biking and hiking, and there is a fishing pier and swimming area.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hlgum4lvq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.023521,42.335707]}},{"properties":{"name":"Race Point Beach","description":"Posted by Ericag<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/path_2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/ternsbig.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/beachbig.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/030397.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is the most beautiful beach I\\'ve ever been to.

Ask a Bostonian if there are any city beaches, and he or she will likely mention this one. While it might be regarded as the anti-Vineyard, Revere Beach is nonetheless loads of fun, convenient for most city dwellers, and a great place to people-watch.\n\nIt\\'s easy to find this beach. Just get on the Blue Line and follow all the people with their radios blasting merengue or hip-hop. It\\'s a youthful beach, popular with teenagers and 20-somethings, especially those who listen to WJMN-FM. This popularity comes in part because of the long sea wall where you can sit and scope for \\'\\'hotties.\\'\\' For Boston babe watch, this is the place to go.\n\nAt a venerable 102, Revere is the oldest public beach in America. Public concerts at the bandstand and easy T access make it one of the most popular beaches in the state. Lifeguards are on duty from late June to early September.

In part through generous gifts of land, the eastern became part of the park system. The western shores were never acquired and were subdivided into smaller house lots. Today the Mystic Lakes are popular for freshwater swimming at Sandy Beach. Special sailing programs are available at the Tufts University Boathouse. The Upper Mystic Lake is for non-powered boats only.
