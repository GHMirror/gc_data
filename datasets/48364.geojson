It is a very popular roadway that experiences many crossings a day.  The fewest cossings recorded to date was totalled at 3,921 on January 6, 1982.  On October 17, 1989 there were 162,414 recorded crossings on the Golden Gate Bridge.\r\n\r\n33 workers were estimated to die during the construction of the bridge yet only 11 workers died during the construction.  A safety net saved 19 workers and were then called members of the \"Half Way to Hell\" club.  The cables that support the bridge are 7,260 feet long and are 38 and 3/8 inches in diameter.  The painters chose international orange for the color of the bridge because it blends in with its setting. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7e3zr4r3fhw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.477989197,37.8176495595]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grand Canyon","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com/dukeboy22\" href=\"http://www.platial.com/dukeboy22\">Dukeboy22</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/grand_canyon_2_.jpg\">grand canyon californiaThe Grand Canyon is 18 miles wide and 27 miles long.

The popularity of the bell became great when abolitionists adopted the Liberty Bell as their symbol.  The writing in the center of the bell reads, \" By Order of the Assembly of the Province of Pensylvania for tbe State House in Philada\".\r\n\r\nThe infamous crack in the Liberty Bell is widely disagreed.  There were hairline cracks on the bell but were bored out to prevent large damage.  One thing that is a confirmed truth is that the first large crack was produced when the Liberty Bell was rung on Washington\\'s birthday in 1846.  Every July forth the bell is rung 13 times by the descendants of the declaration signers in rememberence of the patriots from the original 13 states.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a7e3zrarks48"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.164167,39.952222]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mt.

The carvings can remind everyone that the impossible is possible.  It is one of the most famous landmarks in our country and was difficult to create.\r\n   \r\nDoane Robinson can be credited with the idea to attract more people to the Black Mountains of North Dakota.  The first site for carving was too thin and could be easily eroded and that is when Mt. Rushmore came into the picture.  Gultzon Borglum was the sculptor who etched the faces of the presidents into the mountains exterior.
