I found a fish pinned against a chain link fence, and then this - a paper plate filled with jelly beans sitting on the bench within a bus stop. A tongue depressor held a small sign that read \"Happy Easter\", and written on the lip of the plate it read, \"Happy Easter. Enjoy some jelly beans.\" It should be noted that this was down the street from the local methadone clinic, and across the street from a bar called The Vern.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64fxh6gubny"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.63913,45.51696]}},{"properties":{"name":"Garbage Run","description":"Posted by Nicholsa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/OuterBuilding.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/x01Elevator.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/x02Mailroom.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/x03RecycleArea.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/x04Portal.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/x05InnerCircle.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 1110 sw clay street portland orPortland is very recycling-conscious.

Beneath a large billboard that read \"Health Care with a Heart\" I noticed some scattered rags and discarded shingles. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a little campsite, with two distinct residential areas. Although the camp\\'s walls had been mulched, its floorplan and features were still clearly visible: an improvised brick staircase; sleeping areas shelled in salvaged canvas awnings; a fine layer of cedar chips sprinkled around all of the living areas to inhibit fleas and bedbugs; a depot of old bottles containing greenish-brown liquids; a carefully crafted firescreen made of artificial pine boughs. Stepping back to look at the scene, surrounded by a vast meadow of shattered blackberry canes, I was struck by how intensely familiar the patterns in the wreckage were, and how much they resembled the footprints left by a tornado wandering among the dwelllings of mankind.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64fxh3tdkze"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.642119,45.490419]}},{"properties":{"name":"Starbucks Saddle Horse","description":"Posted by Oskifan<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/1/CIMG1420.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 4500 NE Glisan St, Portland, orHe is right at home hanging out with the locals who frequent Starbucks on Glisan.
