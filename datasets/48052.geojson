There are cutoffs along the way that lead to historic home sites, but the real treat is at the Falls itself. Not only is its beauty breathtaking, but visitors are allowed to swim in the pool below the waterfall.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wivmddgy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.8539,35.59158]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alum's Cave Bluff","description":"Posted by Abaile19<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/54014569@N00/308260694/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/117/308260694_38f2466e57.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/415788030_cbf855444e_o.jpg\">Alum\\'s Cave Bluff Trail is a steep hike that crosses many beautiful landforms such as Arch Rock, Inspiration Point, and Alam\\'s Cave Bluff. Finishing out on Mt. LeConte, Alum\\'s Cave Bluff Trail is a beautiful 5 mile hike definitely worth the effort.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wixu82l9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.45139,35.62936]}},{"properties":{"name":"Appalachian Trail","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/63668260_f5e2f61f94_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/16917268_841c7c651d_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/168388027_5c75372a22_b.jpg\">The Appalachian Trail is a 2,100 mile trail that extends from Georgia to Maine. Unless you are prepared for an immensely difficult hike, I would suggest just doing  parts of it. The piece of trail within the Smokies travels 69 miles hopping back and forth along the Tennessee/ North Carolina border, and connects to many other trails. Enjoy yourself on this trail, but know your limitations. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wj3gaz9m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.42485,35.6112]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boulevard Trail","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/259433021_9994467e2a_o.jpg\">Boulevard Trail is a 8 mile hike that starts from where the Appalachian Trail intersects Newfound Gap. Boulevard Trail branches off and leads you up to the least strenuous climb to the summit of Mt. LeConte. Even though I say least strenuous, the hike is still not an easy with the elevation gain.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wivbg43e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.39045,35.62875]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chimney Tops Trailhead","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/283683874_f8318a7875_o_2_.jpg\">The Chimney Tops Trailhead is 2 mile trail that leads to birdseye view  that is astounding. Once you get near the top the view is beautiful but after climbing the 30 foot rock face, you find yourself standing on the summit. At this point, you have truly arrived. The view is unbelievable beyond what you can imagine. This is certainly my favorite trail to hike.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wj1dgwbm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.46961,35.63531]}},{"properties":{"name":"Indian Creek/Toms Branch Falls","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Toms_Branch_Falls_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Indian_Creek_Falls_2_.jpg\">You must first get on Deep Creek trail for .7 miles then take the cut off for Indian Creek Trail. Along the way on the far side of Deep Creek, you can see Toms Branch Falls. Turn right onto Indian Creek Trail and continue for about 200 feet and you will see Indian Creek Falls . Both waterfalls are approximately 25 feet in height.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wj6he0qf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.42896,35.47241]}},{"properties":{"name":"Laurel Falls Trailhead","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/2/457832932_227e3c8580_o.jpg\">Laurel Falls Trail is a relatively easy 2.6 mile round trip hike that finishes up at an 80 foot waterfall called Laurel Falls. It is named after Mountain Laurel, a plant that is very prominent in the Smoky Mountains. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wiso43j1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.58081,35.67196]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rainbow Falls Trail","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/277466474_73cf4a6d15_b.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/444409060_708fa6a812_b.jpg\">Rainbow Falls Trail is one of the more challenging hiking trails in the Smokies. In 6.7 miles it gains almost 4,000 feet in elevation. At a little under the 3 mile marker, you come to Rainbow Falls, a 75 ft. wonder right along the trail. The hike continues to the top of Mt. LeConte for those who choose to continue that far. Even though Rainbow Falls is a difficult climb, it is very rewarding.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wj3gmj6v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.48657,35.67461]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ramsey Cascades Trail","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/ramsey_cascades1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Rasmey_Cascades2.jpg\">Ramsey Cascades is the tallest waterfall in the Smoky Mountains standing at over 100 feet tall. The trail is a very strenuous hike gaining 2000 feet in only 4 miles. It follows the rivers and streams for most of the length, and the last 2 miles passes through old-growth hardwood forest. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wj4mw99m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.35737,35.70284]}},{"properties":{"name":"West Prong Trail / Spruce Flats Falls","description":"Posted by Abaile19<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/tremont.jpg\">The Tremont Environmental Education Center is an area of the park dedicated to the conservation of wildlife. From the institute, several trails branch off leading hikers on many adventures. The West Prong Trail leads hikers to a beautiful waterfall called Spruce Flats Falls. The hike is a moderate hike with an elevation gain of 650 feet, but well worth the effort. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a635wiw80b7s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.69065,35.64139]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/24355","metadata":null,"contact_name":"abaile19","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:abaile19","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/24355","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=24355,platial:user=abaile19","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48052}
