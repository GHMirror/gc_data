story about being a visitor from czechoslovakia (the bouncer took pity on me).  got drunk on zimas, was inimidated by all the mullets and hard looks (apparantly a butch show of affection), bruised some ribs when i got whipped around a corner too quickly by jimmy (to avoid an off-duty state cop that everyone was dubious of) and jammed myself into a guard rail.  good times...apparantly damaged by
