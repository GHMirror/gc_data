Many events from Jan 29-Feb 17. See the website calendar for more information. Over one hundred years ago, the Chinese community began to participate in the parades of the City of Los Angeles. In 1898, the Chinese lion and dragon procession were regarded as one of the most beautiful units in the City\\'s Annual La Fiesta Parade. After the Vietnam War in 1975, Indo-Chinese refugees poured into the United States and soon became active in our community. Local family associations, Buddhist temples, and community-based organizations mushroomed and the parade became a focal point for community participation. Without a doubt, the Golden Dragon Parade is the highlight of the Chinese New Year in Southern California.\nParade starts at main Street and New High Street, then turns left up W Cesar chavez Ave, turning right on N Broadway, where it hits it\\'s longest stride.
