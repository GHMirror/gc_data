I grew up North Vernon, a little town in southeastern Indiana.  I’ve spent my whole life there, swimming and running track and doing chores every morning.  Chopping wood, for example.  We have 20 acres of land, and lots of trees, and a beautiful pond, and we make apple cider every autumn.  And now I’m a freshman at Valparaiso University.  My dad sends me a copy of the North Vernon Plain Dealer and Sun every Sunday, so I can keep up with home.  I usually know everyone mentioned in the paper.  \r\n\r\nA couple months into this school year, I met Harry.  He was born in the States, but moved with his family to Singapore at age two.  He speaks Mandarin, and eats expertly with chopsticks, and as of last October, had never seen snow.  Or the stars, either, for that matter.  Singapore is always so humid and polluted that you never see the night sky.  So we wandered around campus on clear nights and I showed him the constellations while we waited to see shooting stars.  \r\n\r\nAnd for Spring Break 2007, he took me to see Singapore.  Except for some pretty intense jet lag, it was the most amazing trip of my life.    \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyuomyja"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.87848,1.38826]}},{"properties":{"name":"1145 St. Joseph St.","description":"Posted by Ellen8788I grew up on 1145 Saint Joseph St.  St. Jo is a narrow road on a big hill—a sand dune, actually—it’s a killer for bike riding.  You have to take a sharp turn off of Oak St. at the base, so it’s impossible to get enough momentum.  You have to stand on your bike pedals all the way up, wobbling back and forth, panting…and once you reach the top, you’re already coasting down the other side.  More like hurtling, actually, into another sharp turn at the bottom, around a huge pot hole and through drifting sand, blown up from the beach.   That’s the street where I learned how to ride my bike.  I wiped out on that sand at the bottom so many times, that after a while I started bailing out when I got near the bottom.  I knew I was going to end up on the asphalt, anyway, and the less tangled I got in my bike chain, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the start and end of St. Jo weren’t so great, but the top of it was amazing.  For one thing, that’s where my house was.  Right at the top.  And you could see the lake.  But mostly, the house.  1145.  My parents added on to it twice, so my memory of it is a combination of all its editions.  There was always a picket fence out front, and a yard behind it, that got considerably smaller with each addition.  My mom planted new trees every time they made the house bigger, too, so it really wasn’t a front yard so much as heavily forested little patch of grass.  The oldest tree was a wisteria bush, on your right as you walked up the slightly winding sidewalk to the house.  It was 30 years old, at least.  It had a thick knotted trunk, grown up around the axle of a wagon wheel. The vines branched out around the wheel at the top, intertwined in the spokes, pouring out over the top.  It made huge purple flowers in the spring, shaped like grape clusters, hanging almost to the grass.  The iron rung of the wagon wheel had fallen off long ago, and embedded itself in the grass beneath the tree.  My mom filled the circle in with pebbles during the 1st addition to the house, when I was seven.  I cleared out a seat under the wisteria and lined it with leaves.  I used to sit in the bush, playing with sticks and flowers and my stuffed animal rabbit, whose name I can’t remember.  I left it in the yard one day and first it got rained on and then the dog ate it.  But before the rabbit died, I had a perfect world under the wisteria at 1145 St. Joseph St.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyq3y2oq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.2381,41.62064]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chinatown","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/chinatown.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/food_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/chinatown_2.jpg\">Yesterday (the 5th) Harry and I went to Chinatown. Isn\\'t that funny? Chinatown in Asia. ha. There was an earthquake. We couldn’t feel it because we were on the MRT (train), but Harry’s mom said she felt it in their apartment and Harry’s dad had to evacuate his building. Anyway, Chinatown was fabulous. I have some pretty sweet pictures and we\\'re going back there sometime soon. I got a really amazing skirt. It has a coconut thing on it. hard to explain but you\\'d love it. And I had gelato. Have you ever had it? I had, but it was still amazing. mm. Food here is incredible. I can\\'t figure out why I’m still feeling skinnier here than at home though. Maybe it\\'s all the sweating. I’m going to go have some tea with Harry’s parents now. It’s only 6:15 am here.

Oh, and its illegally parked college kids turned beach bums.  It gets occasional notice for its endangered swamp species, odd strains of weeds, and environmental activists.\r\n\tBut what about its food?  Millerites eat, too, after all.  An Ohio native who’s been living less than 30 minutes away from Miller for nearly 4 years had never heard of Miller Beach’s restaurants until Wednesday, February 21, when I filled her in.  Hopefully, the next time she makes the short trip to Miller for some beach time, she’ll be eating dinner at The Beach Café, on Shelby St.  Their specialty is boned and buttered lake perch.  \r\n           Kitty-corner from the “The Beach” is Flamingo, a neighborhood bar that’s open for lunch and dinner.  They have subs and great thin-crust pizza, but for the best stuffed pizza of your life (I recommend spinach, mushroom, and pepperoni), you have to go to the Miller Pizza Station, on Lake Street.  It used to be a train station, so things are a little loud when the SouthShore runs through.  \r\n            Across Lake Street is J+J’s Fish, for hot, fried seafood, and further down is a three-story Chinese restaurant, Ming Ling.  He (Ming Ling) has been serving great eggrolls with plum sweet and sour sauce for years.  \r\nFor a less smoky, railroad track atmosphere, go to the Miller Bakery Café.  Owner/chef Gary Sanders has made this gourmet restaurant famous for French bread with garlic roasted in the clove, meat from the wood-burning grill, and flourless Café chocolate.\r\n               An address further down the street has been home to multiple experiments of restaurants over the past decade, including Mango, Mama Rosario, and simply 444.  All have offered exciting food (like calamari and fried greed tomatoes) but none lasted very long.  There’s room now for another try!\r\n              New on the block, hopefully to stay, is The Baker’s House (Miller Ave.), serving delicious soups and sandwiches, baked goods, and coffee.  Arman’s an old hotdog stand on Melton Rd., has been bought  and renovated by a tile-maker of Italian heritage from Chicago.  Thanks to the new owner for introducing exotic lamb-burgers and eggplant sandwiches to Miller’s palate.\r\n              Hotdogs still survive during the summer months, at Depot Dog on County Line Rd.  Stop there after a day at the beach to eat authentic Chicago style dogs under umbrellas on the front porch.\r\n              If you’re ever in Miller around 5:30 am and need some good coffee and a buttered croissant, go to the Marquette Perk.  It’s a breezy, sandy coffee shop attached to a stained glass work shop, Alice in Wonderland, where the locals gather with their dogs, kids, and newspapers, before a day at work or on the beach.\r\n            Come to Miller for the beach, and stay a little longer for the food.  We’re glad to have so much of it in our small community, but we’d be selfish not to share. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyrx2rv6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.2493,41.61339]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harry's Dad's Office","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/raffles_place.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/fishballs.jpg\">On the 4th, I visited Harry’s dad’s office. It’s in Raffles Place, which is the high class business district. Every major bank in the world has a station there. It\\'s pretty much the center for commerce in Asia. Plus, there are lots of lawyers and stuff like Harry\\'s dad. So we went to the office and the Chinese secretary there kept touching my hair and saying how pretty I was. Then she showed us videos on her computer of her golden retriever named Nicole. She asked me if I had dogs and I told her I had a Chihuahua and a Labrador. Then later, she asked me how old my la-brudder was and I thought she was talking about my brother. So I said 20 and it was all confused. Harry\\'s dad took us on a walking tour of Raffles and we got to see the river and some old historical type stuff including the oldest bridge in the city. Then, he took the rest of the afternoon off and drove us home. \r\n\r\nOn the 8th, we returned to Raffles Place for lunch. Harry’s Dad’s three Chinese secretaries went and got us a sampling of local dishes so I could see how I liked the Singapore cuisine. It was all pretty good except for the fish balls. Fish balls are these gelatinous/crunchy (that\\'s the only way to describe it) white balls in a clear broth. Pretty much one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever put in my mouth. They told me you have to grow up eating them to like them. Harry does. Sick. One of his secretaries, whom we fondly called Auntie Foong Toh, asked me all about my cultural heritage and we all agreed that I am about as American as it gets. On my mom\\'s side, I have an ancestor who came over on the Mayflower, and on my dad\\'s side, a revolutionary war veteran. And some Cherokee sprinkled in. Also, she asked me if I played with Barbies as a girl and then proceeded to tell me that I looked just like one.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyy5nwca"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.85908,1.29516]}},{"properties":{"name":"Harry's House","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/harry%5C's_house.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/tiger_beer.jpg\">After the zoo, we came back to the house, worn out and dehydrated. So, of course, Harry and I decided to go out again! We just ran some errands at the grocery down the street. But here\\'s the funny part: I got a couple of pictures printed at the photo part, and the clerk kept staring at Harry funny. She started speaking to the other clerk in Hokkien really fast, but the only word we heard was \\'Spiderman\\'. When I went to pay, she said to Harry, \"You look like, movie star.  Is it you?\" He just smiled and said no.  But man did we get a kick out of that.  I told him he should start signing autographs.  \r\n\r\nWe came back home and his mom made an amazing dinner of bean burgers, rice, green beans, and sweet potatoes. I was so full!! The bean burgers were served up on this amazing foccacia bread that we bought at the bakery that morning and topped with almonaise and roasted red peppers that his mom made that afternoon. Oh my goodness! Fantastic. \r\n\r\nAfter that, Harry and I went down to the pool and drank like four beers and ate these things called peanut crackers. They were the perfect compliment. We relaxed by the most amazing swimming pool. It has a freakin waterfall!!  His pool is so beautiful at night. Perfect lighting of the palm trees and waterfall. He basically lives in paradise. No wonder he misses it so much.  \r\n\r\nI worked on my tan by the pool for about an hour this morning (it doesn\\'t take much equatorial sun to excite the melanin).\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubz18wr1s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.78149,1.31773]}},{"properties":{"name":"Holland Village","description":"Posted by Ellen8788On Friday evening, Harry and I went to dinner with his parents at a restaurant in Holland Village.

We ate at a Mexican restaurant called Cha Cha Cha\\'s.  Harry and his dad have eaten there every Saturday for the past ten years or something. It was really good.  I had a chicken burrito that was amazing (plus Harry’s dad ordered two pitchers of the most amazing sangria…).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubylekzmm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.78904,1.31215]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Michigan's shore","description":"Posted by Ellen8788Last summer I ran on this lake shore for the last two weeks of break.  \r\nI didn’t hear much of the place, thanks to my mp3, but got to see it \r\nand smell it and taste it and feel it plenty of times, usually through \r\na runner’s high.  I abandoned my shoes early on, and ran very close to \r\nthe water’s edge, when the sand was the darkest and hardest.  When the \r\nlake was rough, a stray wave might come up to splash my face, and once \r\nor twice, drench my shorts.  Running into the wind was the best.  I \r\ncould smell most fully whatever the lake was offering that day—seaweed, \r\ncucumber beetles, or dead fish.  They re all good smells, if by good \r\nyou mean real and awake and alive.  Yes, even dead fish make an alive \r\nsmell, if you’ll let them.  \r\nI went once very early in the morning, hoping to see the sunrise.  The \r\nsun was already up, actually, but the time I got out on the sand, but \r\nstill low enough to make the quietest waves glimmer out over the sand \r\nin pure, cold, glassy blue.  Looking up, I saw Bethlehem Steel, calm \r\nand chilly on the horizon, its furnaces just beginning, making thin \r\nsteely smoke trail sideways in the distance.  To me, the mills don’t \r\nruin Lake Michigan; they are part of it, a lot like the dead fish.  So \r\nI didn’t mind running toward them, taking in their colors and shadows \r\nwith as much appreciation as I did the sand drifts and drift wood and \r\ndune grass and smooth little brown skipping rocks to the right of my \r\nfeet.  But the wind was at my back, and the rocks were getting more \r\nabundant, and there was U.S. Steel to look at on the other side anyway, \r\nso I turned around, away from the rising sun, to run back over my wet \r\ntracks.  Now everything was red and orange.  The waves were not glassy \r\nbut very textured, with seaweed visible beneath their surface.  Three \r\npeople were visible too, huddled around something on the water’s edge.  \r\nOne of them has his arm around another.  I can’t hear anything but I \r\nknow they’re silent, mourning whatever it is they see.  I run faster, \r\nfeeling wet sand fly up behind me, surpassing the pace of my music, and \r\ntilting my head back to let more wind flow in.  I smell dead fish.  So \r\nthat’s what they’re huddled around.  I run straight toward them and \r\nsmile, not veering my path till the last instant, and as soon as I’m \r\npast, I fill my lungs and laugh out loud. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyt5ogak"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.23419,41.62289]}},{"properties":{"name":"Life's a circus","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Lace, swirls, sparkles, clarity, light, distinct shadows, full blue. A man’s face, a man’s smile, a man’s very white, straight teeth, surrounded by an ostrich feathered grand chapeau in the same spectacular blue that pervades the entire photograph.  The man is holding an enormous blue fan, standing on a…float, perhaps.  Something really, really blue.\r\n\r\nThe pictures dated 2004 show a place of astonishment, entertainment, extreme artifice.  The people in the photos al have a goal.  They want to impress, to dazzle, to make a good show.  To confuse and bend your expectations.  To set off a firecracker under your chair.  They want you to have to examine their crotches and chestal regions to discover their sex, and they want you to not be able to decide.  But mostly, they want you to notice, to point, and to smile with them.\r\n\r\nThree women, dressed in wedding gowns—stained, ruined wedding dresses.  They’ve been treated with flood waters.  It’s the latest fashion.  The women aren’t posing.  One has her back to the camera.  They’re looking around—observing, like me.  They aren’t exactly smiling.  Instead, they’re holding signs.  They seem to be talking.  They have something say.  This photo is dated 2006.  It still has light, and sharp shadows, and unbelievable colors—only the wedding dresses are dingy.  And these people have a purpose, too.  But instead of astonishment, they aim at anger.  Humor, certainly, but not the entertaining kind.  They get their laughs from irony, and satire, and wry jokes, not show business and clown costumes.  This is life, not the circus.  But it looks just as bizarre.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubymmtyls"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04041,41.46405]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little India","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/little_india.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/hindu_temple.jpg\">On the morning of the 8th, Harry’s mom and I went and had foot reflexology done. In case you aren\\'t familiar, it’s the Chinese art of stimulating the blood vessels in different parts of the foot in order to relieve stress in corresponding parts of the body.  For example, the inside of your big toe corresponds with the brain. It was pretty neat. But really really painful!! Man. But afterwards I felt really really good. They did my neck and shoulders too. Just like a massage but they used their elbows!! Yikes. Oh yeah, and the lady who did Harry’s mom looked exactly like Jackie Chan.  After that was over, Harry met us and we went to a sushi bar.  It was amazing. You sit around the perimeter of the restaurant and there\\'s a conveyor belt with all kinds of plates with different types of sushi.  Soo fun.  I ate some fried tofu. Eh. It was ok. Then Harry and I went to little India. It was really…interesting. \r\n\r\nWhen we got off the subway, we accidentally went out the wrong side and had to walk through the wet market. It was soooo disgusting!! We had to walk through the meat section and it was enough to turn anyone into a vegetarian. Yuck. Little India was pretty dirty. It smelled awful. Took awhile to get used to. Everywhere we went, all you could see were booths of gold. Gold gold gold.

Then we went into the orchid gardens. They were absolutely amazing. I took a picture of the most beautiful flower I’ve ever seen—a hanging orchid. It was luscious pink and spidery. So intricate. Being inside the gardens, you forget you\\'re even in the city. The greenery is so thick that you can\\'t see any of the buildings throughout most of the park. It’s incredible. That reminds me, one of the best parts of being here is being able to wake up in the morning to the sound of chirping birds. It makes me want summer really badly.

They are the Singapore Zoo\\'s pride and joy.  They boast the world\\'s largest exhibit of these primates.  My other favorite creature from the zoo was the white tiger. They had THREE of them! The tigers were so beautiful and majestic. I was really surprised at how huge they were. And...get this: their eyes are blue! Oh man, they were so beautiful.  There were elephants, too—Asian elephants, of course, who ate or drank from this suspended metal cylinder.  They looked pretty funny, reaching their trunks up as far as they could go, and their mouths hanging open.  And there were zebras, and giraffes, and a pregnant spider monkey eating a melon, and some really big bamboo.

I got to ride on my first city bus! We rode on the top floor (there were two stories) and in the front. Every time we came to a stop in a line of traffic, it looked like the bus had gobbled up the tiny Asian car in front of it because of my angle. \r\n\r\nWe went to the mall and just walked around for awhile then ate lunch at a food court there. We had Malaysian food. We each had a plate with rice in the middle and then two meats and a vegetable. It was crazy how they served it on regular china instead of paper plates like at food courts in America. The food was all kinda spicy except the lemon chicken. I tried a piece of Harry\\'s squid. It wasn\\'t fried or breaded, just these rings of chewiness in a spicy orange-reddish sauce. Not bad, but I wouldn\\'t order it. Then we took another bus to meet Harry\\'s mom for tea with two of her friends. Then we took another bus (man I am gettin good at flashin my very own bus pass in front of the little beepy thingie) to Harry\\'s dad\\'s office. \r\n\r\nOn another day, I shopped around this huge Japanese-owned department store called takashimaya. I had a Japanese pancake that is like oval-shaped with melted chocolate in the middle. Oh my gosh. Heaven. In my mouth. \r\n\r\nWe went back again later with Harry’s mom. Had some delicious japanese rice and skewers of meat. And to drink, we had kopi, which is coffee mixed with sweetened condensed milk instead of cream and sugar. Definitely amazing. They serve the Styrofoam cups in these little carrier things that look like the handles of plastic grocery bags. I took pictures. Gettin pretty good with the chop sticks too. Then we went and saw the movie 300. All the movies come out on Thursdays here. We had assigned seats. And I got carded!! I guess the little Asian lady didn\\'t think I looked 18. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday we had lunch at this place called Mos Burger which serves Japanese food in fast food form. We had chicken teriyaki burgers topped with sautéed onions and instead of a bun, it was on patties of white rice. You wouldn\\'t believe how good they were. Then we walked down the main drag (Orchard Road) and went to the Gap. Sounds lame, but they just got Gap in Singapore last month so it\\'s a big deal here. We got shirts that say Gap Singapore. Pretty neat. And we finally bought a famed ice cream sandwich from a street vendor. It was exactly how Harry described it: a rectangle of ice cream chopped off of a block and served in a piece of \"rainbow\" bread. I put it in quotes because it just looks rainbow. It actually tastes like regular white bread. It was the strangest thing, but didn\\'t taste as bad as I thought it would. \r\n\r\nYesterday we ate at the food court at Takashimaya again. I had the most amazing brownie. Oh man. They had a stall with JUST brownies. I, of course, chose the triple chocolate fudge variety. Soooo amazing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubz03aqxs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.82166,1.30434]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Shangri La","description":"Posted by Ellen8788<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/03/3/shangri_la.jpg\">I\\'m used to people thinking Harry strongly resembles Spiderman, but this time in the Shangri La beats them all. On the 10th, we went out for dinner with Harry\\'s parents. Oh my gosh! The Shangri La started here in Singapore, so you can imagine how nice it was. Holy crap. It was the fanciest place I had ever seen. geez. We ate at The Line, which is a really ritzy buffet. They had about twelve different buffets actually. And there was a world-renowned chef at each one. They had Chinese, Indian, pasta, salad, and sushi, not to mention a dessert bar complete with chocolate fountain and Coldstone ice cream. I was in chocolate heaven!! Ok so here\\'s the funniest part of the evening: when we got there, Harry’s dad ordered a bottle of champagne. The waiter was gone for a few minutes and then came back with the wrong bottle. So they brought us a whole new complimentary bottle of champagne! Yeah. Two minutes later (literally) they brought the right bottle, which by the way, was a million times better. Then they kept bringing us plates of food with like appetizers (like Peking duck wraps) that weren\\'t on the regular buffet. We thought they just felt bad about the mistake. THEN, when we got the check they gave us vouchers for \"shang dollars\" to use at the hotel or any of its amenities. But here\\'s the kicker... when we got up to leave, the assistant manager came up to Harry’s dad and gave him his card and told him that the next time we come to call him ahead of time for \\'special\\' service. Well! We had no idea what this meant. So when we got in the car to leave we started trying to figure out WHY they did all that for us. We decided that it couldn\\'t have been because of the champagne incident, because it wasn\\'t really an incident at all. It occurred to us that what must have happened is that the wait-staff thought Harry was Tobey McGuire. Seriously. Because famous people always stay at the Shang when they come to Singapore. He\\'ll probably end up in the local papers here in the next week or so. Once, while Harry was at the table by himself, THREE different waiters came over to the table to fold our napkins. ha! and then one time, one of our like nine waiters walked away from the table and then talked into like this earphone-mouthpiece thing he was wearing. i mean it was like high security or something. Well, in any case, the food was amazing. And we were treated like royalty. Some evening. (Oh yeah, and I had like 5 glasses of really really expensive champagne.) Tee hee. I could really get used to living like this.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubypcwk5b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.86028,1.29284]}},{"properties":{"name":"Unsacred Alone","description":"Posted by Ellen8788I’m not sure if I believe in sacredness.  Often, when I most expect it, want it, see the people around me getting it, my experience completely contradicts anything sacred.  Instead of sacredness, I feel isolation, solitude, not loneliness, but aloneness.  The second Vespers service last Christmas, in the Chapel of the Resurrection.  I was in the choir.  I stood in the loft, crammed into the front row bench, stifled in my maroon University Singers robe, clasped tight around the neck, over a very furry black blouse (my cat had slept on my laundry the last time I’d washed it) a pair of backwards dress pants (I hadn’t figured out yet that the goes in back) and open-toe heels (it was 15 degrees outside).  I took the shoes off, hoping the ground might feel holier.  It didn’t.  It was 11 pm.  I was singing something Latin.  I forced my eyes open to avoid falling asleep standing up, with my mouth open, forming a round Latin vowel.  I saw 300 people below me, through my blurred, dried up contact lenses.  They were all feeling sacred.  Some of them were watching me.  I had to go down there.  I tripped down the spiral stars, keeping my eyes on the robe ahead of me, matching its pace.  When I got to the bottom of the stairs, something handed me a candle, and something else lit it.  I held it away from my face in fear, until lighting up the long hair in front of me seemed scarier.  I was in no condition to be handling an open flame—even if it was a holy candle.  The robes around me began moving, two by two, down the chapel aisle, behind a cross.  A sacred procession.  I moved my feet, I had to join.  Because last night, during rehearsal, Pastor Cunningham had said, “DON’T screw up.  And if you do screw up, make it look like you didn’t.”  I moved.  I found a robe to my left whose feet moved when mine did.  I didn’t screw up.  I even sang.  Gloh…oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…ria.  A sacred hymn.  300 people with candles leaned into the procession I didn’t screw up and sang at me, sacredly.  I kept moving, deeper down, through more robes, down more stairs, into the dark belly of the chapel, where I closed my eyes, blew out my candle and sank into the unsacred alone.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyz9j7ae"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.96777,41.4736]}},{"properties":{"name":"campus construction zone","description":"Posted by Ellen8788Construction zones are always interesting.  Especially when you’re on a college campus and there’s nothing more exciting happening than your walk to class.  It’s the same route every day.  Out of Lank’s south side door, down three steps, right at the railing.  You can take the street or the sidewalk, or cross through the grass.  Depends on your footwear.  Thanks to the construction, there’s a slightly new detour to be taken occasionally.  One of the best was the set of swinging gates at the beginning of the sidewalk—two of them, standing solo, in the snow.  The first time you see them, you pause and consider and feel like you’re in a Warner Brother’s cartoon.  You turn your head around, looking for an answer.  You make eye contact with a construction worker.  He shrugs his shoulders, palms facing the sky.  But after you’ve walked through the gates a few times, the novelty wears off.  It’s just part of the route.  Inside the fences, though, where you can’t walk—that’s where the excitement is.  Because the lack of grass is greener on the other side of green fence, maybe.  Caterpillars, earth-movers, cranes, drills, big red totem poles.  Temples for dwarves or altars for giants—massive concrete slabs laid on rusted iron columns.  Piles of riddled cement are the ruins of ancient menhirs, left by druids and dug up by Reith Riley.  Alright alright, druids have nothing to do with it.  But you do get the impression, as stacks of colossal pipes stare back at you while you walk, that a new Stonehenge is happening.  \r\n\r\nI walked through the gates one 8:55 am to see about 20 construction workers standing in a circle, doing early morning calisthenics.  They were wearing their yellow hardhats and reflecting jackets as they bent over to touch their steel-toed boots.   Then they put their cigarettes between their teeth held out their arms and swung them in little circles, 10 seconds forward, 10 backward.   They breathed deeply, blowing out steam in the freezing air.  Fog lurked behind them, rising from the Ditch.  I had stopped to watch them, of course.  One doesn’t see the builders of Stonehenge limbering up everyday.  The cult leader, with steely gray hair and harsh stubble, smiled back at my amazed face as he picked up his carafe and climbed in his fork lift.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubypembsk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.04274,41.46501]}},{"properties":{"name":"hyperactivity","description":"Posted by Ellen87884:23 \r\ntomato soup with a huge dollop of sour cream, a pretzel so salty it’s hot, and nacho cheese.  propel.  a huge swig of berry flavored propel.  half the bottle.  black eyed peas.  where is the love?

No, mom, I have taken the train, by myself, before.  Well, what if I miss the 6 o’clock back, and have to take the 8.  after dark.  by myself.   I’ll be fine, mom.  \r\n\r\nShe won’t let me take the car to the Miller Station and park it there.  Wants to drop me off.  We’re running late.

Chicago is back that way. \r\n\r\nEventually, I find myself sitting on the train.  The westbound one.  On the left side.  I adjust my headphones, and look around me.  There’s nothing interesting inside the train.  It\\'s mostly empty.  Out the window, there’s Smokey’s Ribs.  A blackened, graffitied, violated little hut, spitting grimy smoke out of a sooty pipe on its roof.  It’s surrounded by the rubble of abandoned buildings and two streets.  U.S. 12 and 7th Avenue.  It sits in the median, letting me watch it, daring me to shudder at the thought of going inside and ordering a pork sandwich.  A semi rumbles past, spitting smoke out of its pipe, and obscuring my view.\r\n\r\nIn the moment of opaqueness through my window, caused by the truck, I see a reflection gazing at mine.  It’s a young man in a skull cap, with a briefcase.  Our reflection’s eyes meet.  I resolve to look the longest, challenging his intrusion on my reflection, but he doesn’t look away.  I have to end it with a half-smile and a blink.  \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyo86wxp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.2677,41.59788]}},{"properties":{"name":"the Green Bar","description":"Posted by Ellen8788The Old Style Inn would be better named the Green Bar. It has green upholstered bar stool, green lamp shades, green vases with green silk flower arrangements, and …chandeliers? Everything but their little plastic flames are mint green. Oh yes, and the bar is still decorated for St. Patrick’s Day, which means there are, additionally, a multitude of green-suited leprechauns lounging about, on tables with green-checkered table cloths and wrought iron/stained glass high chairs designed with grape leaves. Green grape leaves. The only variation is a dazzling Miller beer plaque on the wall behind the bar—a useless contraption flashing and spinning psychedelic colors around the brilliant word “Lite.” So you look out the window for relief, and see the vivid green grass of the Courthouse lawn. The building is the color of the sky—cold gray—with a tint of tan, but not enough warmth to contrast the enveloping green. The Court House is blackened toward the base, especially near the doors. There, the cement is the color of soot, like the trees dominating the lawn, bare, gnarled, and enormous. With intimidating breadth at the base, and the spindliest of inwardly curling branches higher up, those trees belong outside a haunted house, not the Courthouse. But perhaps you only think that because of the weather.The wind is blowing viciously…you can tell from the tattered American flag on the 5/3 Bank across the street…but the tree twigs don’t budge. They’re perfectly frozen against the cold grey sky. Oh, there’s a spot of color in the lower-left corner of the Green Bar’s window. It’s an oddly inverted plaster bench, bolted the Courthouse sidewalk. Possibly reminiscent of Chicago’s bulls, but these signify that Valparaiso is the county seat, you suppose. There’s City Hall to the right, white as ice. Makes the sky look like melted butter. In any case, this bench isn’t colorless. It’s painted with summer scenes. The purple-variegated windows of the VU chapel, blue Lake Michigan, a red fox, yellow popcorn, and an incongruous pair of pink shoes, center-bench. So obviously, there are better sights sometimes. And this gives you hope to abandon the Green Bar, heading into the cold, wind, and drizzle, looking for a better day.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fubyt5pagy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.1003,41.48492]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237261","metadata":null,"contact_name":"ellen8788","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:ellen8788","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237261","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":21,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237261,platial:user=ellen8788","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":40091}
