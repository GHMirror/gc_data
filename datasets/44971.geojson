Don’t.\nThe cafe’s plastic menus show pictures of a number of marginally appealing sandwiches and hamburguesas, but their flauta d’ibéric d.o. jabugo is not to be missed.\nThe flauta is a flute — the name for a bread that we might call a small sub, or a long roll. The rest of the name means jabugo ham — what many believe is the world’s best salt-cured ham. The sandwich is wrapped in waxy paper and thrust at you with no ceremony, though I assure you that it’s something Ferran Adrià or Joël Robuchon would be proud to serve. There’s not much of the ham because it’s so expensive, but also because it’s so strongly flavored. It drapes over the bottom layer, its fat stark white, the lean deep, deep pink, just about purple. It is salty, of course, but also rich, sweet, even floral; there are subtleties that make you pause. But this gets a little technical; let’s just say it’s the best sandwich I’ve ever had. -- Mark Bittman<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wk12s8x5h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.170826,41.384118]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carrer Comerç 24, Barcelona","description":"Posted by FbpCarrer Comerç 24, BarcelonaAfter years under the tutelage of the nueva cocina star Ferran Adriá, the chef Carles Abellan went solo with this restaurant in el Born.

Signature dishes include a gently poached egg bathed in a fragrant foam of potato and black truffles and served back in its shell.

That means superb, even precious ingredients, prepared and served simply. The anchovy fillets are insanely good, and an aficionado could polish off a couple dozen. (So what if they\\'re 1.7 euros each? So are oysters.) There are tomato salad with fresh salt cod; Jabugo ham; sliced confited tuna belly; and an extraordinarily creamy cheese (torta Cañarejal) that will destroy any notion of Spain being anything less than the equal of France.\n\nThere is nothing at Inopia — which opened last April — that is not at least intriguing. The plates of olives include the tiny, strikingly complex malagueñas. You can order ham croquettes in any tapas bar, but here they are made with jamón Ibérico, and they are vastly superior. In fact all the fried food — artichokes, sardines, potatoes (served with aioli and a lovely little house-made hot sauce) — is just incredible. The frying is done in olive oil, as it is throughout the best places in Spain, and it makes you wonder why — except for expense — this isn\\'t always the case.\n\nThe menu is huge (in the style of many tapas bars, a percentage of the menu is devoted to pricey canned goods; more on this in a minute), and getting through it in one visit is hopeless. Actually, if you manage to get the reserved table, you have a shot, because for the 35-euro prix fixe menu, about 8 at .37 to the euro, you will be served until you beg the kitchen to stop. Without the prix fixe you will have trouble spending that much money, especially since there is good wine at 2 euros a glass.\n\nThe crowd is drawn not only by the food but by the fame: Inopia is run by Alberto Adrià, the younger brother and partner of Ferran Adrià, at this point perhaps the best-known chef in the world. In the summer, Alberto is the pastry chef at El Bulli, about 100 miles northeast of Barcelona, where Ferran is head chef, and his work there remains brilliant. But in Barcelona, in the increasingly hip neighborhood of Sant Antoni, he seems freer, happier and more at home, and he and his partners have created a restaurant that draws locals, friends, chefs and people from all over town (and increasingly the world). Lines form outside the door, but you can eat early, perfect for norteamericanos who don\\'t want to wait until 9 p.m. for their first bite.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wk14vrwe8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.157647,41.376147]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Clara","description":"Posted by Fbp<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 442, Barcelona, SpainLa Clara\n\nLa Clara (Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 442; 34-93-289-34-60) is a different story entirely. You can sit in absolute comfort, at a table set with white linens, with attentive servers changing your plates and silverware, and for about 40 euros a person, eat far beyond your fill of raciones — essentially bigger portions of tapas — of very high quality and flavor. The upstairs is sleek, bright and pleasant, not unlike trendy American bistros circa 1995. Since this is also the nonsmoking section and, to me, more attractive than the lovely but cavernous downstairs, it\\'s perfect.\n\nI have eaten at La Clara only once (I\\'ve had at least two visits to the other restaurants), but if it was not superb, it was very, very good. Like the ham croquettes at Inopia, the fritters of bacalao were perfectly crisp, greaseless and flavorful, an absolute joy; the tortilla (in Spain, this means omelet) with spring onion and bacalao was fresh and moist; tomatoes — with onions and tuna — were better in March than most of ours are in August. A shipment of fresh baby lamb had just arrived, so we sampled brains, kidneys and liver; the last was slightly overcooked by my standards, but the first two were as good as they can be. Some baby goat ribs rounded things out nicely.\n\nThe above list only hints at what La Clara has to offer; the menu is enormous, with probably 60 to 70 offerings, and a kitchen that seems to execute them all quite well.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wk15wrs7l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.153911,41.378419]}},{"properties":{"name":"La Fonda","description":"Posted by FbpCarrer Escudellers, 10I used to live in the center for two years (since last July) and one restaurant I always recommended or even took my guests to was La Fonda. It\\'s located on C/ Escudellers, 10 between metro stops Drassanes and Liceu. It\\'s typical homemade Catalan food at a very reasonable price (7-15 Euros) in a cozy environment. You can\\'t reserve a table, but if you see a line out the door at night you know you\\'re at the right place. I\\'ve tried almost everything on the menu, but one of my favorites is Paella in Black Ink (Paella tinta negra). It\\'s a mix of seafood with rice in black squid ink.

A representative of the fourth generation of the Quim family works behind the counter in a space about the size of a standard living room. The walls are lined to the ceiling with bottles and cans, the bottles mostly of wine — some quite inexpensive, some unknown, some famous — the cans, of vegetables, seafood and meat.\n(Spain produces what is probably the highest quality and most expensive canned food in the world, and many tapas bars rely on it. Though much of it is good and interesting, for the most part I don\\'t get it, since Spain also produces among the highest quality fresh food in the world. This is as true in Barcelona — which has farms within its city limits — as it is elsewhere in the country.)\n\nStanding in a crowd around the stainless-steel counter, glass of wine or beer in hand, you may get a piece of good bread with some garlicky beans on it, or little assemblies of ham and tuna; mushrooms, butter and tuna; pressed beef with a mix of tomato jam (this, very sweet, is fantastic) and tapenade; bacalao in a few forms; an odd, sort of New Yorkish combination of cream cheese, smoked salmon and honey; a piece of toasted bread with a mussel, that tomato jam again and a spoonful of caviar.\n\nMr. Quim improvises as many as a hundred types of these montaditos a night, on the spot, from the ingredients spread in front of him. There are also classic tapas like potato croquettes, fried empanadas or cheese with sweet grilled peppers, well executed. The whole meal here — you can spend as little as 10 euros, or as much as 35 (about 5 to 0), even more if you start asking for the canned goods — will take you a half hour and, though tapas are not, in theory, lunch or dinner, it\\'s unlikely you\\'ll go out for a “real” meal after this.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62wk17fx0fh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.165485,41.373944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tapac 24","description":"Posted by FbpCarrer Diputació, 269the cooking at Tapaç is all about transforming a few choice ingredients—purple-tinged artichokes, cured-tuna shavings—into swoon-inducing treats.
