It used to be fenced off, rarely visited by anybody. Then it became a homeless encampment. Now, the mounds of dirt, old rebar and chunks of concrete are overgrown with fennel and pampas grass, forming a haven for birds and lizards, a playground for unleashed dogs and an outdoor gallery for sculptors. The Bay Trail runs out to the end. Rough side trails lead to twisted found-object metal sculptures, a crazy little plaster house with a circular staircase, and cartoon-style paintings of uncertain theme, often favoring devils, fast-looking cars and flaming urban wreckage.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfq39js6xp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.325296,37.889486]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cadillac Ranch","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/TXAMAcadillac2.jpg\">Amarillo, Texas Over the decades, a lucky handful of offbeat attractions have grown in recognition and stature, celebrated frequently in magazine photo essays, in calendars, as backdrops for music videos and movies. These Great Monuments are rhapsodized as the embodiment of American hopes and dreams, folly and failure, art and commerce, materialism and spiritualism. Professional authors and screenwriters know a pre-baked, easy-to-get symbol when they see it. Who are we to buck the trend? \r\n\r\n The Cadillac Ranch, located along the tatters of historic Route 66, was built in 1974, brainchild of Stanley Marsh 3, the helium millionaire who owns the dusty wheat field where it stands. Marsh and The Ant Farm, a San Francisco art collective, assembled used Cadillacs representing the \"Golden Age\" of American Automobiles (1949 through 1963). The ten graffiti-covered cars are half-buried, nose-down, facing west \"at the same angle as the Cheops\\' pyramids.\" \r\n\r\n In 1997, development creep forced Marsh to move the entire assemblage about two miles further west. The line of cars is far enough out in a field to allow for suitably bleak photography. The distance from any authority also encourages ever-mutating layers of painted graffiti, which Marsh doesn\\'t seem to mind. \r\n\r\nVisitors are encouraged 24/7 -- just don\\'t steal any of Stanley\\'s colorful signs. The 62-year old Marsh has had a few interesting run-ins with the law over his brand of enforcement. In 1994, he was accused of threatening an 18-year old with a hammer and penning him inside a chicken coop. He\\'s been sued by a family claiming Marsh tricks teens into working for him after catching them red-handed with one of his signs. \r\n\r\nSounds like Marsh is just adding an unexpected thrill around a ranch visit, but then we didn\\'t try to steal a sign. Other bits of Marsh art can be found in the vicinity. There is a pair of legs between Amarillo and Canyon, Texas. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfq3fxx5mf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-101.987076,35.187243]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dooby Lane","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/7_doobie.jpg\">1 Guru Road, Gerlach, Nev.Dooby Lane or Guru Road is located on the edge of the Black Rock Desert just outside of Gerlach, Nev.

Some sources list his date of birth as February 14, 1819. Although he had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented. Norton also wrote to Queen Victoria, and he was referred to as His Imperial Majesty by local citizens and in the newspaper obituaries announcing his death.\r\n\r\nThough he was generally considered insane, or at least highly eccentric, the citizens of San Francisco (and the world at large) in the mid-to-late 19th century celebrated his presence, his humor, and his deeds—among the most notorious being his \"order\" that the U.S. Congress be dissolved by force, and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge to be built across San Francisco Bay. The King in Mark Twain\\'s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is reportedly modeled after him.\r\n\r\nHe is considered a saint by the followers of Discordianism and is referenced repeatedly in the seminal work of the religion, the Principia Discordia.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nNorton was born in England. Records vary as to the date and place of birth. His obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle, \"following the best information obtainable,\" cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was \"aged about 65.\" This suggests 1814 as his year of birth. Other, non-primary sources have his birth on February 14, 1819 in London. According to Drury (1986), immigration records indicate that he was two years old in 1820 when his parents emigrated to South Africa. Southern African genealogies suggest that his father was John Norton (d. August 1848) and his mother was Sarah Norden. Sarah was the daughter of Abraham Norden and niece of Benjamin Norden, a successful Jewish merchant, who displayed his eccentric side by frequently suing family members. This is supported by Cowan (1923) who stated that Emperor Norton I \"was of Hebrew [Jewish] parentage.\"\r\n\r\nNorton emigrated from South Africa to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a gift of 0,000 from his father (possibly his inheritance after his father\\'s death). He accumulated a fortune of 50,000 by 1853 (Cowan 1923). He enjoyed some highly impressive initial success in the real estate market when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice. The price of rice in San Francisco skyrocketed from 4¢ per pound to 36¢ per pound (9¢/kg to 79¢/kg). When Norton heard that a ship holding 200,000 pounds (100 tons) of rice was coming from Peru, he bought all the rice, hoping to corner the rice market. Unfortunately, shipload after shipload of rice came from Peru, and the price of rice plummeted. There was extensive litigation over the incident amongst Norton and his financial partners between 1853 and 1857. Although resulting in a victory for Norton in the lower courts, the cases eventually resulted in a defeat for Norton in the Supreme Court (Cowan 1923). Norton declared bankruptcy in 1858. He then left the city for a time, and shortly after returning announced his title to the offices of the Bulletin.\r\n\r\nThere are no known documents noting an eccentric personality or unusual behavior of Norton prior to the loss of his fortune, so it is not known whether his pronounced eccentricity was a permanent aspect of his psychology, or arose as a result of the stressful financial events of the 1850s. Nonetheless, after his sudden loss of financial stability, Norton seemed to become (in the absence of a proper diagnosis) somewhat \"odd,\" and began exhibiting delusions of grandeur, but it is entirely likely that all his declarations and behavior were the result of successful creative response to the pressure of poverty.\r\n\r\nSelf-proclamation\r\nHaving become fully disgruntled with the inadequacies of the political structure and state and federal governments of the United States, Norton took matters into his own hands on September 17, 1859, when, in letters to the various newspapers of the area, he summarily proclaimed himself \"Emperor of These United States\":\r\n\r\nAt the pre-emptory request of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last nine years and ten months past of San Francisco, California, declare and proclaim myself the Emperor of These United States.\r\n\r\nHe would, on occasion, add \"Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year \"reign\" over America.\r\n\r\nDecrees\r\nIn accordance with his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of state. Deeming that he had assumed power, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree that formally \"dissolved\" the United States Congress. He also observed that\r\n\r\n\"…fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Emperor ordered that \"all interested parties\" gather at Platt\\'s Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 so as to \"remedy the evil complained of.\"\r\n\r\nIn another imperial \"decree\" of January 1860, Emperor Norton I summoned the army to depose the elected officials of Congress:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished; \r\nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with; \r\nNOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress. \r\nNorton\\'s \"orders\" had no effect on the army, and the Congress likewise continued in its activities unperturbed. Norton issued further \"decrees\" in 1860 that purported to dissolve the republic and to forbid the assembly of any members of the Congress. These, like all of Norton\\'s decrees, passed unnoticed by the government in Washington, and by the nation at large. Norton\\'s battle against the elected leaders of America was to persist throughout his \"reign,\" though it appears that Norton eventually, if somewhat grudgingly, accepted that Congress would continue to exist without his permission.\r\n\r\nHis attempts to overthrow the elected government of America by force having been frustrated, Norton turned his attention and his proclamations to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, \"being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm,\" he \"abolished\" both the Democratic and Republican parties. On another occasion, the failure to refer to his adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:\r\n\r\nWhoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable word \"Frisco,\" which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nWhile it is unknown if he intended it as a formal decree, Norton called Minnie Rae, a preteen prostitute who worked in the city, \"the little countess.\" She apparently credited his pronouncement with saving her life in her \"autobiography\" (it is believed the book, which is now lost, was actually written by a journalist who interviewed her between 1871 to 1872).\r\n\r\nAfter examining a number of his \"Imperial Edicts,\" it is tempting to conjecture on the mental condition of America\\'s only sovereign monarch. Unfortunately, diagnosing the precise psychological condition of Norton is an impossibility, due to the anecdotal nature of all the documents that relate his behavior. It has been suggested that he may have been schizophrenic, as \"delusions of grandeur\" is a symptom frequently associated with that condition. However, it is also possible that he suffered from some other mental illness, or even that he was merely eccentric.\r\n\r\nFor all of his quirks and regardless of the precise nature of his psychological condition, it cannot be denied that Norton was, on some occasions, a visionary, and a number of his \"Imperial Decrees\" exhibited a profound wisdom. Among his many edicts were instructions to form a League of Nations, and he explicitly forbade any form of discord or conflict between religions or their sects. The Emperor also saw fit on a number of occasions to decree the construction of a suspension bridge connecting Oakland and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience being exhibited by the authorities:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees. \r\nGiven under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872. \r\nThis decree, unlike most, concerned events that eventually came to pass. Construction of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge began in 1933 and was completed in 1936. BART\\'s Transbay Tube was completed in 1969 and opened in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zpub.com/sf/history/nort.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfq34x0c5a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.461759,37.679851]}},{"properties":{"name":"Forestiere underground gardens","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/1/7.bmp\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 5021 West Shaw Avenue Fresno, CA  93722Like the name implies, these gardens are underground.

Lamb for William Fox, who made sure his wife, decorator Eve Leo Fox, was kept at arms length.\r\n\r\nThe Fox was meant to be a part of a large office complex, which was never finished.\r\n\r\nAccording to \"Great American Movie Theaters\" by David Naylor, the Fox was similar, but more grand, in detail to two other Lamb designed theatres, the Midland in Kansas City, Missouri, and the Loew\\'s Jersey in Jersey City. The Fox was apparently copied in 1932 by S. Charles Lee for the Los Angeles Theatre. The Los Angeles looks much like the Fox, just on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nDue to the decline in people going to the movies in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Fox was demolished and replaced by a modern skyscraper. Before demolition, the interior funishings and decorations were auctioned off. The books written about the Fox demolition are now considered rare and are worth over a hundred dollars for a single copy. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInto the life of San Francisco and all California, comes the Fox Theatre, art institute of amusements, as an addition to the artistic and pleasure-loving life of this great metropolis.

It is hard to believe these days, but back then people dumped all kinds of refuse straight into the ocean, including old cars, and their household garbage, which of course included lots of glass. By the early sixties, some attempts were made to control what was dumped, and dumping of any toxic items was banned. Finally in 1967, the North Coast Water Quality Board realized what a mistake it was and plans were begun for a new dump away from the ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, over 30 years later, Mother Nature has reclaimed this beach. Years of pounding wave action have deposited tons of polished glass onto the beach. You\\'ll still see the occasional reminder of it earlier life, such as a rusted spark plug, but for the most part what you\\'ll see is millions of pieces of glass sparkling in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn addition to searching for and collecting glass, Glass Beach has a very interesting array of tide pools to explore.

Anything a visitor may seek, San Francisco can provide. Echoes of fun and amusement ring throughout the city from the cable cars atop Nob Hill to the sea lions barking at the wharf. \r\n\r\nTurning back the clock to the Depression, we find San Francisco bubbling as a haven of fun even then. \r\n\r\nThe place to go was a now-vanished amusement park, Playland-at-the-Beach. During the Depression and World War II, Playland thrived. Adults and children, families and couples on dates, sailors from all over the world went to Playland to ride bumper cars and roller coasters and explore the thrills of the Funhouse. For many San Franciscans, Playland was and still is their childhood, 33 years after its demolition. \r\n\r\nPlayland was located at Ocean Beach, just north of Golden Gate Park, below the point where the land rises to Sutro Heights. The attractions in this corner of the city had the added novelty of being where Western civilization meets the Pacific Ocean -- in a way, at the end of the world. \r\n\r\nFrom the mural-bedecked Beach Chalet at the western end of the park to Playland to the Cliff House and Sutro Baths, the recreational options lined up in a long row. Much of this ended up as part of the pleasure empire of the man called the Barnum of the Golden Gate, George Whitney. \r\n\r\nA little amusement area named Ocean Beach Pavilion had existed since 1884. In 1912, Arthur Looff and his partner, John Friedle, built Looff\\'s Hippodrome, housing a grand carousel built by Looff\\'s father. In 1922, the two added the Big Dipper roller coaster and the Chutes-at-the-Beach water ride. Whitney and his brother Leo came to town and opened a photofinishing concession booth in a smaller version of Playland. \r\n\r\nIn 1926, Whitney became general manager, and the park became Whitney\\'s Playland-at-the-Beach. He bought out shaky concessionaires during the Depression. By 1942, he owned everything from Sutro Baths to Fulton Street. \r\n\r\nWhitney\\'s Playland grew to more than three blocks of amusements next to the Great Highway. It included Topsy\\'s Roost Restaurant, which later became Skateland; a midway of games and vendors; a diving bell; and, of course, the Funhouse with long wooden slides, a human turntable that spun and threw people off if they didn\\'t hang on, distorting mirrors and air jets that blew women\\'s skirts up. \r\n\r\nPlayland was also the birthplace of the It\\'s-It, Whitney\\'s invention of ice cream sandwiched by two oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate. \r\n\r\nOnly the newly remodeled and now far more upscale Cliff House and Beach Chalet still stand. A condominium development erased any trace of Playland. \r\n\r\nBlue-collar times \r\n\r\nAnyone who remembers Playland is wistful, or maybe just nostalgic, for the gritty, blue-collar San Francisco. \"It wasn\\'t just toys for the rich. It was toys for everyone,\" said Dan Fontes, a muralist working in El Cerrito on a large rendering of Playland and the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nSan Francisco has changed. The blue-collar neighborhoods are mostly gone, and amusement is often more solitary than when the Playland fun house rang with screams and laughter. Still, Playland has not been lost. Anyone can find it. Its fragments are scattered all over the city. \r\n\r\nPlayland is best remembered by a laugh, the one that belonged to a huge mechanical woman who towered above the entry to the Funhouse from the 1940s until it closed in 1972 and she was auctioned off. \r\n\r\nHer name was Laughing Sal. \r\n\r\nAnyone walking down Playland\\'s Midway -- even nearby neighbors -- heard Sal\\'s bellowing laugh. She had devilish curly red hair and huge freckles all over her fat, terrifying visage. In the middle of it all was a gap-toothed smile that provided nightmare material for countless children. This was creepy, the same way a ventriloquist\\'s dummy is. \r\n\r\n\"She would stand there laughing and laughing, and you would stand there laughing and laughing, and you didn\\'t know why,\" said Sharon Jessup, a San Francisco native who grew up going to Playland. Sal\\'s continuous laugh was a drunken yelping guffaw, an evil cackle, the uninhibited outburst of someone going out of her mind. With arms extended, she heaved back and forth with a bit of a bobbing motion in her huge glass box. \r\n\r\nSal was constructed by the Old King Cole papier-mache company under commission to the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., maker of amusement park furnishings. Old King Cole started with a mechanical laughing department store Santa Claus. They fitted the Santa with a woman\\'s legs, breasts that jiggled on the end of springs and custom-made heads. With the addition of a 78 rpm recording of the most memorable laugh in the world, Laughing Sal was born. \r\n\r\nBy the 1960s, Playland was run down and a little seedy. Some say it started downhill when Whitney tore down the Big Dipper roller coaster in the late 1950s. Sutro Baths burned during its demolition in 1966, and Whitney stopped operating Playland in 1968. \r\n\r\nThe park took on a roving carnival feel, said Marvin Gold, who grew up nearby, going to sleep every night to the sound of Sal\\'s cackle. In 1972, Playland was put up for sale. When it closed on Sept. 4, 1972, Herb Caen wrote a column called, \"We\\'ll Never Go There Anymore.\" He reminisced over It\\'s-Its, Bull Pup enchiladas, a 40-cent corn dog and a ride on the carousel. \r\n\r\nToday, Playland is covered with housing. A Safeway stands on the site of the old diving bell. Gold said he remembers when workers came to smash the concrete foundation and heard a clang. They found the concrete lined with a steel tank, filled it in and built on top of it. \r\n\r\n\"One hundred years from now when they tear Safeway down, they\\'re going to find an old steel tank sitting there and have no idea what it was,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, and those slides, those beautiful wooden slides,\" he said of the long hardwood slides in the Funhouse. \"When I saw them cutting those slides into pieces ... I nearly cried. \r\n\r\n\"Playland was our second home.\" \r\n\r\nFor the next 30 years after Playland closed, people didn\\'t have to look far to find Laughing Sal. Although the main Funhouse Sal went to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk for 0,000, Playland\\'s back-up Sal found a home in the basement of the Cliff House, along with the penny arcade machines. They all were put into the Musee Mecanique, a collection that Ed Zelinsky he obtained from George Whitney. \r\n\r\nAll of the machines are still working, offering love tests, telling fortunes and showing the first silent films. Video games were added to a small arcade at the back -- early games like Pac Man and eventually the 3-D driving and shooting simulators we see now. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, the Musee was imperiled when the Cliff House was renovated. San Franciscans came to the rescue with a petition carrying more than 25,000 signatures. They were outraged that the National Park Service, which owns the Cliff House, hadn\\'t tried to find the historical Musee a new home. \r\n\r\nThanks to the public outcry, a home was found at Pier 45, where a row of crab stands leads to a building painted with a giant version of Laughing Sal\\'s face. Her missing tooth is the entry to Amusing America, which chronicles San Francisco\\'s place in the country\\'s cultural history of amusement parks. \r\n\r\nPlayland, Sutro Baths and the 1939 World\\'s Fair are all featured in interactive and informative displays, with the Musee Mecanique collection in the back. \r\n\r\nAnd at the door, as in her two previous homes, Sal is the greeter and gatekeeper who still bursts into laughter for a quarter. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at her luck, having survived the urban development that has put her into a museum version of a city that no longer exists. \r\n\r\nMaybe she\\'s laughing at what amusement in San Francisco has become around her: a Fisherman\\'s Wharf that has become a commercial tourist center with many of the same type of attractions as Playland. \r\n\r\nDan Fontes, the muralist and a good source of history on Sutro Baths and Playland, says that when Playland was alive, \"Fisherman\\'s Wharf was a fisherman\\'s wharf, with fishermen.\" \r\n\r\nNow, it is the Playland of today, the city\\'s waterfront amusement center, even if it is there mostly for tourists. Playland\\'s remains are scattered elsewhere around the city, too. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s-It snacks are found in many grocery stores. \r\n\r\nCarousel in Yerba Buena \r\n\r\nThe marvelous carousel built by Charles I.D. Looff in 1906 and installed at Playland in 1912 eventually found its way back to San Francisco. Marianne Stevens, a preservationist, had bought it from Playland and restored it for a Long Beach mall. In 1998, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency bought it for  million and installed it in a beautiful glass pavilion at Yerba Buena Gardens. \r\n\r\nThe ocean wind even blew Playland\\'s ashes all the way to El Cerrito, where muralist Fontes and partner Ed Cassel are working with Playland collector Richard Tuck to create a tribute to that vanished beach area. \r\n\r\nThey\\'re creating a mural 32 feet long and 10 feet high depicting Playland, Sutro\\'s Baths and Museum and the Cliff House. Fontes said the reactions of former Playland visitors range from surprised delight to tears. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, on the very ground where Playland once stood, five ghosts of those bygone days arose. From a distance, the five 15-foot-high figures across the street from Safeway on 48th and Cabrillo look like ghostly black shadows. Up close, they\\'re monuments called Playland Revisited created by Ray Beldner, an artist who often visited Playland as a child. \r\n\r\nMade of perforated stainless steel, each tall, narrow sculpture represents a Playland icon. There\\'s Laughing Sal of course, a Muni streetcar, the clown entrance to the Funhouse, the rooster from Topsy\\'s Roost and a carousel horse. \r\n\r\nThe statues at the bus terminus also mark the terminus of San Francisco, of the solid world before it hits the sea, and the terminus of a time when that spot was filled with thousands of people of all classes and types enjoying themselves. \r\n\r\nThe icons give tangible body to the ghosts of Playland that live in the hearts and memories of so many grown-ups. They ensure that Playland isn\\'t entirely gone and that childhood won\\'t be forgotten\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother links:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.playlandatthebeach.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sonic.net/~playland/cliffhouse.html<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfq38pci00"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.510664,37.7732]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sutro Baths &amp; the Cliff House","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/sutro.jpg\">1090 Point Lobos San Francisco, CA. 94121,Sutro Baths\r\n\r\nThe concrete ruins just north of the Cliff House are the remains of the grand Sutro Baths. In 1881, Adolph Sutro bought most of the western headlands of San Francisco and made his home there. Fifteen years later, Sutro Baths opened to a dazzled public at an estimated cost of over ,000,000. Spread over three acres, the Baths boasted impressive engineering and artistic detail. \r\n\r\nSwimming\r\n\r\nA classic Greek portal opened to a massive glass enclosure containing seven swimming pools of various temperatures. There were slides, trapezes, springboards and a high dive. Together the pools held 1.7 million gallons of water and could be filled in one hour by high tides. There were 20,000 bathing suits and 40,000 towels for rent. Balmy temperatures and abundant plants enhanced \"California’s Tropical Winter Garden.\" The Baths could accommodate 10,000 people at one time. \r\n\r\nEntertainment\r\n\r\nSutro’s dream was realized as San Franciscans streamed to the Baths on one of three railroads connected to the city. An amphitheater, seating up to 3,700 people, provided a variety of stage shows. Three restaurants could accommodate 1,000 people at a sitting. There were natural history exhibits, galleries of sculptures, paintings, tapestries and artifacts from Mexico, China, Asia, and the Middle East. \r\n\r\nThe Last Years\r\n\r\nFor all their glamour and excitement, the success of Sutro Baths was short lived. The Baths were not commercially successful and Sutro\\'s grandson converted part of the Baths into a skating rink in 1937, a task completed in the early 1950\\'s by new owner George Whitney. Sutro Baths never regained its popularity and the ice-skating revenue was not enough to maintain the enormous building. In 1964, developers who planned to replace the Baths with high-rise apartments bought the site. A fire in 1966 quickly finished the demolition work, but the apartment scheme was never realized. \r\n\r\nToday\r\n\r\nThe Baths became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1973. This area is popular today for the scenic and recreational values recognized by Adolph Sutro. Please use caution as you explore the remains of Sutro Baths and coastal rocks and try to imagine the elegance of life here over 100 years ago. \r\n\r\nFor more information call (415) 239-2366.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfq30jby8p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.513834,37.780425]}},{"properties":{"name":"THE TOWER THEATRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/tower.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 815 E.Olive Avenue in Fresno, CA 93728The crown jewel of Fresno\\'s hottest nightlife neighborhood, the Tower Theatre lends its name to an area which has been a community focus of arts and entertainment for generations.\r\n\r\n  Opened in 1939 as a 20th Century Fox Movie House the theater was restored in 1990 and reopened as a center for the performing arts. In 1992, the theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Considered to be the finest facility of its kind in California, the Tower Theatre boasts an authentic art deco theme throughout the interior and exterior. The covered foyer of Italian Terrazo, as well as the adjoining lobby with its beautiful historic Carvarts glass etching, serve as a mingling area for patrons between acts. It is also conveniently available for refreshments or concession sales.\r\n\r\n  Anchored by the theatre, the Tower District has seen a booming resurgence through the 90\\'s, with many new restaurants and clubs opening within a four mile radius. The theatre is located at the central intersection of Wishon and Olive avenues, relatively close to the Fresno-Yosemite International Air Terminal, freeway access, and major hotels. \r\n\r\n  The theatre is a 1940\\'s moderne deco masterpiece.

Dedicated to the Queen of Peace and Mercy, the Shrine is a shining example of what one man of faith can achieve. The grottos, which are constructed of Missouri tiff rock, are set in a countryside atmosphere that refreshes the body and soul.\r\n\r\nThe origins of this religious setting trace back to 1927. Among the Franciscan Missionary Brothers who that year emigrated from Poland to the St. Louis area was Brother Bronislaus Luszcz, pictured at left. He was a man driven by an overwhelming faith and love for Our Blessed Mother Mary.\r\n\r\nIn his native Poland, Mary is revered as the Queen of Peace and Mercy, and Her most famous shrine is at the Jasna Gora (Bright Hill) monastery in the town of Czestochowa. The people lovingly refer to Mary as Our Lady of Czestochowa, the Black Madonna.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, Brother Bronislaus would sit by the road and watch pilgrims as they passed through his village on their way to Mary\\'s shrine. Overcoming tremendous hardship, some of them walked for hundreds of miles, sleeping by the road, to reach their destination. The memory of these people -- the difficulties they overcame and the love and devotion they had for Mary -- remained with him throughout his life.\r\n\r\nBrother Bronislaus wanted to share his faith with others by spreading the Glory of Our Lady of Czestochowa. So, in 1937, he began his lifetime labor of love. Clearing the thickly wooded land, he built a beautiful cedar wood chapel and hung a portrait of Our Lady above the altar. The chapel soon became a center of religious devotion, with numerous pilgrimages, prayer services and masses being offered.\r\n\r\nThen, one Sunday evening in 1958, an arsonist started a fire on the altar. The Brothers tried to douse the ensuing inferno, but flames consumed the chapel, leaving a pile of cinders. Today, however, the Black Madonna Shrine and Grottos continue to serve as an important site for the religious who visit. \r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfq37py9sa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.68274,38.412979]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Dashiell Hammett Tour","description":"Posted by Kevans<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/falcon200_2.jpg\">100 Larkin San Francisco CaTravel with Don Herron over the fog-shrouded hills stalked by Sam Spade, the Continental Op, and other legendary characters created by San Francisco\\'s most renowned mystery and noir writer.

The concept was developed by Peter Richards and was installed in collaboration with sculptor and master stone mason George Gonzales. Inspiration for the piece came from artist Bill Fontana\\'s recordings made of sounds emanating from a vent pipe of a floating concrete dock in Sydney, Australia. \r\nIn 1980, Richards (now a Senior Artist at the Exploratorium) received a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which enabled him to conduct an extensive period of investigation into the physicality of the Wave Organ phenomenon. The sculpture\\'s speaker horn and audio equipment were either built or acquired for use in some of the experiments of this period. \r\nA prototype, built at the same location, was presented as part of the New Music \\'81 Festival. Though very rudimentary in nature, it generated enthusiasm and support for a permanent work. Permit acquisition and fundraising efforts by Frank Oppenheimer, founding director of the Exploratorium, began soon after, but actual construction did not start until September of 1985, seven months after Oppenheimer\\'s death. The Wave Organ was completed in May of 1986 and was dedicated in June to the memory of Frank Oppenheimer. The Wave Organ is located on a jetty that forms the small Boat Harbor in the Marina district of San Francisco, walking distance from the Exploratorium. The jetty itself was constructed with material taken from a demolished cemetery, providing a wonderful assortment of carved granite and marble, which was used in the construction of this piece. The installation includes 25 organ pipes made of PVC and concrete located at various elevations within the site, allowing for the rise and fall of the tides. Sound is created by the impact of waves against the pipe ends and the subsequent movement of the water in and out of the pipes. The sound heard at the site is subtle, requiring visitors to become sensitized to its music, and at the same time to the music of the environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfq3chyyl5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.440259,37.808351]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/7943","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kevans","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kevans","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/7943","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":20,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=7943,platial:user=kevans","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":40668}
