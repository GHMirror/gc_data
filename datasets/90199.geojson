This service includes administrative boundaries, cities, water features, physiographic features, parks, landmarks, highways, roads, railways, and airports on a transparent background. The service was compiled from a variety of best available sources from several data providers, including the U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service, Tele Atlas, AND, and ESRI. The service currently provides coverage for the world down to a scale of ~1:1m and coverage for the continental United States and Hawaii to a scale of ~1:70k.\n\nThis service is intended primarily for overlaying on these basemap services: World Terrain Base, World Shaded Relief and World Physical Map. \n\nIf you are using ArcMap, this service doesn't draw correctly unless you are using 9.3.1 or more recent because it is cached using the PNG32 graphic format, which isn't supported in ArcMap prior to 9.3.1. It can be used in ArcGlobe 9.3 or more recent.\n\nScale Range: 1:591,657,528 down to 1:72,224\n\n This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"esri,tiles","published":"2014-08-10T11:12:44-04:00","id":90199}
