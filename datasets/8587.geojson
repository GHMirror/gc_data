Attacks were filtered to keep only those incidents that involved rocket attacks which were then grouped together by towns or nearest approximations in certain regions. Points were geocoded by town no by actual blast sites. In some cases a centroid point was used when a town could not be found. For this map, towns with multiple attacks appear as a point with shading around the edges, whereas points with no shading typically have only one or two occurrences in that area. I used batchgeocode.com for the latitude and longitude, as well as Google Earth, Fallingrain.com, and Wikipedia for troublesome geocodes. I uploaded the data as a csv into Geocommons and checked points for accuracy.\n\nthis dataset is for temporal analysis
