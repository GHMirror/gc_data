Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L’Hexagone (The “Hexagon”) because of the geometric shape of its territory.\n\nFrance is bordered by Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Andorra, and Spain. Due to its overseas departments, France also shares land borders with Brazil and Suriname (bordering French Guiana) , and the Netherlands Antilles (bordering Saint-Martin). France is also linked to the United Kingdom by the Channel Tunnel, which passes underneath the English Channel.\n\nFrench firefighters are called Sapeurs-Pompiers, and reflecting the rural nature of much of the country (wide areas with low density of population), the Volunteer Fire brigade (SPV, sapeur-pompier volontaire), with over 190,000 firefighters is the largest firefighting force in France. In addition to being called out from work to attend an incident, they may be on standby at firestations outside their working hours; the intervention and attending hours are paid by the session. The volunteer firebrigade is also a way to promote the culture of civil defence and of solidarity amongst the population. The Professional Fire Brigade (SPP, sapeur-pompier professionnel) numbers over 30,000 firefighters, employed by the d�partements and working on shifts. In some towns there is a mixture of professionals and volunteers, in others only one or the other.\n\nIn Paris and Marseille, the fire brigades are made up of military personnel, but under the control of the Ministry of the Interior in a similar way to the Gendarmes. The Paris Fire Brigade (BSPP) has around 7,000 firefighters, and the Marseille Marine Fire Battalion (BMPM) has over 2,000.\n\nWith the SAMU (French EMS), they are the backbone of the French civil defence.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfhr6sriw7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3.515625,48.9224992638]}},{"properties":{"name":"Germany","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.spark.com\" href=\"http://www.spark.com\">Spark08</a>\n\nGermany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany is a country in west-central Europe. It is bordered to the north by the North Sea, Denmark, and the Baltic Sea; to the east by Poland and the Czech Republic; to the south by Austria and Switzerland; and to the west by France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The territory of Germany covers 357,021 km� and is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate.\n\nGerman fire brigades (Feuerwehr) are organized on a town/village basis, with each town having at least one brigade. In Germany there are about 25,000 local brigades – 24,000 volunteer fire brigades (Freiwillige Feuerwehr), 800 private fire brigades with public accreditation (Werkfeuerwehr), which mostly protect large industrial complexes or airports, many private fire brigades with no public accreditation (Betriebsfeuerwehr) , and 100 public fire brigades (Berufsfeuerwehr) compulsory by law for large towns and cities. However, public brigades are often supported by and cooperate with volunteer brigades. Some volunteer brigades have also a small core of full-time fire fighters paid by local community funds. Volunteer fire brigades are usually structured in three brigade categories (Grundausstattung, St�tzpunktfeuerwehren, Schwerpunktfeuerwehren) depending on size and level of equipment. Some German fire brigades not only have firefighters, but also ambulance crews. There is an estimate of a total of 1,300,000 active members.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfhrddw4l7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.623047,52.48278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hong Kong","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.spark.com\" href=\"http://www.spark.com\">Spark08</a>\n\nAs in the UK, the Hong Kong fire service was once part of the Police, but now is separate with over 9,000 members.

Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of China, Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. The characters that make up Japan’s name mean “sun-origin”, which is why Japan is sometimes identified as the “Land of the Rising Sun”.\n\nJapan comprises over 3,000 islands. Most of the islands are mountainous, many volcanic; for example, Japan\\'s highest peak, Mount Fuji, is a volcano. Japan has the world’s tenth largest population, with about 128 million people. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes the capital city of Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with over 30 million residents.\n\nJapan’s first fire service was founded in 1629 during the Edo-era, and was called Hikeshi . During the Meiji Period, when Japan opened its doors to the West, the Hikeshi was merged into the police department. During this time period, pumps were imported and domestically produced, and modern firefighting strategies were introduced. In 1948, after World War II, a municipality fire service system was established.\n\nToday, fire services are organized on a city/town/village basis. There are 894 fire headquarters and 3,598 volunteer fire corps. These have a total of 155,000 active career firefighters and 21,000 vehicles with 4,800 fire houses; 920,000 volunteer firefighters share an additional 51,000 trucks.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfhr39dv1z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[137.8125,34.885931]}},{"properties":{"name":"Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, UK","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.spark.com\" href=\"http://www.spark.com\">Spark08</a>There are 26 community fire stations across Merseyside.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfhr1n47b6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.4609375,53.5403073915]}},{"properties":{"name":"Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Melbourne, Australia","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.spark.com\" href=\"http://www.spark.com\">Spark08</a>\n\nThe MFB works in the Melbourne area to do fire and rescue work.
