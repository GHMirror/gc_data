conducted every two years. Questionnaires are mailed to every known shelter identified as providing residential services (shelter) to abused women in every province and territory. Information is collected on the characteristics of the facilities and the services provided during the previous 12 months. The survey also includes a one-day snapshot providing information on the characteristics of women and children residing in shelters on a specific day. In 2010, an imputation procedure was used to replace the missing data from non-respondents. The data for 2010 are representative of all shelters known to be in operation in Canada at the time of the 2010 Transition Home Survey, and not just those that responded to the survey. Imputation was not conducted for non-respondents from cycles of the survey prior to 2006. Therefore, year-over-year comparisons should be made with caution.","column_3":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"table 256-0017 transition home survey, one-day snapshot of women residing in shelters because of spousal abuse, canada, provinces and territories, every 2 years(1,4)":"2","id":"aa6ubrsiovi5","column_2":"Rate per 100,000 married, common-law, separated and divorced women.
