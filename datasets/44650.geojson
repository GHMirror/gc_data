The chief of the village was very nervous about us and was not too keen on us taking rock samples. \n\nWe had a gas powered drill we used to take 3\" cores, so we pulled out a few cores and gave them to him. He was totally amazed that we could get out round rocks. He was so pleased with his present, that we became the heros of the village.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lsr246yzlb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[110.566406,1.054628]}},{"properties":{"name":"Guam","description":"Posted by Bluesdawgine<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/27083124@N00/126823017/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/44/126823017_626c95aab8_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/27083124@N00/126822840/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/47/126822840_19298b859c_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/27083124@N00/126822914/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/49/126822914_ff371d86ff_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/27083124@N00/126822933/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/55/126822933_c4fcfc2fc6_o.jpg\"></a>SaipanI did a lot of field work on Guam and found some suprisingly cool places.

We found a cool (but dumpy) hotel in Kota Kinabalu that was fairly affordable. The people were fun and it was owned by one of the local big wigs, who took a great liking to us. The only problem was he really like to drink and would insist that we drink with him. This would usually result in us having to sit with him until he drank so much he passed out. Wierd, but he treated us well and kept us out of trouble.  \n\nWe used to love to go down to the night market and wander around all of the vendor stalls and eat all the great food. Sometimes, you just were never quite sure what you were eating. My favorite were the indian vendors with the Roti Chani and other currys. The Malaysian food was a bit rugged and suspect. Eating the dried fish was tough as it really smelled aweful. I think even a Norwegian would have balked at some of it.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lsr21xf4pv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[116.586914,5.878332]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kuching","description":"Posted by BluesdawgineEric and I did a lot of field work in Sarawak as well as Sabah. Kuching was a pretty cool, but fairly rustic city. I found it to be much more authentic than most of Asia, although that was in 1986, so for all I know it has been overrun by Starbucks and McDonalds at this point. \n\nThe people were totally cool and friendly. The Karst topography of the limestone makes it a really magical place. If you venture \"upriver\" or out into the bush, it gets really wild, really fast.  Monkeys and poisonous snakes abound. Sarawak was the last place to have known cannibals and it is still reported to have a tribe or two that is known to conviently have an enemy disappear in a pot of gumbo.\n\nThere is a great book called Stranger in the Forest : On Foot Across Borneo (Vintage Departures) \tby Eric Hansen. Highly recommended.\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lsr222rjvu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[110.643311,1.482989]}},{"properties":{"name":"Manila","description":"Posted by BluesdawginemanilaI was in Manila a number of times, but the most interesting was shortly after Marcos had fallen. The people were crazy with joy and it was wierd to see tanks all over the place with people climbing on them. \n\nI used to jump onto the Jeepnees and ride all over town without really even knowing where I was going. The people were great. It is a little sad that the Philippines is not as safe as it used to be. \n\nOne of the saddest parts of Manila is the garbage dump city that sits on the out skirts of town. Something like 50,000 people live on the dump, just barely surviving.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lsr1tzq661"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[120.970001,14.619999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Marianas Trench","description":"Posted by BluesdawgineMarianas TrenchI was on a Deep Sea Drilling expedition that spent 51 days at see drilling geologic core samples from all around the Marianas trench. We drilled in over 6000 meters of water. It would take over a day to pull the drill pipe up to change the bit. The key target was to look at some serpentine diahers on the flank of the trench (basically, cold volcanos!). I don\\'t think I want to spend that much time at sea again. Very boring after awhile.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lsr1zn30ra"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.90918,16.341226]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Kinabalu","description":"Posted by BluesdawgineMount KinabaluMt. Kinabalu is the highest mountain on the island of Borneo at over 13,500 ft. I hike up to the summint on new years eve and watched the sunrise to start off 1986. It is an amazing hike which starts off in the tropical rain forest at that base. It transitions up through oak and subapline forest and eventually above tree line. Evidently there are more species of orchids found on the flanks of the mountain than anywhere else in the world. \n\nThere are a variety of guest houses you can stay at on your way to the summit. We skipped the main one and went to one that is rarely used at about 12,000 ft. We discovered why it is rarely used as it was infested with rats. After trying to sleep in it and being literaly attacked by the rats, we moved outside and slept on the solid granite. It was a cold hard night, which made getting up early and hiking to the summit before sunrise not so painful.\n\nThe one big bummer about the place is that the Malaysians have not ethic around littering and the mountain is a total garbage dump along the trail. I totally lost it at one point and started yelling at some of the Malaysians for littering. I am sure they had not a clue what this crazy Orang Puti was yelling about. They shrugged their shoulders and moved on.\n\nIf you make it to the top, spend some time wondering around. The rock formations are amazing and peering over the edge of some of the cliffs are gut wrenching. \n\nOn our way back to Kota Kinabalu, Brad and I decided to hitch hike just to be different. We got a ride in the back of a dump truck full of gravel. It took forever, but was pretty dang coo.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lsr25yq4dd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[117.042847,6.091398]}},{"properties":{"name":"Northern Luzon","description":"Posted by BluesdawgineNorthern LuzonThis is the first place (and hopefully last) that I ever got a feeling for what combat might be like. It was a fairly rough and wild area, but we were doing some field work in an area that had never really been mapped. We were way up in the mountains, when a bunch of helicopters and army trucks came screaming our way. The helicopters were firing rockets into the mountain side just across from where we were. The army trucks came up the road and saw us there and couldn\\'t believe their eyes. They yelled at us \"what the hell are you doing here! We\\'ve got action going on!\" We high tailed it out of there as fast as we could. I have never been so scared in my life. \n\nI think a lot of people glorify war, and I can honestly say I don\\'t know what it is really like. But, having gone through this, I can only vaguely imagine how terrible it really is.

Partly because it is a bit rough with pirates and rebels and partly because they have bad cerebral malaria. \n\nBut being young and stupid, I went anyway. It was very beautiful. At one point, I was sitting with my two field assistants at a restraunt, when we were joined by a guy at our table. He was armed to the teeth, as were his 7 or 8 companions. Rocket launchers, M-16\\'s, gernades, you name it. He asked us who we were and what we were doing there. We told we were geologist looking for rocks. We pointed out on the map were we wanted to go. He politely told us that there were no rocks there. We quickly changed our plans. \n\nAt one point our jeep broke down, so we had to catch a bus back to the main city. It required us to climb on top of a bus for about a 4 hr drive. The bus was packed full of people, goats, chickens, and produce. It was fun and all the people got a big kick out of some white guy riding on the top of the bus with everyone else.\n\nLuckily, I did not get cerebral malaria.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lsr25b0248"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[118.740234,9.622414]}},{"properties":{"name":"Saipan","description":"Posted by BluesdawgineSaipanYet another island I did field work on.
