It has its own shopping district, business association, pier and recreation center with the landmark Belmont Pool where an Olympic gold medalist has taught swim lessons for years.  Several thousand residents consider this quaint and quirky community a city unto itself and at one time, it actually was a separate city.\n\n      In 1906, it took shape as the fastest growing subdivision in Long Beach and was called Belmont Heights. Originally designed as an Italian-styled city running along canals, developers Frank Shaw &amp; George C. Flint scrapped plans because of cost and logistics. Another nearby community, Naples, did become the Italian styled village, offering houses on canals, a promenade with a large fountain and even gondoliers.\n\nAll Belmont wanted was a pier. In 1908, angry residents of Belmont Heights voted to become the City of Belmont. Fed up over high taxes imposed by the City of Long Beach, they decided they could do better on their own. During its brief period as a city, Belmont determined that its residents could not afford what they wanted even more than tax reductions. So just one year later they voted to rejoin Long Beach with the understanding a pier would be built. Belmont got its pier in 1915 and the charming community built its lifestyle around its prized possession and sandy beaches surrounding it.\n\nThe current pier was built in 1966, replacing a wooden pier that stood for over 50 years. The 1,620 foot-long concrete pier has experienced structural damage and needs revamping. New restrooms will be added to the mid section of the pier and enhancements such as lighting and electrical updating is expected to bring more activity to the region.\n\nThe pier is located at Ocean and 39th Place. It offers free public fishing with no license  required as long as you stay on the pier to fish. Pay parking is available in a public lot near the base of the pier.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6l1zk84d15q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.148882,33.755441]}},{"properties":{"name":"Berkeley Pier","description":"Posted by Hikingjay<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/bsp_BP.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/bay_br_bp.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/3/sf_skyline_bp.JPG\">I try to fish here almost every Friday from the spring until mid-summer when the salmon run starts. This pier isn\\'t a fish every minute, or even every trip, but it has a nice view of San Francisco and the potential to catch halibut, striper, bat rays, perch, and even the occasional sturgeon! In fact, there are lots of different fish caught here all the time.
