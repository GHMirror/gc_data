When I was growing up there in the 1970\\'s, it was more like this than the hustle and bustle along SR-13... what they call San Jose Boulevard these days. This gives you a pretty good cross section of forests, from oak paddocks to turkey oak forests. Incidentally, turkey oaks (quercis laevis) is my favorite tree, but is considered a waste tree by some, so too often in the past they\\'d be simply removed.

Came here for the first time in May of 1975 with my best friend Craig Buffkin and his family; his birthday. Really loved the place right from the start.\nThere are a number of lakes, a ravine (yes, Florida has ravines), and some of the nicest forests you have ever seen. But look at the satellite image for a second. Look at the spacing of those trees. Most of Goldhead is covered with turkey oaks. When you\\'re flying along I-95 south towards Orlando, you\\'re seeing woodlands that are artificially thick due to \"management\". Most forests in Florida would manage themselves, usually through fires. The reason that they are so thick in places is due to letting growth continue in an unnatural fashion. Fires are actually part of the life cycle of forests, God\\'s way of keeping things in check. Those turkey oaks (plus some pines) are another example of how Florida should look.\nGreat place. Get there early, stay there late, camp. Walk the trails, enjoy this patch of north Florida.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ylyl65xdy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.953266,29.842245]}},{"properties":{"name":"Swim with wild manatee","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://0009.org\" href=\"http://0009.org\">Jason</a><img src=\"http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/newsletters/v6n2/graphics/manatee.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Weeki wachi riverThis isn\\'t the exact exact location, but the river that connects the weeki wachee spring with the gulf of mexico is home to families of huge gentle amazing manatee (sea cows).  You can rent canoes and go upstream to see all kinds of great floridian wildlife, like otter and turtles.  Get in the water (chest depp mostly) and go pet the manatee who will mostly just come right up to you.  The scars on them are mostly from careless motor boat drivers going too fast and crashing into the not so agile prehistoric animals.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ylyh0n4c6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.571955,28.519307]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Beach At Big Talbot Island","description":"Posted by Astrorob<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> This is another example of a Florida that once was. As you move south along Florida\\'s east coast, the flora changes. This section of the coast line has more in common with beaches northwards into the Carolinas, with stands of oaks almost to the water\\'s edge. This beach is truly wonderful, with all that snow white sand. Inland, you\\'ll find salt marshes plentiful. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67ylykd9j7s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.444016,30.49979]}},{"properties":{"name":"This Is Nine Mile Road...","description":"Posted by AstrorobNine Mile Road, St. John\\'s CountyIn the name of crass commercialization, the road was renamed International Golf Parkway.

I first went here in the spring of 1976, and it left an immediate impression; it seemed so out of place, but there it was, tucked into suburbia. I went on to do volunteer work here in 1991. If you get a chance, swing on by and check this wonderful place out. Some of the grandest live oaks you will ever see, ancient grape vines bigger around then your arm, two genuine Florida upland creeks.
