Digital orthoimage resolution may vary from 6 inches to 1 meter.  In the former resolution, every pixel in an orthoimage covers a six inch square of the earth’s surface, while in the latter resolution, one meter square is represented by each pixel.  The National Map allows free downloads of public domain, 1-meter orthoimagery for the conterminous United States, with many urban areas and other locations at 2-feet or finer resolution.  Many States contribute orthoimagery to The National Map, and the USGS also relies on a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency.
