While unique and offbeat in nature, Chestnut Street retains a distinctive neighborhood feel. Here shoppers and locals find incredible shoe boutiques like Rabat featuring trendy but functional footwear and specialty shops like Blue Bird, a gift shop carrying kitschy gifts like porcelain dolls and oversized potato heads. Well-known retailers, like Gap Body or the small, unique Chadwick\\'s of London for cotton and lace lingerie, lend a mass appeal. Williams-Sonoma, a neighborhood fixture, has the best in cookware, utensils and cookbooks. For beauty care, Bare Essentials or the Body Shop will keep you looking great with the best in cosmetics and skincare. A lunch break on Chestnut means a choice of Cafe Marimba, an open, airy colorful Mexican restaurant or Cozmo\\'s which prepares wood oven meats and seafood paired with California wines. On any day, Chestnut Street is bustling with shoppers, professionals meeting for coffee at Bechelli\\'s or neighborhood Moms with strollers shopping at Books, Inc. The highlights of this cozy San Francisco neighborhood are a sophisticated ambience and streamlined energy conducive to shopping.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3zh3r72p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.44122,37.80022]}},{"properties":{"name":"Chinatown Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Enter the Dragon Gates for access to another, redder and more-bustling world of shopping in San Francisco\\'s Chinatown, tucked loudly away between North Beach and Union Square shopping. Ornate lampposts, pagoda roofs and a Bank of America that could just as well be in Shanghai highlight San Francisco\\'s eclectic Chinatown. At every turn, candles burn and vivid silks grace the jam-packed window fronts, where import vendors sell nearly everything, including (but by no means limited to) carved Buddhas, paper parasols and regal mahogany furniture, perfect for exotic gifts or indulgent tourist fodder. Apothecaries abound, selling delicate green teas, rose-scented black teas and a variety of other ailment-banishing brews by the ounce. For a sweet surprise, the fragrant Fortune Cookie Factory tucked away on Ross Alley is an exciting find. Chinese food is just as abundant: for some of the best in San Francisco, the inexpensive House of Nanking is just off Chinatown\\'s main drag a few blocks west on Kearny (at Jackson). <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3zfkt9tg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40562,37.7906]}},{"properties":{"name":"Embarcadero Center 1-4 Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Embarcadero is an underutilized shopping expanse, usually crowded with professionals who work in the nearby towers or locals who know this San Francisco mall is light on foot traffic but heavy on great stores and accessory shops. Embarcadero is retail haven with brand names like Gap, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, Liz Claiborne, Victoria Secret and Express Jeans. Even though the Embarcadero holds big names, this San Francisco shopping mall has unusual stores: the Discovery Channel Store for science lovers and the Giants Dugout for the sports enthusiast. The mall\\'s spacious outdoor and indoor design lends itself to a more comfortable and easy shopping experience. The Embarcadero is contoured for the busy shopper with wide walkways and well-placed stairwells. During sunny days, the upstairs patio is perfect for patrons dining at Fuzio, a high-energy Italian restaurant or for coffee drinkers at Java City. The shopping mall is also home to the Embarcadero Theater, a movie house showing the brightest alternative and independent films by top directors.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3ze33n7i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.39786,37.79491]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fillmore Street Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> On Fillmore Street, it\\'s easy to feel pampered with several well-known beauty retailers and ritzy interior design boutiques fresh out of New York. Rachel Ashwell\\'s Shabbychic furniture and bedroom design store is next to Betsy Johnson\\'s runway shop on this luxe stretch of Fillmore that combines a busy wealthy Victorian neighborhood with a thriving San Francisco shopping center. Every shopping wish list is checked off here with select perfumeries, furniture designers like Zinc Details and specialty beauty outlets like Aveda. For shopping fuel, Fillmore street offers a Starbuck\\'s as well as a locals-frequented Royal Grounds. A distinctly picturesque part of town, Fillmore Street maintains an air of charm and simplicity while still offering a luxurious and high-end lifestyle.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3z6cp41t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.43387,37.78894]}},{"properties":{"name":"Haight Street Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> The stretch of shops, referred to by San Francisco locals as the Upper Haight, was the center of \\'60s psychedelia. Despite gentrification and the proliferation of stores like Ben &amp; Jerry\\'s and The Gap, it still retains its hippie counterculture credentials, and is dotted with Victorian houses, anarchist bookstores, piercing salons and funky clothing shops. Taking cues from New York and Los Angeles, as well as showcasing local Bay Area designers, the thoroughly modern Jaxx is a true urban outfitter, while just across the street at X-Generation, knock-offs of the originals go for much less. On Haight Street, one of the most eclectic and perennially busy San Francisco shopping stretches, San Francisco shoppers can find just about anything, from hardware to punk gear and fishnets to upscale vintage. With food and booze choices just as prolific (try Cha Cha Cha\\'s for sangria and tapas or Kanzaman for a vanilla hookah and a beer), locals as well as out-of-towners spend time shopping (or just window gazing) on the Haight\\'s incense-scented sidewalks. For music-philes, the bowling alley turned record store, Amoeba Records, is one the Haight\\'s biggest draws. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3zhhcur4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.446961,37.77007]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hayes Valley Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> The Hayes Valley is a beautiful blend of art and commerce in a small San Francisco neighborhood brimming with art galleries, contemporary boutiques, interior design studios, outdoor cafes and wine bars. This stretch of San Francisco shopping, in view of the San Francisco Symphony and Opera House, is a great place to find out-of-the-ordinary items like, crafted ultra-modern club chairs, black ribboned dancing shoes and a funky tabletop in shocking blue. Hayes Valley does not tolerate chain names or major outfitters that would infringe on the artful and airy style of the neighborhood. Located at 345 Gough Street is Shoppe Unusual, where over 30 local artists\\' works are on display in one of Hayes Valley\\'s largest and most colorful retail spaces. Some other unique shopping experiences include 560 Hayes Vintage Boutique, Buu, Gimme Shoes and Evelyn\\'s Antique Chinese Furniture. Prices in Hayes Valley are manageable: San Francisco shoppers can splurge on a well-crafted French truffle bag while ordering lunch for two without tipping the financial scales.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3zbgv2km"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.423,37.7769]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mission Street Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> For tourists and San Francisco shoppers with more eclectic and far flung tastes, the Mission is the perfect place to cater to unconventional whims. The Mission a colorful stretch of blocks with offbeat boutiques and funky ethnic clothing and furniture stores. Living up to its catch-all attitude, the Mission offer most anything, but with a funky twist such as mini snakeskin boots for toddlers, white go go boots, velvet hunting hats, and vintage hipster fashion mixed in with discount fabric and bridal stores. However, mixed in with the eccentric is the Mission\\'s predominantly Latino working class which operate authentic bakeries and fresh markets. Standouts include Rayon Vert, the eclectic home and florist shop and Fishbowl, the art and clothing gallery. Eateries add a unique flavor to the Mission with taquerias and fresh produce stands on every corner. What you won\\'t find here are fashionistas wearing the same Gap sweater; the Mission prides itself on its inimitable and colorful style.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3zfauw3x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.42187,37.76494]}},{"properties":{"name":"North Beach Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> North Beach, the unmistakable Italian district of San Francisco, boasts an Italian style and energy that permeates every boutique and restaurant. North Beach is the perfect shopping getaway because visitors will dine as the Romans do while finding unique European-inspired boutiques along Grant Avenue. Old Vogue carries a vintage wardrobe for men and women with the occasional funky piece. InSolent has year-round footwear and for an old Elvis LP then 101 Music is your destination, jammed with more than 10,000 musical items in CD, cassette and LP format. No shopping day is complete without Steps of Rome, where the waiters serve cappuccinos with a flirty wink and call the female patrons \"Bellisima!\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3zfg4hcv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40713,37.79824]}},{"properties":{"name":"Polk Street Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Polk Street is one of the most divergent shopping neighborhoods in San Francisco, offering a blend of high-end consignment shops, affordable retail outfits shops and low-end clothing stores. Different tastes and budgets are accommodated on Polk: the outdoor enthusiast will find Lombardi Sports a sports haven, the uber Mom can find pink tees for herself and baby at Girl Stuff, and the socialite looking for an affordable Chanel jacket can stop in at CRIS, an upscale-only consignment store. Polk is best for out-of-town shoppers who like the gritty mixed in with some high style, the upscale with the zany. Just taking a coffee break allows for options: there\\'s a Starbuck\\'s near the legendary Bob\\'s Donut Shop, offering the classic cheap coffee and glazed donut combo. This San Francisco shopping district has one caveat: the best and safest shopping experience on Polk starts just north of California Street.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3z7uoqhy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.42179,37.79595]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sacramento Street Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Sacramento Street shopping is on the cusp between Pacific Heights and Presidio Heights in a quiet residential neighborhood. The main features are the interior decor shops and high-end, but fun, clothing boutiques. Sacramento offers household items from small to large, from cashmere sofa throws and scented Florentine soaps to oversized Persian rugs and 19th century French tables. When done buying for the home, shoppers can indulge their fashion tastes with bathing suits designed by Shoshana at Brown Eyed Girl, a shop designed to look like the interior of a hip apartment, and view Jimmy Choo sandals and Prada heels at Fetish shoes. Sacramento Street is the ultimate deluxe shopping avenue with fantastic finds squeezed into a compact little block.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65x3zetpcd7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.447,37.78823]}},{"properties":{"name":"Union Square Shopping","description":"Posted by Kevinangela<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> A lone Corinthian column surrounded by newly installed palm trees marks San Francisco\\'s Mecca for shopaholics.
