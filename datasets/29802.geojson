They\\'re more likely to match the lampshade I will inevitably be wearing.\" \n~Betsy Dee\n\nSounds like the kind of friend you want to take to your office Christmas party, or rather skip your office Christmas party to go to a burlesque show with instead! Betsy Dee\\'s store inventory selection follows that same kind of party girl theme, with fun clothes in soft, feminine, plush fabrics and a hearty selection of unique artisan jewelry.\n\nThis is the place for petite/small women and women who like to wear their clothing reallyreallllly tight to buy sexy tops to go with favorite jeans (Anoname 9) and incredibly soft skirts to kick around with in those new red boots. I especially dug Momie\\'s skirts (see polka dot skirt photo shown with tank tops to the right), which sport great pockets featuring 50s-looking cocktail stencils and are made from interestingly oddly-matched soft soft soft cotton vintage fabrics. At 8 these skirts are reasonably priced given the feel, workmanship, and look. \n\nMany of the designers Betsy Dee carries are local, with a few from Los Angeles and the midwest, and she hires interns and local designers to work in the store. One of my favourite pieces, which, like Betsy Dee\\'s own \"Bad Pants\" label--a sizzling \"Sharon Stone\" kind of line--looks much better on a human than on the hanger, was a denim skirt with insets (see photo over there on the right hand side somewhere) designed by a student at San Francisco\\'s Art Institute in a student fashion show that Betsy sponsors called \"The Denim Invention.\" Some pieces created in that show are still available in the store, such as a sexy little jean-material corset.\n\nInteresting t-shirts that are lots more fun to wear than the standard plain Gap cotton number start at 5 and saucy little skirts that would be great with your stomper boots are 5-0something. I do wish designers would cover a wider range of sizes to suit the curvier and taller of us!\n\nBe sure to check out the well-made and not-as-pricey-as-you-might-think designer jewelry  in the cases lining the back of the store. Betsy Dee carries a better variety of jewelry than most mainly-clothing kind of stores. You never know where you might find the perfect signature piece for Fall.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9ozc9ac"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444117,37.770413]}},{"properties":{"name":"Brand X: Antiques/Estate Jewelry/Objets d'Art","description":"Posted by Wendolyne<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_277.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_304.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_295.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_281.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/platialaug232006_286.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/platialaug232006_272.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/platialaug232006_303.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/platialaug232006_287.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/platialaug232006_300.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/platialaug232006_270.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_294_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 570 Castro Street, San Francisco, CA, 94114Of all the intricate and surprising shops in San Francisco, Brand X is most certainly Queen. Shopping here puts me in mind of a reverse \"Needful Things\" by Steven King: Happily this one offers up needful things that bring only good fortune. \n\nFred Kirkbride and Tim Flint have created a wonderfully cluttered and darling little space for discovering treasures you never even knew you absolutely had to have in your collection. \n\nFor me, a leisurely Sunday in the City includes hooking up with friends for fruity drinkies at Cafe Luna Piena followed by knocking a couple upcoming birthday and wedding gifts off my list at Brand X. Anyone who is into antique jewels and special whimsical delights for the home would be thrilled to receive just about any delicacy Fred and Tim might offer up. \n\nFine antique jewelry, costume jewelry, paintings, art, erotic art, glassware, totchkes, miniatures, smoking memorabilia, a real mish-mash that could take hours to explore must be taken in quickly because you\\'re on sort of a one-horse track and there\\'s always someone shuffling close behind you.

He\\'ll make you laugh even while advising you that the leopard print mumu makes your ass look, well, BIG.\n\nI popped in here just for a minute and ended up staying long enough to find a terrificly patterned set of 50s pajamas for 8 (this is a stellar set, I\\'d peg it at 5 or so if it were freshly laundered and pressed and presented in a tonier store) and a  red hoodie with a \"Sexy\" pull tag (in case anyone doesn\\'t notice immediately). \n\nAlley, dressed nattily in Clothes Contact finds (photos at right), advised buying lightweight clothes since Clothes Contact charges by the pound, but if things are extra heavy accommodations might be made to adjust the price. My pal bought a plush mauve velvet curtain to fashion into her reconstructed overalls and paid just 0--a good amount less than such a good piece of cloth might usually bring. Sure, she\\'ll need to have it cleaned but the price is a bargain including that cost. \n\nIf you\\'re not afraid to dig in and have a good eye and feel for quality fabric you can find some remarkable pieces to wear as-is or rework into your reconstructed fantasy wardrobe. \n\nThis is Clothes Contact\\'s 20th anniversary celebration, so if you get there soon you\\'ll get a 20% discount. \n\nRetro City Fashions has six shopping locations in the  Bay area: Held Over, Clothes Contact, Sharks, La Rosa, Mission Thrift, and Mars. retrocity@retrocity.com\n415.621.3212<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9wbx9wg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.421987,37.764934]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cover to Cover Booksellers","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/Picture_003.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/4/platialaug232006_130.jpg\">1307 Castro Street, San Francisco CAZe bookstore ze neighborhood community rallied tou save.

Every time I\\'ve visited, there\\'s an affordable must-have I just can\\'t do without, last time it was a couple vintage Hamilton printer\\'s trays for only 0 each (I\\'ve seen pieces of much lesser interest and quality go for 0 and up). \n\nRestoration hardware for your Victorian lair can be found here at decent prices, and I bet if you peek in from time to time, you\\'ll eventually find exactly the right drawer handle to match the others on your rustic Mexican cabinet.\n\nRoy was working on sorting movie stills and other memorabilia during my visit and we discussed the ever-changing and broad selection of picture frames and collectible boxes available. Before you buy that 2006 0 cheap-o plastic frame at Walgreen\\'s, get yourself to Four Corners and for the same price see what a quality old frame can do for that sad K-Mart photographer\\'s photo of Cousin It and family that you\\'re morally obligated to display. \n\nMy favorite finds this visit were hand-painted baby cribs at only 5, a great hall desk for 0 (the stuff outside on the sidewalk is always interesting, useful, and priced to move), a Sawyer\\'s View Master complete with reels of Canadian and American tourist attractions at only  each. \n\nI enjoy browsing in the little backroom with the angora sweaters and tchotchkes first and then moving along slowly, taking in each display. I usually spend a little extra time in the vintage jewel cases up front at the end of my visit and I always try to remember to scout for old buttons to use in jewelry or gift projects. I guess I just wasn\\'t feeling like myself this visit because I passed on a  vintage button bracelet with loads of cute buttons sewn onto a strip of fabric like the old Victorian friend bracelets. No way is that still gonna be there tomorrow! \n\nBecause the location is a little bit off the usual bustling retail strips of the City, the feel of the store is leisurely and slow and always makes me wish that when I leave, the world will have slowed down, too. \n________________\nOpen 12-5pm every day. \n415.753.6111<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9pthuzl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.449507,37.764943]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fragile Industries Studios - Custom Wedding Supplies","description":"Posted by Fragileindustry<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/wedding_guest_book_thumbnail.png\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_punk_verD.gif\"> 93003Custom wedding scrapbooks, guest books, books of your vows or ceremony, artwork from your wedding photo(s), favors, gifts for weddings or showers, gifts for the wedding party, and anything else you can think of that\\'s wedding related!

If I had  for every bead she\\'s strung for me...well, I\\'d spend it all on another necklace! \n\nThis is the place to get your watch battery changed, your rings sized, and Granny\\'s engagement ring turned into a breastplate. Custom designs are available for any type of item including wedding rings or bridal party gifts and vintage jewelry repair jobs are welcomed. \n\nIf you\\'re a jewelry or clothing designer, Maopei has the connections to help with manufacturing and she will also help with design. She\\'s designed for the Nature Company and assists local designers in selecting beads and findings. This is a great place for creating your own masterpiece jewelry; even Saks Fifth Avenue designers purchase jewelry components here.  \n\nI was fascinated by Herkimer diamond crystals during my recent visit; Karizma\\'s ever-changing inventory always holds wonderful surprises and Maopei is always willing to help with a design and will string you up on the spot if she\\'s not too busy. During my recent visit she helped me bring my most recent fantasy choker to reality and over the years many of my signature pieces were built with Maopei\\'s assistance.\n\nHere you will discover crystals and carved gemstones for whatever ails you and for whatever doesn\\'t ail you. Many different shapes and sizes are available if you know what I mean (please refer to photos at right).\n\nPlaying with the revolving jewelry display case, the kind where you push the electric button and the trays go \\'round and round, reminds me of mooning over Troutman\\'s Drugstore jewelry case offerings back in my hometown. I would *love* to have one of those babies in my living room someday! Maopei has this one chock full of charms, talismans, and other magical-looking items which could amuse and bewilder even the most peculiar shoppers for hours.\n\nAs if all that isn\\'t enough to satisfy, Maopei also offers an impressive collection of stonework fetishes, fine vintage and estate jewelry, sterling and gold rings, and loose colored stones. Tibetan art and Japanese woodblocks hang throughout the store waiting for you to discover and purchase them while gentle fountains murmur softly that rose quartz would look great with your complexion. \n\nWile away an afternoon at Karizma soon!\n______________________\nTuesday-Sunday 12-7pm\nMonday 1-7pm\nkarizma1@att.net\n415.861.4515<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9wzh102"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.428953,37.767171]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kirsten is making Di-Ann's wedding dress","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\" href=\"http://www.psychoastronomy.org/tracy/mt/\">Tracy_the_astonishing</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/bgarter.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/flowerdress2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/0/whitecorset.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/210282954_cca1789448.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/211293690_2c66b6dbda.jpg\">534 SE Oak St Portland, ORShe\\'s awesome.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9v4i6ca"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.660062,45.519947]}},{"properties":{"name":"Maria ov Haight Street Work Clothes","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/platialjuly152006_020.jpg\">631 Haight Street, San Francisco CA\n\n\nSweet Maria Lopez, married tou ze veddy cutening Carlos ze Cobbler ov Haight Street, eez ze proud new proprietress ov ze beast place fur tou buy your pea coats und dickies!

This time I was smitten with the dazzling array of sparkly brooches and couldn\\'t stop eyeing the impressive cotton skirt selection. Labels you\\'ll bump into here, many of them local, include Citron, CP Shades, Weston Wear, Michael Stars, and Haley Bob.\n\nMaybe it\\'s time to purge: Mary\\'s offers a 50/50 consignment deal: you leave items for 50 days, you split the selling price 50/50. Consignment drop-in hours are 12:15-3:30pm Sunday-Friday.  \n\nYou\\'ll also find new goods here.

A good fairy, one who would save Cinderella\\'s neck with a last-minute ballgown, but it would be a ballgown that made a unique statement about wearable waste in addition to making a statement about the wearer. \n\nFilled with magical goodies, this store compels visitors to choose a talisman for their next journey and maybe a lucky hand-felted hat for a lover\\'s birthday. \n\nIn addition to representing Miranda C. Burns\\' work, Miranda Caroligne offers many area designers\\' one-of-a-kind pieces, original artwork, and jewelry. \n\nIf one-of-a-kind neo-archaic creations make you shiver with delight you\\'d better meditate for a few days before entering. Miranda will design a special piece for and with you; if you\\'re trying to figure out how the hell your mother\\'s beloved wedding dress can be reconstructed to fit into your commitment ceremony you should schedule a visit.  \n\nI found a most delightful curiousity whilst I was visiting with Miranda and urge you to do the same.

What a fun collection! From the sassy green frock featured in the center of the store (photo at right) to autumn-hued trousers and delicately designed tanks (also shown at right),and bouncing over to the bouyant wine bottle cork halter top, Jennifer has a delightful way of redefining everyday fashion sense. \n\nMy visit found Jennifer busily at work creating a surplice wrap sweater dress. If you catch her at a slow time, she\\'ll tailor her designs for you on the spot! \n\nPorcelynne opened in February of 2006 and Jennifer, who attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and gave up the business for a couple years before committing to her design work, has recently left her day job to focus on her creations full-time. \n\nIf you are in the mood for a wardrobe update and want to support a local designer while looking different-than-most, here\\'s your place. Porcelynne also features the work of many local designers including Amy M. Cool\\'s highly touchable recycled fabric handbags and jewelry by 19 Moons and Tessa Poppe. I\\'m going to have to go back for the earrings created with Lite-Brites (photo at right).\n\nThe most intriguing of Porcelynne\\'s offerings is the \"Panty-A-Month\" club. You\\'ll get a new pair of stinkies designed by Jennifer every month--imagine how fun it could be to get this monthly offering from a lover in the subsequent months after breaking up--the turmoil the poor chump would go through knowing that you\\'ll be wearing the panties he bought you--he bought YOU--with your new lover. Oh, the possibilities!\n\nArt work in the gallery rotates; the current show features work created on heat-sensitive fax paper with a soldering iron (shown at right).

She\\'ll welcome you into her store, follow you into your dressing room, and gently sniffy-snif your handbag in search of minty treats. Please ask her lady, Laura James, before offering to share!\n\nRuby\\'s is a local artist space and features a wide variety of local handmade items to marvel over--surprising jewelry, colorful and comfortable clothing, eclectic accessories, and cutie-pie baby gear. Throughout my visit, I kept spotting stuff that I missed at first glance, most notably a nice selection of simple, comfortable-looking, and interestingly-patterned cotton skirts. (photo of skirt rack is over on the right&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;)\n\nI have enjoyed shopping at Laura\\'s original Ruby store in the Mission; one Christmas I bought handmade handbags and fuzzy animal-ear hats there for most of my gifts to family and friends. Ruby\\'s is a good place to find something reasonably priced and unique for thoughtful gift-giving.\n\nPersonally, I am craving the raven resin necklace that I recently spotted on Ruby\\'s website (see photo to the right) and I\\'ve got a few expectant momma friends who I think will enjoy dressing up their little bundles of joy in one-of-a-kind hipster baby togs (and starting at 0, these little outfits don\\'t cost much  more than standard cookie-cutter sleeper jammies!).\n\nFused glass pendants with vintage textile patterns (0-9) and handpainted resin necklaces (both pictured to the right) are interesting pieces to add to the right outfit and are the sort of jewelry that it\\'s hard not to move in on a for a closer look!\n\nI love the Fall-colored brocade and leather handbags; one I spotted looked perfect for opera season--lush fabric, nice long strap, and just big enough for tickets, opera glasses, and lipstick. (also shown over there&gt;&gt;&gt;)\n\nIf you\\'re a tourist, here you can buy a not-so-obviously-a-tourist-wearing-just-shorts  sweatshirt or a different-than-most scarf to keep warm, and one that you\\'ll probably even wear again (as opposed to the Fisherman\\'s Wharf tourist variety). Don\\'t forget to bring it with you next time! This is not L.A.!  \nNote: Photos of Ruby\\'s great handmade scarf selection and a glimpse of one of the interesting paintings on back of hoodies are over there on the right&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nBeyond the painted wave midway through the Haight Ashbury store is Vie Papiel, a store of a different sort, carrying vintage ephemera such as old prints, scary clowns, and framed works. Original hand-colored prints of buff men, brave lions, fair maidens and other interesting tidbits put me in mind of old carnivals and Auntie Flora\\'s Funhouse Library. Wonderful browsing...I spotted several future gifts for hard-to-buy for males. \n\nMISSION STORE HOURS\nMonday 3-7pm\nFriday 12-7pm\nSaturday/Sunday 11-6pm\n____________\nHAIGHT STORE HOURS\nMonday-Saturday 11-7pm\nSunday 11-6pm<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9xrlnav"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.445892,37.770199]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Francisco Gold Company","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/platialwharf2006_003.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/platialwharf2006_006.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/platialwharf2006_020.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/platialwharf2006_012.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/platialwharf2006_016.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/platialwharf2006_019.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/1/platialwharf2006_022.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> Pier 39, San Francisco CA \n\n\n\nZe nice jaunt tou Fisherman\\'s Wharf should allways include ze veezit tou ze jewelie shoppes!

I now wish I\\'d bought the faceted black pearl necklace for 0, but at the time figured I\\'d leave a bargain for the next Betty. Right now everything is 20% off (a bi-annual sale) so I was even more delighted with my finds (Dammit, I really should have have bought that pearl necklace for my niece\\'s graduation gift). \n\nCindy McMullen manages this collective of 14 dealers who each work in the store two days a month and take turns designing window displays.

Sometimes your favorite look just can\\'t be found in a certain kind of pattern or color or size  and you\\'ve gotta do a little \"cheat.\" Can you guess which of the menswear coats in the photo showing two of them side-by-side in the column over there on the right is the real vintage and which is the new, vintage-inspired piece? \r\n\r\nVendima carries Classic Hardware jewelry, which looks and feels like old Bakelite (see photo at right), shoes, coats, dresses, skirts and menswear that are reminiscient of 40s and 50s styles. Some of the new retro offerings include designs by local peeps Brown Sound, Sailor Jerry (did you know he was a real tattoo artist in the 30s and 40s? Yep he was, and you can get stationery here with his tattoo art as well as menswear sort of bowling shirts), Lucky 13, Rock Steady, and beau bois. \r\n\r\nGraciela Ronconi moved to this primo spot (right next to Peasant Pies near the MUNI 24 bus line) and changed the store name to Vendima (which means \"vintage\" in Portugese) after 11 years at \"Guys and Dolls\" in a lesser-traveled Noe Valley location. She buys clothes from the public--you can call to set up an appointment to sell your duds--and from trade shows and wholesalers who scout and buy all over the country. \r\n\r\nWinona Ryder shops here and scouts from Louis Vuitton, Burberry, and Ralph Lauren regularly check out the offerings for inspiration. I was digging the partytime Jackie O. looking metallic-threaded tweedish dresses with matching coats and if I didn\\'t already have a couple sets from Aunt Esther I would have indulged.  \r\n\r\nIn the far back of the store you can find gifts and the ever-popular sales rack; a sweet selection of vintage plastic baby clothes hangers were going for .50 each and some lovely dresses were marked way down (see photos at right).\r\n\r\nGraciela is a gracious gal with a real vintage flair; let her style your vintage look. \r\n_______________\r\nMonday-Friday 11-7pm; Saturday/Sunday 11-6pm\r\nDon\\'t miss the end-of-season sales!\r\n(415) 285-7174 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9uiiw1n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.434229,37.751321]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vicki ov Vicki's Street Shop Boutique","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\" href=\"http://people.tribe.net/madamegonzaga\">Madamegonzaga</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/2/platialjuly152006_021.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 603 Haight Street, San Francisco CA\nVicki eez ze eentaresting straight-talkin\\' hottie shopkeeper hoo donut mince weirds.

From my modern titanium (half the weight and twice the strength of steel!) frameless specs to my pointy vintage sparklers, I trust HyperOptics manager Chris Trethewey as my partner in vision. He\\'s been a great help in choosing  suitable frames over the years and he\\'s got a good eye (heh heh!) for style. \n\nThese guys aren\\'t afraid to put new lenses in my latest vintage cat-eye frame finds (SF Costume Party and Decades of Fashion are good hunting grounds) and they cheerfully replace screws and make adjustments when I stop in with the glasses I stepped on because I couldn\\'t see \\'em there without my glasses on (the floor is NEVER a good place to leave your glasses!).\n\nDuring this visit, which was for a quickie wing repair on the Queen Mother of all glasses--shiny silver metal engraved cat-eyes--Chris beguiled me with 49 retro-inspired Swarovski crystal Lafont frames (shown at right). These delectable frames feature a stunning row of embedded crystals lining the top rim of the glasses rather than the front so that when you\\'re looking down the crystals sparkle for the delight of your admirers. The price of these frames, combined with the ultra-lightweight, anti-reflective, thinnest possible lenses I prefer may someday end up costing me a cool grand. That Chris!\n\nFrankly though, a good optometrist is as important as a good facialist. If you\\'re a glasshead like me and don\\'t yet have a great team of eye people helping with your vision needs, I heartily recommend Dr. William Chantaduly and my friends at HyperOptics. They\\'re aces at navigating insurance quagmires, possess a broad knowledge of the latest frames and options in lenses, and, perhaps most importantly, they stock an ample and eclectic variety of frames.  \n\nCustomer service pros that they are, HyperOptics  can usually accommodate walk-ins or schedule same-day appointments. More information on  selection and services is available on their website or you can call 415-626-8686. Open Monday through Friday from 11:00am - 7:00pm\n\n\n\n...and HEY!

A friend once bought me a giftie package from here filled with fancy chocolate Barbie candies, old fashioned gum and taffy, and little one-of-a-kind handmade jewelies. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning, a Christmas morning before your parents get divorced and the dog gets run over and you find out not only is there no Santa Claus, but there ain\\'t no cookies and milk, neither.\n\nIt\\'s fun to come here to pick up whimsical items to cover most gift-giving fetes from birthdays to babies. I\\'m very happy to say I have an original charm bracelet (see photo on the right)  like those whimsical beebalalou pieces carried in the store. Beebalalou\\'s old-school plastic charms make lively necklaces and bracelets and can really rev up your recently-divorced best friend\\'s psyche! \n\nNo, shopping isn\\'t a substitute for psychotherapy, and sure, you oughtn\\'t overspend, but the whimsical t-shirts and buttons and old-fashioned candies at wishbone are sure to bring a smile to the masses. \n\nThis is where I bought my friend Vendetta\\'s birthday gift of a candy necklace and a delightful little baby-t with a machine gun toting little tyke dressed as a cat emblazoned on the breast. It was hard to give her just the necklace and not keep the t-shirt, always a testament to a good gift purchase!\n\nFrom their site, and I agree:\nThe ultimate artsy little gift shop, Wishbone will delight even the most skeptical shopper. A hand-picked selection of high-quality stationary, clothing, jewelry, toys, and Wishbone-related items distinguishes this place from your run-of-the-mill hipster store. \n\nHint: Be sure to join the mailing list to receive post card updates on Wishbone events, all year long. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62hv9yrfk3w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.464328,37.764174]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/8560","metadata":null,"contact_name":"wendolyne","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:wendolyne","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/8560","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":44,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=8560,platial:user=wendolyne","published":"2010-03-03T17:00:00Z","id":29802}
