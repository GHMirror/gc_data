The dense prairies of oceanic Posidonia (seagrass), an important endemic species found only in the Mediterranean basin, contain and support a diversity of marine life. Ibiza preserves considerable evidence of its long history. The archaeological sites at Sa Caleta (settlement) and Puig des Molins (necropolis) testify to the important role played by the island in the Mediterranean economy in protohistory, particularly during the Phoenician-Carthaginian period. The fortified Upper Town (Alta Vila) is an outstanding example of Renaissance military architecture; it had a profound influence on the development of fortifications in the Spanish settlements of the New World. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrd6vlqglt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.435194,38.911139]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ihilani Resort and Spa","description":"Posted by Sarahl5692-1001 Olani Street, Oahu, Hawaii 96707 Waikiki and Beyond - The best escape from big-city glamour, with a roster of 5-star amenities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrd6kv36oe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-158.129197,21.344193]}},{"properties":{"name":"Inn of the Anasazi","description":"Posted by Sarahl56113 Washington Avenue, Santa Fe, NMEarthy Elegance Inspired by the \"Ancient Ones\" - hotel and restaurant.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrd6olxkbk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.937576,35.687856]}},{"properties":{"name":"Iowa State Fair","description":"Posted by Sarahl56Carnival, Festival, and Feast: America\\'s Most Famous Ag-Extravaganza.  11 days in mid-August.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrd6tj35hk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.5482406616,41.5954185944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Jessup Cellars","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 6740 Washington Street, Yountville CANot on a vineyard, but nice tasting room and the tastings are FREE!

The walls were built to protect the thousands of small, contiguous, rectangular plots (currais) from wind and seawater. Evidence of this viniculture, whose origins date back to the 15th century, is manifest in the extraordinary assembly of the fields, in houses and early 19th-century manor houses, in wine-cellars, churches and ports.

Rising 7,500 m above the ocean floor, it is regarded as the world’s third-tallest volcanic structure and stands in a spectacular environment. The visual impact of the site is all the greater due to atmospheric conditions that create constantly changing textures and tones in the landscape and a ‘sea of clouds’ that forms a visually impressive backdrop to the mountain.

The Tower, built on a 57 metre high rock, rises a further 55 meters. It is divided into three progressively smaller levels, the first of which corresponds to the Roman structure of the lighthouse. Immediately adjacent to the base of the Tower, is a small rectangular Roman building. The site also features a sculpture park, the Monte dos Bicos rock carvings from the Iron Age and a Muslim cemetery. The Roman foundations of the building were revealed in excavations conducted in the 1990s. Many legends from the Middle Ages to the 19th century surround the Tower of Hercules which is unique as it is the only lighthouse of Greco-Roman antiquity to have retained a measure of structural integrity and functional continuity.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrd6swycsw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.406644,43.38576]}},{"properties":{"name":"Trefethen Family Vineyards","description":"Posted by Sarahl56<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1160 Oak Knoll Avenue, Napa, CA 94558Beautiful, historic winery.

The 45-m-high bridge with its span of 160 m, merges 19th-century ironworking traditions with the then new lightweight technology of twisted steel ropes. It was the first bridge in the world to carry people and traffic on a high suspended gondola and was used as a model for many similar bridges in Europe, Africa and the America only a few of which survive. With its innovative use of lightweight twisted steel cables, it is regarded as one of the outstanding architectural iron constructions of the Industrial Revolution.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrd6uwbmrk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.01729202271,43.3231483668]}},{"properties":{"name":"Waikiki Beach","description":"Posted by Sarahl56Waikiki and Beyond - Famous for its generally mild surfing and world-class people-watching.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6lrd6oovogv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.823753357,21.2727389312]}},{"properties":{"name":"Walt Disney World Resort","description":"Posted by Sarahl561675 N Buena Vista Dr, Lake Buena Vista, FL\"The Most Popular Resort Destination on Earth\"- site, hotel.
