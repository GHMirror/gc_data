Photos 01a and 01b are looking towards this spot.  As you can see, the jetty (breakwater) is only 25-50 feet from these houses. The pic pretty much confrims my beleif that most damage would be flooding related.  Note that there are no missing roofs, siding or hangin flashing, even though this area is very exposed (sand routinely builds up in the street behind these houses during the winter). The piece of deck lying in the foreground is from the third house down. If you have been here, the new large off white/gray stucco/stone house with the \"turret\" and the plastic grass is right behind the photographer. Tweeted at 11:30 am Tuesday.
