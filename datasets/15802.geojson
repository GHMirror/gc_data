When there were two of the same location, the &quot;finished&quot; data was used. To find out if your water source on the list, please refer to the actual name of the plant rather than the address or coordinate.\nThis dataset contains only the test results from each plant from the day the Atrazine (atrazine ppb) levels were the highest for the year for raw or unfiltered water.\n&quot;The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that you ask your local water utility for its annual drinking water report if you are concerned about the levels of atrazine in your water.
