These data are based on the wind radii contained\nin the associated Forecast/Advisory.  Users are reminded that the Forecast/Advisory wind\nradii represent the maximum possible extent of a given wind speed within particular\nquadrants around the tropical cyclone. As a result, not all locations falling\nwithin the radii will be experiencing the indicated wind speeds.\n\nThese data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level\nand for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales\nappropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
