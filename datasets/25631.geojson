Owner Willis Vance selected the 20th Century Fox Production âBlood and Sandâ as the premiere.\r\rThis grand opening marked many firsts for the 20th Century Theater â first air conditioned theater in Cincinnati, one of the first fire proof buildings, and first free valet parking. \r\t\rClassic neon on Maison Rd\r\r\r  Designed by Fred W. Stritzel in the Neoclassical Moderne or Art Moderne style, 20th Century reflected the fluidity of society in the post Art Deco period.  The original design was not only for appearance but for improved and perfected acoustics, something little considered in previous theatre designs.\r\rMany feature movies, with all the biggest stars, adorned the big screen at the 20th Century until 1983 when the theater was closed.  A victim of the multi-plex theater that spelled the demise of the neighborhood theater. \t\r\rThe old Sweet Shop\r\rCheck out the Historical Photos.\r\r\rLeft to the elements, 9 years of neglect, vandalism, and water leaks exacted a  large toll on the once glorious theater.  Over the next 5 years, community members argued between demolishing or restoring the historic theatre.\r\rIn early 1990, an entrepreneur named Mike Belmont purchased the building with the intent of changing the use to retail. The restoration was massive and the building reopened in 1991 as Belmontâs Floor Company. \r\r \r\t\rLayout of the theatre\rCheck out the Virtual Tour of the Theatre.\r\r\rThis lasted a full year before the business was moved to another location in Oakley.  At that point the Cincinnati Church of Christ moved in and occupied the space for approximately 4 years.\r\r On October 23, 1997, 20th Century Productions was born, focusing on Special Concert Events and Private functions.\r\rPlease come by and experience the beauty and history of The 20th Century Theatre! \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.the20thcenturytheatre.com%5C'\">www.the20thcenturytheatre.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dem031bi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.433023,39.151232]}},{"properties":{"name":"242 E. 53 Street","description":"Posted by Baobot242 E. 53 Street, New York, NY<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demvtcmz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.011835,40.72127]}},{"properties":{"name":"26brix","description":"Posted by Baobot207 West Main Street, Walla Walla, WA, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejvyhac"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.342104,46.065627]}},{"properties":{"name":"29 Newbury","description":"Posted by Baobot29 Newbury St., Boston, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683ded25arz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.072331,42.352358]}},{"properties":{"name":"2nd &amp; Market Streets, San Francisco","description":"Posted by Baobot2nd &amp; Market Streets, San Francisco<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683desmlgbp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40142,37.78933]}},{"properties":{"name":"3 Thirty 3 Sports Bar","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2427 Corporation Pkwy, Burlington, NC, United States3 Thirty 3 Sports Bar offers a wide variety of entertainment for your enjoyment: Wide screen television, \rPool tables, Video games, Bands, DJs and Dancing.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekqbazq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.436054,36.066122]}},{"properties":{"name":"312 Chicago","description":"Posted by Baobot136 N La Salle Street, Chicago, IL, United StatesOn the corner of LaSalle and Randolph Streets and adjacent to the Hotel Allegro, 312 Chicago\\'s handsome, inviting dining room is bustling from morning to night, catering to local business executives and politicians, shoppers, theater-goers and tourists from far and wide.\r\rAward-winning Executive Chef Dean Zanella blends an Italian heritage filled with family recipes passed down from generations with his extensive and creative culinary experience, bringing to 312 Chicago a menu rich with authentic Italian flavors.

Milwaukie Ave., Portland, OR, United StatesThe Aladdin Theater began as Geller\\'s Theatre, a vaudeville house in the late 20\\'s playing host to the likes of Jack Benny. Through the middle decades of the century it served as a family movie emporium, and in the 70\\'s and 80\\'s it was a porn institution (the number one exhibitor of the X-rated classic Deep Throat). In late 1993 Steve Reischman and Sally Custer (then of promotions company Showman, Inc.) renovated the old hall into the shining light of Portland music venues.\r\rThe Aladdin Theater is a 620 capacity venue that has won numerous awards as Portland\\'s favorite live music venue. From quiet \"listening\" shows such as RAY DAVIES (The Kinks) and LEO KOTTKE, to loud \"rock-out\" shows like SLEATER-KINNEY and BLONDE REDHEAD, the Aladdin has been likened to \"music church\" and has become a must-play venue on the way up for many of today\\'s hottest acts. JEFF BUCKLEY, MACY GRAY, ERYKAH BADU, STEVE EARLE, PAULA COLE, BEN HARPER, DIDO, LUCINDA WILLIAMS, NELLY FURTADO, STRING CHEESE INCIDENT, NORAH JONES, BETH ORTON, KELLER WILLIAMS, RYAN ADAMS, POE, DIANA KRALL, GILLIAN WELCH and RUFUS WAINWRIGHT are just a few of the acts in recent years that have spring boarded from Aladdin into large theaters, amphitheatres, and arenas.\r\rActs that normally play larger concert halls have found the Aladdin to be a perfect situation for them to play in a more intimate environment: BRIAN WILSON (The Beach Boys), DAVID CROSBY (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young), RICHARD THOMPSON, JOHN HIATT, JOHN PRINE, BECK, EMMYLOU HARRIS, EVERCLEAR, ROGER HODGSON (Supertramp), TRAGICALLY HIP, NILS LOFGREN (Crazy Horse/E. Street Band), and INDIGO GIRLS.\r\rAnd the Aladdin has become a home away from home for the finest acts in jazz, blues, world music, pop, bluegrass, roots and everything in between: MACEO PARKER, MARC COHN, SUZANNE VEGA, JOAN OSBORNE, DAVID GRISMAN QUINTET, BILLY BRAGG, PSYCHEDELIC FURS, J.J.

Alice Tully Hall continues to serve as one of the world\\'s most treasured music venues.\r\rAlice Tully Hall was designed specifically as the home of the Chamber Music Society. Exceptional acoustics and comfort make it well-suited to more intimate works. It is also used by other Lincoln Center constituencies, notably for some performances by Jazz at Lincoln Center\r\rThere might be no Chamber Music Society as we know it but for the effort spearheaded by Alice Tully, William Schuman and Charles Wadsworth - because every note played by The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center bears their unique and lasting stamp. Collectively and individually they contributed immeasurably to the cultural life of the United States. \r\rThe magnitude and diversity of chamber music demanded an institution devoted solely to its repertoire, and as President of Lincoln Center, William Schuman determined that chamber music should be housed - in a hall designed specifically for it - along with dance, orchestral music, theater, opera and film at America\\'s preeminent artistic base. Dr. Schuman invited the eminent pianist, chamber musician and accompanist, Charles Wadsworth, to help determine the structure of the new chamber music constituent. They decided on a unique format in which chamber works of every size and description would be presented by highly esteemed performers, including a core of Artist Members to be augmented each season by Guest Artists. \r\rThis institution would also encourage and commission the creation of new works. The founding triumvirate was made complete with the arrival of Alice Tully, a former opera singer and vocal recitalist who agreed to help finance a chamber music hall on condition that it have exemplary acoustics and comfort. The Chamber Music Society\\'s inaugural concert on September 11, 1969 marked the opening of its home, Alice Tully Hall. Mr. Wadsworth served as the Chamber Music Society\\'s first Artistic Director from 1969 to 1989, and Miss Tully served as the Chairman of the Board from 1969 to 1989. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.newyorkcitytheatre.com%5C'\">www.newyorkcitytheatre.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejx1f0l"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.98232,40.77306]}},{"properties":{"name":"Alive One","description":"Posted by Baobot2683 N Halsted St, Chicago, IL, United StatesAlive One combines the very best of music and spirits.

operational warplanes from that historic era and staffed with volunteers in authentic period flight gear, the American Airpower Museum brings to cost effective life powerful images from another era.\r\rIt\\'s squadron of flight ready aircraft include a B-17 Flying Fortress in the markings of the famous Memphis Belle, a twin engine Mitchell bomber, the famous P-40 Warhawk, with its tiger mouth markings and more. The museum also offers a control tower retrofitted to the 1940\\'s, a hangar whose design is reminiscent of Pearl Harbor on the eve of war and access to a fleet of vintage automobiles and trucks that add to the ambiance of this vivid chapter of American history.\r\rThe museum sits five minutes south of the Long Island Expressway at Republic Airport, which is a state owned general aviation airport. It is minutes from the Farmingdale Long Island Railroad station. And because of its airport location it is the only historic aircraft collection in the region that can regularly return to the air, demonstrating the power and stunning beauty of aircraft designed for war.\r\rAs a location for your visual needs the American Airpower Museum is Unique. Cost effective. Local. Cooperative. Historic. Available. Compelling. If you need air power call us.

Coinciding with the three-month anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center, the unveiling of the new building represented progress, growth, and renewal during a city-wide effort to revitalize New Yorkâs cultural, social and economic life. It is the first new art museum built from the ground up since the Whitney Museum of American Art opened in 1966. \"This may not be a big buildingâby American standardsâbut it is a magnificent one. The design is a very interesting response to New York, where building are usually so glassy. Here there is a real weightiness; it suggests a different take on contemporary architecture,\" noted Naomi Stungo, the editor of World Architecture magazine who presented the award.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dechsn8o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.977305,40.761017]}},{"properties":{"name":"American Legion","description":"Posted by BaobotRte. 121, Haverhill<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deg6ncsc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.10507,42.81347]}},{"properties":{"name":"American Legion #265","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_718.jpg\">1034 North Shoop Ave, Wauseon, OH<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683depjiqnw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.13443,41.559307]}},{"properties":{"name":"American Legion Post 311","description":"Posted by BaobotSeekonk<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deenw4g1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.325189,41.82983]}},{"properties":{"name":"American Legiona Post 440","description":"Posted by Baobot295 California St., Newton<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demlnnjd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.200661,42.364967]}},{"properties":{"name":"Americana at the Ritz-Carlton South Beach","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> One Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejxqtxc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.128873,25.790809]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ameriquest Field","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_6122_primary.jpg\">1000 Ballpark Way, Arlington, TX<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683depgm3lj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.080588,32.749931]}},{"properties":{"name":"Amerisuites","description":"Posted by Baobot4235 West Airport Frwy, Irving, TX, United StatesGot Problem Kids?

A lifestyle familiar to native Islanders was rapidly disappearing.\r\rThe purpose of the organization was to establish a museum in order to ensure that still vivid memories and artifacts would not be lost and forgotten. The continuing goal of the Society is to provide public education through collection, preservation, research, interpretation and exhibition of artifacts, documents and photographs relevant to the settlement and development of Anderson Island.\r\rThe period between 1850 and 1975 has been chosen as the chronological scope within which the collections will be maintained because that era saw the settlement of the Island which played an historic role in development of the region known as South Puget Sound. \rThe site of Society activities is the landmark Johnson Farm, seven acres of which were a gift from Alma Ruth Laing, the last direct descendant of Island pioneers, John Oscar Johnson and his wife, Alma Marie. The Johnsons were Finnish immigrants who came to Anderson Island before the turn of the century.\r\rThe farm is typical of those developed by many islanders who raised chickens and dairy herds as a source of income. The buildings are excellent examples of the type of architecture and construction found on the island prior to 1940. The barn is among the last remaining pole barns on the island, as are the chicken houses.\r\rIn 1991, John Parks and his wife, Karen, deeded an additional 22 acre parcel to the Museum. A portion of the gift includes the pond from which the Johnson family pumped the water used on the farm.\r\rThe farmhouse is furnished with many family heirlooms, as well as donated items reminiscent of the stye and period. Many of the quilts in the Museum were restored or reproduced by former islander, Lois Scholl, whose efforts on behalf of the Historical Society have earned her the title Mother of the Museum.\r\rThe original family garden has been enlarged and is now available for use by individual gardeners at a small fee, all of whom are members of the society.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.andersonislandhs.com%5C'\">www.andersonislandhs.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deqkguco"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.706272,47.172555]}},{"properties":{"name":"Andiamo","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_7027_primary.jpg\">938 110th Ave NE, Bellevue, WA, United StatesAndiamo philosophy is to provide our customers with an elegant, yet comfortable, environment where they can enjoy good food, excellent wines and a high level of service at reasonable prices.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deje2xk1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.193652,47.618763]}},{"properties":{"name":"Andre's Steakhouse","description":"Posted by Baobot3031 E.

Coast East, the artistâs first solo exhibition in the United States, will feature new works created especially for her premiere on the East Coast.\r\rStanoff, a descendant of Bizen sword maker Ando Yoshiro Masakatsu, utilizes her skill as a metalworker to create tranquil, introspective environments on two-dimentional steel canvases.  Using traditional metal finishing methods such as grinding, sanding, patinas, and the application of heat, as well as metal-based pigments, solvents, and acids, Stanoff creates varied textures and surfaces on her works. Through the use of  subtle shades of silver and greys, steel, an industrial and mundane material, is transformed; the natural beauty and quiet elegance of the medium is revealed.\r\rInterested in the study of subtraction to the point of purity, simplicity, and refinement, Stanoffâs works explore themes of solitude, nothingness, and the transitory nature of things.  Simultaneously conveying both strength and a sense of stillness, her canvases possess an undeniable ethereal quality that encourages meditation and introspection.\r\râMy inspiration for the work is introspective; my current studio has no windows, only skylights.  Recurring themes for this work are quietude, transient beauty, solitude, empty space, the concept of all things devolving towards nothingness,â Stanoff explains.\r\rHalf-Japanese and half-Russian, she was raised bilingually and in two cultures, living both in her family\\'s Buddhist temple in Japan and in Northern California.  A graduate of UC Berkeley, she also studied East Asian Buddhist Iconography at Yale University.  Recent exhibitions include: Gallerie Sho in Tokyo, Energy Gallery in Toronto, and Urbis Atrium in California.  Her work is included in several private and corporate collections. \r\rArt Gotham showcases the work of early and mid-career contemporary artists who use a variety of media. The gallery, opened by art dealer Kimberly Salib, debuted in January 2005 in New York City\\'s West Chelsea gallery district.

Hawthorne Blvd., Portland, OR, United StatesThe Bagdad Theater, it would seem, has played out most every scene imaginable. Since its 1927 opening, this Hawthorne District landmark has presented more than 25,000 shows -- on stage and screen -- ranging wildly from a Hollywood horse named Beverly to R. P. McMurphy and 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.\r\rIn 1927, Universal Pictures spent the enormous sum of 00,000 to create a splendid and state-of-the-art theater, complete with an expansive stage, gurgling fountain, grand colonnade, and Middle-Eastern decor, right down to the usherettes\\' Arabian-styled uniforms. Even Leon Strashun, conductor of the Bagdad\\'s orchestra, was a musician of great renown, having studied under Tchaikovsky. The place was proclaimed \"a triumph of artistry and craftsmanship.\"\r\rIn the theater\\'s formative years, the movie industry was revolutionized by the replacement of silent movies with \"talkies.\" Through this transition period, live stage shows were constantly big draws. In fact, vaudeville remained a key part of the Bagdad\\'s programs through the 1940s. Latter day stage shows of note included the \"fluorescent dance magic\" of exotic dancer, Mercedes. She shared the bill with a xylophonist. The best-known vaudeville star to grace the Bagdad\\'s stage was Sammy Davis, Jr., performing in the \\'40s with the respected song-and-dance team, the Will Mastin Trio.\r\rMore recently, the Bagdad has been the scene of some notable movie premiere galas. In 1975, actors Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, and producer Michael Douglas appeared at the Bagdad for the Oregon premiere of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest. Sixteen years later, just after McMenamins\\' renovation of the movie palace, My Own Private Idaho debuted here. In its present incarnation as a cinema-and-draft house, the Bagdad continues as a favorite spot to escape into splendor and make-believe.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deenabzq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.662158,45.512315]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bagley Wright Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 155 Mercer St., Seattle, WAThe Bagley Wright Theatre is one of three theatres at The Seattle Repertory Theatre.

Wenatchee Ave., Wenatchee, WA, United StatesThe vision for a performing arts center in Wenatchee began in 1919 with sketches from architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  It became a reality in 1992 when Allied Arts formed a committee chaired by Judy Troy to survey local arts groups about their need for such a center.  In 1994, the Wade-Rose building, which had housed the Thurman Company, became available and the Supporters of the Center was formed to raise money toward a performing arts center.  An economic study was done and a fundraising campaign for four projects began. Those four included the addition of  an exhibition hall by the City of Wenatchee to the existing Convention Center, a \"black box\" small theater, a children\\'s museum and a performing arts theater.  This initial drive raised pledges of 2.5 million, including 1 million from the late Bob Stanley.  This led to the naming of the total project \"The Stanley Civic Center\" which currently includes the Bank of America Performing Arts Center, The Riverside Playhouse, and the Auvil Exhibition Hall.\r\rIn 1996, a properties study led the Supporters of the Center to move the Performing Arts Theatre to a site in front of the Convention Center.  In the meantime, Music Theatre of Wenatchee built their 160 seat Riverside Playhouse at the original location and the Children\\'s Discovery Museum occupied the rear of the warehouse building. A second funding campaign was launched in 1997, which raised another 1.5 million, plus a 3 million grant from the Arts Fund of the State of Washington.  Construction began in early summer of 1998, with Leone &amp; Keeble of Spokane as the general contractor.  Principal contractors were Wells &amp; Wade mechanical and Apple City Electric of Wenatchee.  Architects were LMN Architects of Seattle, who designed Seattle\\'s Benaroya Hall assisted by the  PKJB firm of Wenatchee.  The Wade-Rose building was sold to Quality Rentals, and Music Theatre of Wenatchee purchased their portion of the building.   Children\\'s Discovery Museum moved to a smaller and more manageable site on Kittitas Street, and unfortunately closed it\\'s doors a year later.\r\rThe 490 seat Performing Arts Theater was named the \"Bank of America Performing Arts Center\" after the bank\\'s predecessor Seafirst Bank had donated 50,000.  The naming rights were given to the Bank of America for five years from the opening date.\r\rThe Bank of America Performing Arts Center at the Stanley Civic Center opened its doors to the public with a gala event on September 29, 2000.  This event, called \"A Showcase of Wenatchee\\'s Best\" did indeed showcase local talent from nine local performing arts groups and included a cast of over 100.\r\rIn 2006, the Supporters of the Center launched a 3-phase identity development and branding campaign. The first phase began with a name change to \"The Performing Arts Center of Wenatchee,\" which is what the facility is currently known as.\r\rA special thanks goes to the businesses and individuals whose contributions made construction of the Performing Arts Center possible. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.pacwen.org%5C'\">www.pacwen.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683den3z3zu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.312752,47.426263]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bank Street Theater","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 155 Bank St., New York, NY, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekwetfs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.008995,40.736095]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bank of America Stadium","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_6420_primary.jpg\">800 South Mint Street, Charlotte, NCBank of America Stadium is a football stadium located in uptown Charlotte, North Carolina.

The city incorporated three months later with a population between 700 and 800.\rMiamiâs first park was on land owned by the railroad and located in front of Flaglerâs magnificent Royal Palm Hotel. Called Royal Palm Park, this green space served as the tiny communityâs first gathering place, the venue for a wide array of athletic contests, political gatherings, cultural happenings, and religious meetings, including âSunday Schoolsâ hosted by the former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryant.\r\rMiamiâs first park was on land owned by the railroad and locatedin front of Flaglerâs magnificent Royal Palm Hotel. Called Royal Palm Park, this green space served as the tiny communityâs first gathering place, the venue for a wide array of athletic contests, political gatherings, cultural happenings, and religious meetings. Located on Biscayne Bay (whose waters stretched as far west as todayâs Biscayne Boulevard) Royal Palm Park covered an area from SE 2nd Avenue to the bay and from SE 2nd Street to East Flagler and SE 1st Streets. The park contained a pavilion and later a bandshell. A portion of the greenspace was also used as a baseball field, and for track and field events.\r\rOther parks followed, including Lummus Park, northwest of downtown on the Miami River, and Riverside Park, west of the river in the new Riverside neighborhood. Both opened in the early 1910s. In the second decade of the twentieth century, Miami grew faster per capita than any other city in the United States, its population soaring from 5,500 to approximately 30,000 by 1920. Civic leaders began discussing the creation of a large waterfront park on public land, accompanied by a marina and broad boulevard. They envisioned these elements running along the bay from todayâs East Flagler Street to the Omni area, 19 blocks to the north. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.bayfrontparkmiami.com%5C'\">www.bayfrontparkmiami.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejr7n39"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.187889,25.777439]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bayou Cafe","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 215 First St., Cambridge, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deruwghu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.078436,42.364267]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bayside Exposition Center","description":"Posted by BaobotMt.

Our Bongos Cuban CafÃ© (in Disney World) has had great success, and since this one (in Miami) opened we couldnât be happier,â says Gloria Estefan.\r\rThe Bongos Cuban CafÃ© in Miami, Fla. inaugurated in April of 2000. It came on the heels of the wildly successful Orlando, Fla. flagship location. It raises two stories at the plaza level of The American Airlines Arena and overlooks the port of Miami, Biscayne Bay, and the downtown Miami skyline. Bongos can be spotted from miles away because of the giant pineapple, which rises from the roof. The pineapple has become a well-known symbol for the restaurant.\r\rThe 16,000 square foot restaurant by day, disco by night brings an unprecedented blend of authentic Cuban cuisine and romantic atmosphere of old Havana to Miami. The growing popularity of Bongos Cuban CafÃ© has made it a desirable venue for concerts, special events, and even the filming of music videos. In the past year, Bongos Cuban CafÃ© has hosted such events as the Billboard Music Awards after party and the Premio Lo Nuestro after party.\r\rAfter hours on Friday and Saturdays, our patrons can groove to tantalizing Latin rhythms and be awed by our fascinating light show. By eleven oâclock, large lines have formed outside Bongos Cuban CafÃ©. Eager locals in there twenties and thirties await their turn to experience the ultimate in Latin music and atmosphere.\r\rAside from Bongos Cuban CafÃ© in Miami, the Estefans own three other restaurants.

Few other places in the Northwest can boast such a pedigree. It began as an island venture brought about by a man named John D. Boon. A devout Methodist, Boon came to the developing site of Salem in 1845 to work with the Jason Lee Mission. In 1851, his honest character led to Boon\\'s election as Oregon\\'s first treasurer, a position he kept into the 1860s. During this time, Boon also started his own general store -- the second in Salem. He conducted both state and store business in the brick building he constructed on the island formed by the encircling waters of Mill Creek and the mill race feeding the Mission\\'s mill.\r\rBoon\\'s store became a favorite trading place, and continued as such into the 20th century under its new proprietor, a prosperous adventurer named William Lincoln Wade. Wade not only kept store business brisk, he also opened the building\\'s upper story to serve as a community hall. One frequenter of Wade\\'s store was future president Herbert Hoover, a childhood friend of Wade\\'s son.\r\rWith the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the one-time treasury was transformed into a \"beer parlor\" by Fred Karr, a former hop grower and bowling academy director. The long run of Karr\\'s Tavern stretched into the 1970s, when it was sold and reopened as \"Boon\\'s Treasury,\" still a neighborhood pub, but one that featured live music played by such masters as Earl \\'Fatha\\' Hines. In 1998, the torch was passed to McMenamins and we have continued the pub\\'s live music tradition, all the while striving to maintain the historic building\\'s longstanding status as a favorite hub.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deq0cwfl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.032844,44.948783]}},{"properties":{"name":"Booth Amphitheatre At Regency Park","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 8003 Regency Pkwy., Cary, NC, United StatesAt Booth Amphitheatre enjoyment is as much about atmosphere and the environs as it is about the entertainment.

Construction having begun in 1923, it was formally opened with Sheridan\\'s The Rivals on November 10â 1925. The architect was J. Williams Beal Sons.\r\rOriginally named the Repertory Theatre of Bostonâ the theatre was built to be a permanent home for the Henry Jewett Playersâ a Bostonâbased repertory theatre company. In choosing to locate the theatre across from Symphony Hall and near the Museum of Fine Arts and the old Boston Opera Houseâ the theatreâs creators intended to signify its character as a major cultural institution of Boston and its difference from the commercial playhouses in the Boylstonâ Washingtonâ Tremont streets area of the city.\r\rHenry Jewett, a native of Australia, whose portrait as Macbeth hangs today in the main stairwell leading to the theatre\\'s balcony, was a distinguished actor and director. Born in 1862, he moved to the United States around the turn of the century and became the leading man for Julia Marlowe. He settled in Boston shortly after 1900 and organized the Henry Jewett Players. The Jewett Company first offered Shakespeare productions at the Boston Opera House; in 1916 it moved to the Copley Theatre where it performed until the early 1920s. But Jewett\\'s ambition was to have a permanent home for his company, and he and his wife Frances vigorously pressed for a facility built by the community. In 1923, the Jewett Repertory Fund was started; many prominent Bostonians, including Calvin Coolidge and A. Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard University, were on the roster of sponsors.\r\rAlmost immediately from its openingâ the Repertory Theatre was beset by difficulties. There was much theatrical competitionâ and soon an even more serious problem was posed by the advent of talking moviesâ which lured audiences from all types of live entertainment. In 1930â Mr. Jewettâs company disbanded. Jewett himself died in the same year.\r\rAs the theatre was being closedâ Jewettâs widow remarked prophetically: \"You canât have a repertory theatre without subsidy â lots of subsidy.\" The prescience of this view was proven thirty years later in the 1960s as the American regional theatre movement became increasingly significant and revived the pattern of resident theatre companies.\r\rDuring the 1930s and 1940sâ the theatre was known as the Esquire Theatre and was mainly used as a movie house. The Esquire specialized in art filmsâ and it was here that Boston audiences first saw Laurence Olivierâs Henry V. During these same yearsâ the theatre occasionally reverted to its original purposeâ as in 1941 when Louis Calhern and Dorothy Gish played in Life with Father.\r\rIn October 1953, Boston University purchased the facility, and the vision which had initially created the theatre again began to be realized. The School of Theatre Arts at the Boston University College of Fine Arts has now used the theatre as its primary facility for performance, design, and technical production for three decades. The Theatre Arts Program presented its first production, Nicholas Evreinoff\\'s The Chief Thingâ in Decemberâ 1954. Its students and faculty annually present approximately seven productions in the theatreâs main auditorium and in the upstairs spaceâ now called Studio 210â which was originally the Repertory Theatreâs ballr<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekpfhzg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.086216,42.341617]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boston University Theatre: Boston University Theatre, Studio 210","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_5026_primary.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 264 Huntington Ave., Boston, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decx1m39"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.086216,42.341617]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boston University's 808 Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 808 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo0b9kx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.112841,42.350873]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boston University: Concert Hall","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 855 Commonwealth Ave., Boston<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dei96ftz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.113884,42.35099]}},{"properties":{"name":"Boston University: Marsh Chapel","description":"Posted by Baobot8 St..

The theatre\\'s distinctive characteristics included a lobby richly appointed in huge decorative mirrors and breche violet and white marble, which swept majestically through a succession of lobbies and foyers; great wall surfaces enhanced with gold leaf and wood decorations; and 2,500 plush, roomy seats. The theatre was originally opened as the flagship of vaudeville\\'s legendary Orpheum Circuit, and among the stars believed to have played the Palace in its early years are Jimmy Durante, Mae West, Jack Benny, Sophie Tucker and Bob Hope.\r\rDespite the popularity of such acts, audiences in the late 1920s and early 1930s had begun to lose interest in vaudeville, and in 1931 the theatre was converted into a movie palace, initially presenting films with live stage shows, and then eventually showing only movies. When movie audiences began staying at home to watch television in the 1950s, the theatre managers, hoping to attract larger audiences, booked occasional Broadway shows into the theatre, such as \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" starring Carol Channing.\r\rDuring the late 1950s, the Palace was fitted with special equipment to show films in Cinerama. During the mid-1970s, the management of the Bismarck Hotel transformed the auditorium into a banquet hall by removing the seats on the orchestra level and bringing the floor flush with the stage. In 1984, the theatre, now renamed the Bismarck Theatre, was converted into a rock venue. Sporadically used during the 1990s, the venue was completely restored and renovated during 1999, and renamed the Cadillac Palace.\r\rThe renovated theatre was reopened during the fall of 1999, with the premiere of Elton John and Tim Rice\\'s \"Aida.\" Since then, the Cadillac palace has been the home to several pre-Broadway hits including \"The ProducersÃ¢â¬âThe New Mel Brooks Musical\" and \"Mamma Mia!\" in 2001.

I used to have small poker parties with friends, sitting around an old green poker table and drinking cans of Black Label or bottles of Lucky Lager. Where the kitchen is now, used to be the loft I slept under...the small bar in Venus was the living room where the t.v. and an old couch were. Then in February of 1999, my apartment became this caf??. In the beginning, we served only lunch to the business folks around the neighborhood. Then the small bar went from a dream to a reality when the L.C.B. finally granted us permission to serve cocktails...now, almost 3 years later, I can barely believe that these walls used to be bright orange and I used to watch Perry Mason reruns in the small bar??\rThe marsBar is next door...a space that holds many memories for many people...it used to be the Storeroom Tavern. I worked there for 4 years and had many a dollar beer, watched many a punk show, and made many friends...sadly, it closed. In June, the space was still vacant after a few months and I decided to go for it. So with the help of a lot of friends, a lot of cleaning supplies, and a LOT of hours, we opened the marsBar on August 17 2001. We have bands play...not like the old days...people live upstairs and all over the building so the music is primarily acoustic acts and singer/songwriter stuff...with the addition of the pool table and a couch, its almost like my second home...Below you will find a list of people and businesses. None of this would be possible without them.\rThank you so much for having lunch, dinner, coffee, cocktails, and\rconversation here. It\\'s still home and I am so happy you came over!\rYours,\rKaty Aversenti\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.cafevenus.com%5C'\">www.cafevenus.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deduewwq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.329171,47.625093]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafeteria","description":"Posted by Baobot546 Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dej10zxw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.13366,25.790599]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cafetin Cafe and Bakery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 6934 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dem5047v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.120431,25.854646]}},{"properties":{"name":"Caffe Blu","description":"Posted by Baobot1010 E.

For over 10 years Dara lived in the refugee camps along the Cambodian and Thai border. He resettled in the US in 1999.\r\rDara wanted to share the story of his life under the Khmer Rouge with the world, so it would not happen again.  At the same time Dara wanted the children of Cambodian immigrants, who have grown up in the US, not to forget about Cambodia??s recent history, great culture, traditions and literature. \r\r\rDara Duong provided a presentation about his life history and the Cambodian genocide to the Seattle city employees in July 2005.\r\r\rAWARDS AND RECOGNITION\r\r\rThe Museum began in Dara\\'s garage. With generous assistance from volunteers and supporters. Now the Museum is open to the public. It is located in the White Center area, adjacent to Seattle, in Washington State. \r\rThis Museum is a place where  people of all communities can actively learn about Cambodian history and culture. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.killingfieldsmuseum.com%5C'\">www.killingfieldsmuseum.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekdf6m4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.355142,47.515367]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cambridge Center for Adult Education","description":"Posted by Baobot56 Brattle St., Cambridge, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deje2uxd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.121881,42.374407]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cambridge Center for Adult Education: Blacksmith House, Cambridge Center for Adult Education","description":"Posted by Baobot56 Brattle St., Cambridge, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deiwsd13"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.121881,42.374407]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cambridge National Guard Armory","description":"Posted by Baobot450 Concord  Ave, Cambridge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dem0bh8y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.139675,42.386339]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cambridge Public Library","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 359 Broadway, Cambridge, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dek8kxli"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.104037,42.370537]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cambridge YMCA: Cambridge Family YMCA Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 820 Mass.

The hall was dedicated the Isaac Stern Auditorium in 1996, and the stage was dedicated the Ronald O. Perelman Family Stage in 2006. Throughout its century-plus history, the space has been the forum for important jazz events, historic lectures, noted educational forums, and much more. Designed by architect and cellist William Burnett Tuthill and renovated in 1986, the auditorium\\'s striking curvilinear design allows the stage to become a focal point embraced by five levels of seating, which accommodates up to 2,804. The auditorium\\'s renowned acoustics have made it a favorite of audiences and performers alike. \"It has been said that the hall itself is an instrument,\" said the late Isaac Stern. \"It takes what you do and makes it larger than life.\"\r\rLocated on the third floor of Carnegie Hall, the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall is an intimate auditorium ideal for recitals, chamber music concerts, symposia, discussions, master classes, and more. Seating 268 people, the elegant auditorium evokes a Belle Epoque salon and is \"remarkable for the symmetry of its proportions and the beauty of its decorations,\" according to a review from 1891, when the hall was known as the Chamber Music Hall. In 1986, the Chamber Music Hall was renamed in recognition of the generosity of the Chairman of the Board of Carnegie Hall, Sanford I. Weill, and his wife, Joan. \r\rThe new Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall opened in September 2003 as the site of a broad spectrum of performing and educational events. When it first opened its doors In 1891, Carnegie Hall comprised three auditoriums: the Main Hall, the Chamber Music Hall, and the Recital Hall, located underneath the Main Hall. The Recital Hall was leased to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1895 and was used as a theater by various groups until the early 1960s, when it was converted to a cinema. In 1997, a process began to reclaim the space for its original purpose, and construction began to create a versatile auditorium generally seating 599, with alternate stage configurations of different capacities. Zankel Hall is named in honor of the generosity of the late Carnegie Hall Vice Chairman Arthur Zankel and his wife, J<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dep5ku7z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.980471,40.764951]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carnival Center for the Performing Arts","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_2386.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1300 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL, United StatesCarnival Center for the Performing Arts brings together artists and audiences through partnerships with its resident companies, staff, and local and international arts organizations to provide extraordinary cultural and educational experiences of the highest quality for diverse audiences.\r\rClick to see the view from your seats: <a href=\"%5C'http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/entertainment/archive/pac/%5C'\">http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/entertainment/archive/pac/</a>\r\r    *  The 2,400 seat Sanford and Delores Ziff Ballet Opera House and the 2,200-seat Knight Concert Hall will be the Miami homes for the Concert Association of Florida, Florida Grand Opera, Miami City Ballet, and New World Symphony, as well as premier venues for a wide array of local, national, and international performances ranging from Broadway musicals and visiting classical artists to hip hop, world music, Latin concerts, and popular entertainment from many cultures.\r\r* The Plaza for the Arts will be a magnificent setting for outdoor entertainment, social celebrations, and informal community gatheri<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dee5eona"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.189177,25.787134]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carolina Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 310 S Greene St, Greensboro, NC, United StatesThe Carolina Theatre proudly welcomes over 75,000 people downtown annually to enjoy the rich atmosphere and ambiance of another era, while listening to some of the top performers of today.

It is the home of the Cleveland Browns NFL franchise. The stadium sits on 31 acres (13 ha) of land on the shores of Lake Erie and has a capacity of at least 73,200. The normal use of Cleveland Browns Stadium is only for football; however, the stadium was built with a playing surface large enough to allow it to host international soccer matches.\r\rCleveland Browns Stadium sits on the former site of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which housed the Browns before owner Art Modell moved the team to Baltimore to become the Ravens. As part of the deal that brought a \"new\" Browns team to Cleveland, the city of Cleveland tore down Cleveland Stadium after the 1996 NFL season to make room for the new facility. Debris from the former stadium was submerged in Lake Erie and now serves as an artificial reef. Ground was broken on May 15, 1997, the stadium opened in July 1999, and the resurrected Browns debuted there in the 1999 NFL season.

Gilded Age architectural gem brought back to life as a performing arts center in the âheart of the Berkshiresâ.\r\rKept safe behind the temporary wall and ceiling partitions of a retail store for more than 50 years, the ornately appointed and now fully restored Colonial emerged in August, 2006 as a cultural and economic development force in the Berkshires.\r\r \r\rThe Colonial is an appropriate symbol of the re-emergence of Pittsfield as the economic and cultural center of the Berkshires. A restored and active Colonial Theatre, together with Pittsfieldâs other cultural attractions and businesses, is creating jobs, attracting and inspiring audiences, contributing to rising real estate values and adding vitality back to a city that has been recreating itself as a people-center from its earlier days as a manufacturing center.\r\r \r\rWe invite you to be a part of the on-going movement to maintain this magnificent part of our history and our future. Come tour this architectural icon of another age. Come and enjoy the contemporary entertainment that gives it new life.\r\r \r\rThe Colonial Theatre is a 501 (c) 3 Not-for-Profit organization that operates with a combination of earned and contributed income.

Its elaborate four-story theater entrance is an outstanding example of detailing and craftsmanship in terra cotta, designed in a combination of the Classical Revival and Italian Renaissance architectural styles.

Cornelius Pass Rd., Hillsboro, OR, United StatesThe wildlife at Cornelius Pass Roadhouse was once as common as the rain. Fox, deer, elk, and weasels all wandered the cultivated fields and apple orchards. Pheasants were easily spotted in the daylight; owls were abundant at night. This was when Sunset Highway was new and in a half-hour spent waiting for the school bus, you could count on one hand the number of cars that came along the Highway and the Pass Road.\r\rThese days, the grounds containing the house and barns essentially form a six-acre, rural oasis surrounded by an increasing concentration of freeways, hi-tech office buildings, and stores. And while the pastoral world has largely disappeared, little has actually changed at the property which was the former residence of Frank Imbrie.\r\rThe Imbrie family arrived in the mid-1840s as part of Oregon\\'s first flood of white settlers. The Imbries came to Oregon from the Midwest, but they were not far removed from the Old World. The family\\'s patriarch, James Imbrie, Jr., was born and raised in the Kingdom of Fife, a magical place on the southeast coast of Scotland, where passions for religion and golf run deep.\r\rBy the 1850s, two of James\\' sons, James and Robert, each had developed farms in Washington County. Robert constructed the granary in the mid-1850s, and a decade later replaced the property\\'s original farm house with the three-story, Italian Villa-style home that still welcomes visitors today. With a family that included 12 children and his mother, Robert needed the extra space.\r\rIn the days when the property played host to a sizable dairy, Frank Imbrie had the wonderful octagonal barn built -- soon after the turn of the century. Its unusual design was ideal for the farm\\'s milking and feeding operations. For the middle decades of the 20th century, the Imbries\\' barley was a key ingredient in Blitz-Weinhard beer.\r\rIn 1977, Frank\\'s younger brother, Gary, converted the family home into the Imbrie Farmstead Restaurant. Nine years later, McMenamins jumped at an opportunity to get involved with the venerable property and transformed it into one of the state\\'s pioneer brew pubs.\r\rWhen development threatened the buildings in the late \\'80s, the community rallied to save them, and soon afterwards, McMenamins was able to purchase the property and secure its preservation. Since then, it\\'s just been a whole lot of fun.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dehxy1ip"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.900027,45.546957]}},{"properties":{"name":"Corner Pub","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_4850_primary.jpg\">1 West Union St., Ashland, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683depoqt2i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.467175,42.255365]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cornerstone Books","description":"Posted by Baobot45 Lafayette St., Salem, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo0t62f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.89348,42.520178]}},{"properties":{"name":"Corporate Inn - Sunnyvale","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 805 E.

W., Garden City, NY, United StatesFor over a century, from the first flights by frail biplanes on the Hempstead Plains, to manâs walking on the Moon, Long Island has been on the leading edge of Americaâs aviation and space adventure.\r\rLong Islanders have helped transform aviation from a spectator sport to a major means of commercial transportation. We have also produced a large portion of Americaâs aerial arsenal in time of war. The many historic flights that transpired here, and the many aviation companies that developed here, helped make aviation the integral part of our world that it is today.

That meant a substantial, partially matched, grant from the State and the beginning of the Civic Center.\r\rAfter nearly three busy years, ground-breaking finally occurred on August 17, 1978 at 2:30pm.turning the shovels were Mrs. Carol Smith the Chair of the Danville Civic Center Authority, Danville Mayor David S. Palmer, Bill Widman the Chair of the Danville Recreation Board and Robert Radmacher the Deputy Director of the Illinois Department of Business and Economic Development.\r\rThe next two years were filled with debate and changes to the Civic Center to bring it in under budget and define its purpose. Mayor David S. Palmer was instrumental in keeping the plan on-track. In a March 10, 1985 article in the Commercial-News it was said of David S. Palmer, \"He was proudest of the Civic Center. Accused of \\'pushing it through\\' by those who saw no need for it, he once jokingly referred to it as the \\'Palmer House\\'.\"\r\rFinally, on September 20, 1980, the Civic Center was opened to the public.\r\rOver the last 20 years the Civic Center has seen a lot pass through it\\'s doors, your doors, the doorway to entertainment in Danville.

The City was named after the Des Moines City Improvement Company that was named after Des Moines, Iowa and is pronounced de moin\\'. The City\\'s area is 5.58 square miles.\r\rDes Moines, Washington - A City of Pioneers\rDes Moines, Washington is a city of pioneers - pioneers like John Moore, who was the first known nonnative to settle here, and medical pioneer Dr. Barney Clark, who received the first artificial heart transplant. Bordered on the west by the Puget Sound, the community has always had a maritime orientation, serving as a focal point for the area.\r\rEarly Des Moines was seen by the Native American Indians, who followed the stream beds to catch spawning salmon and dig for clams; by British naval Captain George Vancouver during his 1792 explorations; by explorers from the Hudson\\'s Bay Company in 1824; and by American explorer Charles Wilkes in 1841. The first Des Moines homestead claim certificate was granted to John Moore in 1872. In 1889 the plat of the Town of Des Moines was recorded and lots sold like hot cakes. In 1890, the Des Moines News described the city as \"The best and most prosperous city on Puget Sound.\" By the 1900\\'s Puget Sound was a busy waterway, providing transportation, food and recreation. World War I brought summer visitors, many building large homes here. The dock was enlarged to accommodate a ferry run between Vashon Island and Des Moines, allowing island farmers to ship their fruits to the canneries in the valley.\r\rFood and recreation were the main attractions in the 1920\\'s and 1930\\'s. Des Moines Beach Park and Salt Water Park were developed. During and after World War II, the population grew and businesses boomed, leading to formal incorporation as a City in 1959 and the eventual construction of a marina and pier.\r\rDes Moines continues to expand and change with time.

The Dorsch Gallery represents South Florida artists who work in sculpture, painting, sound art, new media and performance. The gallery has also hosted many cultural events such as film festivals, concerts, and dance performances. The result is an atmosphere that brings together ideas from the wide variety of arts available in South Florida, nurtures the conceptual and aesthetic development of its artists, and offers a glimpse of diversity to its visitors.\rThe Gallery was originally located in a second floor loft apartment off of Coral Way and SW 13th Avenue in Miami, in the historic Parkway Drugs building. This small 500 square foot venue was the host to the first solo exhibitions for many of Miami\\'s artists in the early 1990\\'s. The gallery was well known for giving artists thier first exhibitions and the gallery soon developed a large underground folowing. In January of 2000 the Gallery moved to a large 7000 square foot warehouse in Wynwood, one of the first galleries in the area, along with Locust Projects and the Bernice Stienbaum Gallery, and down the street from the Rubell Family Collection and the Marguiles Warehouse.\r\rThe Gallery is currently open year-round and has a solid inventory of works by over 20 artists.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.dorschgallery.com%5C'\">www.dorschgallery.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683depi3x6v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.197978,25.79986]}},{"properties":{"name":"Doryman's Inn","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 2102 W.

To this end, the observatory has installed an Internet-capable videoconferencing unit, allowing an impressive network of astronomy experts and former astronauts to interact with students in real time inside classrooms nationwide.\r\rLocally, hundreds of children are thrilled as they see the sun, moon, planets, and stars firsthand during telescope viewings. Each year Dyer hosts thousands of visitors through school tours, observation nights, scout events and other community programs. These groups have access to Dyer\\'s extensive astronomy library as well as a computer center featuring astronomy software, and a mission control center where telescopes around the country are controlled robotically.\r\rThe observatory also partners with organizations such as NASA and the National Science Foundation to connect Dyer\\'s outreach efforts with the space research programs they sponsor. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.dyer.vanderbilt.edu%5C'\">www.dyer.vanderbilt.edu</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decde0zx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.804701,36.052542]}},{"properties":{"name":"E &amp; S Art Gallery &amp; Framing","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 108 S 10th St, Louisville, KY, United StatesE &amp; S Art Gallery &amp; Framing<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deeduvnb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.766511,38.257501]}},{"properties":{"name":"EF Education Building","description":"Posted by Baobot1 Education St., Cambridge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dek98qug"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.070746,42.369445]}},{"properties":{"name":"EST home harbour","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_2059.jpg\">Espoo<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decy1ktj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[24.666666,60.216667]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eagle Point High School","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 203 N Platt St, Eagle Point, OR<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dei3zvp9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.806732,42.469978]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eagles Club/The Rave/Eagles Ballroom","description":"Posted by Baobot2401 W.

Its mission:\r\rDo Jump engages audiences and students using extremely physical theater, music and the unexpected to awaken the senses and inspire a feeling of possibility and awe.\r\rIn 1983 Lane and company renovated the historic Echo Theatre, a former silent-movie house, creating what has become an important focus of arts and culture in southeast Portland.  The very next year saw the founding of the Do Jump Movement Theater School, teaching Do Jumpâs unique style of movement.  Classes encourage physical confidence, freedom, and grace in a creative environment.\r\rThe company has toured extensively throughout the US and Canada, including extended runs at L.A.âs Geffen Playhouse, New York Cityâs New Victory Theater, and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C.  Artistic Director Robin Lane has designed large-scale spectacles for events such as the Nike World Masters Games, the opening of Portlandâs west side light rail, and for ArtQuake, Torontoâs Winterfest 2003, Portlandâs Rose Festival parade, Contemporary Crafts, the opening of the Pacific Northwest College of the Arts, and the opening of the Western Culinary Instituteâs new facilities.\r\rDo Jumpâs tours, like all of its shows, are as flexible as a Do Jump performer.  From a \"no tech\" show in a school gymnasium to an aerial extravaganza on Broadway, Do Jump can fit any bill.\r\rFrom the companyâs inception, Laneâs vision for Do Jump has been consistent: Do Jumpâs performances are a provocative blend of dance, acrobatics, aerial work, humor and original music that celebrate creativity and community.\r\rDO JUMP! is a 501(C)3 non-profit organization.

Halsey St., Troutdale, OR, United StatesAs hard as it may be to believe today, Edgefield, built in 1911, served for several decades as the Multnomah County Poor Farm. Residents operated a self-sufficient environment, raising hogs, poultry, growing a variety of fruits and vegetables, operating a dairy, cannery and meat packing plant as well as working in the laundry, kitchen and hospital.\r\rIn 1947, it was renamed the Multnomah County Home and Farm and in the late fifties the farm operation was eliminated. In 1962, the facility was renamed Edgefield Manor and for the last two decades of operation, functioned as a nursing home and eventually closed in 1982.\r\rMcMenamins purchased the property from Multnomah County in 1990. In phases lasting over four years, the condemned buildings and land were transformed into a unique European-style village, including lodging, a pub with a movie theater, fine dining, a winery, a brewery, distillery, golf course, gardens, vineyards, artwork, meeting, wedding and banquet space, and special events year round.\r\rThe historic Georgian-revival style Manor dominates the village atmosphere and is surrounded by numerous smaller buildings that now share a role in entertaining visitors. Local artists showcase their artwork on doors, walls, and ceilings celebrating the history of Edgefield and the Columbia Gorge. The sculpted grounds and gardens tie the 25 acres together, making Edgefield a warm, relaxing and enchanting place to visit.\r\rFor more information on the history of the poor farm, Edgefield offers a fantastic book called \"Vintage Edgefield - A History of the Multnomah County Poor Farm and McMenamins Edgefield.\" Written by local historian, Sharon Nesbitt, the book combines factual history with humor and is incredibly entertaining and is available for purchase at our Online Shop. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dej1gl1o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.407991,45.538515]}},{"properties":{"name":"Edgewater Hotel","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 666 Wisconsin Ave., Madison, WI<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683delbs37v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.389729,43.079104]}},{"properties":{"name":"Edgmont Country Club","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_5836_primary.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 5180 West Chester Pike, Newtown Square, PA, United StatesEdgmont Country Club, established in 1963, is a private non-equity 18 hole golf club located in northern Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

Nestled in the expansive Evergreen State Fairgrounds in Monroe, Wash., the stately race track has a solid record of vigorous attendance and support from the surrounding community. Much of the track\\'s success can be attributed to its unique design, which combines a 5/8-mile paved outer oval with a 3/8-mile inner oval, a 1/5-mile oval, a 1/8-mile drag strip, and a figure-eight track. The unification of the five venues within view of the 7500-seat covered, and additional 7500-seat modular grandstands has created a flexible Motorsports arena offering a diverse entertainment product to the fan base.\r\rDubbed \"The Superspeedway of the West\" by NASCAR racing legend David Pearson, the track\\'s outer oval provides an exciting, high-speed playing field for some of NASCAR\\'s top touring divisions, while the smaller ovals and figure-eight track render a perfect venue for weekly NASCAR events.\r\rIn 1978, the helm of Evergreen Speedway was transferred to International Productions, Inc., owned and operated by the Beadle family. In the nineteen years that have followed, Bob, Dorothy, John, Bobbie, Mickey, and Lyn Beadle have dedicated their lives to the success of the beloved track and to the health of automobile racing in the Pacific Northwest.\r\rIn 1984, International Productions signed the prestigious Winston Racing Series sanctioning agreement with NASCAR, creating an alliance between the largest sanctioning body in the world and the largest speedway in the northwest. Over the past twenty years, International Productions has distinguished itself as an innovator in the promotions business.\r\rWith northwestern racing fans hungry for a big NASCAR stockIMAGE about05.gifcar race in their own backyard, Evergreen Speedway hosted the inaugural \"Motorcraft 500\" -- a 500-lap NASCAR Winston West Series race -- in July of 1985. For the region, it was the largest event in the history of NASCAR and over the years attracted some of the sport\\'s top drivers, including Bill Elliott, Geoff Bodine, Sterling Marlin, Harry Gant, Ken Schrader, Derrike Cope, and the late Davey Allison. Moving with the trends of the industry, International Productions recognized the surging support for the NASCAR REB-CO Northwest Tour, and responded by developing and promoting the 250-lap \"Coors Light 250\", the longest event for the series.\r\rIMAGE about04.gifIn 1995, Evergreen Speedway landed on the schedule of the inaugural NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series season. With the national touring series came live television and radio coverage, exponential return on investments for Evergreen Speedway sponsors and a new, exciting entertainment product for the track\\'s thousands of patrons. With 50 racing events scheduled for 1998--including the May 9th NASCAR NAPACARD 200 Craftsman Truck Series clash, the August 15th Coors Light 200 NASCAR Winston West, the July 18th 200-lap NASCAR REB-CO Northwest/ Southwest Tour Shootout event, and weekly Saturday night NASCAR Winston Racing Series Super Stock, Street Stock, Mini Stock, Bomber and Figure-Eight shoot-outs (rain or shine!) --Evergreen Speedway will be a destination of choice for nearly two hundred thousand Seattle Area race fans. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.evergreenspeedway.com%5C'\">www.evergreenspeedway.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683declrq6g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.990702,47.867912]}},{"properties":{"name":"Evos Arts Institute","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 98 Middle St., Lowell, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683derfofk9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.310855,42.645168]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ewing Manor and Cultural Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 48 Sunset Rd., Bloomington, IL, United States\r\rEwing Manor, located on the Sunset Hill estate of the late Hazle Buck Ewing, sits majestically in the wooded landscape at the northwest corner of Towanda Avenue and Emerson Street in Bloomington, Illinois.

Featuring a world-class collection of artifacts, unique architecture by Frank O.

EMP is dedicated to capturing and reflecting the essence of rock \\'n\\' roll, from its roots in jazz, soul, gospel, country and the blues, to its influence on hip hop, punk and other more recent genres. EMP invites visitors to participate in a total sensory experience: see rare artifacts and memorabilia, hear musicians tell their stories, or play an instrument and create your own music. Learning about music has never been so much fun.\r\rThe Inspiration\r\rEMP was conceived by Paul G. Allen and Jody Patton. Paul Allen\\'s early passion for Jimi Hendrix led to his amassing of the world\\'s largest collection of Hendrix memorabilia, and later, his desire to share that collection with the public. Early planning soon gave way to a broader cultural mission for both Paul and Jody ?? to create a destination for celebrating musical innovation and for inspiring young and old to feel moved by music ?? and so Experience Music Project was born.\r\rEMP\\'s collection includes more than 80,000 artifacts that helped shape music history, including musical instruments (from one of the first electric guitars to those used by artists such as Bob Dylan, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters and Kurt Cobain), an extensive recorded sound archive, film, photographs, fanzines from around the world, stage costumes, handwritten song lyrics and rare song sheets. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.emplive.org%5C'\">www.emplive.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deervrbh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.20322,47.678908]}},{"properties":{"name":"Exploris Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 201 East Hargett Street, Raleigh, NC, United StatesThe mission of the Exploris Museum is to connect North Carolinians of all ages with the world around them by inspiring interest in our ever-evolving global society and how it touches their lives here at home.\r\rWith an emphasis on life-long learning in international education, we create an environment through exhibits, programs, and films, where visitors become better prepared to work, live and prosper in the world today and into the future.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dehwqslh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.636483,35.778169]}},{"properties":{"name":"Expo Center Norte","description":"Posted by BaobotSao Paulo<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decofrcr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-46.630001,-23.53]}},{"properties":{"name":"Expo Hall (Isf)","description":"Posted by Baobot1202 E. 38th St. 38th and Fall Creek, Indianapolis, IN<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683denaapgb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.136942,39.82552]}},{"properties":{"name":"Expocentr' Krasnaya Presnya Fairgrounds","description":"Posted by BaobotMoscow<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deojgeh7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.619998,55.75]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ezekiel Bates Masonic Lodge","description":"Posted by BaobotNorth Main Street, Attleboro<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deoln5ku"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.28762,41.95813]}},{"properties":{"name":"FBI Rock Club #2","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 5920 Hwy 6 Houston, Houston, TX, United StatesFormerly Forgetta\\'Bout It II, FBI Rock Club features a full bar, live music, and a huge dancing area.

The Empire State Building is often visible on a clear day. There is an exhibit area, as well as a gift shop, located in the original Keeper\\'s Quarters. The Fire Island Lighthouse is a perfect place for individuals, families, or groups to visit, any time of year.\r\rLocated within the Fire Island National Seashore, the surrounding area is rich in history, wildlife and activities. In addition to visiting the Lighthouse, you will have an opportunity to enjoy birds, fox and deer or learn about the area\\'s natural history on either a guided or self-guided nature walk. Perhaps you may choose to visit some of the nearby towns on Fire Island, or just relax on the beach.

The FitzGerald family bought and renovated the building in 1980, and since then its reputation for great music in a casual, comfortable, unpretentious atmosphere has grown steadily. Chicago Magazine calls it \"a musical gem,\" and the club has consistently found itself in the top 5 in Chicago polls of favorite venues.\r\rOver the years, we realized that there were a few things that we would like to offer -- good food, an \"away\" room for customers to meet and talk, and a separate space for gatherings and parties. Through the years we acquired the buildings on either side of us, and in 2001 we took the plunge and began to restore them to their original 1920\\'s glory, with the help of the Berwyn Development Corporation.\r\rWe replaced all of the wiring and plumbing, designed and rebuilt storefronts, restored plaster walls and original tin ceilings, refinished the original wood floors and added beautiful art glass windows and period fixtures and finishes. A new mural was painted on the outside west wall facing the club. As a result, we can now offer food in our Roosevelt Grill restaurant and SideBar, and an elegant, intimate private party room. We are very proud of this project, and hope that you\\'ll have a chance to visit and enjoy our new spaces. \r\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.fitzgeraldsnightclub.com%5C'\">www.fitzgeraldsnightclub.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683den4kkd1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.789607,41.865198]}},{"properties":{"name":"Five College Women's Studies Research Center","description":"Posted by Baobot83 College St., South Hadley, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deev7hq4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.577798,42.25285]}},{"properties":{"name":"Five Flags Center","description":"Posted by Baobot405 Main St., Dubuque, IA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deqeiwkd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.665448,42.497663]}},{"properties":{"name":"Five Spot","description":"Posted by Baobot1123 Euclid Ave., Atlanta, GA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dehvaagj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.350196,33.764634]}},{"properties":{"name":"Flamingo","description":"Posted by Baobot16701 S.

Phillip Frost Art Museum, started as a student gallery. Since then, it has grown to achieve official recognition as a major cultural institution of the State for its unprecedented collection of Latin American and 20th century American art, its innovative exhibitions that draw on or enhance the collection, and its unparalleled service to South Florida\\'s diverse audiences.\r\rIn 1999, the museum received accreditation from the American Association of Museums (AAM). From the community, the Frost Art Museum has earned the accolade \"Miami\\'s Best Museum\" (South Florida\\'s New Times, 1996, 1994, 1993). It has assumed a central role in the FIU community and in the cultural life of South Florida as a whole through its mission to serve the broadest audience possible and to deliver all programs and services free of charge.\r\rSince 1977, the museum has been housed in less than 7,000 interior square feet of an FIU administration building located in the heart of the campus. Through its determination to reach \"the broadest audience possible,\" the Frost Art Museum figuratively burst through its walls to create one of the most prestigious outdoor sculpture programs in the US, with 57 monumental works by the stellar sculptors of contemporary world art.\r\rThe community recognizes the Frost Art Museum as the most appropriate home for extraordinary cultural treasures; in 1989, the FIU leadership and the board of the Metropolitan Museum and Art Center ensured the intact survival of this important collection by transferring its ownership to the Frost Art Museum when the private museum closed. Also in 1989, leaders of the exiled Cuban community obtained the transfer of New York\\'s Oscar B. Cintas Foundation Collection to the Frost Art Museum where it serves as a rallying point for a culture in exile.\r\rAlthough limited by space, the Frost Art Museumâs more than 160 exhibitions since 1977 and broad range of educational programs are unparalleled in their quality and the diversity of audiences they serve. Its student and faculty exhibitions, an essential component of the Museum\\'s academic function, show the work of artists who have achieved significant state and national recognition, including NEA, Guggenheim and Florida Visual Artist Fellowships.\r\rFrost Art Museum-curated exhibitions, drawn from its own, local and national collections, explore recurrent themes from a contemporary perspective and the native aesthetic expressions of the region\\'s diverse people. Borrowed exhibitions enhance understanding of the Frost Art Museumâs collection, introduce new aesthetic concepts in support of artistic exploration, and connect the Museum to underserved audiences.\r\rThe Frost Art Museum amplifies the impact of its exhibitions with a wide range of regionally unique and nationally recognized educational programs. The Steven and Dorothea Green Critics\\' Lecture Series and the Visiting Artist Series directly connect South Florida\\'s audiences with the most important artists, critics and art historians living today. The Frost Art Museum works with Miami-Dade County Public Schools to deliver interdisciplinary training for teachers and tours that reach more than 12,000 teachers and students annually.\r\rReaffirming its commitment to the excellence of its collections, exhibitions and educational programs, the museum will continue to broaden its base of support, develop a state-of-the-art facility to define new standards in the field, and serve an increasingly larger and more diverse constituency as it enters the millennium. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.fiu.edu%5C'\">www.fiu.edu</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekibw8f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.226311,25.8738]}},{"properties":{"name":"Frye Art Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 704 Terry Ave., Seattle, WA, United StatesThrough its exhibitions, collections, and programs, the Frye Art Museum engages audiences, challenges perceptions, and encourages dialogue about representational art in all its complexities, past and present. Admission to the museum will always be free to the public.\rBorn Oct. 25, 1858 in Davenport, Iowa, Charles was the son of a brick mason who emigrated from Hanover, Germany. Emma Lamp, also of German heritage, was the daughter of a local grain elevator owner. Charles and Emma were married in 1885 in Montana.\r\rCharles and Frank Frye and a friend Charles Bruhn created the Frye-Bruhn Meat Packing Co., in Seattle in 1891. Built on 15 acres of tide flats located in South Seattle near the site of Seahawks Stadium, Frye businesses prospered, sparked by the need for gold mining provisions during the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush. During this time, the payroll grew from 00 a month to more than  million a year. The Frye business expanded to include cattle, sheep, hog, and chicken ranching in several western states, later expanding to include a large scale meat processing plant with retail sales outlets stretching from California to Alaska. During these prosperous times Charles and Emma were able to travel to Europe and collect art.\r\rIt is believed that Charles and Emma purchased their first European painting at the Chicago World\\'s Fair in 1893. Their collection grew to more than 230 works - eventually covering the walls of their large home on Seattle\\'s First Hill from floor to ceiling.\r\rFrye meat processing plant workers,\rcirca 1950\rThroughout the 1920s and 1930s Charles invested in real estate, industry, farms, ranches, gold mines, and oil wells. He built industrial warehouses for firms such as Frigidaire and Buick Motor Co. After purchasing 2,000 acres of land in Monroe, Frye established an industrial scale lettuce farm with processing facilities, six narrow-gauge railroad tracks, and a plant that produced 200 tons of ice per day. The lettuce farm failed financially because of the Depression, but Frye was able to retain the meat packing plant, business investments and the art collection.\r\rOne of the last photos taken of Charles Frye, visiting his fields circa 1930\r\rEmma died in 1934. They had no children and Charles spent his last years alone. In his will, Charles Frye provided for the creation of a free public art museum to house and display his beloved art collection. He died on May 1, 1940, at age 81. The museum, named after both Emma and Charles, opened to the public in 1952. Walser Greathouse was the museum\\'s first director. After Walser\\'s death, Kay, his widow, took over as Director, and maintained that position until she retired in 1993. The Greathouses established the American and Alaskan Collections for the Frye Art Museum. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.fryeart.org%5C'\">www.fryeart.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deeljwuf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.324396,47.606824]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fuel Coffeehouse","description":"Posted by Baobot1037 Park St., Jacksonville, FL<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683derq9gzk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.68105,30.314315]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fuller Auditorium","description":"Posted by BaobotBlackburn Circle, Gloucester<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683def4i0e1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.660559,42.625039]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fulvio's 1900","description":"Posted by Baobot1900 Harrison St., Hollywood, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683ded05jfz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.145047,26.010388]}},{"properties":{"name":"Funhouse","description":"Posted by Baobot206 5th Ave. N., Seattle, WA, United StatesLocated right inside the shadow cast by the Space Needle, The Funhouse is Seattle\\'s oldest surviving punk rock club.

GableStage/FST has won critical acclaim for its artistic excellence and has been recognized through numerous Carbonell Awards. GableStage year-round programming includes main stage productions - among which are recent contemporary plays and educational theatre programs that include Shakespeare and the Classics.\r\rFrom 1983 through 1987, we performed the plays of William Shakespeare in repertory outdoors using the Casino Gardens at Vizcaya as its venue. From 1987 until Hurricane Andrew in 1992, our home was the Minorca Playhouse in Coral Gables. The fury of Hurricane Andrew decimated the playhouse, including the theatre, rehearsal hall, 5000 square foot set construction and costume workshops and storage areas. Yet, it did not destroy the theatre\\'s mission. We continued to produce the finest classical and contemporary theatre at the Carousel Theater in Coral Gables during 1993-94.\r\rOn the heels of that season, we were invited to discuss establishing the theatre\\'s new home at the historic Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. The exceptional efforts of many dedicated individuals and our community\\'s dynamic corporate leadership made that dream a reality: A distinctive theatre amid the exquisite splendor and grace of the Biltmore has become the theatre\\'s permanent home. The 1999 season welcomed a renewed vision, with Producing Artistic Director Joseph Adler (now in his 7th Season) and a new name for the theatre, GableStage.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.gablestage.com%5C'\">www.gablestage.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demdtt5z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.278947,25.741493]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gables Diner","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2320 Galiano St., Coral Gables, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dep1r92s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.256745,25.750928]}},{"properties":{"name":"Galanga","description":"Posted by Baobot2389 Wilton Dr., Wilton Manors, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deshm0oe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.134717,26.158231]}},{"properties":{"name":"Galaxy Cinema","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 770 Cary Towne Blvd, Cary, NC<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degy4ysz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.757868,35.777087]}},{"properties":{"name":"Galaxy Club","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2808 Commerce St., Dallas, TX<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deolvy7o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.783047,32.783247]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gallery 181","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 181 Canal St., Lawrence, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683def3vl5a"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.153339,42.70649]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gallery 79","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 79 Newbury St., Boston, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dendrity"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.074436,42.351783]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gallery A3","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 28 Amity St., Amherst, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683denu3eq2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.52028,42.375849]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gallery Bershad","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 99 Dover St, Somerville, MA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683def1t9d9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.124238,42.396292]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gallery Hatch Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 325 Lafayette Rd, Hampton, NH, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degwuqem"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.838388,42.937566]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gallery M2","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 325 West 19th, Houston, TX, United StatesThe mission of M2 is to help promote artists and their work in an atmosphere conducive to their needs.

Genesee St., Waukegan, IL, United StatesAfter sitting vacant for twelve years, the Genesee Theatre began its 3 million renovation in July of 2001 as part of the City of Waukegan\\'s downtown renovation project. With the help of over 120 volunteers, the Genesee was brought back to its original splendor. Every care was taken in the restoration to ensure the integrity of this great venue. All wall fabrics in the facility are exact replicas of the original wallpaper and coloring in the facility has been recreated as exactly as possible based on existing paint chippings. Many of the original plaster moldings, wooden railings and light fixtures have been kept intact. The marquee, installed on September 2, 2004, is an exact replica of the one which graced the Genesee in 1927.\r\rNow an 115,000 sq. ft. state of the art facility, the Genesee has expansive lobbies and lounges, stage size has been doubled and a balcony expansion has raised seating capacity to over 2,400, making the Genesee Theatre one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region. In addition, to ensure that there is no question to the splendor of this facility, a one-of-a-kind, 18 foot, Baccarat crystal chandelier has been added to the grand lobby. The chandelier, which originally hung in Seattle\\'s Orpheum theatre, is valued at 50,000 and weighs 2,200 pounds, includes thousands of pieces of crystal and features gold plated sconces. Kept in boxes since 1967, the chandelier was sold for only 00,000 to the Genesee Theatre by Mr. Louis Bianchi, and the remaining 50,000 was donated to the renovation efforts.\r\rThe Genesee Theatre re-opened its doors on December 3, 2004 to two sold out performances of Bill Cosby, and will continue to provide the highest quality of performances including comedians, Broadway productions and national and regional musical acts. The Genesee Theatre is located in downtown Waukegan, originally a commercial port city and later an industrial center; it is now the seat of Lake County. Within short distance to Chicago and Milwaukee, and home to a culturally rich and diverse population, the city is poised for a dramatic comeback.\r\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.geneseetheatre.com%5C'\">www.geneseetheatre.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683depa3r2r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.831314,42.362424]}},{"properties":{"name":"Genesis Convention Center","description":"Posted by Baobot1 Genesis Center Plaza, Gary, IN, United StatesThe New Millennium has been a remarkable time of growth, change and revitalization in the City of Gary.

Flagler St., Miami, FL, United StatesOlympia Theater first opened in February 1926 as a silent movie palace and amazed the public with its stunning Moorish architecture, perfect acoustics and simulated night sky - complete with rolling clouds and twinkling stars.  The theater achieved notoriety as the first air-conditioned building in the South.  The Olympia Theater at Gusman  Center for the Performing Arts owes its distinctive character to architect John Eberson, the master of âatmosphericâ theater design and it is one of the few Eberson buildings still standing.  Philanthropist Maurice Gusman saved the theater from demolition and donated it to the City of  Miami in 1975.  After extensive renovation, overseen in part by famed architect Morris Lapidus, the Olympia Theater at Gusman  Center for the Performing Arts is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Cultural icons such as Elvis Presley, Sarah Vaughan and Luciano Pavarotti have provided memorable evenings under the Gusman stars.  Today, Maximum Dance Company, Florida Philharmonic and the Miami International Film Festival call the theater their home. \r---gusmancenter<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedlckps"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.190733,25.774266]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gutman Library,  Harvard University","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Appian Way, Cambridge, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dei0375u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.12098,42.37596]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gwinnett Center Arena","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_6917_primary.jpg\">6400 Sugarloaf Pkwy., Duluth, GA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683denxcj7v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.088779,33.989867]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gypsy","description":"Posted by Baobot625 NW. 21st St., Portland, OR, United StatesThe Gypsy offers a retro lounge atmosphere perfect for office, cocktail, and birthday parties.

Evans St., McMinnville, OR, United StatesOn McMinnville\\'s charming, old main street, Hotel Oregon strikes an inviting pose -- as it has since 1905. With practically a century of history under its belt, the Hotel has plenty of stories to tell. The building has welcomed many thousands at various times during its rich history to enjoy its restaurant, lounge, dance spot, bus depot, Western Union office, beauty parlor, soda fountain, and lodging rooms.\r\rMcMenamins has created a living history, by naming the lodging rooms after the colorful and worthy cast of characters who shaped this exceptional place.\r\rThe 1950\\'s were a particularly \"musical\" time for the hotel, as reflected in a couple of the rooms you may book today. Room 306 pays respect to Heck Harper, whose country-and-western band played the Hotel\\'s lounge several times during that decade. Meanwhile, the room we call \"Wayne the Singing Chef,\" room 401, is dubbed so after the Hotel Oregon\\'s kitchen wizard, who would often remove his apron to pick up the microphone to entertain in the lounge.\r\rFor those who like to go back even further in history, one room is named after the Amazing Louis la Bonte, a French-Canadian fur trapper who settled near McMinnville in 1830.\r\rAs you enjoy the many period appointments and fixtures at the hotel, as well as the historic photographs that grace the walls, you\\'ll see why, for a century, the hotel has been considered a particularly warm and comfortable place to get away -- and relax!\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dektgodc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.194449,45.210148]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel Regina","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Place des Pyramides 2, Paris<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683desczgvi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.332237,48.863938]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel Rey Juan Carlos","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Barcelona<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683derf1kam"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.169919,41.387917]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotel Strudlhof","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> Pasteurgasse 1, Vienna<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deg3ghpf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.358204,48.221675]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hotwire Online Coffeehouse","description":"Posted by Baobot17551 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decepkhl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.313479,47.756227]}},{"properties":{"name":"Houge Park","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> White Oaks Drive and Twilight Drive, San Jose<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deftn61h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.94396,37.25636]}},{"properties":{"name":"Houghton Library","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Harvard University, Cambridge, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deqlxhx7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.117285,42.378355]}},{"properties":{"name":"Houma-Terrebonne Civic Center","description":"Posted by Baobot346 Civic Center Blvd., Houma, LA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683del98j7b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.725407,29.577601]}},{"properties":{"name":"House Theatre of Chicago","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 4700 N.

By providing its customers with an outstanding entertainment experience reminiscent of the best of New Orleans, Howl at the Moon has attracted a diverse and loyal following in every market that it has entered. The focal point of the nightclub is a stage featuring a pair of baby grand pianos. The piano players are the ringmasters responsible for creating the excitement that characterizes a night at Howl at the Moon. These piano players are hand picked from the finest regional talent and are thoroughly trained to continually thrill and entertain the audience. Howl at the Moon strives to keep their shows fresh with a mainstream and recognizable format that allows their typical customer to sing along with 90% of the songs.\r\rHowl at the Moon\\'s piano players take the stage two at a time. The entertainers play for one hour and then yield the stage to two new players. At the changeover, all four piano players stay on stage for what is known as a \"four-way.\" The four-way occurs at the end of each hour and lasts for two to three songs. This hourly encore allows the piano players to incorporate additional instruments (drums, guitar, and saxophone) into the performance. The four-way raises the energy of the room and provides a defined transition between the piano player shifts.\r\rAdditionally, during every hour the Howl at the Moon entertainers engage in \"Showtime.\" During this act, all Howl service employees join in and lead the audience through a choreographed routine to animated versions of popular tunes that include nostalgic TV shows and commercial jingles. The audience participation approaches 100% during Showtime and is enhanced by the high energy level of the live music.\r\rHowl at the Moon is a total entertainment experience where the piano players and staff do not only entertain the guests; the guests become part of the show. The customers tend to be a diverse group comprised of guests of all ages. The regular clientele of Howl at the Moon is enhanced by traveling business people and conventioneers. Howl at the Moon is a hot spot for birthdays, anniversaries, and other celebrations.\r---howlatthemoon<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683des78f0y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.202651,47.674074]}},{"properties":{"name":"Howlin' Wolf","description":"Posted by Baobot907 S.

dedicated solely to powerboat racing. Formed in 1983, our mission is to preserve and exhibit important artifacts from the sport of hydroplane racing. The museum features an incredible collection of vintage hydroplanes spanning seven decades, including boats that have won 17 Gold Cups.\r\rThe Hydroplane and Raceboat Museum is also the nation\\'s primary resource for historical and educational information on hydroplane racing. Our extensive collection of books, magazines, race programs, newspaper, photos, trophies, and other memorabilia dates back to the turn of the last century. We have over 200 hours of rare, vintage racing films transferred to videotape, covering hydroplane racing for the 1940s to the present.\r\rThe stories of famous drivers are here as well. Legendary Bill Muncey, Ron Musson, Mira Slovak, \"Wild\" Bill Cantrell and other past drivers are featured, plus information on many of the top modern drivers, including Chip Hanauer.\r\rIn addition to great archives on the the history of hydroplanes, our museum is also a fully equipped boat restoration shop. Over the years, we have restored seven of the most famous Gold Cup and Harmsworth winners to full running condition. They include the Miss America VIII (1929 and \\'31 Harmsworth winner); Slo-mo-shun IV (1950, \\'52, and \\'53 Gold Cup winner); Slo-mo-shun V (1951 and \\'54 Gold Cup winner); Hawaii Kai III replica (1958 Gold Cup winner); Miss Thriftway (1961 and \\'62 Gold Cup winner); the legendary \"Green Dragon\" Miss Bardahl and the 1967 Miss Budweiser. Most important, these great hulls have been restored by Museum members, people like you who loved the boats and simply could not see them fade away.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.thunderboats.org%5C'\">www.thunderboats.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demqhx0f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.259029,47.426696]}},{"properties":{"name":"I-X Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> One I-X Center Drive, Cleveland, OH<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683delxkcde"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.687506,41.430762]}},{"properties":{"name":"I/O Lounge","description":"Posted by Baobot30 NE 14th St., Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demivq0u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.193433,25.788287]}},{"properties":{"name":"IBM/Hitachi","description":"Posted by Baobot5600 Cottle Road building 50/B1, San Jose, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degcimm9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.803907,37.249729]}},{"properties":{"name":"IDS - Istitute for Development Studies","description":"Posted by BaobotBrighton, United Kingdom<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683der730hj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.139901,50.820723]}},{"properties":{"name":"IEEE PerCom","description":"Posted by BaobotNew York<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dely8ek3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.006389,40.714167]}},{"properties":{"name":"IFES Portuguese Hall","description":"Posted by BaobotMountain View<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo158xa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.082778,37.386111]}},{"properties":{"name":"IFES Portuguese Hall","description":"Posted by Baobot432 Stierlin Road, Mountain View<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demplnk2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.078095,37.399971]}},{"properties":{"name":"ITC Hotel Maurya Sheraton &amp; Towers","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> New Delhi<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dep1pp2z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[77.205824,28.63769]}},{"properties":{"name":"Icarus","description":"Posted by Baobot3 Appleton St., Boston, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deks2wz0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.069625,42.346504]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ice Box Cafe","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 1657 Michigan Ave., Miami Beach, FL, United StatesArgentine-born chef Andrea Landini\\'s menu rotates daily among eight or so starters and a dozen entrees, but there are some standards.

But Dr. Frank Damrosch (photo, right), the godson of Franz Liszt and the head of music education for New York City\\'s public schools, was convinced that American musicians should not have to go abroad for their training. Damrosch and his financial backer, James Loeb, modestly planned for 100 students, but found that they had greatly underestimated the demand for high-quality musical training. The School quickly outgrew its original home at Fifth Avenue and 12th Street, and, in 1910, moved to new quarters on Claremont Avenue.\r\rBut the Institute is only half the story of what is now The Juilliard School; Augustus D. Juilliard and the Juilliard Graduate School are the other half. When Mr. Juilliard, a wealthy textile merchant, died in 1919, his will contained the largest single bequest for the advancement of music at that time. In 1924, the trustees of that bequest founded the Juilliard Graduate School to help worthy music students complete their education. In 1926, the Graduate School and the Institute of Musical Art merged as the Juilliard School of Music under one president, the distinguished Columbia University professor John Erskine, but with separate deans and identities. Damrosch continued as the Institute\\'s dean, and Ernest Hutcheson was appointed dean of the Graduate School. In 1937, Hutcheson succeeded Erskine as president of the combined institutions. (Juilliard\\'s Evening Division â originally the Extension Division â was begun in 1933, offering continuing education for adults.)\r\rComposer William Schuman, later to win the first Pulitzer Prize for music, became president of the combined schools in 1945. Under his administration, the merger process of the schools was completed. Schuman established the Dance Division in 1951 with Martha Hill (photo, left) as its first director. He also established the Juilliard String Quartet in 1946, the School\\'s teaching and performance quartet-in-residence. And in 1947 he created an innovative music theory curriculum, called Literature and Materials of Music (known as L&amp;M), that changed the manner in which music was taught throughout the United States. He resigned in 1961 to become president of the newly constructed Lincoln Center.\r\rDr. Peter Mennin, another well-known composer, was Schuman\\'s successor. In 1968 Mennin created a Drama Division â with John Houseman as its first director and Michel Saint-Denis as consultant â and oversaw the move of Juilliard to Lincoln Center in 1969. The School changed its name to The Juilliard School to reflect its broader artistic scope. With the move also came the creation of the current Pre-College Division, offering intensive musical instruction to talented youngsters from 8 to 18. (Music lessons for young students had been provided through Juilliard\\'s Preparatory Division since 1916.)\r\rAfter Mennin\\'s death in 1983, Dr. Joseph W. Polisi (photo, below) became the School\\'s sixth and current president, beginning with the 1984-85 academic year. Dr. Polisi\\'s term at Juilliard has been a time of vitality for the School, with the establishment of new student services, alumni programs, a revised curriculum, a new emphasis on the humanities and liberal arts, and the realization of two major goals: the completion of its first residence hall - the Meredith Willson Residence Hall - which opened in 1990, and the establishment of a jazz program - the Institute for Jazz Studies (a collaboration of The Juilliard School and Jazz at Lincoln Center) - which began in September 2001. This period of growth also has seen enhanced student and faculty financial support; the creation of an exchange program with Columbia University and Barnard College; a new emphasis on community outreach; creation of a CD-ROM to teach music to children; and a schoolwide initiative to develop interdisciplinary programs involving actors, dancers, and musicians.\r\rDuring Dr. Polisi\\'s tenure, the Juilliard Orchestra has performed in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, France, and Bermuda, and participated, in 1992, as the Evian Festival\\'s resident ensemble. In addition, Dr. Polisi has led the process of developing a comprehensive long-range plan for the School that has resulted in a 50 million capital campaign dedicated to enhancing student financial aid and faculty compensation, as well as the development of schoolwide programs that will prepare Juilliard students for the demands of the 21st cent<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dehv6p37"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.930177,40.806859]}},{"properties":{"name":"Julie Ince Thompson Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 536 Mass.

But when you visit Kaz Winery, you??ll experience the benefits of small and intimate and you??ll make new friends in Rick and his wife, Sandi, two of the friendliest winery owners in the Sonoma Valley. You??ll go away convinced theirs is the way wineries should be.\r\rRick wears all the hats from a vineyard visor to a cellar cap that covers his wild hair to a French beret on the ??I??m a Kazoholic? poster in the tasting room. He picks, punches, tastes and tests. He blends and bottles and brags. He has a lot to brag about. Kaz Winery??s 1000 annual cases sell out, sometimes before Rick changes hats to design the crazy, hand-tinted labels that give you a glimpse of his family??s past.\r\rOne of Rick??s earliest memories is himself at age 3, toddling behind his German Great-Aunt Hattie while she tended her organic garden. He remembers fascination with farming even then, the scents of turned earth and fresh vegetables and pungent manure nourishing roots, raspberries big as boulders and fruit trees heavy with bounty.\r\r??Hattie had all kinds of amazing things growing in her garden,? said Rick. ??She was an organic farmer, using only natural practices, composts; no chemicals. She was always very aware of nature and from the time I was a small child she set the tone for how I wanted to grow everything. She was the only one in the family that said I??d have a farm someday. I named my tractor after her.?\r\r??Tractor Hattie? went to work in 1986 when Rick and Sandi bought the Sonoma acreage, cleared and planted, leaving existing walnut trees to flourish in the vineyard rows. A commercial photographer at the time, Rick balanced camera and classes at U. C. Davis, focusing on organic farming practices in his vineyards with the intention of producing at an amateur level like he did in his younger, garage grape-smashing days when all the neighbors laughed at him. The first vintage was 1994 and by ??96 he was hooked.\r\r??I loved it,? said Rick. ??I also love different areas of the world and have fun making wines of different styles like Sangiovese and Rhone blends. I was blending grapes that nobody would blend, doing it for flavor like the Europeans have always done. There are no stainless steel tanks here. The wine is made in a very old-world style.?\r\rAt Kaz, you can be a part of the process. When equipment is strewn all over the front of the winery, expect to punch down the cap during fermentation or get out of the way. Kaz also has great, affordable hands-on workshops of 12 or fewer people, open to wine club members first then the public. Workshops cover what Rick calls ??vineyard stuff? like picking during harvest, skimming skins or pushing caps. Kids are welcome.\r\r??We??re extremely kid-friendly. We have playdough and coloring books for kids at the picnic tables out by the Coy Pond. They can play croquet on the lawn and we always have organic juice for them. People should feel comfortable bringing kids here and make it a family outing. In fall, kids can pick pumpkins from the pumpkin patch.?\r\rFrom the opened-armed welcome at Kaz to the wild labels on bottles, you can tell Rick Kasmier thinks wine is not stuffy. He believes people take wine just a little too seriously. ??Even in Europe, wine is just to accompany food,? he said. ??It??s not to get a big rating in the Spectator.?\r\rVisit Kaz Vineyards and Winery, kick off your shoes and sip a little fun with a self-proclaimed wacky winemak<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deniz005"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.554968,38.427689]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kazimierz World Wine Bar","description":"Posted by Baobot7137 E Stetson Drive, Scottsdale, AZ, United StatesKazimierz Wine bar features comfortably plush sofas &amp; chairs in vineyard colors, stone walls softened by candlelight; wooden wine casks evoke the feel of a European wine cave; subtle lighting; interesting mix of jazz, latin &amp; world beat music at levels that don\\'t strain conversation.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dessq4zu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.927579,33.499293]}},{"properties":{"name":"Keefe Auditorium, Elm Street Junior High School,","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Nashua<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deqy445y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.468056,42.765278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Keller Auditorium","description":"Posted by Baobot222 SW.

Over the years, thousands of kids have congregated here to decipher the three Rs, eat macaroni and cheese on Mondays, and climb hand over hand up the gym rope to ring the bell.\r\rWhen built, Kennedy Elementary School\\'s location was rather remote; it stood three blocks beyond the end of the nearest street car line. And that line, which came out Northeast Alberta Street, passed through some pretty sparse country, judging from an ordinance that outlawed the shooting of rabbits from the street car.\r\rAlso, the school was just eight blocks from the city line, then set at Northeast 42nd Avenue -- and in those early years, the numerous Kennedy students residing beyond that boundary lived without electricity, water, sewer and telephones.\r\rActually, the first elementary school classes were held on the school grounds in portable, one-room buildings in 1913, two years before the present-day school building was built and opened. Just 29 children attended that first year.\r\rAs decades passed, the school took on additional civic roles, further endearing it to its neighbors. When school was not in session, \"Kennedy\" served the community as a public meeting hall, polling place, Red Cross blood drawing center, collection site for paper &amp; tin can drives, weekend playground, and even flood-relief shelter.\r\rIt was a sad day indeed when at the end of the 1974-75 school year, school officials, faced with declining enrollment throughout the district, closed Kennedy, declaring it too old and crumbling to repair.\r\rScrambling to ward off several demolition orders, a coalition of neighbors, former students, past PTA presidents, and the Portland Development Commission fought successfully to save the community\\'s center.\r\rMike and Brian McMenamin presented just one of several proposals for reviving the condemned property. Other ideas ranged from a retirement home to an indoor soccer facility. After receiving the approval of the city and the support of the neighborhood, McMenamins launched its renovation in the spring of 1997, infusing the 80 -year-old structure with new life. In particular, a river of artwork was created from the stories of generations of Kennedy\\'s students and teachers.\r\rOn October 22, 1997, the original principal\\'s bell was rung on the front steps at 7 a.m. sharp to herald the old school\\'s new beginning as McMenamins Kennedy School. Offering a unique and fun lodging, dining and meeting experience, Kennedy remains a lively gathering spot for neighbors and newcomers alike.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degxfsb8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.630661,45.564131]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kennedy's Mid-Town","description":"Posted by Baobot42 Province St, Boston<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decen1xy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.059876,42.357107]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kent Historical Society and Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 855 E.

Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, located in West Palm Beach, Florida, is one of the premier performing arts centers in the Southeast with a growing national and international reputation. True to the spirit in which it was created, the Center is expanding programming by initiating projects on local, national and international levels. The world-class Kravis Center opened fully funded, with a total construction cost of 8 million, of which a remarkable 9 million came from private individuals and corporations. The Kravis Center is a success story that provides communities worldwide with an example of a thriving performing arts center and a major community and economic catalyst. Set on 10.6 acres of property at the highest point in the city, the Kravis Center includes three venues -- the 2,193-seat Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr. Concert Hall, the flexible 300-seat Rinker Playhouse and the outdoor Michael and Andrew Gosman Amphitheatre with a capacity for 1,400 patrons. Additionally, the Kravis Center facilities include the Cohen Pavilion, which houses the Weiner Banquet Center meeting and banquet facility and The Picower Foundation Arts Education Center, along with a five-level parking garage.\r\rFall 2005 marks the Center\\'s 14th season and the number of events hosted annually has grown to more than 800, with attendance of more than 500,000 patrons. Many regionally based arts organizations call the Kravis Center their home including Ballet Florida, Miami City Ballet, Palm Beach Broadway Series, Palm Beach Opera, and the Palm Beach Pops. During the 2005-2006 season, the Kravis Center itself will present more than 350 performances featuring acclaimed artists from every discipline. Established as a leading force in the social fabric of the community, its many outreach programs are as broad and varied as the community itself. To date, the Center has opened the door to the performing arts for more than 1 million schoolchildren as well as thousands of economically disadvantaged senior citizens, minorities and community groups. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.kravis.org%5C'\">www.kravis.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deg7gp8o"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.059042,26.706158]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kresge Little Theater","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 48 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deng7cbh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.093425,42.35882]}},{"properties":{"name":"Krystal Nights","description":"Posted by Baobot10855 SW. 72nd St., Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedpzs3y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.334072,25.702355]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kyojin","description":"Posted by Baobot3485 N.

More recent production highlights include the Chicago premiere of Rent, the Tony-Award winning Sweet Smell of Success and the pre-Broadway, world premieres of Billy Joel and Twyla Tharp\\'s Movin\\' Out and Monty Python\\'s Spamalot.\r\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.broadwayinchicago.com%5C'\">www.broadwayinchicago.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deqoa7i7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.628271,41.880732]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lacoste Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 25 Main St., Concord, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decsycdi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.349619,42.460089]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lafayette Cajundome","description":"Posted by Baobot444 Cajundome, Lafayette, LA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deen2cb4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.040093,30.217277]}},{"properties":{"name":"Laguna Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2800 NW Seventh Ave., Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deomhard"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.20726,25.802727]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lahiris","description":"Posted by BaobotEaling, London<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dehsdqlm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.322037,51.507621]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Charles Civic Center Arena","description":"Posted by Baobot900 Lakeshore Dr., Lake Charles, LA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683den4q2t4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.219306,30.228066]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Charles Civic Ctr Rosa Hart Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 900 Lakeshore Dr., Lake Charles, LA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deq1t3cr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.219306,30.228066]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake View Cemetery","description":"Posted by Baobot12316 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, United StatesFounded in 1869, Lake View Cemetery sits on 285 acres of land and was modeled after the great garden cemeteries of Victorian England and France.

At its peak, the LeMay Collection numbered in excess of 3,000 vehicles and thousands of artifacts and was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest privately owned collection in the world; impressive if accomplished by a King, but jaw dropping, awesome when accomplished by a local businessman from Tacoma, Washington.\r\rIn 1998, Harold and Nancy LeMay formed the 501c3 charitable organization, The Harold E. LeMay Museum, and committed themselves to donating the vast LeMay Collection to the Museum for the benefit of the public. The LeMay Museum was chartered to secure, preserve and interpret the valuable LeMay Collection, along with additional vehicles and artifacts that it may acquire, in order to explore the broad themes of American mobility and lifestyle in an instructive and entertaining manner.\r\rThe magnitude of the LeMay Collection, and its power to relate the story of the American experience with the automobile, demands a new paradigm in transportation museums.  The LeMay will be an inviting place, eliciting memories and stories from those who visit. It will provide a venue to explore history, design, technology and restoration. In short, the LeMay will create ??America??s Auto Experience? and become a world-class tourist destination in its own right.\r\rThe exciting design concepts for the future home of the Harold E. LeMay Museum were approved by the Museum??s Board of Directors at their meeting on November 4, 2003. The design for the LeMay Collection??s future home are stunning and present a campus complex that includes: a great pavilion with a tower showcasing 150 of the finest cars in the collection; a concourse capable of presenting 100 cars in displays related to culture, speed, design and technology; galleries for experiential opportunities; a restoration shop; a 3-acre courtyard for shows, auctions and rallies; cafes, retail and entertainment areas; a clubhouse for use by sponsoring car clubs; and most impressively - viewable storage for up to 2,000 automobiles on site! The architects sought to design a public gathering place for fun, exploration and celebration in a building that will become an icon for the world??s foremost auto museum.\r\rThe LeMay Museum has received enthusiastic support from the City of Tacoma, a strong partner which has provided the 9 acre building site next to the Tacoma Dome, valued at nearly 7,500,000. Gensler Architects have worked closely with the Tacoma Dome and City to ensure synergy between the Dome and new Museum. The 3-acre auto courtyard will provide a beautiful environment that will invite leisurely walks and lively car rallies.\r\rNancy LeMay is thrilled with the plans for the Museum??s future home. ??Harold would love the design, the way it suggests a car, and most importantly, that it is designed to become a gathering place for the community. I believe this is a great vision and that we can and will get it done?.\r\rThe museum has poised itself to begin the national campaign to create America??s Car Museum in 2007, enabling the Museum to open its new facility in 2009.

It was the most modern theater of its time, equipped with the \"latest projector equipment\" and a Wurlitzer organ.

The Fir Lodge was one of the first year-round homes built on Alki Beach and was owned by prominent Seattleites, William and Gladys Bernard. Mr. Bernard had established the city??s first soap company, Seattle Soap Co. and his wife Gladys was known for her devotion to children??s charities, especially orphaned children. After several summers of camping at Alki, the Bernards decided to put down permanent roots as year-round residents. In 1902. they announced plans to construct a unique log house combining the attributes of a summer cottage with a thoroughly modern home. The Fir Lodge was typical of the Rustic Style which was popular at the turn of the century. Today, the Fir Lodge survives as the Homestead Restaurant.\r\rThree years after building the Fir Lodge, the Bernards decided to sell their comfortable AIki estate and move back to Seattle. Gladys recalled that it was the separation from the city that made life at Alki difficult. ??Servants were hard to keep because we were so far out,? she said, ??and we couldn??t stay in town at night because the ferry stopped running. When the tide was out we couldn??t come home.? Their young daughter Marie attended a school in Seattle and made a rather lengthy boat commute to school each day. The advent of streetcars made quiet Alki Beach much more accessible to beach-goers, turning the beach into a lively resort area. And Luna Park??s crowds and loud nightlife added to the congestion and to the lack of privacy and tranquility that the once out-of-the-way beach community prized.\r\rIn June 1907, the Fir Lodge was purchased by the Seattle Auto and Driving Club, an organization of auto enthusiasts who planned to use the lodge as a place for their club members to rendezvous after the long drive from Seattle. In subsequent years, it was a boarding house, a Veteran??s home, and finally the Homestead Restaurant. Around 1908, the carriage house was moved from its original location on the estate, approximately 100?? NW of here, (in the center of the street.) It is believed that when the city put in West Seattle??s streets that this building was moved, to make way for Stevens Street. At that time, the foundation was probably added and the building converted from a stable to additional living spaces. The upstairs of the carriage house is believed to have originally been a hayloft and the space above the inside of the front door was its opening.\r\rThis old building ,which is built of douglas fir logs, has been a home to various Alki families for most of the past 90+ years. At one time it even housed an antique store. The carriage house was purchased by the Southwest Seattle Historical Society in 1995, restored, and converted into the Log House Museum. The restoration was made possible through a grass-roots fund raising effort which raised over 75,000. The Log House Museum has been open since November 13,1997, the 146th anniversary of the landing of the Alki party on AIki??s beach. The landscaping is all done with native planting. A granite and marble donor circle adorns the courtyard in tribute to the many people who helped make this heritage project an award-winning facility and a community treasure.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.loghousemuseum.org%5C'\">www.loghousemuseum.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decwyyp5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.410696,47.577636]}},{"properties":{"name":"Logan Square Auditorium","description":"Posted by Baobot2539 N Kedzie Blvd, Chicago, IL, United StatesLogan Square Auditorium is a fully equipped live music venue with a full liquor bar.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683der4z3zx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.706996,41.927381]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lola Seattle","description":"Posted by Baobot2000 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, WA, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683def74l6w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.340158,47.613108]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lola's Room","description":"Posted by Baobot1332 W.

Performing arts residencies offer well-equipped and professionally staffed technical facilities and stages, and a sophisticated, diverse and sympathetic audience for new work â especially technically complex work that requires generous allocations of time and space impossible in conventional theatrical settings. Likewise, MASS MoCA\\'s vast galleries and expert fabrication staff give visual artists the tools and time to create works of scale and duration impossible to realize in the time and space-cramped conditions of most museums. We endeavor to expose our audiences to all stages of art production; rehearsals, sculptural fabrication, and developmental workshops are frequently on view to the public, as are finished works of art.\r\rIf MASS MoCA\\'s mission is to foster and present exciting new work of the highest quality in all media â and in all phases of its production â we also work hard to position the arts as a vibrant catalyst for community revitalization: indeed, the creation of new markets, good jobs and the long-term enrichment of a region in economic need is one of MASS MoCAâs driving purposes. We at MASS MoCA are convinced that advancement of the arts, increased tourism and community participation, and regional economic redevelopment are mutually reinforcing and inextricably linked, and we act forcefully on that belief.

McCaw Hall is the home to Pacific Northwest Ballet, Seattle Opera, community festivals and guest performers from around the world, plus weddings, conventions, receptions, meetings and more!\rMarion Oliver McCaw Hall sits on a remarkable foundation.\r\rHer story begins in 1881 with the last will and testament of saloonkeeper James Osborne, who left 0,000 to the City of Seattle to build a civic auditorium. The private gift was to be matched by public funding in order to build the auditorium, however in 1881 the City??s total operating budget was 0,000. In 1886, David T. and Louisa Denny donated the land in order to help the City build the hall.\r\rThen came the great Seattle fire in 1889, the Gold Rush and WWI ?? placing plans on hold until the time was right.\r\rIn 1927, the time was right and Seattle voters approved a 00,000 bond measure to match the private gifts and build our city??s first Civic Auditorium. Dedicated by Seattle??s only female Mayor, Bertha K. Landes, the vision was the same yesterday as it is today.\r\r??To bring us many cultural advantages and make it possible ?? for high and low, rich and poor to gather here to nourish their souls with the wonder of pageantry.? Bertha K. Landes, 1927\r\rFor the 1962 World??s Fair, a  million public-private renovation changed the 6,000 seat flat-floor auditorium into an opera house with two balconies, rakedracked orchestra seating and updated lobby spaces. However, the technical, mechanical and backstage areas remained unchanged from 1927 through 2001.\r\rToday, we celebrate the success of the third public-private partnership ?? remaining true to the philanthropic vision of James Osborne back in the 1880s and upholding our own values of supporting the arts and creating a community-gathering place for all.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.seattlecenter.com%5C'\">www.seattlecenter.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dee71moh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.348506,47.622078]}},{"properties":{"name":"McCaw Hall: McCaw Hall Allen Room","description":"Posted by Baobot305 Harrison St., Seattle, WA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683derz0nyy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.348506,47.622078]}},{"properties":{"name":"McCaw Hall: McCaw Hall Norcliff Room","description":"Posted by Baobot305 Harrison St., Seattle, WA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejrstvb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.348506,47.622078]}},{"properties":{"name":"McCormick &amp; Schmick's Harborside","description":"Posted by Baobot1200 Westlake Avenue North, Seattle, WA, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683denp1r6e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.340981,47.629997]}},{"properties":{"name":"McCormick &amp; Schmick's Seafood","description":"Posted by Baobot1103 First Avenue, Seattle, WA, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683des1tx1k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.336994,47.605493]}},{"properties":{"name":"McCormick Place","description":"Posted by Baobot2301 S.

Today, it is a vital, thriving McMenamins owned and operated live music palace that hosts everything from rock \\'n\\' roll and country, to hip-hop and big band swing.\r\rTales about the grand hall at N.W. 14th and Burnside cover myriad topics and time periods. The Crystal opened its doors as a ballroom in 1914 (as World War I began), in the days when frisky Portland residents could still be arrested for dancing the Tango. During the Great Depression, \"Dad\" Watson staged popular old-time dance revivals here as a way to raise people\\'s spirits. African American formal dances at the Crystal, because of segregation, were as rare as they were special. Other local folks can regale you with romantic tales of how their dance partner at the Crystal eventually became their spouse.\r\rIn the 1960s, the Crystal was the ultimate rock palace. People still argue about whether it was really Jimi Hendrix whom Little Richard fired in the middle of a performance at the Crystal. It is agreed, however, that bands like the Grateful Dead (twice), Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Country Joe &amp; the Fish, and Buffalo Springfield (with Neil Young and Stephen Stills), and a hundred others thrilled audiences at the big ballroom.\r\rThe procession of legends and legends-to-be has continued since McMenamins reopened the Crystal\\'s doors in 1997. The ballroom has been honored to host celebrated artists such as George Clinton, Dick Dale, James Brown, Michael McDonald, Billy Idol, Gregg Allman, the Wailers, and Robert Cray, as well as contemporary favorites including Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood, Liz Phair, Steve Earle, Nick Cave, the Indigo Girls and Ween.\r\rWhile the action on the stage has always thrilled, one thing everyone remembers about the Crystal is its astounding \"floating\" dance floor. \"Like dancing on clouds,\" is how people describe cutting a rug here. At the time of its construction, the Crystal\\'s mechanical dance floor (now fully restored to proper working order) was said to be unique on the Pacific Coast. Today, it may be the only one left in the United States. You will also appreciate our gorgeous decor: flamboyant wall sconces and light fixtures, grand paintings and gigantic windows everywhere. People who come to the Crystal seem to be inspired by an energy emanating from the site itself, a phenomenon social scientists call \"the power of place.\"\r\rMcMenamins is proud to welcome a whole new generation of fun-lovers and repeat offenders to the renovated, always-happening Crystal Ballroom, and its sister venue, Lola\\'s (one flight down). The Crystal is the only place we know where you can enjoy national, regional, and local bands live while dancing the night away on air.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dertu7pr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.684364,45.522824]}},{"properties":{"name":"Me&amp;Thee Coffeehouse","description":"Posted by Baobot28 Mugford St, Marblehead, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deiyabcf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.850563,42.505678]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meadow Brook Music Festival","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Walton At Adams Rd., Rochester Hills, MI<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dem1131u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.19404,42.68068]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meadowlands Exposition Center","description":"Posted by Baobot355 Plaza Drive, Secaucus, NJ, United StatesIn addition to offering a professional staff of trade show specialists and facilities to match, the Meadowlands Exposition Center is conveniently located just minutes outside of New York City.

He platted and named the town of Puyallup (means generous people), was the towns first mayor and brought electricity and water to the town.  Ezra realized the value of marketing and built a fortune selling hops.  He and his father introduced hops to the Puyallup Valley in the 1880\\'s.   By 1885 Meeker was recognized as the \"Hop King of the World\"!   Imagine from a humble farmer to a person who was recognized worldwide.  This prominence lasted until 1891 when the \"Hop Louse\" decimated the crops.   Hops as a cash crop disappeared in western Washington and so did the Meeker fortune.\r\rEzra dabbled in a  number of enterprises from gold mining in Dawson, dehydrating fruits and vegetables, proposing milk be placed in paper cartons, and many other interests.  He tried to replace hops with sugar beets but could not convince his peers that they would produce as the hops did.\r\rHe began writing with gusto and published a romance novel about coming west.  He was a great friend of the Northwestern Indians.  He wrote about one of the major tragedies of the era.  The Tragedy of Leschi was a book written in sympathy towards the plight of the Indians.  He wrote in particular about the much publicized trial of Indian Chief Leschi.  Meekers other books are Pioneer Reminiscences, Ezra\\'s Short Stories for Children and the The Ox Team and the Old Oregon Trail.\r\rIn 1906 Ezra started at Camp 1 (the front lawn of the Meeker Mansion) to retrace the Oregon Trail and to erect markers along the way.  With very little money he lectured and raised money as he went.  His diaries of that journey are transcribed and will eventually be published by the Ezra Meeker Historical Society scheduled to coincide with the 100th Anniversary of his journey in 2006.  Ezra is the only known pioneer who originally came west and then retraced the Oregon Trail two more times by ox-drawn wagon.  He also retraced portions of the Oregon Trail in a specially built automobile.  He was 94 years young when an opportunity to fly in an open cockpit airplane was presented to him.  He was amazed that he could fly over the trail in less than seven days and it originally took him seven months to come from Independence to Portland.  He is recognized as the Champion of the Oregon Trail, and without his unwavering pursuit to preserve the trail, it would have been obliterated.\r\rTwo years before his death a statue was erected in Pioneer Park in his hometown of Puyallup to recognize all pioneers who traveled across the Oregon Trail.  Meeker died just short of his 98th birthday in December 1928.  Few can match Meeker\\'s accomplishments as a pioneer, historian, author and entrepreneur.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.meekermansion.org%5C'\">www.meekermansion.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deotv3bp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.290307,47.191598]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mellon Arena","description":"Posted by Baobot66 Mario Lemieux Place, Pittsburgh, PA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejz6kjq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.989145,40.441267]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mellwood Art Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1860 Mellwood Ave., Louisville, KY<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deing1va"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.713474,38.263357]}},{"properties":{"name":"Melrose Apartments","description":"Posted by Baobot1 Norris Road, IndiaThis is the location that Dean stays when he is in India<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683desrq8zd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.04358,35.00884]}},{"properties":{"name":"Melrose Unitarian Universalist Church","description":"Posted by Baobot70 West Emerson St., Melrose<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dehdg3b7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.066363,42.458925]}},{"properties":{"name":"Memorial Fieldhouse and Pamplin Sports Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> N. 11th St. and N.

Miami Ave., Miami, FL, United StatesIn 1949, The Junior League of Miami\\'s \"Project Finding Committee\" determined that Dade County\\'s children needed a science museum. The Junior Museum of Miami, a private non-profit organization, was established in 1950 in a house on the corner of Biscayne Boulevard and 26th Street. The Junior Museum expanded so quickly that in 1952 it was forced to move to the Miami Women\\'s Club building on Bayshore Drive. It was then christened the Museum of Science and Natural History.\r\rIn 1953, the Guild of the Museum of Science was formed. Their efforts included volunteer assistance to the staff, operation of the Museum Store, as well as tours and outreach programs.\r\rThe institution, however, again began outgrowing its new space. In response, Mrs. Henry Shaw created a special committee, headed by Mrs. Sydney (Claire) L. Weintraub, which ultimately recommended to the Dade County Commission that it should establish a major independent science museum which could service citizens of all ages.\r\rBy 1960, the first building of the community\\'s new science museum opened its doors. The facility, located on three acres of the historic Vizcaya complex, was built and furnished rent-free by the County.\r\rDuring the same year, the Patrons were formed as the Museum\\'s fundraising arm. They have since developed the outstanding annual \"Around the World Fair\", South Florida Artists Show, Trust Fund and other fundraising activities to provide the museum with continued financial security. The Sponsors, a host committee, were also created in 1960.\r\rLate 1966 saw the construction of a Space Transit Planetarium which soon became the leading facility of its kind in the world. Its activities now include international television programming.\r\rThe next decade, which brought the association of 15 affiliate clubs representing various scientific disciplines, broadened the scope of activities offered and provided an important forum for exchange.\r\rOver the years, additional support groups, such as the Latin American Friends and Orange Bowl Luncheon Committee (formed from representatives of all the volunteers) have stepped forward to meet the institution\\'s increasing financial needs.\r\rIn 1989, the Museum\\'s lease agreement with the County for the Vizcaya site was extended for 99 years.\r\rDuring the last decade, the Museum has expanded to provide space for 4,000 member families, over 250,000 annual visitors, one of the largest summer science camps in the nation (ages 3 to 14) and countless additional exhibits, collections and activities. The yearly operating budget has grown to 2.5 million dollars.\r\rPresent science education needs in South Florida again require expansion of these facilities, which currently total 48,000 square feet.\r\rThrough the years, the Museum has enjoyed the full support of the Metropolitan Dade County Commission, Department of Parks and Recreation and School Board, the City of Miami and the State of Florida.\r\rThough the history of the institution can be charted by the growth of its facility, this story is ultimately one of people. For almost 50 years, the Miami Museum of Science and Space Transit Planetarium has been nurtured by a legion of tireless volunteers and generous contributors. Their abundance of vision and dedication has rarely been equaled by any other civic group in the city\\'s history. Here, the greatness of the accomplishment can be found.   \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.miamisci.org%5C'\">www.miamisci.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683defo0h2c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.210494,25.747317]}},{"properties":{"name":"Miami Seaquarium","description":"Posted by Baobot4400 Rickenbacker Causeway, Key Biscayne, FLIn the early 1940\\'s, Fred D. Coppock and Capt. W.B. Gray recognized the need for an appreciation of our oceans and set forth in designing the first major marine park attraction in South Florida: Miami Seaquarium. Coppock and Grey envisioned a place where people of all ages could experience the fabulous wonders of the ocean. As pioneers of their time, they spent the next ten years developing a bold new facility to care for animals. Finally with its grand opening in 1955, the dream was underway. Over the years, generations have heard the bark of a sea lion, seen the grace and beauty of a dolphin and felt the splash of a mighty Killer Whale.\r\rLocal Miami residents, school groups and tourists from around the world, became fascinated with the experience of looking through a window to the ocean below and seeing its creatures. With this excitement came an increased appreciation and respect for the creatures of the sea, which led to a national desire to protect them. Miami Seaquarium expanded its mission statement to include the rescue and rehabilitation of sick and wounded animals, and the subsequent release of these animals back into the wild. Furthermore, the park began its on-going campaign to save the endangered Florida Manatee from extinction. As a result, Miami Seaquarium has become a world leader in the biology and medical treatment of these gentle giants.\r\rToday, Miami Seaquarium continues to be the number one attraction in South Florida, educating and entertaining tens of millions of visitors over the years and being one of the leaders in manatee rescue, rehabilitation and release. Today, Miami Seaquarium continues to be the number one attraction in South Florida, educating and entertaining tens of millions of visitors over the years and being one of the leaders in manatee rescue, rehabilitation and release. We are very proud to be a part of the ongoing movement toward marine conservation in our society, but we know that our job will never be completed. There will always be a need for places of inspiration and learning if we are to foster an appreciation for the underwater world in future generations. We hope that you will come away from our park with a heightened appreciation of the ocean and her wonders.

The release fifty years ago of that small Java troop signified the beginning of the larger thriving troop that runs free at MONKEY JUNGLE today.\r\rLocated just off U.S. 1 in South Dade, MONKEY JUNGLE was an innovator of many of the concepts currently seen in the design of zoological parks. It is home to nearly400 primates, most running free on a 30 acre reserve. It is one of the few protected habitats for endangered primates in the United States and the only one that the general public can explore.\r\rVisitors today are immediately welcome by the Java monkey troop, now numbering in the 80âs. The Java monkeys forage through the Jungle eating natural foods. This experience with the monkeys continues to be a highlight of Monkey Jungle. The Java monkey is a skilled diver in the wild, collecting crabs and other shellfish along the riverbanks and mangrove swamps. Scheduled feedings at MONKEY JUNGLE show off these water skills as animals dive into a pool to receive fruit from the guides.\r\rAs part of the parkâs continuing effort to promote the understanding of primates, MONKEY JUNGLE has given a new look introducing audiences to the lifestyle of the orangutan. Always unpredictable, the audience often witnesses impromptu acts by these lovable apes.\r\rA total of 30 species of primates are represented at MONKEY JUNGLE including gibbons, guenons, spider monkeys and colobus. The Golden Lion Tamarin is native to the Brazilian jungle. Threatened with extinction, MONKEY JUNGLE proudly participates in an international effort to save the tiny creature.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.monkeyjungle.com%5C'\">www.monkeyjungle.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deogv863"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.432573,25.565784]}},{"properties":{"name":"Monroe Civic Center Arena","description":"Posted by Baobot401 Lee Joyner Expressway, Monroe, LA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degdvesi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.115246,32.507389]}},{"properties":{"name":"Monroe Civic Center Jack Howard Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 401 Lee Joyner Expressway, Monroe, LA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dem393he"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.115246,32.507389]}},{"properties":{"name":"MontBleu Resort Casino &amp; Spa","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 55 Highway 50, Lake Tahoe, NV<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decgxx9h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.938242,38.9806]}},{"properties":{"name":"MontBleu Resort Casino &amp; Spa","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_828.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 55 Hwy 50, Stateline, NV, United StatesThe MontBleu Theatre combines theatrical stage and lighting, terraced seating, a production-sized stage and can seat 950 banquet-style and up to 1,500 theatre-style.

The original owner, James A. Moore, was a flamboyant developer responsible for many of the early homes and structures in downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. The first building on the regraded Second Avenue, the Moore created a general shift away from Pioneer Square as the central business district while firmly establishing Second Avenue as the \"film/theatre district\" for Seattle. Architect E.W. Houghton gave the theatre a simple exterior with Italian and Byzantine terra-cotta details, while focusing much of the visual beauty on an opulent interior. Hailed as one of the most beautiful and completely equipped playhouses in the United States, the Moore boasted a grand lobby with mosaic floors, marble, onyx, carved wood, stained glass, and metal. There was also a ceiling fresco in old rose, cream and gold. Beams were supported by Muses representing Drama and Music. The theatre interior was resplendent with clusters of lights, rich hangings, and stained-glass paneling.\r\rThe Moore Theatre Twenty-five hundred enthusiastic Seattleites arrived for the opening night celebration. The program featured a locally written and produced comic-opera entitled \"The Alaskan\" which went on to a successful Broadway run. Throughout the first ten years the new Moore Theatre presented stage plays, operas, symphonies, and musicals.\r\rFor the next decade the Moore was host to the famous Orpheum vaudeville circuit. The largest of its kind in North America, all the legends and wonders of American vaudeville played the Moore stage. In fact, the Moore was also home to \"The Negro Ensemble,\" a popular local group of vaudevillians. However, while the Moore Theatre certainly has a history of diverse programming, receptivity to diverse audiences has not always been the case. Built into the theatre was a separate side entrance leading directly to the top balcony. Despite being the home to many, many black performers, African-Americans were not allowed entry into the theatre except through this \"back door\" to the balcony. When the Orpheum Theatre was built in 1927, the Moore\\'s vaudeville contract came to an end.\r\rThe Moore Theatre The Great Depression was, ironically, perhaps the most active and exciting time at the Moore. Due to the leadership of Cecilia Schultz, one of the great pioneers of the arts in Seattle, the Moore presented many of the most distinguished European and American singers, musicians, and dancers. Sarah Bernhardt, Lily Langtry, the Barrymores, Marie Dressier, and Anna Pavlova were just a few of the first-class performers seen at the Moore throughout the thirties.\r\rThe following decades at the Moore were rather unstable; programming at the Moore was less established as the theatre searched for a niche in an ever-changing market. After a three-year lease between 1949-51 in which the Moore was used as a revival house, the theatre became strictly a rental house. Throughout the 50\\'s and 60\\'s road shows, boxing matches, travel-films and special events were the mainstay of the Moore.\r\rAfter re-modeling in 1955, the Moore re-opened with a season featuring local \"artists-in-residence\" such as the Amusa Kabuki troupe. Other local visual artists were featured in the newly converted mezzanine art gallery. Among those presented in the first exhibit were Mark Tobey, George Tsutakawa, Guy Anderson, June Nye, and Kenneth Callahan.\r\rIn 1974 the Moore Theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. This status, however, did not guarantee financial or artistic stability as the theatre struggled to remain open. One year later two local film connoisseurs leased the theatre and after several months of cleaning and slight remodeling the theatre re-opened as the \"Moore-Egyptian\"--this time a foreign and \"revival\" movie theater. Home to the first Seattle International Film Festival, the Moore returned to stage arts when the pair lost the lease after five years and went on to open the Egyptian on Capitol Hill. \tThe Moore Theatre\r\rAfter the successive renovations and cleanings new and larger seats have been put reducing the capacity to 1419 seats; also the box seats have been taken out.\r\rIn the last twenty years the Moore has defined itself as a venue for both local community events, such as lectures, beauty pageants, and local dance or musical groups, and as a home for more \"alternative\" touring musicians and theatre. Virtually every musical genre, from the most hard-core punk to flashy funk, has had a place on the Moore stage in recent years.\r\r-Sean McIntyre\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.themoore.com%5C'\">www.themoore.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deldgvvt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.34092,47.611233]}},{"properties":{"name":"Moose Lodge 475, Petaluma","description":"Posted by Baobot300 English Street at Western Ave, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683ded2d5oe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.64409,38.23282]}},{"properties":{"name":"Morehead Planetarium and Science Center","description":"Posted by Baobot250 E Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, NC, United StatesThe Morehead Planetarium and Science Center, one of the largest planetariums in the United States, is located on the north end of the campus of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Rosenwald, then Chairman of Sears Roebuck &amp; Company, was inspired by a 1911 visit with his son to the Deutches Museum in Munich. He returned to Chicago determined to create America\\'s first center for \"industrial enlightenment,\" a vehicle for public science education. With the help of other Midwest business leaders, Rosenwald restored and converted the Palace of Fine Arts, the last remaining major structure from the 1893 World\\'s Fair, into a new type of American museum - where visitors could interact with the exhibits, not just view displays and artifacts. In 1933, the Museum of Science and Industry opened to the public, at the same time as the Century of Progress Exposition.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degr054d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.58028,41.7924]}},{"properties":{"name":"Museum of the Americas","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 2500 NW. 79th St., Miami, FL, United StatesThe MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAS (MoA) is one of the few art institutions in Florida to foster and promote both established and emerging contemporary artists of every origin.

A reception with the artists, free and open to the public, will be held on Friday, February 9th, from 5-8pm., concurrent with Portsmouth\\'s Art \\'Round Town gallery walk (<a href=\"%5C'http://www.artroundtown.org%5C'\">www.artroundtown.org</a>).\r\rThe Enormous Tiny Art Show marks the largest exhibition Nahcotta has amassed since the gallery and home furnishings/gift shop opened its doors six years ago. Owner Deb Thompson says with excitement, \"The sheer volume of artwork in The Enormous Tiny Art Show is remarkable - well over one hundred individual pieces will be hanging on our walls for this exhibit, all ranging in medium, price, genre, subject matter. For this show, we really wanted to pull together a refreshing and incredibly diverse collection of artwork from a large group of artists, some established, some not, some up-and-coming.\"  The \"enormous\" collection of tiny artwork spans pricing from 0 to 00 and up, another uncommon occurrence for the gallery, which often represents work priced well into the thousands.\r\rThompson, and Nahcotta manager, Rebecca Cox, invited their stable of artists to submit between three and six pieces each (10\" x 10\" or smaller) for The Enormous Tiny Art Show, having been inspired by some of the diminutive drawings, paintings, prints, and encaustics they\\'d come across in artists\\' studios. Over the course of months, word spread and further artists embraced the thematic project with great enthusiasm. More than 25 artists from as close as Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, and as far as Italy, San Diego, Philadelphia, and Atlanta will have their artwork in The Enormous Tiny Art S<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deet2743"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.759772,43.076129]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nairobi","description":"Posted by Baobottbc<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deetdacn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.233299,36.1353]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nakorn","description":"Posted by Baobot2039 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dem2kcr4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.147607,26.011359]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nami Japanese Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 8381 Pines Blvd, Pembroke Pines, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deh0qtz3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.254718,26.009048]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nando's Trattoria and Piano Bar","description":"Posted by Baobot2500 E Hallandale Beach Blvd, Hallandale, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedpbies"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.125543,25.986056]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nantucket Whaling Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 13 Broad St., Nantucket, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deflqmdx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.098555,41.285395]}},{"properties":{"name":"Napa Valley Grille","description":"Posted by Baobot111 Providence Place, Providence, RIUpscale Restaurant serving upscale Italian Food and Extensive wine list.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dej3eo18"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.359179,41.76427]}},{"properties":{"name":"Napper Tandy's Irish Pub","description":"Posted by Baobot126 N West Street, Raleigh, NC, United StatesNapper Tandy\\'s is the pub that parties like a club!

This 1,200-acre base was shut down in 1960 and declared surplus property by the U.S. Government. Nassau County obtained much of this property from the government in 1961. With the obtainment of Mitchel Field, many proposals were put forth. Some of the recommendations included a civic center, a large central library, residential housing, museum and cultural center. After consideration of these recommendations, the result was to build a 15,000 seat arena (additional seats were added from 1981-1984 that increased the seating capacity to over 18,000). The arena was built at the cost of 32 million dollars and sits on sixty-three acres of Mitchel Field. The building was dedicated to those who had made the supreme sacrifice for their country; hence the name Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\r\rThe Nassau Coliseum has accommodated virtually all forms of entertainment and sports, from state-of-the-art rock concerts, touring family shows, professional wrestling, boxing, track &amp; field, lacrosse and soccer. It is also home to the New York Islanders, NHL team and the NY Dragons, arena football team.\r\rPresently, SMG Management privately operates the Coliseum. SMG was founded in 1977 to manage its first account, the Louisiana Superdome. Since its founding it has grown to 176 facilities. These facilities benefit from the companyâs depth of resources and its unparalleled expertise, leadership, and creative problem-solving. Our successful growth has been built on the many partnerships we have developed with our clients â both municipal and private.\r\rOrganizationally, SMG has two separate operating divisions, one for stadiums and arenas and another for convention centers, providing the same effective business principles to two distinctively different business segments. At this time SMG manages 74 arenas, 7 stadiums, 51 convention centers, 34 performing arts centers, and 10 other recreational facilities. SMG-managed facilities grossed more than  billion in 2004, hosting more than 9,000 events and attracting more than 50 million patrons.\r\rOur ownership and team of dedicated corporate support personnel make us unrivalled in the field of private facility management. SMG is a joint venture in general partnership form with two equal principals: The Hyatt Hotel Company and ARAMARK Corporation. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.nassaucoliseum.com%5C'\">www.nassaucoliseum.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dei1y961"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.587181,40.719967]}},{"properties":{"name":"Natick High School","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 15 West St., Natick, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedklido"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.35929,42.277055]}},{"properties":{"name":"National Academies","description":"Posted by Baobot2100 C Street NW, Washington, DC, United StatesThe National Academy of Science, the National Research Council, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine are known as the National Academies.

The venues themselves have also won critical kudos: Prudential Hall has been praised as \"one of the world\\'s great concert halls\" (Hans Fantel, former music critic for The New York Times) and the Victoria Theater was dubbed \"a gem\" by The New York Times.\r\rNJPAC is easily accessible by car or public transportation, and offers plenty of safe, affordable parking.

The Noble Horse is proud to perform narratives on horseback in the elaborately restored theatre.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deojl7g0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.637552,41.907903]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nobu Miami","description":"Posted by Baobot1901 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deouo6ne"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.129271,25.795158]}},{"properties":{"name":"Noc Noc","description":"Posted by Baobot1516 2nd Ave, Seattle, WA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedbybp4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.338941,47.609612]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nokia Theatre Times Square","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 1515 Broadway 44th and Broadway, New York, NY, United StatesThe Nokia Theatre Times Square is a 2100-capacity venue designed by the award-winning architect David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group and operated by AEG LIVE.

Bond St., Bend, OR, United StatesOpened in 1936, the St. Francis School was the first-ever parochial school established in Central Oregon. It was the realization of a long-held dream of parish priest Father Luke Sheehan.\r\rFather Luke, who hailed from County Cork, Ireland, had come to Bend in 1910 as part of a mission to the \"wilds\" of Oregon made by the Irish Capuchin order of Catholic priests. Father Luke established and cultivated the St. Francis parish, initially by trekking hundreds of miles on horseback or on foot, to meet with those first, widely dispersed parishioners. Among this pious group were many of the priest\\'s countrymen, Irish immigrants who had converged upon the high desert mostly to work as sheepherders.\r\rFather Luke\\'s nephew, Dominic O\\'Connor, was also a Capuchin priest, who like his uncle, came to Bend. Father Dominic, though, made quite a name for himself before coming to Oregon. In fact, in the annals of Irish history, Father Dominic O\\'Connor is heralded as a national hero. His deeds done in support of the Irish Republic are celebrated in text, verse and song. After coming to Bend in 1922, Father Dominic lived a much quieter life devoted to serving the St. Francis Parish, and more generally, the Baker Diocese. This service firmly established the Irish hero as an important figure within the history of Central Oregon.\r\rAll of the groundwork done by Fathers Luke and Dominic and their Capuchin brethren, laid a solid foundation allowing for the school\\'s construction, which ironically came during the economically dire days of the Great Depression. The original brick school building contained four classrooms, with grades one through eight paired two to a room. That first year, there were 145 students enrolled. In years to come, that number soared to more than 300. To accommodate enrollment increases, additions were made to the school in the 1950s and \\'60s. The first add-on of two classrooms was done in 1953. Seven years later, four more rooms were constructed. Then, in 1968, a spacious new parish center was built along the school\\'s north side to house a gym, stage, meeting rooms and cafeteria.\r\rBy all accounts, the nuns who taught at St. Francis, all of whom were of the Sisters of the Holy Names order from Marylhurst University campus south of Portland, were effective teachers; many were taskmasters, and most had a big heart (though some chose not to wear it on their sleeve).\r\rBeginning in the late 1960s, change was afoot. Student uniforms were no longer required and lay teachers began to fill the roster at St. Francis School, and the remaining nuns no longer wore habits. But while the formal look of the faculty and student body was relaxed, the focus on quality education remained constant.\r\rIn 2000, the St. Francis School relocated to a newly constructed modern campus on the northeastern section of the city. The old downtown property, which now included four old bungalow houses on the back end of the lot, passed to McMenamins, who renovated and reopened the landmark as the Old St. Francis School in November 2004.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deqljeh1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.314807,44.056686]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Tavernier Restaurant Bar","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 90133 Overseas Hwy, Tavernier, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683ded502it"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.538416,24.996491]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Town School of Folk Music","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 4544 N Lincoln Ave, Chicago, IL, United StatesThe Old Town School of Folk Music teaches and celebrates music and cultural expressions rooted in the traditions of diverse American and global communities.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo1jcnp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.685507,41.963931]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old West Church","description":"Posted by Baobot131 Cambridge St., Boston<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deexfk6r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.063945,42.361278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Old Whaling Church","description":"Posted by BaobotMain Street, Edgartown<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deft0uyv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.51743,41.39083]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ole Ole","description":"Posted by Baobot8100 W.

Otterman St., Greensburg, PA, United StatesThe Palace Theatre has been a major force in Westmoreland County\\'s cultural scene for generations.  Opened September 2, 1926, as the Manos Theatre, The Palace Theatre today hosts the widest variety of live entertainment in the area in a beautifully renovated 1320-seat facility, located across from the county courthouse at 21 West Otterman Street in downtown Greensburg, PA. The Palace Theatre\r\rThe Palace Theatre is home to the Westmoreland Symphony Orchestra and a regional venue for River City Brass Band. Productions are mounted on a regular basis by local arts groups including Laurel Ballet, Stage Right, Greensburg Civic Theatre, Westmoreland Choral Society, and Greensburg Central Catholic High School. Concert promoters bring popular entertainers to the Palace such as Joan Baez, Buddy Guy, Kevin James, Connie Francis, The Oak Ridge Boys, Penn &amp; Teller, Frankie Avalon, and Keb Mo. Westmoreland Cultural Trust (formerly The Westmoreland Trust), owner and developer of The Palace since 1990, sponsors national touring musicals and celebrity headliners like Tom Jones, Kenny Rogers, Wayne Newton, Lily Tomlin, Bob Newhart, Lou Rawls, Judy Collins, Neil Sedaka, Ben Vereen, Bill Cosby, Bernadette Peters, Harry Belafonte, Irish Tenor Ronan Tynan, George Carlin, and Paul Anka.\r\rThe Palace Theatre The work of original architect Leon H. Lempert &amp; Son of Rochester, NY, much of the original Manos Theatre remains intact, including the Lobby\\'s candlelight chandelier and golden Grecian marble, black and white floor tiles, and the unique ticket booth at the theatre\\'s entrance. Phase II renovations begun in 1996 included air-conditioning, new stage lighting, a state-of-the-art sound system, and more comfortable and spacious seating installed throughout the entire upper level of the theatre. The original opera boxes were replicated and will be completed by painting the hand-cast, decorative moldings and hanging velvet swags.  Two original murals were  refurbished alongside the theatre\\'s Loge seats.  (A third mural remains hidden under a layer of paint on the ceiling above the orchestra pit!)  \r\rPhase III renovations completed in September 2004 gave us the newly dedicated Megan\\'s Suite, an expanded suite with table seating for guests to enjoy refreshments before the show or during intermission.  The most recent renovations also include new rest rooms for men and women on the main floor and mezzanine levels, drinking fountains, and an elevator.  These projects are restoring The Palace to its original state of old-world beauty with modern day improvements, making it one of the finest theatres of its size and type in the country. \r---thepalacetheatre<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deowv1cg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.544949,40.303364]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palace of Auburn Hills","description":"Posted by Baobot4 Championship Dr., Auburn Hills, MI<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degrm5pu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.242492,42.697046]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palacio del Vino y la Aceituna","description":"Posted by BaobotAlmendralejo<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demn38b8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.4,38.683334]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palacio del Vino y la Aceituna","description":"Posted by BaobotAlmendralejo<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683del4uohq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-6.4,38.683334]}},{"properties":{"name":"Palladium Modesto","description":"Posted by Baobot950 10th St., Modesto, United StatesThe 209\\'s Premier Night Spot, located in Downtown Modesto @ 10th &amp; J, offers 15,000sq.feet of dance floor, 40,000watts of heart pounding sound to groove you all night, 3 Go-Go Cages, 3 Dance Floors, Intelligent Lighting and all your favorite Top 40, R&amp;B, Hip Hop, Club Anthems, and Latin Music.

Beginning with the restoration of the Pantages and The Rialto theaters 22 years ago, many of our historic buildings and storefronts have undergone face-lifts and refurbishing. This beautification effort, combined with improved roads and the debut of Sound Transit\\'s Tacoma Link Light Rail system, has made Tacoma\\'s historic Theater District more accessible, user-friendly and welcoming for tourists and local residents than ever before. A wide variety of unique merchants and restaurants, state-of-the-art museums, including the Museum of Glass and the new Tacoma Art Museum building, along with The Washington State History Museum, invite you to enrich your cultural senses and explore the new world of Historic Downtown Tacoma.\r\rIn 1975, a group of concerned community volunteers with a strong belief that the arts are essential in stimulating community growth, campaigned and raised money locally to restore Tacoma\\'s Historic Pantages Theater to its original grandeur. Realizing the desperate need for money to keep the doors open, they negotiated with the City of Tacoma to buy the building and to grant funding to the nonprofit organization running the theater. Succeeding in their efforts the Pantages was reopened in 1983. Without the work of these dedicated community volunteers, and the support of the City of Tacoma and its City Council, what became the Broadway Center for the Performing Arts in 1991 would not exist today.\r\rNow, with three unique theaters and our own acclaimed performance series, the Broadway Center serves as a vital and valuable arts steward. The Pantages, a beautiful historic theater seating 1,169 audience members, offers a lush performance experience and is home to The Tacoma Opera, Tacoma City Ballet, Tacoma Philharmonic, Tacoma Concert Band, and Tacoma Symphony. The Rialto, a 742-seat theater that originally served as a grand movie palace, hosts the Tacoma Youth Symphony Association, the Northwest Sinfonietta and the Puget Sound Revels. Theatre on the Square, a 302-seat facility with a contemporary flair, offers a more intimate setting and is home to the Tacoma Actors Guild.\r\rIt is our pleasure to welcome you to Historic Downtown Tacoma and our three exciting theaters filled with rich, cultural performances year-round. Please read on to find out more on the background of each theater. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.broadwaycenter.org%5C'\">www.broadwaycenter.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedkrveb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444757,47.262563]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pantages Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 710 Hennepin Ave., Minneapolis, MN<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekub1tn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.275046,44.977792]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pao","description":"Posted by Baobot825 Washington Ave., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deld5t8s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.133191,25.778653]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paolo Soleri Amphitheatre","description":"Posted by Baobot1501 Cerrilos Rd., Santa Fe, NM<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deel06zf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.965549,35.669944]}},{"properties":{"name":"Papago Brewing","description":"Posted by Baobot7107 E McDowell Road, Scottsdale, AZ, United StatesPapago Brewing features an extensive tasting room with a 30 tap bar where the line-up changes daily plus a beer engine for cask conditioned ales; showcasing the Southwest and serving the finest microbrews as well as great classic beers from around the world, A variety of wines, ports &amp; meads by the glass, Free wireless internet connections (Wi-Fi).<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deimpxwp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.928213,33.465551]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paper Heart","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 750 Grand Avenue, Phoenix, AZ, United StatesThe Paper Heart Arts Venue is a downtown Phoenix arts destination catering to visual art, music, dance, theater, spoken word/poetry, performance, video/film and comedy.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deeabjvq"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.083535,33.452281]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paper Moon Dance Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 515 Daniel Webster Hwy, Merrimack, NH, United StatesWhat level dance are you??

The theater was commissioned by theater owner J.J.

Born into a family of prominent Philadelphia Quakers and educated at Harvard (where he first developed his taste for Italian painting), Samuel Parrish began collecting art seriously in the early 1880s, shortly after moving his successful law practice from Philadelphia to New York.\r\rIt was during these same years that Parrish began paying regular visits to his family\\'s home in Southampton. The village, then as now a popular summer resort, quickly caught his interest, and before long he became actively involved in its affairs.\r\rWhile traveling in Italy in the fall of 1896, Parrish decided to build a museum in Southampton to house his rapidly growing collection of Italian Renaissance art. He purchased a small parcel of land adjacent to the library and commissioned a fellow Southampton summer resident, the architect Grosvenor Atterbury (1869-1956), to design a suitable structure.\r\rThe Museum was actually pieced together in several installments over a period of sixteen years. The first Art Museum at Southampton, as the Parrish was then known, was a single large exhibition hall. Constructed in wood and entered from Main Street, the hall was built during the summer of 1897. It was not until the following year that the Museum was incorporated and a catalogue of the collection, which included paintings, copies of classical and Renaissance sculpture was published. A few years later, a fireproof brick wing (designed by Atterbury and financed largely by Samuel Parrish\\'s brother, James Cresson Parrish) was attached to the north side of the building. The new exhibition hall, completed in 1902 soon became a popular site for concerts and art lectures.\r\rAs the collection continued to expand, a second wing soon became necessary. In 1913, Atterbury extended the Museum to the south, toward Job\\'s Lane. The new wing included a Renaissance-inspired arched loggia through which one entered the Museum,flanked by gates that permitted direct access to the gardens.\r\rThe collection and the building were bequeathed to the Village of Southampton when Samuel Parrish died in 1932. The founder\\'s death, coupled with the Depression and the war years that followed, brought developments at the Museum to a standstill for the next two decades.\r\rIn the 1950s, the new president of the Museum\\'s Board of Trustees, Mrs. Robert M. Littlejohn, brought new life to the Parrish. She launched a major campaign to strengthen the Museum\\'s holdings in American art. Paintings by Thomas Moran, Childe Hassam, Guy Pene du Bois, and Thomas Doughty were added to the collection.\r\rUpon Mrs. Littlejohn\\'s death in 1961, the Parrish became the beneficiary of more than 300 paintings, drawings and watercolors from her personal collection. The core of her collection was a remarkable group of thirty-one paintings by William Merritt Chase.\r\rOne of the most important artists to live and work in Southampton at the turn of the century, William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) was also an extremely popular teacher at the Art Students League in New York. In 1891, he opened a summer art school in Shinnecock Hills, just west of Southampton. The school operated successfully for more than ten years. Now converted into private homes, the studio and student housing are known as the Art Village.\r\rThe distinguished Chase collection Mrs. Littlejohn assembled over the years - including Still Life with Cockatoo (ca. 1879), Prospect Park, Brooklyn (ca. 1887), and The Blue Kimono (ca. 1898) now form the nucleus of the Museum\\'s extensive Chase holdings.\r\rThe Chase painting most closely associated with the Parrish today is unquestionably The Bayberry Bush (ca. 1895), a charming Shinnecock landscape in which three of Chase\\'s daughters are grouped informally around a large bayberry bush. An accomplished example of American \"plein-air\" painting, the picture represents Chase at the height of his powers and displays his fondness for the light and colors of Eastern Long Island.\r\rIn 1981, further depth was added to the Museum\\'s permanent collection when nearly 200 works of art by the prominent painter, critic and long-time Southampton resident Fairfield Porter (1907-1975) were donated to the Parrish by his wife Anne, and by the artist\\'s estate.\r\rSince the Porter bequest, the Parrish has increasingly focused its exhibition and acquisitions on American painting of the twentieth century, with special attention directed toward the generation of artists who have maintained studios on the East End of Long Island since the 1950s. Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers, who together with Fairfield Porter helped revitalize figurative painting in 1950s, are represented by several works in the collection. More recent arrivals in the area include Chuck Close, Joan Snyder and Joe Zucker. A major painting by Albert Pinkham Ryder, who was important to artists such as Marsden Hartley and Jackson Pollock has been acquired.\r\rAlthough the Parrish is best known for its American paintings, the permanent collection also contains a sizeable group of prints and drawings, among them works by George Bellows, Marsden Hartley, Larry Rivers, Helen Frankenthaler, and Robert Rauschenberg.\r\rEnhancing the architectural charms of the Parrish are the peaceful, shaded gardens that surround the Museum, which contain more than 250 different trees and shrubs from around the world. The gardens are decorated with various sculpture reproductions from the original Parrish collection.\r\rAmong these reminders of the past, the Parrish actively looks toward the future. The curatorial staff maintains a full schedule of changing exhibitions in the Museum\\'s galleries, with a focus on examining art of the recent past or contemporary work.\r\rWith its lively schedule of exhibitions, lectures, films, concerts, and art classes for young people, school programs and special programs for older audiences, the Parrish offers the public a rich variety of year-round cultural activities.\r\rIn the years to come, it will continue to provide its own special blend of personal pleasure and cultural enrichment for all who come to enjoy its peaceful gardens, its widely ranging exhibitions, and the many treasures of its permanent collection. \r---thehamptons.com/mus<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683der5xhsu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.391132,40.883559]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parrot Jungle Island","description":"Posted by Baobot1111 Parrot Jungle Trail, Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deom0os8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.17536,25.78417]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pascal's on Ponce","description":"Posted by Baobot2611 Ponce de Leon Blvd., Coral Gables, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683delmb9qo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.258507,25.747727]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pasha's","description":"Posted by Baobot900 Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deq1lmci"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.13778,25.790528]}},{"properties":{"name":"Patacon Restaurant #5","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 18230 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683depag1ci"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.121051,25.944312]}},{"properties":{"name":"Patchogue Theatre for the Performing Arts","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 71 E.

It is the home of the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League. It opened in August, 2000. Bucking a recent trend, the city decided against selling the naming rights of the new stadium to a large corporation and named it after coaching legend Paul Brown, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame who founded not only the Bengals in 1966, but also the Cleveland Browns in 1946.\r\rIn 1996, Hamilton County voters passed a one-half percent sales tax increase to fund the building of two new facilities for both the Bengals and the Major League Baseball Cincinnati Reds. Previously, the Bengals and the Reds shared occupancy of Cinergy Field, but both teams complained that the aging multipurpose facility lacked modern amenities and other things necessary for small market teams to survive. Paul Brown Stadium was built first. After the Bengals moved into Paul Brown Stadium a large section of Cinergy Field was removed and the field was sodded with natural grass.

During the late 1800s and the early 1900s, their lives and work paralleled the growth of Portland from a small Northwest town site to a thriving city with a quarter million population. With its eclectic architectural design and richly decorated interior, including family artifacts, the Pittock Mansion stands today as a living memorial of this family\\'s contributions to the blossoming of Portland and its people.\r\rEnglish-born Henry Lewis Pittock journeyed on a wagon train from Pennsylvania to Oregon in 1853 where, at the young age of 19, and in his own words, \"barefoot and penniless,\" he began working for Thomas Jefferson Dryer\\'s Weekly Oregonian newspaper. In 1860, at the age of 26, he married 15-year-old Georgiana Martin Burton of Missouri. Six years prior, Georgiana had crossed the plains from Keokuk, Iowa to Oregon Territory with her parents. Georgiana\\'s father E.M. Burton was a flour mill owner and one of early Portland\\'s well known building contractors.\r\rGeorgiana PittockTogether, Henry and Georgiana began a long life of work, community service, and devotion to family, which would last 58 years and celebrate six children and eighteen grandchildren.\r\rA consummate businessman, Henry Pittock took ownership of the Weekly Oregonian in 1860, changing its format to the daily paper we read today. He went on to build an empire incorporating real estate, banking, railroads, steamboats, sheep ranching, silver mining, and the pulp and paper industry.\r\rGeorgiana dedicated herself to improving the lives of the community\\'s women and children. She helped found the Ladies Relief Society in 1867, whose Children\\'s Home provided care, food, and shelter for needy children. Georgiana also worked with the Woman\\'s Union, and played a key role in building the Martha Washington Home for single, working women. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.pittockmansion.com%5C'\">www.pittockmansion.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deeoew03"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.717155,45.524797]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pizza Loft","description":"Posted by Baobot10187 W.

Victory Blvd., Portland, OR, United StatesPortland International Raceway is built on the former location of the World War II city of Vanport, which was wiped out by a 1948 flood. The Army Corps of Engineers sold the site to the City of Portland in 1960 and in 1961 the first Rose Cup races were held.\r\rThe Portland Jaycees saw that the abandoned roads of Vanport had the potential to become a road race course and convinced the Rose Festival that they should sponsor a race during their annual celebration. The first Rose Cup races were held in June of 1961, starting a tradition that continues today. Soon after that first race both Go Kart and Motorcycle enthusiasts started race programs of their own with Drag Racers starting about four years later.\r\rIn 1965 the first drag races were held at PIR and the first Trans Am races in 1972. In 1978 IMSA came to Portland with the first GTP sports car race in the G.I. Joe\\'s / Camel Gran Prix, followed in 1984 by CART with Indy Cars in the Freightliner / G.I. Joe\\'s 200.\r\rBy 1970 the old asphalt of Vanport was in such poor shape that some of the sanctioning bodies would not sanction races at \"West Delta Park.\" Because the very popular Rose Cup Races were threatened, the Rose Festival decided to do 00,000 worth of paving if the City would pay them back out of revenues from the racing events held there. The City accepted the offer feeling that the raceway would never be able to make the final payment.\r\rNewly hired Racetrack Manager, Dale LaFollette, made the final payment on the loan after only two and one half years. Since that day Portland International Raceway has operated as an enterprise fund even though the first ten years were spent in the General Fund. Revenue sources consist of three major categories: rental, food concessions and advertising. PIR prides itself on being the most \"user friendly\" racing facility on the west coast with rates and charges 10% to 25% less than other, similar facilities.\r\rThe facility is owned and operated by the City of Portland through its bureau of Parks and Recreation. The raceway is operated as an Enterprise Fund, meaning that its operating expenses and capital improvements are covered by the revenues that it generates, as the raceway receives no general fund tax dollars. The raceway\\'s varied, year round activities bring between 30 and 40 million dollars into the surrounding community each year.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.portlandraceway.com%5C'\">www.portlandraceway.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deiptk6t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.699058,45.601341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center","description":"Posted by Baobot2060 N.

Taiko (the Japanese word for drum and the name of the art form) has its roots in ancient Japanese tradition. Today, taiko is a dynamic and evolving performing art combining rhythm, movement, energy, and culture into a single art form. Through artistic excellence and innovation in taiko, we affirm Asian American pride, inspire audiences, build community, and educate about our culture and heritage.\r\rPortland Taikoâs aspiration is to create taiko performance of the highest artistic quality to touch the universal in all of us and to provide a strong and beautiful voice for Asian America. Using the taiko in this way is not new, drawing on centuries of tradition. In ancient Japan, taiko was used to delineate the boundaries of the village, scare away invading armies and pests in the rice fields, aid meditation in religious ceremonies, and call the community together in times of both crisis and celebration. Today, Portland Taiko continues to call over 70,000 people a year together with its innovative Asian American expressions rooted in ancient Japanese traditions. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.portlandtaiko.org%5C'\">www.portlandtaiko.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683desenhag"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.632354,45.574025]}},{"properties":{"name":"Portobello Ristorante","description":"Posted by Baobot2841 Coral Way, Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demhxv2n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.240029,25.750341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Portoroz","description":"Posted by BaobotSlovenia<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683den41y1c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.995463,46.151241]}},{"properties":{"name":"Portsmouth Athenaeum","description":"Posted by Baobot9 Market Square, Portsmouth, NH, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deowex9g"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.757584,43.077188]}},{"properties":{"name":"Portsmouth SCORE Office","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_8565_primary.jpg\">195A Commerce Way, Portsmouth, NH, United StatesSeacoast SCORE is a volunteer organization affiliated with the Small Business Administration.\r\rWe provide free counseling to small businesses and provide low cost workshops on small business topics in the Seacoast, NH area.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deioj5mt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.78683,43.09122]}},{"properties":{"name":"Post 156","description":"Posted by Baobot215 Waverly Oaks, Waltham<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dem70dry"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.209982,42.383721]}},{"properties":{"name":"Post Gazette Pavilion At Star Lake","description":"Posted by BaobotRoute 18 At Route 22, Pittsburgh, PA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683ded4o3kb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.39084,40.37507]}},{"properties":{"name":"Potawatomi Bingo Casino","description":"Posted by Baobot1721 W.

It also serves the general public with a full schedule of special exhibitions, lectures, tours, concerts and other programs. The Museumâs collection is displayed in 45 galleries on three floors, tracing the history of art from antiquity to the 21st century.\r\rGalleries housing Greek vases and coins, Roman frescoes and sculpture, and Etruscan bronzes lead to the Medieval gallery, which includes a 12th-century sculpture from the Third Abbey Church of Cluny, France. A sequence of European galleries follows, with painting, sculpture, and decorative arts ranging from the Renaissance to Neoclassicism.\r\rHighlights of the 19th-century French painting galleries include masterpieces by Delacroix, Corot, Manet, Monet, CÃ©zanne, Rodin and Matisse. American painting of the 19th and early 20th centuries is represented in work by Chase, Heade, Homer, Bellows, Sargent and Cassatt.\r\rPendleton House, which opened in 1906, is the earliest example of an âAmerican wingâ in any museum. It features an extraordinary collection of 18th- and early 19th-century decorative arts and one of the finest American furniture collections in the country, including examples from the Townsend and Goddard circle of colonial Newport craftsmen. Paintings by American masters such as Copley, Stuart, Cole, and Sully also hang in Pendleton House.\r\rThe Museumâs Egyptian galleries feature the coffin and mummy of the priest Nesmin, burial objects, and a first-class collection of faience. Additional galleries highlight the artistic achievements of Africa, Central and South America, India, and China. The nine-foot Buddha Dainichi Nyorai, from a medieval temple west of Kyoto, occupies his own gallery, while extensive collections of Asian textiles and Japanese prints are exhibited in galleries dedicated to their display.\r\rSelections from the more than 18,000 prints, drawings and photographs and the 15,000 costume and textiles are frequently featured in special exhibitions. The Daphne Farago Wing, dedicated in 1994, displays contemporary art in all media, either from the Museumâs permanent collection or from special traveling exhibiti<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dehut1t5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.407117,41.826522]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rhodes on the Pawtuxet Ballroom","description":"Posted by Baobot60 Rhodes Place, Cranston<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683den51pj5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.393922,41.767791]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rhythm House Cafe","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3029 Washington Pike, Bridgeville, PA, United StatesThe rhythm house caf?? is a restaurant and nightclub located adjacent to the intersection of interstate route 79 and pennsylvania state route 50 in the borough of bridgeville, pennsylvania.\r\rwe are approximately a 15 minute drive south from pittsburgh and a 40 minute drive from wheeling, wva.\r\rwe feature live music six nights a week by the best in regional and national artists.\r\rwe offer fine dining in a casual, relaxed atmosphere.\r\rclick here to view a map of the surrounding area.\r\ryou may contact us by telephone at 412-221-5010. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.rhythmhousecafe.com%5C'\">www.rhythmhousecafe.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekz2me3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.113971,40.351708]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rhythm Room","description":"Posted by Baobot1019 E.

Beginning with the restoration of the Pantages and The Rialto theaters 22 years ago, many of our historic buildings and storefronts have undergone face-lifts and refurbishing. This beautification effort, combined with improved roads and the debut of Sound Transit\\'s Tacoma Link Light Rail system, has made Tacoma\\'s historic Theater District more accessible, user-friendly and welcoming for tourists and local residents than ever before. A wide variety of unique merchants and restaurants, state-of-the-art museums, including the Museum of Glass and the new Tacoma Art Museum building, along with The Washington State History Museum, invite you to enrich your cultural senses and explore the new world of Historic Downtown Tacoma.\r\rIn 1975, a group of concerned community volunteers with a strong belief that the arts are essential in stimulating community growth, campaigned and raised money locally to restore Tacoma\\'s Historic Pantages Theater to its original grandeur. Realizing the desperate need for money to keep the doors open, they negotiated with the City of Tacoma to buy the building and to grant funding to the nonprofit organization running the theater. Succeeding in their efforts the Pantages was reopened in 1983. Without the work of these dedicated community volunteers, and the support of the City of Tacoma and its City Council, what became the Broadway Center for the Performing Arts in 1991 would not exist today.\r\rNow, with three unique theaters and our own acclaimed performance series, the Broadway Center serves as a vital and valuable arts steward. The Pantages, a beautiful historic theater seating 1,169 audience members, offers a lush performance experience and is home to The Tacoma Opera, Tacoma City Ballet, Tacoma Philharmonic, Tacoma Concert Band, and Tacoma Symphony. The Rialto, a 742-seat theater that originally served as a grand movie palace, hosts the Tacoma Youth Symphony Association, the Northwest Sinfonietta and the Puget Sound Revels. Theatre on the Square, a 302-seat facility with a contemporary flair, offers a more intimate setting and is home to the Tacoma Actors Guild.\r\rIt is our pleasure to welcome you to Historic Downtown Tacoma and our three exciting theaters filled with rich, cultural performances year-round.

Old Cornelius Pass Rd., Hillsboro, OR, United StatesWith roots stretching back to the stage coach days, the Rock Creek Tavern (in its pre-fire days) was a longtime favorite stop off for Washington County residents. Not surprisingly, it was the backdrop for Old West style television commercials.\r\rThe rustic tavern stood on the site of a stage stop on the old overland route from Portland to the coast. Following a destructive fire, an adjoining blacksmith shop was moved onto the foundation of the burned-out stage stop.\r\rAs the 20th century progressed, the old shop was converted to the Rock Creek Tavern. In the early \\'70s, the modest tavern was substantially enlarged and furnished with a stone fireplace and turn-of-the-century bar and back bar. The outdoor deck, with its sweeping view (and landing space for a misguided car), was a summer highlight. No matter the season, live music kept the tavern rockin\\'.\r\rThen there was the disastrous fire that burned the Rock Creek Tavern to the ground. While many a local lamented its passing, leave it to the tenacious McMenamins brothers to authorize a brand new, even more accommodating facsimile: the beautiful, rustic new Rock Creek Tavern that is now flexing its formidable entertainment muscles: with plenty of food, drink, and music to carry on a grand historic tradition on Old Cornelius Pass Road.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deiswqvr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.779923,45.527022]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rock N Soul Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 191 Beale St. Suite 100, Memphis, TN<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683denete43"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.051793,35.139456]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame","description":"Posted by Baobot1 Key Plaza, Cleveland, OH<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo6djop"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.694162,41.453099]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rock-A-Bangkok","description":"Posted by Baobot13718 SW 88th St., Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deon2uth"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.308994,25.688864]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rockafellas","description":"Posted by Baobot231 Essex St, Salem<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deqlsjio"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.895225,42.521455]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rockingham Ballroom","description":"Posted by Baobot22 Ash Swamp Rd., Newmarket, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deshnfrb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.938448,43.050863]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rockingham Park Racetrack","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 1 Rockingham Park Boulevard, Salem, NH, United StatesThe 11th Annual Spring Craft Festival takes place at Rockingham Park Racetrack in Salem, New Hampshire on Saturday March 10 and Sunday March 11 from 10am to 5pm daily.\rOver 150 Booths of American Made arts, crafts, specialty foods and live music.\rAdmission .00 Adult, under 14 free.

Southport Ave., Chicago, IL, United StatesThe building that houses SCHUBAS TAVERN  is a brick and masonry neo-Gothic treasure that\\'s been a Lake View neighborhood landmark for 100 years. Built in 1903 as part of a project undertaken by the  SCHLITZ BREWERY, the building was one of hundreds erected at the turn of the century. This project included structures housing everything from corner taps to opulent hotels, and stretched from Minneapolis through Wisconsin to the far reaches of Chicago\\'s Pullman district.\r\rSchlitz Brewery SCHUBAS remains one of a handful of these elegant buildings still operating as a saloon. In 1988 Chris and Michael Schuba bought the building, and set upon refurbishing it to its original glory. This extensive renovation included restoring the 30\\' Brunswick mahogany bar, tin ceilings and walnut wainscotting in the bar room, and a full makeover of the back music hall. The ornate exterior, featuring two-toned herringbone patterned brickwork, copper parapets and cornice caps and two SCHLITZ globe logos in terra cotta bas relief, has been carefully cleaned and restored. Several years ago the second floor saloon-keeper\\'s flat was changed to an elegant private banquet facility, complete with its own mahogany bar.\r\rCompleting this renovation in 1997 was the expansion of SCHUBAS dining operation into the building next door. A new full-service kitchen and 80-seat dining room make up the adjacent THE HARMONY GRILL. This addition offers an expanded selection of SCHUBAS signature home-cooked American regional cuisine and seasonal specials. Good weather permits us to open up the dining room onto a sidewalk cafe on Southport.\r\rIn the spirit of its public-house roots, SCHUBAS is open daily for lunch and dinner and weekend country brunch. We offer music entertainment nightly. For more information on upcoming events at SCHUBAS, or specifics on hosting a private gathering in one of our rooms, call 773-525-2508.\r\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.schubas.com%5C'\">www.schubas.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683ded78juj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.663817,41.939252]}},{"properties":{"name":"Schwartz Auditorium - Brandeis University","description":"Posted by Baobot415 South Street, Waltham, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683ded6el7j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.256316,42.365204]}},{"properties":{"name":"Science Center 251","description":"Posted by Baobot1 Oxford St, Cambridge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deoiy2tn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.115735,42.376405]}},{"properties":{"name":"Science Center, Auditorium D","description":"Posted by BaobotHarvard Yard, Cambridge<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demx9ojk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1187,42.37454]}},{"properties":{"name":"Science Fiction Hall of Fame","description":"Posted by Baobot325 5th Ave. N., Seattle, WA, United StatesThe Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame (SFM) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization created to inspire new generations to reach beyond the present, imagine the future and explore the infinite possibilities of the universe.\r\rThe first museum devoted to this dynamic and far-reaching genre, SFM combines artifacts and information in evocative environments, immersing visitors in science fiction\\'s \"alternative worlds.\" Witness how science fiction touches all forms of artistic expression and reframes the complexities of science, art, culture and the humanities - helping give visitors new insights into themselves and their world.\r\rThe museum is also home to the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, honoring the legends and luminaries that have shaped humanity\\'s visions of the future.

Its ochre walls, reminiscent of the Tuscan landscape, its intimate, sultry atmoshpere, and its authentic Italian cuisine make it a favorite with diners from around the Puget Sound and beyond. Serafina\\'s philosophy is simple: Offer the freshest, highest quality ingredients, present the food in an honest and inviting way, and provide the casual warmth and soothing ambiance that echoes the welcoming embrace of an Italian home.\r\rThe ritual of coming together sharing wine and food with family and friends is the central motif in our lives. Italian food has an immediacy, honesty, and warmth: it possesses the spirit of a grandmother\\'s wisdom and love. Italian food isn\\'t about trailblazing alchemy or edible high fashion; Italian food is about staying connected--to each other, to the past, to the earth.\r\rOur menu recreates many of the dishes that owner Susan Kaufman and chef John Neumark have enjoyed in friends\\' homes throughout Italy. It is our hope that your dining experience at Serafina will leave you feeling transported to the sublime Italian countryside, and completely taken care of by our sincere, professional staff.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.serafinaseattle.com%5C'\">www.serafinaseattle.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedj62qu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.32589,47.636891]}},{"properties":{"name":"Serena","description":"Posted by Baobot222 W. 23rd St., Miami Beach, FL<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedamc1d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.128266,25.79844]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sergio's Family Restaurant","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 8202 Mills Dr. Town &amp; Country Mall, Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deryka0j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.268236,25.712726]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sets","description":"Posted by Baobot93 E.

It enjoyed a successful economic life from 1929 until the 1970??s. At that time, vaudeville was entertainment of a bygone era and multi-screen, small capacity\rmotion picture theatres were cropping up throughout the island. Attempts were made to re-vitalize the theatre by using it as a flea market, an antique showroom, a night club, and skating rink. None of these lasted very long and many who remembered or heard fond stories of its past grandeur, wondered what would become of the beautiful St. George Theatre . Hope was raised in January 2001 when, in his State of the City address, then Mayor Rudolph Giuliani promised resources for the renovation of the St.George Theatre into a Performing Arts Center which would ensure revitalization into the entire neighborhood. Unfortunately, the tragic events of 9/11/01 understandably put a halt to these resources.\r\rThe newly renovated St. George Theatre will serve as a Cultural Center for a myriad of activities, including after school programs, seminars in theatre production, acting, dance and voice as well as rehearsal and performance space, and even television and film location shoots. Large scale productions, national tours, grammy award concerts, best in comedy, opera, and children\\'s shows, events that are almost exclusive to other boroughs, will be part of the cultural calendar at the St. George Theatre.  And, of course the theatre could be home to many fund raising functions for numerous organizations, both island based and regional.\r\rThe entrance lobby of the theatre will remain open 7 days a week.\r\rThis \"Center\" will attract tourists to our Island , as well as those who\rwork in that bustling area, and residents with information regarding the\rschedule of events at the theatre, as well as other attractions and functions\racross the Island.\r\rThe restoration of the St. George Theatre will provide jobs as well as afford the residents of Staten Island the opportunity to come together and enjoy a diversity of visual and performing arts, enhancing the cultural and economic vitality of all of Staten Island while the St. George Theatre is preserved and protected as a unique, once again vibrant structure.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.stgeorgetheater.com%5C'\">www.stgeorgetheater.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683depuftcm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.076903,40.64201]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. James Theatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 246 West 44th St., New York, NY<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekj6z8j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.987857,40.758098]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. John's Episcopal Church","description":"Posted by Baobot114 20th Ave. S.E., Olympia, WA, United StatesSt. Johnâs Episcopal Church has been offering Godâs love to the community since January 7, 1864. Founded in what would become the Capitol city of the State of Washington, St. Johnâs offers worship, study, fellowship and service to enrich the body, soul and spirit. The present building is the fourth used for worship and is filled on Sunday with people of all walks of life who gather as an offering of love to God and to the world.\r\rRooted in the Anglican tradition, St. Johnâs is a member of the Diocese of Olympia, which includes all of Western Washington.

The Diocese of Olympia is a part of the Episcopal Church.   In turn, the Episcopal Church is affiliated with the world-wide Anglican Communion.   (This includes the Church of England, the Church of Canada, and many others.)\r\rAnglicanism grew out of the unique historical circumstances of the late sixteen- and early seventeenth-century England, which was marked by a powerful sense of national identity and whose populace was split between Catholics and Protestants.   Long before the Protestant Reformation, the English church was notorious for its sense of independence.  Finally severed from Rome under Henry VIII, the Anglican Church took shape theologically under Henry\\'s three children:  Edward VI, a firm Protestant who reigned for six years, long enough to institute the first Book of Common Prayer, a decidedly Protestant document;  Mary I, a devout Catholic who reigned for five years, long enough to reinstate certain Catholic practices that Edward had proscribed; and finally the Pragmatic Elizabeth, who in her forty-year reign labored brilliantly to forge not only a society but an established church that was broad enough to include all but the most extreme Catholics and Protestants.\r\rThe result was--and is--a church of astonishing theological breadth.  But it is not breadth in a lax, lazy, anything-goes sense.  The Anglican Church, when truest to its own theological traditions, views the mind not as a potential instrument of the Devil but as a gift of God.  And it takes seriously the idea of the community of faith as a context within which people from different backgrounds and with varying perspectives can openly share their experiences of God, can attend to one another in a spirit of love, and can thereby gain insights that may help every member of the community to move somewhat closer to God\\'s truth.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.saintmarks.org%5C'\">www.saintmarks.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degpp8qm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.320218,47.630952]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Mark's School","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Rte. 85, Southborough<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejr6ki9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.527368,42.297464]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Mary's Apartment","description":"Posted by Baobot88 Lexington Street, Waltham<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejw8m45"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.235809,42.379503]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Michel","description":"Posted by Baobot162 Alcazar Ave., Coral Gables, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683decfo8by"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.258273,25.753056]}},{"properties":{"name":"St. Paul Rodeo Arena","description":"Posted by Baobot20025 4th St., Saint Paul, OR, United StatesThe world\\'s best cowboys and cowgirls compete for top prize money in this exhilarating sport called rodeo.

I St., Tacoma, WA, United StatesIn October of 1918, a group of civic minded community members founded the Tacoma Chapter of the Drama League of America (known as the \"Tacoma Drama League\" or sometimes as the \"Civic Drama League\"). The Drama League of America sought to promote theater and the study of theatrical literature and culture as a means of community building as well as individual enrichment. Many such chapters were started across the United States. The Tacoma Chapter was comprised of the Civic Drama School and the Tacoma Little Theatre (TLT). The Drama League provided oversight, governance, and promoted the two subsidiary wings. While TLT\\'s first fully realized production was not until December of 1919, a production of G B Shaw\\'s You Never Can Tell, The time from 1918 to 1919 was filled with classes, play reading and study. That commitment has been the hallmark of TLT\\'s history. While some gaps maybe found in its production history for various reasons including the Great Depression and World War II, records show that organizational activity has never ceased since those early days in 1918.\r\rToday, TLT is the surviving entity of the original three. As such, it has inherited the responsibilities and goals of all three: Governance, Promotion, Education, and Production. TLT is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors, and is managed by a small professional staff. TLT hires professional directors and contracts designers and other production leadership positions from among those with professional or other significant experience. The actors, crew, ushers, and all other theater functions are accomplished by over 250 volunteers from a four county area giving over 10,000 volunteer hours a year to provide their friends, family, neighbors, co-workers and community with some of the best amateur theater this area has to offer. This puts Tacoma Little Theatre among the largest volunteer driven organizations in Pierce County.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.tacomalittletheatre.com%5C'\">www.tacomalittletheatre.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deejr2cz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.452005,47.262392]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tacoma Main Library","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 1102 Tacoma Avenue South, Tacoma, WA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedavd6m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444401,47.252647]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tacoma Main Library, Olympic Room","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 1102 Tacoma Avenue South, Tacoma, WA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deoq1roy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444401,47.252647]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tacoma Musical Playhouse","description":"Posted by Baobot7116 6th Ave., Tacoma, WA, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dei8wysl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.531627,47.255513]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tailgaters Sports Bar","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2645 E Millbrook Road, Raleigh, NC, United StatesTailgaters features lots of different Sport Events, Great Bands(with No Cover!), Karaoke, Darts, and great drinks and food.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekmk40r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.587797,35.849401]}},{"properties":{"name":"Taipei International Convention Center (TICC)","description":"Posted by BaobotTaipei<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dek0mc4s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[121.449996,25.02]}},{"properties":{"name":"Talula","description":"Posted by Baobot210 23rd St, Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683del9vwz7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.128169,25.798407]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tamara","description":"Posted by Baobot1677 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, FL, United StatesValentine\\'s Day lurks, a week away, and romance is in the air.

It is in Irving, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, and opened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of 5 million. The stadium seats 65,675.\r\rBuilt to replace the aging Cotton Bowl, the stadium was to have originally been a domed stadium, but the stadium could not support the weight of the entire roof, and public funding ran out [citation needed] before the roof support structure could be modified. This resulted in most of the stands being enclosed but not the playing field itself. This unusual arrangement - more commonly seen in European soccer stadiums - prompted Cowboys linebacker D.D. Lewis to make his now-famous quip that the \"hole\" in the stadium\\'s roof was there \"so that God can watch His team.\"<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deh304td"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.908798,32.837596]}},{"properties":{"name":"Texas de Brazil Churrascaria.","description":"Posted by Baobot11401 NW 12th St., Miami, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683degaxdr8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.218458,25.879128]}},{"properties":{"name":"Textile Heritage Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 2406 Glencoe Street, Burlington, NC, United StatesThe Textile Heritage Museum is located in the Company Store and Office Building in the Glencoe Mill Village.

Ethical leadership is concerned with the means as well as the ends to personal and professional achievements. As such, Woodhull has developed a community that encourages women to lead with honesty, respect, courage and compassion; to strive for the common ground in decision- making; and to share in community service.\r\rThe Institute defines ethical leadership as the compassionate use of power with attention to:\r\r    * Community Service\r    * Mediation, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution\r    * Financial and Economic Literacy\r    * Effective and Ethical Speaking\r\rAt Woodhull we understand that all issues are \"women\\'s\" issues from social justice to education, from the constitution to the economy, science, politics, mathematics, Woodhull has reached out to women experts in all fields.

Since the theater\\'s beginnings it has been our policy to admit any person under the age of eighteen for free to any Theater Schmeater production. Additionally, we have produced annual Free Classics in the Park for the past nine years, through which thousands of families have seen the great plays of classical literature at no charge in parks throughout Seattle.\r\rThe Theater is in production year-round, annually presenting 5-6 mainstage shows, 5-6 late night productions and our Free Classic in the Park. Our 2000 season was attended by over 8,100 people at 183 individual performances. Nearly 1,000 people enjoyed the park show and 336 youth took in a show at no cost to them.

Beginning with the restoration of the Pantages and The Rialto theaters 22 years ago, many of our historic buildings and storefronts have undergone face-lifts and refurbishing. This beautification effort, combined with improved roads and the debut of Sound Transit\\'s Tacoma Link Light Rail system, has made Tacoma\\'s historic Theater District more accessible, user-friendly and welcoming for tourists and local residents than ever before. A wide variety of unique merchants and restaurants, state-of-the-art museums, including the Museum of Glass and the new Tacoma Art Museum building, along with The Washington State History Museum, invite you to enrich your cultural senses and explore the new world of Historic Downtown Tacoma.\r\rIn 1975, a group of concerned community volunteers with a strong belief that the arts are essential in stimulating community growth, campaigned and raised money locally to restore Tacoma\\'s Historic Pantages Theater to its original grandeur. Realizing the desperate need for money to keep the doors open, they negotiated with the City of Tacoma to buy the building and to grant funding to the nonprofit organization running the theater. Succeeding in their efforts the Pantages was reopened in 1983. Without the work of these dedicated community volunteers, and the support of the City of Tacoma and its City Council, what became the Broadway Center for the Performing Arts in 1991 would not exist today.\r\rNow, with three unique theaters and our own acclaimed performance series, the Broadway Center serves as a vital and valuable arts steward. The Pantages, a beautiful historic theater seating 1,169 audience members, offers a lush performance experience and is home to The Tacoma Opera, Tacoma City Ballet, Tacoma Philharmonic, Tacoma Concert Band, and Tacoma Symphony. The Rialto, a 742-seat theater that originally served as a grand movie palace, hosts the Tacoma Youth Symphony Association, the Northwest Sinfonietta and the Puget Sound Revels. Theatre on the Square, a 302-seat facility with a contemporary flair, offers a more intimate setting and is home to the Tacoma Actors Guild.\r\rIt is our pleasure to welcome you to Historic Downtown Tacoma and our three exciting theaters filled with rich, cultural performances year-round. Please read on to find out more on the background of each theater. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.broadwaycenter.org%5C'\">www.broadwaycenter.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683desml968"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.444757,47.262563]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thee DollHouse","description":"Posted by Baobot3210 Yonkers Road, Raleigh, NC, United StatesThee DollHouse is an upscale club.

Miami Ave., Miami, FL, United StatesTobacco Road holds the oldest existing liquor license in the history of Dade County. Its 87-year-old history for debauchery has been chronicled in newspapers, magazines, and books. The \"Road\" is not merely a bar, it is a legend. It was a speakeasy and gambling hall during Prohibition years and a hangout of mob boss Al Capone. During World War II all of its licenses were revoked by a Judge on charges of \"lewd, wanton and lascivious\" behavior. Until the early 1980s the police moral squadron annually raided the bar. The \"Road\" has managed to survive Prohibition, hurricanes, the Depression, the revocation of its liquor license and attempts by the city of Miami to have it legally shut down.\r\rIn 1982 Tobacco Road was given a new face on life - the property was purchased by Michael Latterner and Associates Realtors. Latterner asked two FIU hospitality majors to run \"a beat up little dive\" he has just acquired. One of them, Patrick Gleber, at the time manager of a trendy wine bar was apprehensive at first - the neighborhood was rather undesirable. However, it was one block west of Brickell Avenue, booming with all of its new skyscrapers, business offices, towers, and international banks. Gleber took a gamble and hired friends to help. The idea to make the bar a blues nightclub like those found in New York and Chicago was formulated. One friend and customer, Tom Moon, said when he first saw the bar that it was \"a great neighborhood bar without a neighborhood.\" We found it. In a Miami Herald cover story in 1993, a Miami Judge said \"they\\'re turned a dying operation that used to be a hangout for many of the city\\'s down-and-outers into a thriving business patronized by yuppies.\"\r\rHosting acts like Blues greats B.B. King, Koko Taylor, Albert Collins and Jr. Washington have helped Tobacco Road become one of the city\\'s hot spots. Our customers run the gamut from lawyers and bankers to bikers and tuxedoed party revelers. Today, the bar is known worldwide. We feature the best live music Miami has to offer seven nights a week and we serve the highest quality food at very reasonable prices - and of course, we are famous for our great drinks! The bar itself is said to be the longest in Miami\\'s history; it is dark and soothing - an old town sort of feel with all of the comforts of a neighborhood bar and home style cooking to make the comfort reach an even higher level. We are known for our 100% sirloin burgers and hand cut French fries, but if you are smart you\\'ll try the specials - always a treat!\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.tobaccoroad.citysearch.com%5C'\">www.tobaccoroad.citysearch.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683des49jt2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.193377,25.768032]}},{"properties":{"name":"Toi","description":"Posted by Baobot1904 4th Ave., Seattle, WA, United StatesToi was born the vision of the amazing designer, Andrea Maki and the recipes of Toi, mother of Max Borthwick four years ago.

TWIST is actually seven bars in one with each bar having its own unique atmosphere and dÃ©cor. You can literally \"bar hop\" without ever leaving this two story club. TWIST is open seven days a week from 1pm to 5am. Its motto is its mantra - Never a Cover - Always a Groove. Its reputation as a \"must do\" when in Miami is well deserved.\r\rThe first bar that you encounter when entering TWIST is the \"Video Pub\" which artfully combines an English gentlemen\\'s club dÃ©cor with the audio and visual of current music video. Then outside enter a quieter \"Garden\" area with plantings, mood lighting and a bar that features tropical drinks. Step just off this garden and into the tiki, tropical \"Bungalow Bar\", which is best known for \"Gaiety\", a collection of erotic men dancing for your pleasure. On upstairs the ocean breezes flow through the veranda style \"Patio Bar\" As the night thickens past midnight, the size of the crowd is growing in equal proportion to its intensity. The \"Main Room\" DJ is setting the bass and the beat to cutting edge tribal house rhythms. Next door in the more upscale (but equally) packed \"Frolic Lounge\" take in a short show or just step back and observe the ever changing parade of human flesh. Finally you head back downstairs and into the \"Game Room\" for a late night game of pool or video games.\r\rTWIST is located in the popular Washington Avenue nightlife district in the heart of South Beach (which is the southern portion of the city of Miami Beach). It is next door the authentic 11th Street Diner at 1057 Washington Ave. It is two blocks from the Atlantic Ocean and the popular 12th street \"gay\" Beach. The club is within easy walking distance of major hotels, shopping and restaurants and sits in the middle of the city\\'s \"National Art Deco Historical District.\" Miami Beach is gay friendly and the South Beach portion of the city is home to a large gay population. As required by ordinance, entry to TWIST is limited to ages 21 and over.\r\rTWIST is staffed with personable and attractive professionals that truly understand customer service and care about your satisfaction. TWIST continues to embody the same innovative ideals as envisioned in 1993 by founding partner Richard Trainor. Outstanding DJs, hot dancers, friendly bartenders and outrageous female impersonators, combine with thousands of loyal and first-time customers to make TWIST a \"must do\" every night out on South Beach.

The University is comprised of three campuses: the Seattle campus is made up of seventeen schools and colleges whose faculty offer educational opportunities to students ranging from first-year undergraduates through doctoral-level candidates; the Bothell and Tacoma campuses, each developing a distinctive identity and undergoing rapid growth, offer diverse programs to upper-division undergraduates and to graduate students.\r\rThe primary mission of the University of Washington is the preservation, advancement, and dissemination of knowledge. The University preserves knowledge through its libraries and collections, its courses, and the scholarship of its faculty. It advances new knowledge through many forms of research, inquiry and discussion; and disseminates it through the classroom and the laboratory, scholarly exchanges, creative practice, international education, and public service. As one of the nation\\'s outstanding teaching and research institutions, the University is committed to maintaining an environment for objectivity and imaginative inquiry and for the original scholarship and research that ensure the production of new knowledge in the free exchange of facts, theories, and ideas.\r\rTo promote their capacity to make humane and informed decisions, the University fosters an environment in which its students can develop mature and independent judgment and an appreciation of the range and diversity of human achievement. The University cultivates in its students both critical thinking and the effective articulation of that thinking.\r\rAs an integral part of a large and diverse community, the University seeks broad representation of and encourages sustained participation in that community by its students, its faculty, and its staff. It serves both non-traditional and traditional students. Through its three-campus system and through educational outreach, evening degree, and distance learning, it extends educational opportunities to many who would not otherwise have access to them.\r\rThe academic core of the University of Washington is its College of Arts and Sciences; the teaching and research of the University\\'s many professional schools provide essential complements to these programs in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural and mathematical sciences. Programs in law, medicine, forest resources, oceanography and fisheries, library science, and aeronautics are offered exclusively (in accord with state law) by the University of Washington. In addition, the University of Washington has assumed primary responsibility for the health science fields of dentistry and public health, and offers education and training in medicine for a multi-state region of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The schools and colleges of architecture and urban planning, business administration, education, engineering, nursing, pharmacy, public affairs, and social work have a long tradition of educating students for service to the region and the nation. These schools and colleges make indispensable contributions to the state and, with the rest of the University, share a long tradition of educating undergraduate and graduate students toward achieving an excellence that well serves the state, the region, and the nation.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.washington.edu%5C'\">www.washington.edu</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo5socu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.30965,47.65975]}},{"properties":{"name":"University of Washington - Tacoma","description":"Posted by Baobot1900 Commerce St, Tacoma, WA, 98402The University of Washington, Tacoma educates diverse learners and transforms communities by expanding the boundaries of knowledge and discovery.\r\rUW Tacoma provides a world-class education for students pursuing bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degrees.

The result of this collaboration was \"Send Me No Flowers\", which was presented at St. Anthony\\'s Catholic Church Parish Hall for three nights in August. Each night two more rows of seats were added to accommodate all who wanted to attend.\r\r    After this success, the group voted to continue and they formally organized, elected officers and became Renton Little Theatre (RLT).\r\r    The next few years, plays were generally performed in various elementary schools. One exception was the Los Maestros Art Gallery and it eventually became RLT\\'s first headquarters, remodeled gradually to become more like a theatre.\r\r    In 1971, having outgrown the rather inadequate facility, RLT contracted to perform their plays at the newly constructed CARCO Theatre, which was, and still is, under the management of the Renton Parks Department. The next change was in the 1972-73 season, when the group decided to change the name to Valley Community Players.\r\r    We are still Valley Community Players and we still perform four plays each season at CARCO Theatre. We celebrate each closing season with a banquet where awards, determined by a panel of judges, are presented. Our awards are named \"The Vannie\", in honor of Vanecia Adderson, one of the original founders. Vanecia is still a member of Valley Community Players.\r\r    Our mission is still the same: To increase understanding and appreciation of community theatre and to bring quality theatre, at affordable prices, to Renton and the surrounding areas.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.valleycommunityplayers.org%5C'\">www.valleycommunityplayers.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deffa41p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.204204,47.480685]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valley Office Park","description":"Posted by Baobot13 Branch St, Methuen<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dedzpx3f"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.213893,42.706264]}},{"properties":{"name":"Van Dyke Cafe &amp; Loftel","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 846 Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dejent06"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.137089,25.790542]}},{"properties":{"name":"Van Millwork Design Center","description":"Posted by Baobot65 Crawford St, Needham<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deg6kkbi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.227134,42.3063]}},{"properties":{"name":"Van Wezel","description":"Posted by Baobot777 N.

This Dade County commissioner and \"back country\" land promoter envisioned a perfectly designed city as an answer to the uncontrolled sprawl of an emerging Miami. A city of plazas, esplanades and fountains, filled with buildings and homes inspired by a heritage of Mediterranean design. With the help of other visionaries of his time, Merrick\\'s dream became Coral Gables.\r\rAnd today, protected by ordinances that preserve the past by encouraging restoration and revival of this community\\'s historic places, the City Beautiful lives up to its name, existing just as Merrick planned it should be.\r\rIn the midst of one of Coral Gables\\' residential neighborhoods, hidden behind pastel stucco walls and wrought iron gates, is found one of the most special attractions of this special city - Venetian Pool. Perhaps the only swimming pool anywhere to be included in the National Register of Historic Places. Certainly it is the only swimming pool of its kind with its vine-covered loggias, shady porticos, spanish fountain, three-story observation towers and cascading waterfalls that spill into a free-form lagoon complete with coral rock caves and palm-fringed island. Even now, Venetian Pool would still put a twinkle in George Merrick\\'s eye, as it did so many years ago.\r\rFed by underground artesian wells, Venetian Pool was once a quarry pit, its only value being limestone it produced for the construction of that time. Through the creative efforts of Merrick\\'s artist-uncle Denman Fink, and architect Phineas Paist, this eyesore was transformed in 1924 to what was then called Venetian Casino.\r\rDuring its heyday gondolas plied its waters. Esther Williams and Johnny Weismuller of Tarzan fame swam its length. The orchestras of Paul Whitman and Jan Garber serenaded pool side dancers as they swayed beneath the stars on outdoor terrazzo dance floors. Bathing beauties by the hundreds promenaded across specially constructed walkways, while visiting dignitaries passed through the circular aquarium room entry to tour the \"world\\'s most beautiful swimming hole.\" They often listened to three-time Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan deliver speeches for his annual fee of cash and Coral Gables real estate.\r\rToday, over one hundred thousand visitors a year come to Venetian Pool. And three generations of Gables residents, together with their Miami neighbors, have learned to swim here, all captivated by the charm of the setting, and invigorated by the clear, cool water. For Venetian Pool is drained nightly in summer months, its 800,000 gallons of water replenished each day from the subterranean aquifer that flows beneath it. Recently this practice was scheduled to be discontinued in order to preserve South Florida\\'s water supply for an ever increasing population. But, in 1988, a method was found that would allow the pool to replenish its water without diminishing natural resources by recycling the water, via natural ground filtration, back into the aquifer. This new technology together with a concentration on complete restoration of all the surrounding buildings and loggias will insure that this place of beauty will be a joy for many more visitors to discover, for many years to come.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.venetianpool.com%5C'\">www.venetianpool.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683defe3lsi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.273421,25.745998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Ventress Library Gallery","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Webster Street, Marshfield, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekuwtn0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.68891,42.08135]}},{"properties":{"name":"Venue to be confirmed","description":"Posted by BaobotJohannesburg<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dei6bak8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.04,-26.19]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vera Project","description":"Posted by Baobot1916 4th Ave., Seattle, WA, United StatesThe Vera Project (Vera) is what every teenager needs, a music-arts center run by and for youth.  By engaging participants at all levels of music production and community organizing, Vera strives to fulfill its mission to fuel personal and community transformation through the vehicle of popular music shows produced in partnership with young people in Seattle.  \rSince its inception in 2000, Vera has provided a unique resource to Seattle??s youth and music community by maintaining a safe, alcohol and smoke free environment for people of all ages to come together and experience music in a way that transcends commercial entertainment and erases divisions between performer, staff and audience. Vera uses its downtown location as a means to bridge the divisions that exist between neighborhoods and bring people together in a neutral and open space.   Weekly concerts and events fuse with educational programming and a participatory governance structure to give young people an empowering, inclusive sense of music that stresses their ability to positively affect their surroundings, both within the organization and in their daily lives.\r\r \rVera takes the primacy of music in young people??s lives as an opportunity to create learning experiences and build self-awareness and self-esteem in an audience with few chances to express itself otherwise. Through these learning experiences and an emphasis on the process of popular music, Vera promotes critical thinking, empathy, emotional intelligence and civic participation.  Vera uses the power of music as a primary vehicle with which to develop a community of healthy, compassionate and innovative individuals.  Vera??s passionate, patient, and professional approach to popular music has opened up new worlds to thousands of young people, many of whom have never actively taken part in their communities before.  Vera kids become great adults.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.theveraproject.org%5C'\">www.theveraproject.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo1q8g6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.339041,47.612457]}},{"properties":{"name":"Verdi Club","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 2424 Mariposa St., San Francisco<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dei9a4hh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.407632,37.763244]}},{"properties":{"name":"Verizon Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://events.ocregister.com/images/internal/img_6408_primary.jpg\">601 F St Nw, Washington, DCVerizon Center, managed by Washington Sports &amp; Entertainment, LP, is home to the NBA??s Washington Wizards, the WNBA??s Washington Mystics, the NHL??s Washington Capitals, and the Georgetown Hoyas Men??s Basketball team.\r\rLocated in the heart of Chinatown off of the Gallery-Place Chinatown Metro stop, Verizon Center is only a few steps away from the White House and hosts more than 220 events and concerts each year.\r\rSince debuting in December of 1997, the state-of-the-art 00 million sports and entertainment facility has entertained over 21 million patrons with over 1,735 world class sporting events, concerts and family shows.

Located in the heart of Washington State\\'s capital city, The Center has become a community gathering place, providing a focus for the performing arts unique to the region.\r\rWe present our own season of national and international touring artists from a broad spectrum of genres and styles. Our real purpose, however, is to provide the support services needed by the many local performance groups who call the Center home.\r\rOur multi-purpose facility contains a 983-seat proscenium theater with four seating levels and adjacent lobby spaces, as well as a smaller Stage II black box theater with its own lobby. The Center\\'s stages and lobby areas are available for rental - not only for regional performing arts groups and touring artists, but also for workshops, seminars, receptions, parties, video shoots... just about anything you could think of.\r\rOpened in 1985, our facility has played host to thousands of events, with almost 2,000,000 people crossing our threshold. Our history did not start in 1985, however. The Washington Center is really the grandchild of the old Liberty Theater, a 1924 vaudeville house which stood on the same ground the Washington Center does today. The Liberty Theater was renovated and refurbished in 1948, becoming the Olympic Theater movie house. The Olympic was then taken down to just a few exterior walls in the early 1980??s, and completely rebuilt as the Washington Center. While the building\\'s facade still retains elements of the 1924 architecture, the interior is contemporary and modern.\r\rThe Washington Center building is owned by the City of Olympia, and the Washington Center for the Performing Arts is a private, not-for-profit organization with a long-term contract to operate the Center. We are a real success story in public/private partnerships, with each party bringing its strengths to the table.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.washingtoncenter.org%5C'\">www.washingtoncenter.org</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683deo2zma5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.900074,47.043998]}},{"properties":{"name":"Washington Convention Center","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 801 Mount Vernon Place N.W., Washington, DC<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683demjqdf8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.022913,38.902985]}},{"properties":{"name":"Washington State Capitol Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> 211 W. 21st Ave. SW, Olympia, WA, United StatesThe State Capital Museum is dedicated to preserving and interpreting the history and culture of Washington.\r\rLearn about the establishment of Washington\\'s state capital and the construction of the imposing capitol building in the exhibit Olympia: Her Present, Proud Position.\r\rInterior of Museum featuring two floors of exhibits, the museum offers interpretations of regional Native American history and a series of interesting temporary exhibits.

Ms. Barnes complemented our team with substantial experience in managerial administration. Ms. Ewen\\'s comprehensive experience in performing arts and artistic direction is essential to our collaboration as well. Ms. Barnes and Ms. Ewen have been with First Onstage Productions (FOS) since its inception in 1996. As First Onstage built their reputation for presenting artistic excellence in all aspects of their productions the organization grew into a prominent community theater, bridging generational gaps and enriching our geographic region.\r\rCombining the strengths of each of these individuals and building on the artistic reputation that First Onstage has developed, WWCA has created a collaboration with a collective vision. Merging these two entities unifies and fortifies performing arts and educational opportunities in our region. Today this dynamic organization is known as Western Washington Center for the Arts, an organization dedicated to promoting real change in our geographic area.\r\rWWCA has renovated a 1918-historic building nestled in the scenic Sinclair Inlet. We have brought the plans for a 78-seat performing arts center and visual art gallery to fruition and are thrilled to see it taking form. We are excited to be developing this endeavor and providing performers, artists, educators and volunteers a place to promote, present and preserve the arts in Western Washington.\r---<a

Russell St. Portland, OR 97227The White Eagle is one of the most storied joints in the Northwest. And with any good watering hole, the line between fact and fiction--and between this world and the other--seems to have been thoroughly and wonderfully blurred. Tales of ghosts and mortal mischief abound, seemingly with no regard for historic accuracy.\r\rIt is certain that Bronislaw Soboleski and William Hryszko opened the White Eagle Saloon in 1905 essentially as an aid station and meeting place for Polish immigrants. And it was here that organizational meetings for the West Coast\\'s first Polish Catholic church (St. Stanislaus) were held. As the surrounding neighborhood became less Polish and less residential, the White Eagle became an after-work stop for laborers of the nearby docks, rail yards, and factories.\r\rThen in the early \\'70s, rock music and long hair were introduced to the hardhat bar. Surprisingly, it worked out; everyone coexisted under the bark and watchful eye of Tony Ferrone, the gruff, Brooklyn-born bartender. With a steady flow of tequila and a ragged soundtrack provided by the likes of the Holy Modal Rounders, The Eagle soared, establishing a grand live music tradition and a reputation as a place to be. \r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.mcmenamins.com%5C'\">www.mcmenamins.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683des5ryo5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.674824,45.540663]}},{"properties":{"name":"White Lion Cafe","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_coffee_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 146 NW Seventh St., Homestead, FL, United States<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683dekrkvyg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.479459,25.455168]}},{"properties":{"name":"White River Amphitheatre","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 40601 Auburn Enumclaw Rd., Auburn, WA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683delzr0hf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.15399,47.274838]}},{"properties":{"name":"White River Valley Museum","description":"Posted by Baobot<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 918 H St. SE., Auburn, WA, United StatesThe White River Valley Museum is a partnership with the city of Auburn and combines history and culture to create an exciting and educational experience for visitors.

Russell, Portland, OR, United StatesTodayâs Wonder Ballroom was built by The Ancient Order of Hibernians, a group committed to immigration reform, civil rights for those of Irish descent and the preservation of the old Irish culture. Designed by the architecture firm of Jacobberger &amp; Smith, the hall was completed on schedule and the first meeting was held in the new building on September 10, 1914.\r\rBy 1916 membership in the organization reached its peak at 490 members. Although membership tapered off during the next decade, the building remained an active meeting place. During the 1920s when the KKK backed efforts to ban all private and parochial schools in the state, the Hibernians came to the rescue and helped defeat the efforts.\r\rBy 1935 Hibernian membership dwindled to only 30 members and in 1936 the building was turned over to the Catholic Church, which used the building to operate the Catholic Youth Organization. Sporting events were the main attractions for the building and the Portland Boxing School also used the facility until about 1941.\r\rIn 1938 building ownership was transferred to the American Legion Organization and the American Legion Navy Post No. 101 operated in the space. The building was full of activity during World War II, with many events and war updates taking place in the hall. During 1948, some remodeling was done in the auditorium and the ceiling was lowered.\r\rIn 1956 the building was sold to Evelyn Collins, who envisioned a community center and day care facility. In 1957 major remodeling was conducted to update to new building codes, with windows added to the east side of the hall. The Community Center Nursery was established here after the renovation was completed. By 1960 the facility was known as the Christian Community Center and the hall hosted numerous sporting events. In 1975 the name of the facility was changed to honor Grace Collins, Evelynâs late mother who was a strong community activist. The daycare also operated under her name for twenty-five plus years.\r\rOn June 1, 1997 the All-Ireland Cultural Society of Oregon sponsored a day of activities at\rthe Collins Center. The event was held to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the potato famine in Ireland. 1,500 people of Irish descent attended, making it the first Irish event at\rthe hall in 60 years.\r\rBy 2002 the building was shuttered due to deterioration and lack of funds by the Collins estate. In June of 2004 the building was purchased and remodeling was started for the new Wonder Ballroom.\rIn November of 2004 a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places was passed by the State Historic Preservation Office.\r\rWith the newly renovated Wonder Ballroom, Portlanders can now enjoy a restored piece of history\rand a great new venue for performance and events.\r\rNot to mention delicious food and outstanding visual arts.\r---<a href=\"%5C'http://www.wonderballroom.com%5C'\">www.wonderballroom.com</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a683defvhppd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.663822,45.540942]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wonderland Ballroom","description":"Posted by Baobot1290 N.

This was one of those ideas that we had both harbored in private, but talking about it and realizing that we shared each other\\'s enthusiasm made us actually think seriously about finding a space and opening a little restaurant/cafe. What made the idea seem even more appealing was that we both had very similar thoughts about what this restaurant/cafe should be like. We agreed that it should be local (What\\'s the point in owning a cafÃ© if you can\\'t hang out there?). It should be vegetarian but should appeal to everyone (as kelly is a vegetarian and I\\'m a vegan). It should be clean and bright and contemporary (but not contemporary in a cold and trendy way, contemporary in a clean and simple and lighthearted way). It should be relaxed and comfortable, and we should have two tea-robots as our mascots...\r\rAfter a month of looking at real estate we found a wonderful space on Rivington street, in the lower east side of Manhattan, quite close to where Kelly and I each live. The space seemed perfect to us because it faced south (sunny!), was close to where we each lived, it was small, and it had a cute little outdoor space in front. So we signed the lease and then i went on tour and Kelly went to work.\r\rIt\\'s worth noting at this point that neither Kelly nor I had any restaurant experience up until we decided to open teany. Therefore, as I went on tour, Kelly had to learn everything about opening and running a restaurant. She worked with architects and contractors, distributors and city officials, plumbers and etc etc. She worked incredibly hard, and in all honesty I have to say that the lion\\'s share of the credit for teany has to rest with Kelly. I wish that I could take more credit for teany\\'s aesthetic or it\\'s food, but the truth is that Kelly pretty much did everything while I traveled around the world and played concerts and talked about myself to journalists.\r\rteany opened in May of 2002, and for our opening we had a big party. I couldn\\'t believe that we had actually taken teany from an idea shared over breakfast to a functioning restaurant/cafe. Okay, when I say \\'we\\', I of course mean \\'Kelly\\'. I signed the checks and oversaw everything, but as I said earlier, Kelly pretty much did everything.\r\rWhen we first had the idea to open teany we also decided that teany should focus on tea. The reason for this is that tea is healthy, tasty, fascinating, varied, and full of history. Not to mention the fact that we both thought that a small space filled with 96 canisters of tea from around the world just seemed like a cool idea.\r\r(And now I can editorialize a bit and say that I love teany. It\\'s bright and pretty and the food is great and the drinks are great and it\\'s my pride and joy and I know it\\'s shameful for me to gush and wax enthusiastic over teany, but I really do love it.)\r\rOne of our other goals with teany is to make a vegetarian restaurant/cafÃ© where even non-vegetarians are happy to hang out. I have great respect for some of the rigidly strict vegan restaurants in the world, but we wanted teany to be a place wherein everyone feels comfortable, regardless of whether they\\'re vegetarian or vegan or carnivore or what have you.\r\rOne of my favorite things is when a non-vegetarian comes into teany and has our vegan turkey club with a champagne raspbellini followed by a piece of vegan chocolate cheesecake and says to me, \\'Wow, I never knew that vegan and vegetarian food could be so GOOD!\\'\r\rThanks for your interest in teany, and we hope to see you here soon.
