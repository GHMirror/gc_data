Look out for the quail in the brush, and the gophers in the holes everywhere.  Up above you can often spot hawks and vultures circling.  There\\'s some pretty cool flora, too.  This is another place people often let their dogs off-leash, though it is against the rules.  Be considerate of other hikers, look out for bikers and coyotes.  Also, park rangers do patrol the area and will ticket unleashed pets.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ejxvkf1ap4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.554979,37.891247]}},{"properties":{"name":"Land's End","description":"Posted by Birgit<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/51/106123784_e8bc605853_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/56/106106926_3c7751b4b4.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/37/106123708_aa437a08d0.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Land\\'s End, San Francisco, CAThis place rocks.  I went on a fine Saturday afternoon, and it was relatively quiet.  Trails lead off the main path everywhere, with steps going down to at least one beach.  The views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Headlands are awesome.  Look out for people cruising, if you know what I mean.\nStrictly on-leash.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ejxvhcsbom"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.51318,37.780755]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mt Tam State Park Fire Road One","description":"Posted by Birgit<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/41/83635972_51aedb09a5_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/37/83636002_b79e9717c6_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/37/83636040_842f885608_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> panoramic highway and brighton blvd, mill valley, caThis is the paved fire road that descends into the park all the way down to Alice Eastwood group camp (no pets or single/small groups of people allowed overnight, urg).  Early mornings can be breathtaking with views all the way to Land\\'s End in San Francisco, and watching the fog move over the crest of Mount Tam is one of my favorite befuddled-morning-brain non-activities. \nThe walk is easy going enough to take your aging parents down, and my dog enjoys the smells and sounds anyway.  It\\'s rather crowded on the weekends, but on weekdays (especially around six am) it\\'s quiet and beautiful.  Locals let their dogs off leash though it isn\\'t allowed.  Use common sense if you\\'re going to let your dog run free.\nSadly, it leads to many much more interesting trails that are off-limits to dogs.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ejxvtwft59"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.578068,37.911057]}},{"properties":{"name":"Runyon Canyon","description":"Posted by Birgit<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/37/110510746_0486c32ad2_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/54/110510735_9d7ac1c1b8_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/110510716_1b905068cc_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Beautiful off-leash park in the heart of LA.

Follow the signs off Highway 1.  From the parking lot, go to the northern most beach access and head north on the beach (south of this entrance is all state park land: no dogs allowed).  \nFrom here, let the mutt off leash to romp and roll in the dead seal carcasses - this being great white territory, there are some - all the way up to the ... inlet?  Is that what those are called?  Basically, at the end of the beach you can see Bolinas, one of the most guarded or secretive towns on the coast.  Beware of strong outgoing tides, and rip currents: low tide is a great time to go, high tide can be dangerous for water dogs.  Stinsonites are very friendly, as are their dogs.  I\\'ve found the best time of day is very early morning right before you head up or down the coast for one of the most beautiful scenic drives around.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ejxvplquuf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.657547,37.904116]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Boo, cat lover","description":"Posted by Birgit<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/45/106123735_fbed27df6a.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/28/97059191_233aed9104.jpg?v=0\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/40/81867766_28fdfd5f9e.jpg?v=0\">The Boo hails from the same place as Tracy the Astonishing\\'s Sam.

Look for the sign on Pierce Point Road.  From the road it\\'s a fun little stroll through a little wilderness area (very muddy after the rains) with giant lilies growing the path.  Head and down the sandy slope (which is much harder to go up once you\\'ve romped on the beach for an hour) and meet up with the beach by the creek.  \nIt was fairly deserted when I went on a late Friday morning, there was only one other group of women with friendly elderly dogs. \nIt\\'s worth going after the rain for the little waterfalls, and the beach is one of those beautiful pristine northern California beaches that the dogs love.  Lots of birds and sticks, hawks, ravens and vultures circle above.  Apparently, you can spot whales out in the water at the right time of year/day/I don\\'t know.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ejxvjgbiot"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.938213,38.150487]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/221724","metadata":null,"contact_name":"birgit","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:birgit","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/221724","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":11,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=221724,platial:user=birgit","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":46628}
