There are only two people I can think of that I most want to meet, not rock stars or actors, but rather men with wonderfully intelligent minds, Brian Greene being one of them, of course, and the other being Stephen Hawking. I doubt I would have very little to add to the conversations but listening to them speak, for me, is like someone else going to the opera or to the taping of their favorite sitcom.   Just come in April or May, when the weather isn\\'t too hot or too cold. Those are the best months for tenperate weather. Thank you so much for your time.\nShannon Stephenson<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbpoplgmt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.427578,38.567062]}},{"properties":{"name":"Columbia University","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\" href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\">Briangreenelube</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbpzklsc5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9610767365,40.8070530583]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hello from AZ!","description":"Posted by SystemGilbert, AZ<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbpw7iy0e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.788333,33.352778]}},{"properties":{"name":"I love Compton and we love Brian Greene","description":"Posted by MoneeperrycomptonCPT<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbpyfis9s"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.222017,33.892996]}},{"properties":{"name":"Murray, KY","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\" href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\">Briangreenelube</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbq0276ek"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.3081054688,36.6067088864]}},{"properties":{"name":"Okinawa loves Brian Greene!","description":"Posted by Jessicamonkey<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbpt8s4oi"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[129.7265625,28.4590330197]}},{"properties":{"name":"PORTLAND BY LIMO","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\" href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\">Briangreenelube</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/02/3/PARTYBUS_PORTLAND_BY_LIMO.jpg\">portlandLIMOUSINES<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbpmilz9v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.675,45.523611]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Fran","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\" href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html\">Briangreenelube</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a65mbpxymk6p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.448120117,37.6925143553]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stringt Cheese","description":"Posted by 5hane54columbia CAI have numerous points of interest in Greenes theories.
