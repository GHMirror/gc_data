These best track positions and intensity (maximum 1-minute sustained \nsurface wind speed and minimum sea-level pressure) are based on a post-storm assessment of all available data and may \ndiffer from values contained in real-time storm advisories.  In general, they will not reflect the erratic motion implied \nby connecting the individual center fix positions.  The best track is a living database which serves as the official \nU.S. National Weather Service historical record of the tropical cyclone. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas.  \nThe data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed \nby the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the use of these data.\n\nUploaded into Geocommons as shp, dbf, and shx
