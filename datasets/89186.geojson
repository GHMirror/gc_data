This is a transparent tile site, to be used as an overlay in conjunction with other maps. Here you can see examples of the MRGS tiles overlaid on the Afghanistan Grey tiles.\nBackground\n\nThe MGRS is a system of locating places on earth, like latitude and longitude. Unlike latitude and longitude, though, it can represent areas, rather than points, on earth, making very useful for general positioning and planning. Thus, MGRS grid references are used by NATO militaries in all areas of the world. Some humanitarian organizations working on the ground in Afghanistan are also using MRGS coordinates.\n","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://mapbox.com/tileset/military-grid-reference-system-afghanistan","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"MapBox","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://mapbox.com/tileset/military-grid-reference-system-afghanistan","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"mgrs,tile","published":"2014-08-10T23:18:29-04:00","id":89186}
