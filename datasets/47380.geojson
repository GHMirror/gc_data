I went up there last summer on a two week fishing, camping trip.  It was summer time so it was light outside 24 hours a day, and it was a beautiful place.  The only thing I did not like about the place was the enormity of the mosquitoes.  But then again, all of Alaska is like that.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a4csoomvlj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-159.4875,61.57444]}},{"properties":{"name":"Aruba","description":"Posted by CparsonsTalk about deep sea fishing.

We used to go here every other summer for its seclusion.  We would rent a rather large house on the beach for a week or so and just relax.  We would fish on the shore and also go out to sea upwards of 15 miles to catch anything from Amberjack to Snapper to Barracudas.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a4csev9du3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.6765,35.911599]}},{"properties":{"name":"Center Hill Lake","description":"Posted by Cparsons<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/lake_sunrise_01.jpg\">18024 Smithville Hwy, Silver Point, TNNice little weekend trip for some bass fishing.
