The place was accentuated with tables to eat or to have a drink and to hang out, the place has a foosball table with a few arcade games like Black Jack or Pac man. My boyfriend’s friends including Ron, who can sometimes be a dramatic nice guy with a lot of ups and downs, Joe a sort of indecisive person with somewhat could be classified  as an ultimate geek, Candace is an easy to talk to and fun to be around and quite a party girl. The light is excessively dim with a big light to hang over the billiard table. I grab my pool stick and line up to take my shot. With the ball rolling on the upper right pocket, it ricochets off the other ball and ended up missing the shot. As it turns out, I did not win many games and just was there for the fun of it. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw2ufprqv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.46507,41.8446]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cd's House","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILFew Friends\n\nMy boyfriend’s friends Joe, Ron, and Hubert along with another friend Sandra came to hang out and have a good time. Sandra wanted to burn a few CD’s. We were holding glasses of Polish Vodka called Zubrowka mixed with apple juice and it was scrumptiously good. The weather outside was pretty nice. We proceeded outside the back door and walked around talking about random events like work and school. Some of the music and movies were given to me to give me some entertainment to do in my spare of time incase I am bored with no school work to do. I did not drink excessively even though the alcoholic drinks were very good. Ron was walking and stumblingly outside, which I do not if the drinks made him a little tipsy or he was just a little dizzy and didn’t feel so well. There was no special occasion being celebrated, but I do remember that since my boyfriend has a Polish background that his heritage and alcohol are intermixed. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw2mca1dp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Alegre Burrito","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 7193 W Grand Ave, Chicago, ILMexican Talk\n\nFrom my boyfriend’s house is an excellent Mexican restaurant. I am staring up at the menu trying to decide what I would like to munch on. I originally wanted to order a chicken enchilada. The inside of the restaurant looked like a diner with a pieces of candy and TV’s that were playing Spanish soap operas and Mexican decorations hanging all around. Behind the counter, there are a lot of ads in Spanish, adds more meaning to the atmosphere. Due to much convincing, my boyfriend told me to order a double cheeseburger. Double Cheeseburgers are supposedly a famous trademark of the place and one of my boyfriend’s friends works there and makes very good ones. I knew since I loved him so much that I would trust his opinion. As soon as I walk in there, there was no aroma that grabbed my attention, but just trying to get some that would spark my appetite. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw2ytztqn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.8059,41.923799]}},{"properties":{"name":"El Gordo","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILPicture Perfect Burrito:\nI must of had numerous highlights of visiting different Mexican restaurants on my spring break. The restaurant was called El Gordo. The decorations are Mexican-authentic looking and the walls are nicely accessorized with beautiful and gorgeous artwork with beautiful colors on the walls like light oranges and reds. There were a few waitresses wandering around that spoke very little English. They were dressed up kind of like Jennifer Lopez in the Maid in Manhattan movie, which was a gray dress with a white apron with their head nicely put up in a bun. It did not bother me that she was speaking Spanish because their dialect was speaking really slowly. I actually understand a little Spanish from my high school classes. My boyfriend was not that hungry, but I decided to order a burrito. When it was place in front of me, it was one of the biggest burritos I have ever seen. The burrito was intermixed with lettuce, tomatoes, chicken, vegetables, and beans whipped up in a big shell. Our waitress gave us a wicker basket that was filled with Tostitos chips with a side of hot and spicy salsa. Everything that I tasted in the palette of my mouth was amazing and fresh, I could feel the scrumptious food in the stomach being filled. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw2zj4sb0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"House","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILPlay station Mastery:\n\nI am bopped down on my bottom playing video games. I forget what it is called, but the object of the game is to steal the sheep from the pasture. My opponent is my boyfriend and we also play on the computer. I try my very best, but I know that we play for the pure fun of it. His walls are white with cracks that are chipped and dirty. His room has two desks with two computers (one is his and the other one is his brothers), two beds, his TV with play station, CD rack and tons of clothes scattered all over the floor. Right along his bed, he has a metal gothic group called Gorgoroth, who is a group that likes to wear accessories and masks. It is a typical guy vs girl war trying to win a game, but he is very skilled at shooting type of games, but just know that it is all for fun.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw2vezqzx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.814985,41.925485]}},{"properties":{"name":"Little Caesar's Pizza","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Elmwood Park, ILCheeser Cheeser:\n\nMy boyfriend, his friend Hubert and I decided that we needed a change of adventure. We decided to take a walk down around a Chicago suburb called Elmwood Park. We walked to Little Caesar’s Pizza. When we got there, we sat down a round table and ordered two pizzas with a couple of orders of Crazy Bread. From the table, we couple smell the baked cheese and garlic that made our tongues water with taste. When our waitress placed the pizza the pizza on the table, we began to divide up the food. Crazy Bread is a long breadsticks with a garlic buttery aroma taste. When the food was placed, our eyes bogged out and we were sitting on the edge of seat waiting to dive in. What was the most amazing thing about the experience was that Hubert, was able to stuff down a whole pizza and an entire order of Crazy Bread by himself. Our mouths dropped in amazement and it looked like he hadn’t eaten anything in three days. \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw3236xvv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Movie Night","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Elmwood Park, ILSlaughter Massacre:\n\nJudging on what movie to watch, my boyfriend and I in his room was the Texas Chain Saw Massacre the Beginning, which is a pretty gruesome movie filled with blood and guts. No movie watching was going to go along without having some Farm Hard Lemonade (maybe kind of similar to Mike’s Hard Lemonade). With the lights turned out to minimize the dim effect, I do remember the most gruesome part of the movie. I especially remember a part when a man tried to avenge the murder of his girlfriend and he got knocked out and fill on the top of the chainsaw and chainsaw started and sliced throughout his body. Through being scared, I had to hide my eyes on my boyfriend’s shoulders. Also from finishing the lemonade, I drank some Smirnoff’s Ice while my bones were shaking in the chair praying not to get scared.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw2myt94w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Party Hardy","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> Elmwood Park, ILParty Hardy\n\nThere was a party at my boyfriend’s house. Ron, Joe and Candace came to the party. When I was sitting on the couch in the living room listening to the bass beats to a certain type of music like Disturbed and Rammstein. This party was partially about our one year anniversary that I had with my boyfriend. I knew it probably would be good ideas to buy him a rare remix of his favorite type of music. Some of my other gifts that I included were limited box edition, a poster, a patch (which can be put on clothing or bag), and autographed poster. While opening his presents, we had tall bottles of Smirnoff’s Ice to drink. At the party, once he opened the CD, he immediately wanted to play and hear the intense sound banging on his ears. There is something in the Polish background that is called the “Polish factor.” Most parties tend to include alcohol and polish people think it intermixes with parties well.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw2sdmtce"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.809167,41.921111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Puzzles","description":"Posted by Kdsjcgrl1324Indianapolis, INSudoku Solves\nI am crammed in between people trying to concentrate on my fairly easy sudoku puzzles. I am on a charter bus that is about to leave Indianapolis so I can go visit my boyfriend who lives in Chicago.The way I got here is from leaving Wittenburg University in Springfield, Ohio. Our school is currently on spring break right now.  I am really anxious to see him, but I need something to keep myself entertained. Even if I am not doing the puzzles, I either sleep or find someone on the bus that I can talk to, or else I work on homework. I have a book with close to 500 puzzles in it. I do not have a specific strategy besides logic and process of elimination to solve them. Sometimes I might do these in Chicago if my boyfriend gets busy with something else or has to attend a class. Working diligently, I flip to page 170. My pencil hits the page marking down the appropriate number. I gaze between the lines and try to figure out what options I can rule out. When I know I am doing well it gives a sense of confidence. I like the sudoku puzzles because they pass time and fun to do, and keep my mind challenged and sharp. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6rgw31yfx0c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.248748,39.900437]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/20781","metadata":null,"contact_name":"kdsjcgrl1324","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:kdsjcgrl1324","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/20781","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":9,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=20781,platial:user=kdsjcgrl1324","published":"2010-04-24T16:00:00Z","id":39925}
