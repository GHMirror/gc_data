Although it is not technically out of the country I am counting it because it was pretty far away and not everyone just goes to Alaska for the heck of it. Alaska was beautiful and full of wildlife. After the cruise we continued further into Alaska and stayed in a few cool lodges, hiked a lot, and did many other outdoor activities! One of my favorite things I have ever done in my life was in Alaska. We got to ride a helicopter up into the mountains and land on a glacier. There we got out and \"explored\" it was amazing and I have way to much to say about it so I will stop.  :)<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642cun18tc5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-154.570999,61.288314]}},{"properties":{"name":"Athens and Greek Isles, Greece","description":"Posted by Kfische2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN5153.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN5159.JPG\">Athens, GreeceCan you say shocking?! I was suprised at how dirty and crowded a lot of Athens actually was. My junior year of high school my family went to Greece for our Spring Break. This has to be one of the highlites of my life!

In London we had 5 days to tour the city and of course see as many sights and historical landmarks as possible.

We put on a day camp for the orphans on the Island of Nassau. Everyone thinks of Atlantis when you talk of the Bahamas but the truth is there are many poverty stricken people on just the opposite side of the island. I learned a lot on this mission trip and also got to experience the luxury aspect of the Bahamas for a day or so as well.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642cuzx0860"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.330001,25.059999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Paris, France","description":"Posted by Kfische2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN0591.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/10/2/DSCN0660.JPG\">Paris, FranceThis has to be one of my favorite places that I have visited.
