Of the 126 workers that were on the rig at the time 11 died in the resulting explosions. The rig burned for two days, finally sinking on April 22nd. Shortly thereafter it was found that the wellhead, on the ocean-floor 1,500 meters below, had been damaged and was leaking oil into the water. The first estimates of the spill rate were at 1,000 barrels per day, later estimates during May and June once underwater footage of the leaking well had been released moved the figure from 5 to 25 thousand barrels per day, and finally to 35-60 thousand barrels per day. This is equal to an Exxon Valdez disaster every four to seven days. The Ixtoc I oil well in the southern Gulf of Mexico which suffered a similar blowout in 1980 took nearly a full 10 months to be capped, and several attempts by BP to stop the Deepwater Horizon flow failed before it could finally be contained on July 15.The oil slick spread quickly over the ocean surface, covering 1,500 square kilometers (580 sq miles) by April 25 and over 6,500 square kilometers (2,500 sq miles) by the beginning of May. Hundreds of kilometers of the Louisiana shoreline was contaminated, including several wildlife refuges important for sea turtles as well as hundreds of species of birds.

The oil contaminated shoreline from Brest to Saint Brieuc, and even as far east as the Channel Islands.","Photo_credit":"(NOAA)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.716667,48.583333]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-4.666893,50.401232],[-4.965199,50.39434],[-5.260467,50.366868],[-5.549097,50.319151],[-5.8276,50.251773],[-6.092643,50.165552],[-6.341108,50.061532],[-6.57013,49.940965],[-6.777136,49.805288],[-6.959877,49.656108],[-7.116443,49.495174],[-7.245288,49.324355],[-7.345227,49.145613],[-7.415444,48.96098],[-7.455485,48.772531],[-7.465244,48.582359],[-7.444956,48.392554],[-7.395174,48.205177],[-7.31675,48.022241],[-7.210815,47.845692],[-7.078756,47.677388],[-6.922191,47.519082],[-6.742947,47.372411],[-6.543037,47.238876],[-6.324638,47.119836],[-6.090067,47.016494],[-5.841762,46.929887],[-5.582257,46.860881],[-5.31417,46.810162],[-5.040174,46.778235],[-4.762984,46.765414],[-4.485337,46.771828],[-4.209973,46.797412],[-3.939616,46.841914],[-3.676957,46.904892],[-3.424633,46.985719],[-3.185207,47.08359],[-2.961154,47.197523],[-2.754832,47.326369],[-2.568467,47.468822],[-2.40413,47.623425],[-2.263711,47.788586],[-2.148902,47.962588],[-2.061169,48.143607],[-2.001731,48.329724],[-1.971535,48.518947],[-1.971236,48.709228],[-2.001178,48.898485],[-2.061369,49.084622],[-2.151474,49.265556],[-2.270796,49.439238],[-2.418276,49.603679],[-2.592487,49.756978],[-2.791638,49.897342],[-3.013592,50.023115],[-3.25588,50.132799],[-3.515732,50.225079],[-3.790109,50.298841],[-4.075744,50.353188],[-4.369195,50.387458],[-4.666893,50.401232]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"1972-1992 : ChevronTexaco Amazon oil spill","end time":{"end_time":"2003/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2002-12-31","granularity":"day","time":"2002/12/31 00:00:00 -0500"},"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.mofilms.org/justicianow/\"><b>Justicia Now!</b> : a documentary about Chevron Texaco's legacy in the Amazon</a>• <a href=\"http://www.chevrontoxico.com/section.php?id=3\">ChevronToxico: Texaco in Ecuador</a>• <a href=\"http://www.amazonwatch.org/newsroom/index.php?type=video\">Amazon Watch: Newsroom</a>• <a href=\"http://www.rainforestrelief.org/Campaigns/ChevronTexaco/ChevronTexaco_s_Legacy_in_Ecuador.html\">Rainforest Relief: Texaco's Legacy of Pollution in the Amazon</a>• <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE1D81731F930A15753C1A9659C8B63\">New York Times:  Texaco Goes on Trial in Ecuador Pollution Case</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"165,000 to 171,000 tonnes","Cause":"Waste product dumping","Photo_align":"left","Location":"Ecuadorian Amazon","Photo_text":"Texaco's Ecuador Operation.","Overlay":"<img src=\"http://www.google.com/earth/gallery/images/kml_feed_small.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"> <a href=\"http://www.tryse.net/spill/Texaco%20Ecuador.kml\">Map of Texaco's Operations in Ecuador</a> (ChevronToxico.com)","Date_range":"1972 - June 1992","id":"a634qstt3yps","description":null,"Photo":"toxico_smoke.jpg","PrevID":9,"NextID":11,"begin time":{"end_time":"1972/01/02 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1972-01-01","granularity":"day","time":"1972/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"Type":"Drilling Operations","extra_block":"  <a href=\"#video_texaco;balloonFlyto\"><img src=\"http://mw1.google.com/mw-video/common_files/yt.png\" width=\"42\">View movie clip in Google Earth</a>.","Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>50,820,000 - 52,668,000<b>In barrels: </b>1,209,450 - 1,253,430","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"ChevronTexaco Amazon oil spill","Impact":"<b>In 1993 a number of Indian tribes from the Ecuadorian Amazon filed a lawsuit against Texaco</b> for ruining their rivers and land, causing widespread devastation to the rainforest environment, and creating a dramatically increased risk of cancer for tens of thousands of people. The lawsuit states that Texaco dumped millions of gallons of waste oil products into the pristine rainforest river environment rather than re-inject it back into the well which is the industry practice in other parts of the world. Water and soil samples taken in the rainforest by toxicologists indicate life-threatening levels of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene\">Benzene</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene\">Toluene</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylenes\">Xylenes</a>, and highly carcinogenic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon\">Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</a>.  Texaco extracted oil from the Ecuadorian Amazon from 1972 to 1992 at the rate of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels per day. An estimated <b>18.5 billion gallons of toxic waste water products</b> were dumped into the river system or left in open, unlined pits during this time. While it is difficult to say exactly how many million gallons of crude oil this would correspond to, current estimates are at around three times the amount spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster. The area that has been contaminated is roughly the size of the state of Rhode Island. In June of 1992 Texaco withdrew from Ecuador, but many areas are still in need of cleanup operations and local peoples have still not been compensated. In some villages near polluted water sources, the rate of cancer is 1,000 times higher than the historical norm for the area, and hundreds of open-air leaking toxic waste pits still remain in the jungle without any cleanup performed. In addition, <b>16.8 million gallons of crude oil</b> has also been spilled directly from pipelines by ChevronTexaco's operations in the area.<b>This placemark</b> marks the Sacha Sur area which was among the places reviewed during the lawsuit in March 2006.

Shortly thereafter it was found that the wellhead, on the ocean-floor 1,500 meters below, had been damaged and was leaking oil into the water. The first estimates of the spill rate were at 1,000 barrels per day, later estimates during May and June once underwater footage of the leaking well had been released moved the figure from 5 to 25 thousand barrels per day, and finally to 35-60 thousand barrels per day. This is equal to an Exxon Valdez disaster every four to seven days. The Ixtoc I oil well in the southern Gulf of Mexico which suffered a similar blowout in 1980 took nearly a full 10 months to be capped, and several attempts by BP to stop the Deepwater Horizon flow failed before it could finally be contained on July 15.The oil slick spread quickly over the ocean surface, covering 1,500 square kilometers (580 sq miles) by April 25 and over 6,500 square kilometers (2,500 sq miles) by the beginning of May.

The lawsuit states that Texaco dumped millions of gallons of waste oil products into the pristine rainforest river environment rather than re-inject it back into the well which is the industry practice in other parts of the world. Water and soil samples taken in the rainforest by toxicologists indicate life-threatening levels of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene\">Benzene</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene\">Toluene</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylenes\">Xylenes</a>, and highly carcinogenic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon\">Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</a>.  Texaco extracted oil from the Ecuadorian Amazon from 1972 to 1992 at the rate of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels per day. An estimated <b>18.5 billion gallons of toxic waste water products</b> were dumped into the river system or left in open, unlined pits during this time. While it is difficult to say exactly how many million gallons of crude oil this would correspond to, current estimates are at around three times the amount spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster. The area that has been contaminated is roughly the size of the state of Rhode Island. In June of 1992 Texaco withdrew from Ecuador, but many areas are still in need of cleanup operations and local peoples have still not been compensated. In some villages near polluted water sources, the rate of cancer is 1,000 times higher than the historical norm for the area, and hundreds of open-air leaking toxic waste pits still remain in the jungle without any cleanup performed. In addition, <b>16.8 million gallons of crude oil</b> has also been spilled directly from pipelines by ChevronTexaco's operations in the area.<b>This placemark</b> marks the Sacha Sur area which was among the places reviewed during the lawsuit in March 2006.

Major drilling operations in the half-million hectare area started in 1975. In a similar situation to the <a href=\"#9;balloon\">Texaco Ecuador</a> operation, poor standards no longer legal in most countries were used - including the dumping of waste oil products into the pristine rainforest river environment instead of re-injecting back underground. An estimated 9 billion barrels of toxic waste water products were dumped during the 30 years of operation by Occidental - an average of 850,000 barrels per day.The area which Block 1AB occupies is an <b>indigenous territory</b>, home to the <a href=\"http://www.achuarperu.org/en/\"><b>Achuar</b></a> people for thousands of years. Many children and adults in the Achuar communities downstream of the drilling operations now have dangerously high levels of lead and cadmium in their blood, and are suffering other ill effects of the petroleum extraction activities. Fish and game which the Achuar communities depend on has also declined due to the extensive pollution in the area. In 1984 the Peruvian government named Block 1-AB <i>'the country's most damaged environmental region'</i>.In 2000 Occidental Petroleum sold the rights for Block 1AB to <b>Pluspetrol</b>, an Argentinean company. Pluspetrol has continued to use the substandard infrastructure and production methods left behind by Occidental, and the contamination of the Achuar land continues today.<b>In 2007 the Achuar communities filed a lawsuit</b> in the US against Occidental Petroleum for polluting their rivers and drinking water with carcinogenic hydrocarbon compounds and heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic. Ill effects experienced by the Achuar include an increased risk of cancer, and lead poisoning is widespread among Achuar children. The Achuar is currently waiting to hear if the case will be accepted in US courts.The Peruvian government is currently opening up a number of new areas to oil company bidding - in the last few years the proportion of the Peruvian Amazon zoned into hydrocarbon blocks has increased from 13% to 70%. Several of the new proposed blocks overlap indigenous territories, natural protected areas, or reserves for indigenous peoples who live in voluntary isolation.","Photo_credit":"(Amazon Watch)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.429546,-2.803633]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-76.412872,-1.848849],[-76.512813,-1.852335],[-76.611844,-1.866235],[-76.708881,-1.8904],[-76.802863,-1.924562],[-76.892762,-1.96835],[-76.977595,-2.021284],[-77.056434,-2.082785],[-77.128415,-2.15218],[-77.192751,-2.228711],[-77.248737,-2.311538],[-77.295759,-2.399758],[-77.3333,-2.492403],[-77.360949,-2.58846],[-77.3784,-2.686878],[-77.385461,-2.786578],[-77.38205,-2.88647],[-77.368203,-2.985458],[-77.344069,-3.082459],[-77.30991,-3.176409],[-77.266096,-3.266277],[-77.213107,-3.35108],[-77.151519,-3.429885],[-77.082009,-3.501828],[-77.005335,-3.56612],[-76.922339,-3.622054],[-76.83393,-3.669016],[-76.741079,-3.706491],[-76.644806,-3.734066],[-76.546167,-3.751438],[-76.446247,-3.758417],[-76.346143,-3.754926],[-76.246956,-3.741002],[-76.149775,-3.7168],[-76.055668,-3.682585],[-75.965668,-3.638733],[-75.880764,-3.585725],[-75.801885,-3.524145],[-75.729898,-3.454669],[-75.665591,-3.378058],[-75.609666,-3.295155],[-75.562735,-3.206868],[-75.525311,-3.114166],[-75.497801,-3.018066],[-75.480503,-2.91962],[-75.473604,-2.819908],[-75.477177,-2.720023],[-75.491181,-2.621057],[-75.515459,-2.524094],[-75.549743,-2.430197],[-75.593657,-2.340392],[-75.646719,-2.255663],[-75.708345,-2.176937],[-75.777862,-2.105076],[-75.854507,-2.040864],[-75.937442,-1.985005],[-76.02576,-1.93811],[-76.118493,-1.900692],[-76.214628,-1.873161],[-76.313114,-1.855816],[-76.412872,-1.848849]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"In Focus: Contesting Oil's Legacy","end time":null,"Link_section":null,"Tonnes_spilled_range":null,"Cause":null,"Photo_align":null,"Location":null,"Photo_text":null,"Overlay":null,"Date_range":null,"id":"a634qsw5cykb","description":"\r\n\r\n<b>In Focus: Contesting Oil's Legacy</b>\r\n<b>Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pulitzercenter.org/showproject.cfm?id=32\">\r\nVisit the <b>Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</b> to find out more.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>This placemark</b> marks the Rio Corrientes, one of the areas polluted by Occidental Petroleum's operation in the Peruvian Amazon.\r\n<a href=\"#55;balloonFlyto\"> &lt; &lt; Back </a>\r\n","Photo":null,"PrevID":null,"NextID":null,"begin time":null,"Type":null,"extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":null,"Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":null,"Impact":null,"Photo_credit":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.726011,-2.495682]}},{"properties":{"name":"2003 : Tasman Spirit","end time":{"end_time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2010-12-31","granularity":"day","time":"2010/12/31 00:00:00 -0500"},"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/case-histories/index.html#tasman-spirit\">ITOPF: Tasman Spirit</a>• <a href=\"http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/crisis/tasmin/index.cfm\">WWF: Karachi oil spill, Pakistan</a> • <a href=\"http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/tasman_spirit/tasman_spirit.htm\">Cedre.fr: Tasman Spirit</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"27,000 to 30,000 tonnes","Cause":"Ran aground at port entrance","Photo_align":"center","Location":"Karachi Port, Pakistan","Photo_text":"The Tasman Spirit.","Overlay":null,"Date_range":"28 Jul 2003","id":"a634qssv5m8m","description":null,"Photo":"tasman_spirit_unk_heloaft_sunk.jpg","PrevID":55,"NextID":57,"begin time":{"end_time":"2003/01/02 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2003-01-01","granularity":"day","time":"2003/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"Type":"Oil tanker","extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>8,316,000 - 9,240,000<b>In barrels: </b>197,910 - 219,900","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"Tasman Spirit","Impact":"<b>On July 27th, 2003 the Tasman Spirit grounded</b> at the entrance to Karachi Port, Pakistan carrying 67,800 tonnes of light crude oil.

Dead fish and finless porpoise were found on the beaches.Clifton Beach could finally be re-opened to the public in October 2003.","Photo_credit":"(CTX)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[67.001499,24.791912]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[67.019442,25.718052],[66.911898,25.714642],[66.805359,25.701047],[66.701018,25.677419],[66.600041,25.644021],[66.503556,25.60123],[66.412636,25.549522],[66.328289,25.489476],[66.251443,25.421761],[66.182943,25.347131],[66.123531,25.266416],[66.07385,25.180512],[66.034426,25.090369],[66.005673,24.996983],[65.987882,24.901382],[65.981223,24.804619],[65.985743,24.707755],[66.001367,24.611849],[66.027899,24.517948],[66.065026,24.427076],[66.112322,24.340221],[66.169255,24.258323],[66.235189,24.182271],[66.309397,24.112886],[66.391067,24.050917],[66.479308,23.997031],[66.573164,23.951809],[66.67162,23.915735],[66.773617,23.889199],[66.878058,23.872484],[66.983822,23.86577],[67.089776,23.869129],[67.194784,23.882525],[67.297719,23.905814],[67.397475,23.938746],[67.49298,23.980968],[67.583202,24.032026],[67.667164,24.091371],[67.743954,24.158364],[67.812731,24.232281],[67.87274,24.312326],[67.923312,24.397631],[67.963882,24.487272],[67.993986,24.580275],[68.013273,24.675628],[68.021509,24.77229],[68.018578,24.869205],[68.004485,24.96531],[67.979359,25.05955],[67.943452,25.150887],[67.897137,25.238312],[67.840903,25.320859],[67.775354,25.397613],[67.701202,25.46772],[67.619256,25.530402],[67.530418,25.584958],[67.435672,25.63078],[67.33607,25.667355],[67.232722,25.694275],[67.126784,25.711237],[67.019442,25.718052]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"1997 : Evoikos","end time":{"end_time":"2008/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2007-12-31","granularity":"day","time":"2007/12/31 00:00:00 -0500"},"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/precis.php5?key=19971015_001\">CTX: Evoikos</a>• <a href=\"http://www.itopf.com/_assets/documents/paj_98.pdf\">ITOPF: The Evoikos and Pontoon 300 incidents (PDF)</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"25,000 to 29,000 tonnes","Cause":"Ship collision","Photo_align":"left","Location":"Singapore Strait","Photo_text":"The Evoikos anchored after the collision.","Overlay":null,"Date_range":"15 Oct 1997","id":"a634qslwom2e","description":null,"Photo":"Evoikos_1055.jpg","PrevID":56,"NextID":58,"begin time":{"end_time":"1997/01/02 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1997-01-01","granularity":"day","time":"1997/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"Type":"Oil tanker","extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>7,700,000 - 8,932,000<b>In barrels: </b>183,250 - 212,570","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"Evoikos","Impact":"<b>The two tankers Evoikos and Orapin Global collided in the Singapore Strait</b> on the evening of October 15, 1997.

The tourism industry was also hit, and environmental organizations expressed fears for the green turtle population, as the turtle eggs usually hatch on the Lebanese beaches during the month of July.","Photo_credit":"(Wikipedia)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.399165,33.647668]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[35.417366,34.506972],[35.308274,34.503801],[35.200209,34.491155],[35.094389,34.469178],[34.992006,34.438118],[34.894211,34.398324],[34.802095,34.350245],[34.716685,34.294422],[34.638922,34.23148],[34.569661,34.162124],[34.509651,34.08713],[34.459537,34.007332],[34.419845,33.923616],[34.390984,33.83691],[34.373239,33.748172],[34.366771,33.658377],[34.371616,33.568512],[34.387684,33.47956],[34.414768,33.39249],[34.452539,33.308249],[34.500559,33.227751],[34.558281,33.151865],[34.625059,33.081411],[34.700153,33.017146],[34.782741,32.959759],[34.871925,32.909866],[34.96674,32.868],[35.066169,32.834607],[35.169146,32.810045],[35.274572,32.794575],[35.381324,32.788361],[35.488265,32.79147],[35.594259,32.803868],[35.698176,32.825424],[35.798908,32.855908],[35.895377,32.894995],[35.986548,32.942267],[36.071438,32.99722],[36.149125,33.059266],[36.218761,33.127738],[36.279578,33.201901],[36.330898,33.280956],[36.37214,33.364049],[36.402828,33.45028],[36.422597,33.538712],[36.431199,33.628381],[36.428504,33.718309],[36.414506,33.807508],[36.389325,33.894999],[36.353205,33.979817],[36.306511,34.061021],[36.249734,34.137713],[36.183479,34.209037],[36.10846,34.274199],[36.025498,34.332469],[35.935508,34.383194],[35.839487,34.425804],[35.738508,34.459819],[35.633704,34.484857],[35.526252,34.500634],[35.417366,34.506972]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"1999 : Erika","end time":{"end_time":"2010/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2009-12-31","granularity":"day","time":"2009/12/31 00:00:00 -0500"},"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/case-histories/index.html#erika\">ITOPF: Erika</a>• <a href=\"http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/erika/erika.htm\">Cedre.fr: Erika</a> • <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7192085.stm\">BBC News: Total guilty of French oil spill</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"19,000 to 28,000 tonnes","Cause":"Broke in two in bad weather","Photo_align":"left","Location":"Bay of Biscay, France","Photo_text":"The Erika sinking after splitting in two.","Overlay":null,"Date_range":"12 Dec 1999","id":"a634qssljayf","description":null,"Photo":"Erika-large.jpg","PrevID":60,"NextID":62,"begin time":{"end_time":"1999/01/02 00:00:00 -0500","original":"1999-01-01","granularity":"day","time":"1999/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"Type":"Oil tanker","extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>5,852,000 - 8,624,000<b>In barrels: </b>139,270 - 205,240","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"Erika","Impact":"<b>The Erika tanker started breaking in two</b> 60 miles from the coast of Brittany in bad weather on December 11th, 1999.

In total over 50 kilometers (30 miles) of shoreline was oiled by this spill.","Photo_credit":"(NOAA)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.716667,27.6]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-82.708705,28.002728],[-82.756426,28.001251],[-82.803707,27.995362],[-82.850024,27.985126],[-82.894864,27.970656],[-82.937731,27.952112],[-82.978154,27.929701],[-83.015685,27.903668],[-83.049912,27.874304],[-83.080461,27.84193],[-83.106998,27.806906],[-83.129234,27.769616],[-83.146929,27.730472],[-83.159894,27.689904],[-83.16799,27.648358],[-83.171136,27.60629],[-83.169302,27.564161],[-83.162513,27.522432],[-83.15085,27.481561],[-83.134446,27.441993],[-83.113484,27.40416],[-83.088198,27.368475],[-83.058867,27.335327],[-83.025814,27.305076],[-82.989401,27.278052],[-82.950025,27.254547],[-82.908116,27.234818],[-82.864131,27.219077],[-82.818546,27.207497],[-82.771858,27.200202],[-82.72457,27.197272],[-82.677198,27.198738],[-82.630253,27.204584],[-82.584244,27.214748],[-82.539672,27.229118],[-82.497019,27.24754],[-82.45675,27.269812],[-82.419303,27.295694],[-82.385088,27.324905],[-82.354478,27.357126],[-82.327811,27.392007],[-82.305379,27.429168],[-82.287433,27.468205],[-82.274172,27.508691],[-82.265748,27.550184],[-82.262256,27.592231],[-82.263742,27.63437],[-82.270195,27.676142],[-82.28155,27.717086],[-82.297686,27.756753],[-82.318433,27.794708],[-82.343566,27.830531],[-82.372813,27.86383],[-82.405854,27.894235],[-82.442328,27.921412],[-82.481834,27.94506],[-82.523938,27.964918],[-82.568175,27.980766],[-82.614055,27.992428],[-82.661072,27.999776],[-82.708705,28.002728]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"2006 : Solar I","end time":{"end_time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2010-12-31","granularity":"day","time":"2010/12/31 00:00:00 -0500"},"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/solar/solar.htm\">Cedre.fr: Solar I</a>• <a href=\"http://earth.esa.int/ew/oil_slicks/Philippines_oil_aug06/Philippines_oil-Aug06.htm\">European Space Agency: Philippines, August 2006</a> • <a href=\"http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/index.cfm?uNewsID=78300\">WWF: Large oil spill in the Philippines threatens marine ecosystem</a> • <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17385\">NASA: Oil Spill near Guimaras Island</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"172 to 1,540 tonnes","Cause":"Sank in bad weather","Photo_align":"center","Location":"Guimaras Strait, Philippines","Photo_text":"Oil on the coast of Sitio Nauway Island in the Philippines.","Overlay":"<img src=\"http://www.google.com/earth/gallery/images/kml_feed_small.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"> <a href=\"http://www.tryse.net/spill/WWF%20Guimaras%20Spill%20Overlay.kml\">Overlay Map</a> of the Solar I spill.

Many children and adults in the Achuar communities downstream of the drilling operations now have dangerously high levels of lead and cadmium in their blood, and are suffering other ill effects of the petroleum extraction activities. Fish and game which the Achuar communities depend on has also declined due to the extensive pollution in the area. In 1984 the Peruvian government named Block 1-AB <i>'the country's most damaged environmental region'</i>.In 2000 Occidental Petroleum sold the rights for Block 1AB to <b>Pluspetrol</b>, an Argentinean company. Pluspetrol has continued to use the substandard infrastructure and production methods left behind by Occidental, and the contamination of the Achuar land continues today.<b>In 2007 the Achuar communities filed a lawsuit</b> in the US against Occidental Petroleum for polluting their rivers and drinking water with carcinogenic hydrocarbon compounds and heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic. Ill effects experienced by the Achuar include an increased risk of cancer, and lead poisoning is widespread among Achuar children. The Achuar is currently waiting to hear if the case will be accepted in US courts.The Peruvian government is currently opening up a number of new areas to oil company bidding - in the last few years the proportion of the Peruvian Amazon zoned into hydrocarbon blocks has increased from 13% to 70%. Several of the new proposed blocks overlap indigenous territories, natural protected areas, or reserves for indigenous peoples who live in voluntary isolation.","Photo_credit":"(Amazon Watch)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.429546,-2.803633]}},{"properties":{"name":"2003 : Tasman Spirit","end time":{"end_time":"2011/01/01 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2010-12-31","granularity":"day","time":"2010/12/31 00:00:00 -0500"},"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/case-histories/index.html#tasman-spirit\">ITOPF: Tasman Spirit</a>• <a href=\"http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/crisis/tasmin/index.cfm\">WWF: Karachi oil spill, Pakistan</a> • <a href=\"http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/tasman_spirit/tasman_spirit.htm\">Cedre.fr: Tasman Spirit</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"27,000 to 30,000 tonnes","Cause":"Ran aground at port entrance","Photo_align":"center","Location":"Karachi Port, Pakistan","Photo_text":"The Tasman Spirit.","Overlay":null,"Date_range":"28 Jul 2003","id":"a634qspp68of","description":null,"Photo":"tasman_spirit_unk_heloaft_sunk.jpg","PrevID":55,"NextID":57,"begin time":{"end_time":"2003/01/02 00:00:00 -0500","original":"2003-01-01","granularity":"day","time":"2003/01/01 00:00:00 -0500"},"Type":"Oil tanker","extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>8,316,000 - 9,240,000<b>In barrels: </b>197,910 - 219,900","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"Tasman Spirit","Impact":"<b>On July 27th, 2003 the Tasman Spirit grounded</b> at the entrance to Karachi Port, Pakistan carrying 67,800 tonnes of light crude oil.

Of the 126 workers that were on the rig at the time 11 died in the resulting explosions. The rig burned for two days, finally sinking on April 22nd. Shortly thereafter it was found that the wellhead, on the ocean-floor 1,500 meters below, had been damaged and was leaking oil into the water. The first estimates of the spill rate were at 1,000 barrels per day, later estimates during May and June once underwater footage of the leaking well had been released moved the figure from 5 to 25 thousand barrels per day, and finally to 35-60 thousand barrels per day. This is equal to an Exxon Valdez disaster every four to seven days. The Ixtoc I oil well in the southern Gulf of Mexico which suffered a similar blowout in 1980 took nearly a full 10 months to be capped, and several attempts by BP to stop the Deepwater Horizon flow failed before it could finally be contained on July 15.The oil slick spread quickly over the ocean surface, covering 1,500 square kilometers (580 sq miles) by April 25 and over 6,500 square kilometers (2,500 sq miles) by the beginning of May. Hundreds of kilometers of the Louisiana shoreline was contaminated, including several wildlife refuges important for sea turtles as well as hundreds of species of birds. Tar balls from the spill also reached beaches and islands in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas.","Photo_credit":"(Wikipedia)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.364863,28.73384]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-88.30215,31.789135],[-88.678007,31.777626],[-89.050099,31.731742],[-89.413965,31.652038],[-89.76527,31.539472],[-90.099875,31.395392],[-90.413887,31.221518],[-90.703722,31.019911],[-90.966145,30.792947],[-91.198304,30.543278],[-91.397763,30.2738],[-91.562519,29.98761],[-91.691013,29.687966],[-91.782133,29.378249],[-91.835211,29.061921],[-91.850014,28.742481],[-91.826734,28.423432],[-91.765963,28.108242],[-91.668681,27.800305],[-91.536225,27.502909],[-91.370272,27.219207],[-91.172807,26.952184],[-90.9461,26.704631],[-90.692677,26.47912],[-90.415293,26.277981],[-90.116907,26.103284],[-89.800648,25.956817],[-89.469794,25.840078],[-89.127737,25.754254],[-88.77796,25.700218],[-88.42401,25.678518],[-88.069461,25.689374],[-87.717898,25.732676],[-87.372877,25.807985],[-87.037906,25.914536],[-86.716412,26.051245],[-86.411712,26.216716],[-86.12699,26.409258],[-85.865264,26.626891],[-85.629359,26.867371],[-85.421881,27.128204],[-85.245188,27.406669],[-85.101365,27.699843],[-84.992192,28.004625],[-84.919124,28.317771],[-84.883262,28.635915],[-84.885329,28.955613],[-84.925653,29.273369],[-85.004145,29.585677],[-85.120282,29.889058],[-85.273102,30.180102],[-85.461195,30.455504],[-85.682703,30.712109],[-85.935335,30.946949],[-86.216373,31.157286],[-86.522709,31.34065],[-86.850867,31.494869],[-87.197055,31.618108],[-87.557207,31.708893],[-87.927048,31.766132],[-88.30215,31.789135]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"Deepwater Disaster Blues","end time":null,"Link_section":null,"Tonnes_spilled_range":null,"Cause":null,"Photo_align":null,"Location":null,"Photo_text":null,"Overlay":null,"Date_range":null,"id":"a634qsn4r0f5","description":"\r\n\r\n<b>Deepwater Disaster Blues</b>\r\n<b>Greenpeace US: BP Deepwater Disaster and Gulf Oil Spill</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/gulf-oil-spill\">\r\nVisit the <b>Greenpeace Gulf Oil Spill</b> page to find out more.</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#2;balloonFlyto\"> &lt; &lt; Back </a>\r\n","Photo":null,"PrevID":null,"NextID":null,"begin time":null,"Type":null,"extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":null,"Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":null,"Impact":null,"Photo_credit":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.00765,28.891964]}},{"properties":{"name":"1979-1980 : Ixtoc I oil well","end time":null,"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.incidentnews.gov/incident/6250\">NOAA Incident News: IXTOC I</a>• <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v290/n5803/abs/290235a0.html\">Nature.com: Ixtoc 1 oil spill</a> • <a href=\"http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/ixtoc1.htm\">Sedco 135F - IXTOC I</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"454,000 to 480,000 tonnes","Cause":"Drilling error, blowout","Photo_align":"left","Location":"Gulf of Mexico","Photo_text":"IXTOC I well blowout.","Overlay":null,"Date_range":"3 Jun 1979 - 23 Mar 1980","id":"a634qszgkp0e","description":null,"Photo":"Ixtoc I-.jpg","PrevID":2,"NextID":4,"begin time":null,"Type":"Exploratory oil well","extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>139,832,000 - 147,840,000<b>In barrels: </b>3,327,820 - 3,518,400","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"Ixtoc I oil well","Impact":"<b>The Ixtoc I oil well was a 2 mile deep exploratory drilling site.</b> A blowout of oil and gas out of the well ignited on June 3rd, 1979 causing the platform to catch fire.

The oil contaminated shoreline from Brest to Saint Brieuc, and even as far east as the Channel Islands.","Photo_credit":"(NOAA)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.716667,48.583333]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-4.666893,50.401232],[-4.965199,50.39434],[-5.260467,50.366868],[-5.549097,50.319151],[-5.8276,50.251773],[-6.092643,50.165552],[-6.341108,50.061532],[-6.57013,49.940965],[-6.777136,49.805288],[-6.959877,49.656108],[-7.116443,49.495174],[-7.245288,49.324355],[-7.345227,49.145613],[-7.415444,48.96098],[-7.455485,48.772531],[-7.465244,48.582359],[-7.444956,48.392554],[-7.395174,48.205177],[-7.31675,48.022241],[-7.210815,47.845692],[-7.078756,47.677388],[-6.922191,47.519082],[-6.742947,47.372411],[-6.543037,47.238876],[-6.324638,47.119836],[-6.090067,47.016494],[-5.841762,46.929887],[-5.582257,46.860881],[-5.31417,46.810162],[-5.040174,46.778235],[-4.762984,46.765414],[-4.485337,46.771828],[-4.209973,46.797412],[-3.939616,46.841914],[-3.676957,46.904892],[-3.424633,46.985719],[-3.185207,47.08359],[-2.961154,47.197523],[-2.754832,47.326369],[-2.568467,47.468822],[-2.40413,47.623425],[-2.263711,47.788586],[-2.148902,47.962588],[-2.061169,48.143607],[-2.001731,48.329724],[-1.971535,48.518947],[-1.971236,48.709228],[-2.001178,48.898485],[-2.061369,49.084622],[-2.151474,49.265556],[-2.270796,49.439238],[-2.418276,49.603679],[-2.592487,49.756978],[-2.791638,49.897342],[-3.013592,50.023115],[-3.25588,50.132799],[-3.515732,50.225079],[-3.790109,50.298841],[-4.075744,50.353188],[-4.369195,50.387458],[-4.666893,50.401232]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"1972-1992 : ChevronTexaco Amazon oil spill","end time":null,"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.mofilms.org/justicianow/\"><b>Justicia Now!</b> : a documentary about Chevron Texaco's legacy in the Amazon</a>• <a href=\"http://www.chevrontoxico.com/section.php?id=3\">ChevronToxico: Texaco in Ecuador</a>• <a href=\"http://www.amazonwatch.org/newsroom/index.php?type=video\">Amazon Watch: Newsroom</a>• <a href=\"http://www.rainforestrelief.org/Campaigns/ChevronTexaco/ChevronTexaco_s_Legacy_in_Ecuador.html\">Rainforest Relief: Texaco's Legacy of Pollution in the Amazon</a>• <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE1D81731F930A15753C1A9659C8B63\">New York Times:  Texaco Goes on Trial in Ecuador Pollution Case</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"165,000 to 171,000 tonnes","Cause":"Waste product dumping","Photo_align":"left","Location":"Ecuadorian Amazon","Photo_text":"Texaco's Ecuador Operation.","Overlay":"<img src=\"http://www.google.com/earth/gallery/images/kml_feed_small.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"> <a href=\"http://www.tryse.net/spill/Texaco%20Ecuador.kml\">Map of Texaco's Operations in Ecuador</a> (ChevronToxico.com)","Date_range":"1972 - June 1992","id":"a634qsv7vh4v","description":null,"Photo":"toxico_smoke.jpg","PrevID":9,"NextID":11,"begin time":null,"Type":"Drilling Operations","extra_block":"  <a href=\"#video_texaco;balloonFlyto\"><img src=\"http://mw1.google.com/mw-video/common_files/yt.png\" width=\"42\">View movie clip in Google Earth</a>.","Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>50,820,000 - 52,668,000<b>In barrels: </b>1,209,450 - 1,253,430","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"ChevronTexaco Amazon oil spill","Impact":"<b>In 1993 a number of Indian tribes from the Ecuadorian Amazon filed a lawsuit against Texaco</b> for ruining their rivers and land, causing widespread devastation to the rainforest environment, and creating a dramatically increased risk of cancer for tens of thousands of people. The lawsuit states that Texaco dumped millions of gallons of waste oil products into the pristine rainforest river environment rather than re-inject it back into the well which is the industry practice in other parts of the world. Water and soil samples taken in the rainforest by toxicologists indicate life-threatening levels of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene\">Benzene</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene\">Toluene</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylenes\">Xylenes</a>, and highly carcinogenic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon\">Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</a>.  Texaco extracted oil from the Ecuadorian Amazon from 1972 to 1992 at the rate of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels per day. An estimated <b>18.5 billion gallons of toxic waste water products</b> were dumped into the river system or left in open, unlined pits during this time. While it is difficult to say exactly how many million gallons of crude oil this would correspond to, current estimates are at around three times the amount spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster. The area that has been contaminated is roughly the size of the state of Rhode Island. In June of 1992 Texaco withdrew from Ecuador, but many areas are still in need of cleanup operations and local peoples have still not been compensated. In some villages near polluted water sources, the rate of cancer is 1,000 times higher than the historical norm for the area, and hundreds of open-air leaking toxic waste pits still remain in the jungle without any cleanup performed. In addition, <b>16.8 million gallons of crude oil</b> has also been spilled directly from pipelines by ChevronTexaco's operations in the area.<b>This placemark</b> marks the Sacha Sur area which was among the places reviewed during the lawsuit in March 2006.

In June of 1992 Texaco withdrew from Ecuador, but many areas are still in need of cleanup operations and local peoples have still not been compensated. In some villages near polluted water sources, the rate of cancer is 1,000 times higher than the historical norm for the area, and hundreds of open-air leaking toxic waste pits still remain in the jungle without any cleanup performed.

In a similar situation to the <a href=\"#9;balloon\">Texaco Ecuador</a> operation, poor standards no longer legal in most countries were used - including the dumping of waste oil products into the pristine rainforest river environment instead of re-injecting back underground. An estimated 9 billion barrels of toxic waste water products were dumped during the 30 years of operation by Occidental - an average of 850,000 barrels per day.The area which Block 1AB occupies is an <b>indigenous territory</b>, home to the <a href=\"http://www.achuarperu.org/en/\"><b>Achuar</b></a> people for thousands of years. Many children and adults in the Achuar communities downstream of the drilling operations now have dangerously high levels of lead and cadmium in their blood, and are suffering other ill effects of the petroleum extraction activities. Fish and game which the Achuar communities depend on has also declined due to the extensive pollution in the area. In 1984 the Peruvian government named Block 1-AB <i>'the country's most damaged environmental region'</i>.In 2000 Occidental Petroleum sold the rights for Block 1AB to <b>Pluspetrol</b>, an Argentinean company. Pluspetrol has continued to use the substandard infrastructure and production methods left behind by Occidental, and the contamination of the Achuar land continues today.<b>In 2007 the Achuar communities filed a lawsuit</b> in the US against Occidental Petroleum for polluting their rivers and drinking water with carcinogenic hydrocarbon compounds and heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic. Ill effects experienced by the Achuar include an increased risk of cancer, and lead poisoning is widespread among Achuar children. The Achuar is currently waiting to hear if the case will be accepted in US courts.The Peruvian government is currently opening up a number of new areas to oil company bidding - in the last few years the proportion of the Peruvian Amazon zoned into hydrocarbon blocks has increased from 13% to 70%. Several of the new proposed blocks overlap indigenous territories, natural protected areas, or reserves for indigenous peoples who live in voluntary isolation.","Photo_credit":"(Amazon Watch)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.429546,-2.803633]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-76.412872,-1.848849],[-76.512813,-1.852335],[-76.611844,-1.866235],[-76.708881,-1.8904],[-76.802863,-1.924562],[-76.892762,-1.96835],[-76.977595,-2.021284],[-77.056434,-2.082785],[-77.128415,-2.15218],[-77.192751,-2.228711],[-77.248737,-2.311538],[-77.295759,-2.399758],[-77.3333,-2.492403],[-77.360949,-2.58846],[-77.3784,-2.686878],[-77.385461,-2.786578],[-77.38205,-2.88647],[-77.368203,-2.985458],[-77.344069,-3.082459],[-77.30991,-3.176409],[-77.266096,-3.266277],[-77.213107,-3.35108],[-77.151519,-3.429885],[-77.082009,-3.501828],[-77.005335,-3.56612],[-76.922339,-3.622054],[-76.83393,-3.669016],[-76.741079,-3.706491],[-76.644806,-3.734066],[-76.546167,-3.751438],[-76.446247,-3.758417],[-76.346143,-3.754926],[-76.246956,-3.741002],[-76.149775,-3.7168],[-76.055668,-3.682585],[-75.965668,-3.638733],[-75.880764,-3.585725],[-75.801885,-3.524145],[-75.729898,-3.454669],[-75.665591,-3.378058],[-75.609666,-3.295155],[-75.562735,-3.206868],[-75.525311,-3.114166],[-75.497801,-3.018066],[-75.480503,-2.91962],[-75.473604,-2.819908],[-75.477177,-2.720023],[-75.491181,-2.621057],[-75.515459,-2.524094],[-75.549743,-2.430197],[-75.593657,-2.340392],[-75.646719,-2.255663],[-75.708345,-2.176937],[-75.777862,-2.105076],[-75.854507,-2.040864],[-75.937442,-1.985005],[-76.02576,-1.93811],[-76.118493,-1.900692],[-76.214628,-1.873161],[-76.313114,-1.855816],[-76.412872,-1.848849]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"In Focus: Contesting Oil's Legacy","end time":null,"Link_section":null,"Tonnes_spilled_range":null,"Cause":null,"Photo_align":null,"Location":null,"Photo_text":null,"Overlay":null,"Date_range":null,"id":"a634qspe1b7t","description":"\r\n\r\n<b>In Focus: Contesting Oil's Legacy</b>\r\n<b>Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pulitzercenter.org/showproject.cfm?id=32\">\r\nVisit the <b>Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</b> to find out more.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>This placemark</b> marks the Rio Corrientes, one of the areas polluted by Occidental Petroleum's operation in the Peruvian Amazon.\r\n<a href=\"#55;balloonFlyto\"> &lt; &lt; Back </a>\r\n","Photo":null,"PrevID":null,"NextID":null,"begin time":null,"Type":null,"extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":null,"Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":null,"Impact":null,"Photo_credit":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.726011,-2.495682]}},{"properties":{"name":"2003 : Tasman Spirit","end time":null,"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/case-histories/index.html#tasman-spirit\">ITOPF: Tasman Spirit</a>• <a href=\"http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/crisis/tasmin/index.cfm\">WWF: Karachi oil spill, Pakistan</a> • <a href=\"http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/tasman_spirit/tasman_spirit.htm\">Cedre.fr: Tasman Spirit</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"27,000 to 30,000 tonnes","Cause":"Ran aground at port entrance","Photo_align":"center","Location":"Karachi Port, Pakistan","Photo_text":"The Tasman Spirit.","Overlay":null,"Date_range":"28 Jul 2003","id":"a634qsu80i9o","description":null,"Photo":"tasman_spirit_unk_heloaft_sunk.jpg","PrevID":55,"NextID":57,"begin time":null,"Type":"Oil tanker","extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>8,316,000 - 9,240,000<b>In barrels: </b>197,910 - 219,900","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"Tasman Spirit","Impact":"<b>On July 27th, 2003 the Tasman Spirit grounded</b> at the entrance to Karachi Port, Pakistan carrying 67,800 tonnes of light crude oil.

In total over 50 kilometers (30 miles) of shoreline was oiled by this spill.","Photo_credit":"(NOAA)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.716667,27.6]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-82.708705,28.002728],[-82.756426,28.001251],[-82.803707,27.995362],[-82.850024,27.985126],[-82.894864,27.970656],[-82.937731,27.952112],[-82.978154,27.929701],[-83.015685,27.903668],[-83.049912,27.874304],[-83.080461,27.84193],[-83.106998,27.806906],[-83.129234,27.769616],[-83.146929,27.730472],[-83.159894,27.689904],[-83.16799,27.648358],[-83.171136,27.60629],[-83.169302,27.564161],[-83.162513,27.522432],[-83.15085,27.481561],[-83.134446,27.441993],[-83.113484,27.40416],[-83.088198,27.368475],[-83.058867,27.335327],[-83.025814,27.305076],[-82.989401,27.278052],[-82.950025,27.254547],[-82.908116,27.234818],[-82.864131,27.219077],[-82.818546,27.207497],[-82.771858,27.200202],[-82.72457,27.197272],[-82.677198,27.198738],[-82.630253,27.204584],[-82.584244,27.214748],[-82.539672,27.229118],[-82.497019,27.24754],[-82.45675,27.269812],[-82.419303,27.295694],[-82.385088,27.324905],[-82.354478,27.357126],[-82.327811,27.392007],[-82.305379,27.429168],[-82.287433,27.468205],[-82.274172,27.508691],[-82.265748,27.550184],[-82.262256,27.592231],[-82.263742,27.63437],[-82.270195,27.676142],[-82.28155,27.717086],[-82.297686,27.756753],[-82.318433,27.794708],[-82.343566,27.830531],[-82.372813,27.86383],[-82.405854,27.894235],[-82.442328,27.921412],[-82.481834,27.94506],[-82.523938,27.964918],[-82.568175,27.980766],[-82.614055,27.992428],[-82.661072,27.999776],[-82.708705,28.002728]]]}]}},{"properties":{"name":"2006 : Solar I","end time":null,"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/solar/solar.htm\">Cedre.fr: Solar I</a>• <a href=\"http://earth.esa.int/ew/oil_slicks/Philippines_oil_aug06/Philippines_oil-Aug06.htm\">European Space Agency: Philippines, August 2006</a> • <a href=\"http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/index.cfm?uNewsID=78300\">WWF: Large oil spill in the Philippines threatens marine ecosystem</a> • <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17385\">NASA: Oil Spill near Guimaras Island</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"172 to 1,540 tonnes","Cause":"Sank in bad weather","Photo_align":"center","Location":"Guimaras Strait, Philippines","Photo_text":"Oil on the coast of Sitio Nauway Island in the Philippines.","Overlay":"<img src=\"http://www.google.com/earth/gallery/images/kml_feed_small.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"> <a href=\"http://www.tryse.net/spill/WWF%20Guimaras%20Spill%20Overlay.kml\">Overlay Map</a> of the Solar I spill.

Major drilling operations in the half-million hectare area started in 1975. In a similar situation to the <a href=\"#9;balloon\">Texaco Ecuador</a> operation, poor standards no longer legal in most countries were used - including the dumping of waste oil products into the pristine rainforest river environment instead of re-injecting back underground. An estimated 9 billion barrels of toxic waste water products were dumped during the 30 years of operation by Occidental - an average of 850,000 barrels per day.The area which Block 1AB occupies is an <b>indigenous territory</b>, home to the <a href=\"http://www.achuarperu.org/en/\"><b>Achuar</b></a> people for thousands of years. Many children and adults in the Achuar communities downstream of the drilling operations now have dangerously high levels of lead and cadmium in their blood, and are suffering other ill effects of the petroleum extraction activities. Fish and game which the Achuar communities depend on has also declined due to the extensive pollution in the area. In 1984 the Peruvian government named Block 1-AB <i>'the country's most damaged environmental region'</i>.In 2000 Occidental Petroleum sold the rights for Block 1AB to <b>Pluspetrol</b>, an Argentinean company. Pluspetrol has continued to use the substandard infrastructure and production methods left behind by Occidental, and the contamination of the Achuar land continues today.<b>In 2007 the Achuar communities filed a lawsuit</b> in the US against Occidental Petroleum for polluting their rivers and drinking water with carcinogenic hydrocarbon compounds and heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic. Ill effects experienced by the Achuar include an increased risk of cancer, and lead poisoning is widespread among Achuar children. The Achuar is currently waiting to hear if the case will be accepted in US courts.The Peruvian government is currently opening up a number of new areas to oil company bidding - in the last few years the proportion of the Peruvian Amazon zoned into hydrocarbon blocks has increased from 13% to 70%. Several of the new proposed blocks overlap indigenous territories, natural protected areas, or reserves for indigenous peoples who live in voluntary isolation.","Photo_credit":"(Amazon Watch)"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.429546,-2.803633]}},{"properties":{"name":"2003 : Tasman Spirit","end time":null,"Link_section":"• <a href=\"http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/case-histories/index.html#tasman-spirit\">ITOPF: Tasman Spirit</a>• <a href=\"http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/crisis/tasmin/index.cfm\">WWF: Karachi oil spill, Pakistan</a> • <a href=\"http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/tasman_spirit/tasman_spirit.htm\">Cedre.fr: Tasman Spirit</a>","Tonnes_spilled_range":"27,000 to 30,000 tonnes","Cause":"Ran aground at port entrance","Photo_align":"center","Location":"Karachi Port, Pakistan","Photo_text":"The Tasman Spirit.","Overlay":null,"Date_range":"28 Jul 2003","id":"a634qsnnzzqm","description":null,"Photo":"tasman_spirit_unk_heloaft_sunk.jpg","PrevID":55,"NextID":57,"begin time":null,"Type":"Oil tanker","extra_block":null,"Gallons_Barrels":"<b>In gallons: </b>8,316,000 - 9,240,000<b>In barrels: </b>197,910 - 219,900","Tanker_or_Oil_spill_name":"Tasman Spirit","Impact":"<b>On July 27th, 2003 the Tasman Spirit grounded</b> at the entrance to Karachi Port, Pakistan carrying 67,800 tonnes of light crude oil.
