Freedman surveyed 44 gun trafficking cases involving 165 defendants in U.S. jurisdictions along the border. From U.S. court documents, Freedman extracted a list of 1,600 guns by brand name. All were weapons purchased in the Southwest for transit to Mexico and that nation’s violent drug cartels. Most of the weapons were either sent to Mexico or intercepted en route. The map, prepared by reporter-researcher Will Tucker, breaks down each purchase documented in the court indictments and criminal complaints and, if known, shows where in Mexico the weapons ended up. With the ATF’s Operation Fast and Furious now in the headlines,  the Houston Chronicle presents the survey data in an interactive format that allows readers to view and comment.\r\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"64 Century Arms WASR10 AK-47 rifles","description":"<a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2011/06/hearst-survey-top-10-guns/#1\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3324/5842309549_b7f129db9a_m.jpg\" alt=\"Century Arms WASR-10 AK-47\" width=\"240\" height=\"66\"></a>Purchased at unidentified  federally licensed firearms dealer(s) In Glendale, Ariz., between June and August, 2010 by Alvador Figueroa Resa and five associates.
