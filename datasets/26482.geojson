He\\'s also remembered for his grace in the water, his good humor, and his sportsmanship.\n\nThroughout his youth, Duke strove to refine his water skills. Swimming, surfing and canoeing were his passion. When top Australian swimmers visited the islands in 1910, Duke inspected their every move. He would use what he had learned from them to perfect his swimming. Duke\\'s aquatic skills improved to such an extent that those who saw him were astonished. Bill Rawlins, an island attorney from Yale tried to help Duke get the recognition he deserved. However, to obtain official sanction for any aquatic records, swimmers had to belong to a recognized club. So Duke and his friends organized their own club in 1911 and named it Hui Nalu (Club of the Waves).\n\nDuke\\'s astonishing swim times were sent to the Mainland, but they were so startling that officials refused to believe them. His supporters decided that the only thing they could do was raise money for Duke and another Hawaiian swimmer, Vincent Genoves, to travel to the Mainland to compete.\n\nIn March of 1912 Duke Kahanamoku and fellow Hawaiian Vincent Genoves were in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to compete for places on the American Olympic team. The Olympic swim trials were being held at various athletic clubs throughout the United States. On March 13th Duke had been in Chicago where he had won the 100-yard race. Now, in Pittsburgh two days later, Kahanamoku would compete in the 220-yard indoor race and Genoves in the 500-yard indoor swimming event. Unfortunately, Duke\\'s leg would cramp when he hit the water, and he lost the race. Neither Hawaiian would win in Pittsburgh and only Kahanamoku would make the Olympic team and travel to Stockholm.\n\nDuke, who almost slept through the 100-meter dash, and who had to convince officials to delay the race long enough for him to put on a swim suit, broke the Olympic record in July of 1912. He had been clocked at sixty-three and two-fifths seconds. Pandemonium reigned and the Hawaiian swimmer became a hero. He was now the most famous Hawaiian alive, and he had done much to publicize the islands.\n\nOn January 22, 1968 the world would bid \"Aloha\" to Hawaii\\'s most famous citizen. He would be remembered as a great swimmer, surfer and all-around good guy. More than 20-years after his death memories of his achievements and affecting personable style still linger.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlomv0l5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.82804,21.276656]}},{"properties":{"name":"Newbedford Armory","description":"Posted by Us3rnamenew bedford maa camera man was knocked down and his camera was hit into his face<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlpzr3jh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.9309,41.63765]}},{"properties":{"name":"Newport Beach Live cam","description":"Posted by Us3rname<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/74128681@N00/150006918/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/49/150006918_12283a18eb_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/74128681@N00/149998500/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/49/149998500_17f75a9be0_o.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/74128681@N00/146704658/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/47/146704658_e7982e1886_o.jpg\"></a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Newport Beach, CA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlh31c2r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.923727,33.606828]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nick","description":"Posted by Us3rnameHuntington Beach<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlqfx4tp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.998333,33.660278]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nightmare Haunted House until 11/03/06","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/0/NIGHTMARE200pix.jpg\">107 Suffolk Street, NY, NYThis is a popular haunted house, but it gets decidedly mixed reviews.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.smarttix.com/package.aspx?showcode=NIG58\">Get tickets</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzloijnm7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.986071,40.718982]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nina's Costumes","description":"Posted by Us3rname1636 W University Ave., Gainesville, FL(352) 375-6462Costumes for everyone.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzljjvnwp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.343334,29.652104]}},{"properties":{"name":"North Marina Beach","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/4/thumb_Albirplaya.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> Near Castroville, CANorth Marina is a nice beach long used by local residents.\n\nDescription: A sunbathing area in the sand dunes.

This beach area is gorgeous! There is a large boulderable arch, and many beachside climbing sections at this little oasis. In the middle of the Beachside Wall there is a cave extending 10 feet into the rock. At the left side of entrance, there are a few good hands within reach above the overhang of the cave. The landings are in the sand, so it makes it fairly safe for dropping. Without questions, \n\nPanther Beach is known for rock climbing and the difficulties in climb ranges from very easy to more advanced climbs, putting you over 25 feet in the air. Because a lot of the rock is sandstone, climbing should however be done with caution. The high tide also will affect some of the routes.\n\nDIRECTIONS: CA Hiway1 just south of Davenport between milepost 26.86 and 26.4. The entrance is very hard to see when coming from the north. Look for a dirt road between the west side of highway and the railroad track and be prepared to make a very sharp turn.\n\nParking: Park on the dirt between the highway and the railroad tracks (west of the highway) Take special care with your belongings, as vandalism has been reported there.\n\nWalking: From the north end of the parking area, cross the tracks and follow the trail. It is steep and eroded, use with caution and watch for poison oak.\n\nThe only way to get to Hole in the Wall is to walk through the hole in the rocks at the south end of the beach, but do not try it at high tide and be sure to get back before the tide comes in.\n\nNOTE: Directly next to Panther Beach is Hole in the Wall, which is considered a nude beach.\n\nACTIVITIES: An incredible beach for nature sight seeing, bird watching, rock climbing, sun bathing, or just enjoying a picnic lunch.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzldjztfg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.215862,37.023456]}},{"properties":{"name":"Park Slope Halloween Parade 10/31/06","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/0/parade_1_400.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> Tuesday, October 31st\nThe Park Slope Civic Council hosts its annual kids\\' Halloween parade and party for children of all ages.

On the beach you will find sailors from Asia, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. While this makes rigging enriching it can be confusing on the water since it is clear some do not know the rules of the road.\n\nThe long sandy beach is backed by shady lawns and thorn dropping Kiave trees so wear sandals. The wind in the summer is mostly side-onshore and strong and steady. There is little shore break because of the reef running parallel to the beach about 800 feet from shore. In the spring and fall the wind has more ENE in it. These ENE winds produce gusty side shore winds with blasts and lulls near the beach.\n\nDo not launch until 11AM at any of the sites in Maui. This rule was established because it is extremely difficult to see the local spear fishermen who can work the reef until 11am. \n\n\n\nby <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/aleka\">Aleka</a>\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlh5vzaw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-156.446772,20.898508]}},{"properties":{"name":"Spruce Saddle","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <a href=\"http://wwwa.accuweather.com/adcbin/public/index.asp?partner=netWeather\">Weather Forecasts</a> | <a href=\"http://wwwa.accuweather.com/maps-satellite.asp?partner=netWeather\">Weather Maps</a> | <a href=\"http://wwwa.accuweather.com/index-radar.asp?partner=netWeather\">Weather Radar</a>\n<a href=\"http://beavercreek.snow.com/mtn.camslarge.asp?camera_id=40\"><img src=\"http://common.snow.com/mtncams/bc_gorerange.jpg\"></a>\n\nMountain Cams are updated every 5 minutes throughout the day from 6:00 AM to 3:55 PM. \n\nElevation: 10,200\\'/3,109m.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlr9n9tl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.51159,39.5915]}},{"properties":{"name":"St George Island Live beach Cam","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/05/4/sgi640.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> St George Island, FL <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlbxq0jv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.861145,29.662996]}},{"properties":{"name":"Staten Island Nightmare Haunted House until 11/03/06","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/0/NIGHTMARE200pix_6_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 460 Brielle Ave\nStaten Island, NY 10314\n\nThis is a popular haunted house, but it gets decidedly mixed reviews.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.smarttix.com/package.aspx?showcode=NIG58\">Get tickets</a><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62qzlq3lff8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.135055542,40.593751284]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stone Moutain Park","description":"Posted by Us3rname<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/10/1/23231201_L.jpg\">PO BOX 778, STONE MOUNTAIN, GA, 30086Several rooms of the Antebellum Plantation at Stone Mountain Park are said to be haunted.
