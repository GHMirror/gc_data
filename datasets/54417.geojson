Previously, these individuals could vote in the proportional and majoritarian elections without any restrictions: they could elect local government bodies and officials even if their place of deployment had changed only a few days before the elections. The NGOs recommended that only the individuals who have served in the relevant electoral district for at least a year should be allowed to vote.\r\nThis recommendation aimed at ensuring that no military servicemen would be relocated shortly before the elections in order to influence the outcome of vote in specific electoral district(s). However, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) and the ruling party representatives presently interpret Article 10.10(1) in a different way. According to them, all military servicemen who have signed, at any point prior to the compilation of the special voter list, 1 a contract for a period of at least one year should be allowed to vote, even if this was done the day before the list was compiled.\r\nThis interpretation of Article 10.10(1) contradicts the essence of the recommendation of NGOs and leaves the same situation that existed before the addition of Paragraph 10(1) to the law.
