Founded in 1969 by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, Brother Martin strives to form Christian young men through a holistic approach to education as put forth in the school\\'s Mission Statement and in keeping with the Philosophy of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. The hallmarks of that tradition are an education rooted in religious values, structured through friendly discipline, nurtured by personal attention and committed to academic excellence.\n\nInformation about our History\n\t\nFather Andre Coindre, founder of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, was born in Lyon, France, in 1787. Devoting his life to the restoration of the Church following the Reign of Terror at the end of the French Revolution, his chief mission became the moral, intellectual, and religious development of young orphan boys left in distress by the consequent disintegration of family life. \n\nFather Coindre had envisioned a community of brothers trained to work with the poor through the establishment of schools; in 1821 that dream became a reality with the formation of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. After Father Coindre\\'s death in 1826 and at the end of Father Francis Coindre\\'s administration, Brother Polycarp, our first Brother Superior General, assumed leadership of the struggling community. His tenure was marked by a period of tremendous growth. By the time of his death in 1859, the Institute had grown to over 400 Brothers in 70 schools.\n\nIn January of 1847 at the request of Bishop Portier, five missionary Brothers of the Sacred Heart arrived in Mobile, Alabama, to begin charitable and educational work. With a presence in the United States, the congregation began its transformation into a worldwide institute, spreading throughout North America in the South, New York and New England areas and into Canada.\n\n“To be a member of the institute today is to be believe in God’s love, to live it, and to spread it. It is to contribute as religious educators to the evangelization of the world particularly through the education of youth.”\n       Brothers of the Sacred Heart “Rule of Life” #13\n\nThe Brothers of the Heart of Jesus will frequently remember these words of Jesus Christ: “I have come to bring fire to the earth. How I wish it were blazing already.”\n       Father Andre Coindre\n       Rule of 1821<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnw0wipae"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.05832,30.00341]}},{"properties":{"name":"DPZ Gentilly Charette - Spring 2006","description":"Posted by Rufuslpage 26 of DPZ report\nGentilly Town Center \nGalina Tahchieva \n \nAnalysis:  \n \nCurrently the strip shopping center along Gentilly Boulevard is underused and is perceived to \nbe both poorly maintained and outdated. It is owned by Texas-based Gentilly LLC.  The \nbuildings did not suffer major damage from wind or flood; rather, most of them were looted in \nthe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The pre-Katrina tenants included a Dollar Store, \nWalgreens, Right Aid, Blockbuster, several fast food restaurants, as well as a series of local \nbusinesses such as a barber shop, a Laundromat, car wash and others. \n \nToday only a few of these shops are in business and very few will be coming back to this \nlocation. As many of the Gentilly residents noted, the shopping center needs to be redeveloped \nin order to better serve the surrounding community. Even before the hurricane its maintenance \nand overall physical shape was not appropriate for this very central and important location, \nwhich is at the intersection of two major thoroughfares - Gentilly Boulevard and Elysian \nFields. This area should be positioned as a town center instead of a strip shopping center, as it \nis today, and should become the heart of the community. It could be developed as a 24-hour \nplace of character and community synergy by creating a combination of shops and residential \nuses.     \n \nNeeds: \n \n1. Create a square between the Walgreens building on the east and the shopping strip on the \nwest side in order to traffic-calm Gentilly Boulevard and provide a new green civic space \nto be used by the whole community. \n2. Plant a double row of trees around the square to provide shade to the sidewalks around it, \nand leave the central space clear of structures for active use by the residents in the \ncommunity. \n3. Design the square to accommodate future streetcar lines running through Gentilly \nBoulevard and connecting to another line along Elysian Fields. 4. Reverse the current model of parking in the front of buildings to a model of parking in the \nback of buildings.  The parking lots should be laid out in way that allows the construction \nof a future parking garage.   \n5. Create a merchandizing strategy for the town center and present it together with the master \nplan to several developers with good track record of building such centers.  The offer may \nbe extended to the current owners.   \n6. Reshape the north and south corners on the east side of Elysian Fields to form a true \ngateway to the town center.  Propose the “reversed gas station model” that puts the gas \nstation building in the front and the pumps in the back.  The gas station building can then \naccommodate the functions of a corner store.  Encourage the Zuppardo grocery store \nowners to rebuild their building wrapping around the corner but leaving larger sidewalk in \nthe front, at least 20 feet form curb to building.  The parking lot in the back can be re- \nstriped to accommodate more spaces. \n7. Allocate at least three sites with good visibility for new restaurants of different price \npoints, including a family restaurant and a place affordable to students and young people.  \n8. Allocate a major anchor on the north-west corner of the site, across from the historically \nsignificant cemetery to activate the northern edge of the main street.  This anchor may be a \ncinema or a retail tenant.  Create a plaza in the front of the building in order to terminate \nthe street vista and direct the pedestrian traffic. \n9. Study the buildings on the south and east sides of Gentilly Boulevard and preserve the \nones of historical value (including the Deco building of the former McKenzie Bakery) \n10. Create a pedestrian and/or vehicular connection between the town center and Dillard \nUniversity.  Ideally this connection can happen along the northern edge of the Duck Pond \nand continue south of the mausoleum building, terminating on a new plaza at the edge of \nthe town center.  The businesses around this plaza should target younger customers. \n11. Reconfigure several of the street alignments along the south edge of Gentilly Boulevard in \norder to weave together the urban fabric on both sides of the boulevard and create more \npedestrian friendly crossing possibilities. \n12. Encourage two main building types in the town center – apartments above shops and live- work units.   \n\npage 64\nObservation: Gentilly Town Center was in terrible condition even before the hurricane, despite \nits fabulous location. The community requires its updating and refurbishment to a first-rate \nfunctional and social center. \n \nDiscussion: As is the case in the practice of retail, the newer shopping center destroys the old \none. Accordingly, the Gentilly shopping center decayed upon the construction of the center \nfurther to the east and then in turn decayed with the construction of the newer shopping in east \nNew Orleans. This occurred despite the fact the Gentilly shopping center has, by far, the best \nlocation, as the intersection of Gentilly Boulevard and Elysian Fields is in close proximity to \n610 and is conceivably the best of all locations in New Orleans by virtue of its access to \ntransportation, as well as its being in the centroid of New Orleans.  \n \nCurrently, a certain type of regional shopping requires long trips to Metairie, East New \nOrleans, or St. Bernard Parish, and residents of Gentilly must drive great distances to secure \nanything but the most ordinary groceries and services. In reaction to this situation, the Gentilly \nCivic Improvement Association is requiring that a new town center provide for its residents’ \nneeds. The current shopping center is actually a multiplicity of strip shopping, parcels and out \nof date traditional buildings, violently cut by the diagonal of Gentilly Boulevard, with a series \nof unresolved and unconnected parking lots.  \n \nThe proposed plan, while retaining the option of maintaining a number of buildings, is a radical \nredesign that creates a town square as a front door for Gentilly. The town square straddling \nGentilly Boulevard creates a circumstance that is much more pedestrian-friendly by splitting \nthe traffic into a one-way pair (each leg narrow and easier to cross), thus creating a memorable \nspace, and organizing the parking to be generally behind the buildings, such as the traditional \nhometown shopping experience is created. This kind of center is the future of retail. If this \nshopping center is constructed quickly enough it will outperform those others that were \nsimultaneously destroyed.  \n \nThe splitting of the boulevard is not a great problem, as Gentilly Boulevard is equipped with \nstoplights and various impediments. Furthermore, the creation of the commercial and what is \nassumed to be residential and office above may be easily amortized with the aid of the Gulf \nOpportunity Zone which is specifically designed for commercial projects.  \n \nThe demographics of the trade area of this location is the average nationally and the average \nfor New Orleans, and is therefore excellent for the kind of middle class shops that would be \nmost useful to the current residents of Gentilly. The initial trade area, before the New Orleans \npopulation as a whole comes back, is five miles, ultimately to be reduced to what is on the \nmap. Even then the demographics are excellent.  \n Recommendation:  The GCIA must hold to this design or one similar to it. Then, the \nreconstruction of the shopping center can take place regardless of the owner, in such a way that the center forms the town center of Gentilly and does not revert back to an interchangeable \nstrip shopping center of no particular character. \n \npage 73\nObservation:  Dillard University has an opportunity to tie in to the larger neighborhood \nrevitalization, helping to propel it as well as positioned to benefit from it. \n \nDiscussion:  Dillard University has a handsome, small campus that, while damaged by the \nwaters, has not been damaged by recent architecture. The University is currently involved in \nthe rebuilding of its student and faculty residential areas. Additionally, it is adjacent to the strip \nshopping centers at Gentilly and Elysian Fields, which are currently in dismal condition, but \nwhich could become the future Gentilly Town Center. The proposed Dillard plan, while \naccommodating substantially additional programming and reordering the playing fields and \nparking lots, permits the connection to continue.  \n \nRecommendation: The campus architect should coordinate the Dillard Plan with that of \nGentilly Town Center. \n\nGentilly rebuilding plan calls for \\'quality retail\\'; Shopping center at Elysian Fields would get revamp\nBy Jaquetta White, Business writer\nTimes-Picayune (New Orleans)\nNovember 14, 2006\n\nA rebuilding plan proposed recently to residents of Gentilly neighborhoods recommended converting the shopping center along Gentilly Boulevard at Elysian Fields Avenue into something \"more appropriate to the surrounding neighborhoods and that better serves the needs of Gentilly residents.\"\n\nThe plan was presented last week by Andres Duany, principal of Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company, the Miami firm contracted by the community to craft a plan for its rebuilding.\n\nDuany called the shopping strip that had included a Blockbuster, Baskin-Robbins, Radio Shack, Walgreens and a mix of small, locally owned outfits, a \"third-rate shopping center.\" And said it is \"absolutely crucial that you have a first-rate retail on that place.\" Fewer than half of the businesses operating in the shopping strip before Hurricane Katrina have reopened.\n\nThe plan calls for a mixed-use development that would consist of retail space with residential space above it.\n\nAccording to the plan, Gentilly Boulevard would be reconfigured to include a greenspace square surrounded by trees. The addition would \"calm traffic\" and \"provide a new green civic space.\" Parking would be moved to the rear of the shopping strip.\n\nAmong the other highlights, the plan suggests that a cinema or large retailer anchor the strip.\n\nA developer would be identified through a request-for-proposal process. The plan says the remodeled town center could be financed through a public/private partnership, but does not give specifics.\n\nThe plan would need to be adopted by the Gentilly Civic Improvement Association and presented to the city to become the formal rebuilding plan for the neighborhood. Scott Darrah, president of the association, said he did not know if the group had approved it yet.\n\nLocal residents say a change would be welcomed.\n\nGentilly resident Vera Triplett said the goal is to get \"quality retail\" to move to the strip.\n\n\"The quality of occupants is not what the neighborhood would like to see or deserves,\" area resident Reggie Glass said. \"People would like to see something nicer.\"\n\nBut, for those changes to take place, the center likely would have to be sold. The shopping center is now owned by Texas-based Gentilly LLC.\n\nEd Badouh, the company\\'s proprietor, said it is not currently for sale but he would entertain an offer to sell it.\n\nHowever, he said his current priority is not on selling, remodeling or tearing down the center, but on allowing the tenants who want to return the opportunity to do so.\n\n\"What we\\'re doing is what we\\'re obligated to do,\" said Badouh, who, with his wife, bought the center in 1983. \"Our first obligation is to try to put back the tenants that were there.\"\n\nBadouh said he is also open to moving new tenants into the space and has met with the neighborhood group to discuss that possibility, though no plans are final yet.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nJaquetta White can be reached at jwhite@timespicayune.com or (504) 826-3494\n\n\nThere are a number of smart, talented and acclaimed planners and architects who spend virtually all day every day thinking about a better future for New Orleans. Spend a week in the life of one, the prince of \\'new urbanism,\\' Andres Duany.\nSunday, December 10, 2006\nBy Doug MacCash\nArt critic\n\nTo hear some people talk, you\\'d think architect and urban planner Andrés Duany is the devil. They\\'d have us resist with religious zeal his designs for a newer, better post-Katrina New Orleans. Given a chance, Duany would damn the Crescent City to a future of cleanliness, orderliness and artificiality. He would do to us what he did to those poor suntanned zombies who live in Seaside, Fla., his signature 1981 ultra-planned development that made him infamous among the world\\'s architectural aesthetes.\n \t \nHe must be scorned and shunned.\n\nThe trouble is, he\\'s just so darned reasonable -- not to mention charming.\n\nHe\\'s 57 years old, born in New York, raised in Santiago, Cuba, and Barcelona, Spain; educated at Princeton, L\\'Ecole Des Beaux Arts and Yale. He\\'s married to renowned architect Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and based in Miami. For a quarter-century, he\\'s been the prince of \"new urbanism,\" a movement dedicated to defeating suburban sprawl. He\\'s planned hundreds of towns and neighborhoods. He speaks with a sort of bemused authority, as if Shangri-La were easily within reach, if it weren\\'t for the foibles of the unenlightened. His voice is a Caribbean/ Mediterranean baritone, his eyes close-set and intense, his smile blade-like and quick, his sarcasm ever-present and impeccable.\n\nDuany is part of a wave of celebrated visionaries -- from Harry Connick Jr. (on behalf of Habitat for Humanity) to Brad Pitt (for Global Green) to Thom Mayne (for the Hyatt Hotel) to Donald Trump to Pres Kabacoff -- who\\'ve poured forth various utopian plans for the resuscitation of the storm-shattered region. He has been a regular visitor to the Gulf Coast since October 2005. Fueled with grant money from a bevy of benefactors and agencies, including former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale, the Knight Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Louisiana Recovery Authority, he and his team of new urbanists have contributed rebuilding advice and design plans for big cities and small towns from Pascagoula, Miss., to Lake Charles.\n\nIt was Duany who proposed a slow-speed, pedestrian-friendly, oceanfront boulevard through Biloxi, Miss. It was Duany who promoted permanent, expandable, comparatively cozy Katrina Cottages to compete with emergency FEMA trailers. It was Duany who provided a vision for more genteel urban thoroughfares to replace the strip malls of St. Bernard Parish.\n\nIn the arena of post-K planning, Duany and his firm Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Co. seemed to be everywhere, attempting to slow traffic, add green space, elevate and consolidate our collectively reduced footprint.\n\nThose earlier plans for outlying areas may have been benign enough, but in early November, the devil Duany, at the invitation of Unified New Orleans Plan administrators, extended his tentacles to that holiest of holies, the Vieux Carre, which was largely unaffected by Hurricane Katrina. Duany had been called in to plan three of the 14 New Orleans planning districts: Gentilly, the Central Business District and the French Quarter. As is his custom, he conducted a four-day series of public meetings attended by preservationists, residents, developers and shop owners -- what architects call a charrette.\n\nDuany and company absorbed the suggestions, complaints and premonitions of what one member of the staff succinctly called \"stake holders,\" then, calling upon their collective urban planning powers, they presumably attempted to conceive broadly satisfying solutions to the French Quarter\\'s woes. On Nov. 11, Duany presented his vision for an improved Vieux Carre.\n\nThe day before, Duany could be found in his New Orleans headquarters, a cleanly renovated Decatur Street shotgun house, purchased for the Duany team\\'s extended stay. He multitasked as he discussed the future of the oldest section of the city, studying a computer screen, gazing through a window, and compulsively leaping upright from time to time to wander the room, tweaking the arrangement of the furniture, going so far as to wind an electrical cord more neatly around the base of a lamp.\n\nHe said the French Quarter had been an inspiration to him for decades. Despite its age, he sees the \"compact, walkable, diverse\" neighborhood as a model for the \"energy-starved\" future.\n\n\"All other cities are trending toward New Orleans,\" he said. \"Most cities get famous by doing three blocks of French Quarter.\"\n\nHe traced his penchant for designing communities with only a handful of harmonious architectural styles to the French Quarter, where he discovered \"the richness of what can be achieved with 12 notes.\"\n\nBut, he pointed out, all is not well.\n\n\"The French Quarter has been loved to death,\" he said, \"overwhelmed by tourists. It has become an unpleasant living environment.\"\n\nIt\\'s an environment that could be considerably improved, through modest suggestions, he said, but he saved specifics for a public presentation the following night, thereby preserving his spontaneity.\n\nIn the meantime, he turned his attention to a disagreeable e-mail from the New Orleans Building Corp. that had appeared on his screen, announcing a dramatic city-sponsored riverfront development proposal, dubbed the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" plan, that would stretch along the Mississippi from the French Quarter beyond Bywater, featuring architectural marvels by modernist heroes such as Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid and Daniel Libeskind.\n\nThe development would pass immediately in front of Duany\\'s Marigny shotgun house. He feared it would blot out the view of the well-used dog park and nearby burned warehouses that he said he found rather interesting.\n\nHe dismissed showy, big-budget projects such as the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" plan as \"silver bullet\" solutions. New Orleans, he said, is historically addicted to them. The aquarium, Convention Center and world\\'s fair were all silver bullets meant to save the struggling city. They were high-profile substitutes for more elemental changes to the municipal codes that, he believed, would have accomplished more over time. Duany puts great stock in municipal codes.\n\nNo \\'genius architects\\' needed\n\nThe portion of the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" plan that most drew his ire was the reliance on what he called \"the genius architects.\"\n\n\"All these people are congenitally over budget,\" he said, damningly, adding that they had no place in a \"city in crisis.\"\n\n\"They\\'re totally cool things,\" he said of tourist attraction architectural marvels. \"The point is that they don\\'t save the city.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Duany pointed out that he would personally benefit from the appearance of a design by Gehry, or one of the other geniuses, a stone\\'s throw from the Marigny shotgun house he\\'d recently bought for 60,000.\n\n\"I can\\'t wait to have a brilliant piece of architecture facing my house. It\\'s going to do wonders for my property value,\" he said.\n\nIf he had his choice of Pritzker Prize architects to build outside his front window he would choose Dutch star Rem Koolhaas.\n\n\"The others are not fun,\" he said. \"Rem has the irony, fatalism, complexity and bad taste that would work well in New Orleans.\"\n\nWhen Duany was asked if he could be added to a list of \"the genius architects\" brought in to save the city, he was adamant.\n\n\"I am not one of the genius architects,\" he said. \"I write codes. The basic theme is this: Cities require fundamentals to be in place.\"\n\nDuany listed safe streets, good schools, a working water supply, walkability and transit as the sort of citywide fundamentals that need to be addressed before a project like the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" or the proposed Thom Mayne-designed New Orleans Jazz Park, which he declared to be nothing more than a \"doormat for the Hyatt,\" could be undertaken. Both plans remain entirely on the drawing board and in the imaginations of their proponents.\n\nThough Duany\\'s past developments had distinctly historical styles, he said he was not against the \"Reinventing the Crescent\" or New Orleans Jazz Park because of their avowed shiny, starkly geometric modernism.\n\n\"I\\'m not an ayatollah of traditional architecture,\" he said.\n\nConsidering that the French Quarter is a perennial lightning rod of preservationist concerns, Duany\\'s Nov. 11 presentation could easily have become the urban planning equivalent of the shootout at the OK Corral.\n\nHe acknowledged that some people feared his influence on the sacred French Quarter.\n\n\"The monster has come,\" he said.\n\nJust minutes before Duany\\'s presentation at the Scottish Rite Temple on Carondelet Street, a member of his staff marveled that the master was so relaxed that he\\'d spent much of the day smoking cigars in his Decatur Street back yard -- the Marigny, he has said, reminds him of Cuba.\n\n\"I remember specifically when on a street in the Marigny,\" Duany recently wrote, \"I came upon a colorful little house framed by banana trees. I thought, \\'This is Cuba.\\' I realized in that instant that New Orleans is not really an American city, but rather a Caribbean one. I understood that when seen through the lens of the Caribbean, New Orleans is not among the most haphazard, poorest or misgoverned American cities, but rather the most organized, wealthiest, cleanest and competently governed of the Caribbean cities. This insight was fundamental because from that moment I understood New Orleans and began to truly sympathize.\"\n\nFacing the crowd of 50 who\\'d gathered to hear him speak in the acrid yellow ground floor of the temple, he said, \"Today, I spent all day listening to bamboo in the breeze and train sounds.\"\n\nSome in the audience were grim-faced, their arms crossed over their chests. A few folding chairs were occupied by bow-tied architect types. Duany\\'s staff of youthful acolytes eagerly awaited the revelation of their hard work -- and the master\\'s words.\n\nPerhaps it was the soundness of Duany\\'s ideas, perhaps that he\\'d solicited public input in advance, perhaps his aforementioned charm, but his potentially heretical presentation went off without fireworks.\n\nHe began with what he called \"a \\'Tom and Jerry\\' cartoon,\" a plan for the Marigny that he\\'d prepared of his own volition as an alternative to the New Orleans Building Corp.\\'s \"genius architect\" plan. To maximize usable space, he proposed a great wave of buried parking garages applied to the Marigny riverfront. St. Peters Street and the riverfront railroad tracks would tunnel through the landscaped garage berm. Atop the riverfront rise would be three stories of densely packed, brightly colored, quasi-Creole-style apartments and shops opening onto a promenade atop the existing docks. Dwellers and visitors would enjoy an unparalleled view of the river. His laser pointer slashed sword-like across the projected illustrations.\n\nResidents put at ease\n\nIf there was dissent in the audience, it went largely unspoken.\n\n\"I\\'ve never found a place that needed my services less,\" Duany said of the French Quarter as he launched into the feature presentation, setting the crowd immediately at ease.\n\nHe proposed five-story buildings along the French Quarter riverfront, arguing the space was too valuable for the current, ground-level parking lots -- enhanced parking would be integrated into the designs. He proposed that Rampart Street be transformed into a leafy Parisian-style boulevard, with multilevel parking garages to better accommodate French Quarter visitors. Parking, parking, parking: Duany seemed obsessed with the issue. As he later explained, the No. 1 complaint among French Quarter residents was lack of street parking. All of his plans were dedicated in part to \"liberating on-street parking for people living there.\"\n\nOne audience member questioned Duany\\'s reliance on automobiles in his plans. After all, new urbanism eschews individual vehicles for public transportation and pedestrians.\n\n\"I\\'m a ruthless realist,\" he said in response. \"I don\\'t want to force people not to drive. I want to invite them to walk.\"\n\nAnother audience member assailed Duany\\'s assertion that the Iberville public housing development should be saved, equating the complex with French Quarter crime.\n\n\"I believe the Iberville project is beautiful,\" he said, side-stepping the audience member\\'s political thrust.\n\nAnother questioned the height of the French Quarter riverfront structures.\n\nDuany assured them that properly designed structures needn\\'t be as tall or as blank as the towering Wyndham New Orleans Hotel near the river at Canal Street, which he described as a \"big oaf of a building.\"\n\nWith each critical stab, Duany parried deftly.\n\nHe concluded his presentation, true to his word, by suggesting a revamping of current French Quarter codes covering trash disposal, noise, litter, the destruction of buildings, parking lots and spilled liquid garbage, what he called the \"yellow ooze in the cracks.\" More importantly, he said, there needed to be a way to enforce existing code violations.\n\nThe seeming mantra of New Orleans is, he said: \"We shall not enforce anything.\"\n\nHis solution to the enforcement problem is a parking-ticket-style \"quality of life\" citation with such violations as \"building modification without permit,\" \"illegal demolition by neglect,\" \"improper signage,\" \"trash out on incorrect days\" and \"trash in general.\"\n\n\"Even people who handle a great deal of money get upset when they get a ticket,\" he said. \"One good 0 \\'trash in the wrong place\\' violation and you\\'ve got a cop paid for the whole morning.\"\n\nAnd then the presentation was over. His laser was extinguished. It was time for a scotch.\n\nDuany had been hired to consult. The job of implementing his ideas would remain in the hands of New Orleans leaders. His ideas would be passed through a chain of district and citywide planners, to be presented to the City Council as early as January.\n\nAn hour after the French Quarter presentation, at Duany\\'s Decatur Street headquarters, an enormous pot of gumbo was ready, and grace was about to be said. It was the custom during Duany\\'s stay in New Orleans, instigated by the team\\'s Cajun cook, to dedicate a suppertime prayer to one member of the planning team. That night, the last night of their two-week stay in New Orleans, grace was dedicated for the first time to Duany.\n\n\"Finally,\" he said.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nArt critic Doug MacCash can be reached at dmaccash@timespicayune.com or (504) 826-3481.\n\n_________________________\n\nThe Andres Duany File\n\nBorn Sept. 7, 1946, in New York City -- a Virgo.\n\nLived in Santiago, Cuba, until 1960 -- one year after Fidel Castro took power -- then moved to Barcelona, Spain, then Miami.\n\nGraduated from Princeton, 1971; Ecole de Beaux Arts, Paris, 1972; Yale School of Architecture, 1974.\n\nCo-founded Miami Arquitectonica architecture firm in 1976 with wife Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and others.\n\nCo-founded Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Co. in 1980 -- designs Seaside, the 80-acre resort village in Northwest Florida.

Europeans arrived as early as the late 1600s.\nEuropean\\'s Arrival\n\nAlexander Milne, a Scottish footman, who landed in the United States just before 1776, made a fortune from first a hardware business and then from brick making. He believed that future development would be along Lake Pontchartrain. He bought a large expanse of swampy real estate in this area. By 1830 he owned most of the lakeshore. Milne was right in his prediction. But even with the existence of the London Avenue Canal and the building of the Pontchartrain Railroad (Elysian Fields Avenue), it was not enough to draw homesteaders to the area. Throughout the 1800s, the railroad, that connected the city to Lake Pontchartrain, brought crowds of people from the city to the Milneburg resort in Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks neighborhood. A railway station was at the intersection of Gentilly Boulevard and Elysian Fields, where the railroad intersected Bayou Sauvage on the Darcantel Plantation.\n\nIt was not until the New Orleans Lakeshore and Land Company joined its drainage system at Florida Avenue with the Orleans Pumping Station that some scattered development did occur in the early 1900s.\n\nWith evidence of the earliest settlement in 1830, after the start of the Pontchartrain Railroad, sparse residential development started in 1905. Creoles were the first to inhabit the area after leaving the French Quarter/Esplanade area. The majority of development occurred from 1920 until 1950.\nSugar Hill\n\nDillard University, from which the neighborhood is named, opened in 1930 and moved to its existing site in 1935. During the 1940s, professional African Americans moved adjacent to the university and the area was called \"Sugar Hill.\" Huge oak trees lined the streets from Gentilly Boulevard to Benefit Street. Similar to the destruction of the Treme and 7th Ward\\'s thriving African American businesses and the removal of longstanding homes, this prosperous neighborhood was destroyed by the construction of the I-610 built straight through its middle, demolishing the trees and many houses. \n  \t  \nDillard University selected its name to honor Dr. James Hardy Dillard, whose distinguishable service in the education of African Americans in the South established an important chapter in the history of American education.\n\nHer Rich History\n\nDillard University was formed from a merger of Straight University and New Orleans University.\n\nThe American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church established Straight University in June 1869. The Freedman\\'s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church founded Union Normal School in July 1869. Straight University was later renamed Straight College and Union Normal School\\'s name changed to New Orleans University. Initially, both institutions provided instruction at the elementary, secondary, collegiate and professional levels.\n\nStraight College administered a law department from 1874 to 1886. New Orleans University began its medical department, including a school of pharmacy and a school of nursing, in 1889. The medical department was given the name Flint Medical College and the affiliated hospital was called the Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School. The medical college closed its operation in 1911, but the hospital, including the nursing school, continued and was renamed Flint-Goodridge Hospital of Dillard University and was located in Central City. The University ran the hospital from 1932 to 1983.\n\nNew Orleans University and Straight College merged in June 1930 and opened Dillard University. From 1930 to today Dillard has followed a policy \"in making no distinction as to race, religion or sex in the admission of students or in the selection of faculty.\"\n\nThe trustees of Dillard decided to close Gilbert Academy, the secondary school that was a part of the New Orleans University complex. However, the academy continued as a separate institution under the leadership of the Board of Education of the Methodist Church until 1949.\n\nSome outstanding accomplishments\n\nDillard instituted the first speech department in an African American university, the first undergraduate general education curriculum in the South, the first college in Louisiana to offer a nationally-accredited collegiate program in nursing, and the first among historically Black colleges and universities and any university in south central United States to offer a Japanese Studies program.\n\n    Dillard, University History\n    www.dillard.edu/about_d/history.htm\n\n    Carl Holmes Executive Development Institute hosted by Dillard University\n    www.iabpff.org/edi.htm\n\n  \t \nDillard University\\'s present location, since 1935, sprawls across 48 acres with its buildings fashioned in turn-of-the-19th century architecture. Marcus Akinlana, a local artist, displayed his talents on the London Avenue Canal Wall that borders the campus with a mural called \"Mystical, Magical New Orleans.\" This historically black private, four-year, liberal arts, coeducational university is a member school of the United Negro College Fund.\n\nA Taste of Some Outstanding Graduates and Associates\n\nBeginning in 1941, Dr. Albert Dent led Dillard University as its president for twenty-eight years. Dent grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, during segregation. He refused to ride segregated public transportation and said \"As a boy I walked all over Atlanta. Where ever I wanted to go, I walked.\" Albert Dent affected many African American students who later became activists and leaders in the local civil rights movement.\n\nRevius O. Ortique, Jr. was a student of both Xavier and Dillard Universities. Dr. Albert Dent and A. P. Tureaud, local counsel for the NAACP, made a significant impact on the young Revius. As an attorney, he became involved in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. He helped organize the McDonogh Day Boycott (in the McDonogh neighborhood) in 1954 and various public protests demanding civil rights. In the 1950s, he led the Urban League and fought job discrimination. He was elected judge in 1979.\n\t\t \n  \t  \t \nThomas C. Dent, writer, civil rights activist and dramatist, was the oldest son of Dr. Albert Dent and Ernestine Jessie Covington Dent, a former concert pianist. He began his writing career at Morehouse College as an undergraduate and lived and worked in New York for many years before returning to New Orleans. During his time in New York, he served as press liaison for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund during a most volatile time in United States civil rights history. Thurgood Marshall, then NAACP attorney and later Supreme Court Justice, appointed him to this position.\n\nHis writings in New York contributed greatly to the renaissance of published works that fueled the energy of the day and spoke to the power and struggles of African Americans.\n\nIn 1965, Dent returned to New Orleans and helped start the Free Southern Theater (FST). FST was a collective of artists, activists and thinkers who fought against racism and segregation through dramatic productions. Out of FST, Dent cofounded BLKARTSOUTH, a writer\\'s workshop to develop young writers and \"create a cultural base for them in the city.\"\n\n    AARC Notable African Americans from Louisiana Thomas C.

It opened in March 1949 with only 7,000 volumes. The library was named after a New Orleans cotton broker, whose wife bequeathed her and her husband\\'s entire estate, over one million dollars, to educational and charitable institutions. Approximately 50,000 from that estate was used to build the Norman Mayer Library. Today, the library contains over 30,000 books and has added hundreds of video and audiocassettes to its collection.\n\n    New Orleans Public Library Norman Mayer Branch\n    nutrias.org/~nopl/info/branches/ge/ge.htm\n\nHebrew Rest Cemetery\n\nOn Pelopidas Street is one of the three sites that make up the Hebrew Rest Cemetery, the largest of several Jewish burial grounds in New Orleans.\n\nThe Jewish people have made a significant impact on various aspects of the city\\'s culture and commerce. Through the generosity of Jewish philanthropists, the city benefited from major contributions to the New Orleans Museum of Art, establishment of institutions such as Tulane University and Touro Infirmary, support extended to Dillard University, and donations that helped parks and tourist attractions. Successful Jewish merchants, particularly during the 1800s and early 1900s, strengthened the city\\'s economy. Synagogues serving Jewish populations were built to serve the growing congregations in New Orleans and cemeteries were established for their dead.\nMount Olivet Cemetery &amp; Mausoleum\n\nMount Olivet Cemetery &amp; Mausoleum, on Norman Mayer Avenue, holds the remains of some of New Orleans\\' most noted.

He grew up in the Fischer Housing Development and received his law degree from Loyola University.\n\nToday, Dillard is a residential neighborhood with many conveniences nearby. A high density of commercial establishments, large and small, satisfies most of the needs of the community. Liberty Bank, on Gentilly Boulevard, is one of the ten largest black-owned commercial banks in the United States. St. John Berchman\\'s Manor, run by the Holy Family Order of nuns, operates a Catholic preschool and a home for the elderly population.\nFor more information:\n\nGentilly/Dillard Relocate New Orleans\nwww.relocateneworleans.com/neighborhoods/gentilly.cfm\n\nA House Divided\nwww.tulane.edu/~so-inst/divided24.html\n\nA House Divided\nwww.tulane.edu/~so-inst/divided25.html\n\nJudeo-Alsatians in the Deep South\nwww.sdv.fr/judaisme/histoire/document/south/neworlns.htm\n\nFind A Grave, Henry Roeland \"Professor Longhair\" Byrd\nwww.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=2703\n\nWalter C.

On June 12, 1869, the American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church founded Straight University; on July 8, 1869 the Freedman\\'s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church established Union Normal School. Straight University and Union Normal School were subsequently renamed Straight College and New Orleans University, respectively. Initially, both institutions offered instruction on the elementary level, then expanded to include the secondary, collegiate, and professional levels.\n\nStraight operated a law department from 1874 to 1886. Gilbert Academy, a secondary school, was a unit of New Orleans University. New Orleans University in 1889 opened a medical college, including a school of pharmacy and a school of nursing. The medical college was named Flint Medical College and the affiliated hospital the Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School. The medical college was discontinued in 1911, but the hospital and the nursing school were continued under the name of Flint-Goodridge Hospital.\n\nOn June 6, 1930, New Orleans University and Straight College merged to form Dillard University, which elected to follow the practices of the two parent institutions in making no distinction as to race, religion or sex in the admission of students or in the selection of faculty.\n\nThe trustees of Dillard elected to continue as a part of the university the work of the hospital but not that of Gilbert Academy. The latter continued operation as a separate institution under the sponsorship of the Board of Education of the Methodist Church until 1949. The university operated Flint-Goodridge Hospital of Dillard University from 1932 until 1983.\n\nIn September 1935, on a new site with a new physical plant, Dillard University began instruction. The university was named in honor of James Hardy Dillard, whose distinguished service in the education of African Americans in the South forms an important chapter in the history of American education.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnw7irkpe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.06508,29.99837]}},{"properties":{"name":"Family Dollar Store","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 2125 Caton St., 70122Family Dollar operates over 6,200 stores in a contiguous 44 -state area ranging northeast to Maine, southeast to Florida, as far northwest as Idaho and southwest to Arizona.

Business was fast to return when the bank reopened in March and has not slowed.\n\nAt the other end, the 3216 Gentilly Blvd. address of what once was the flagship store of Zuppardo’s Family Supermarket, now marks only rubble.\n\nIn between, businesses in the retail-dense space fall somewhere within the two extremes. Like Liberty, there are those that are bustling with business. Good Phellaz Barber Shop, for example, won’t advertise for fear that a crush of business would leave the barbers overwhelmed.\n\nOthers, including a pawn shop, paint store and electronics chain, are busy with plans to return, though their storefronts remain dark.\n\nThen there’s the video store, fast food chain and convenience store that have cut ties with the stretch and likely are closed for good.\n\nAll told, about one-third of the businesses that before the storm operated in the Gentilly Boulevard corridor from Elysian Fields Boulevard to Norman Mayer Avenue have returned. With the exception of Family Dollar and Rite Aid, all of the businesses that have reopened are locally owned.\nBefore Katrina, the retail stretch was one of the most trafficked in Gentilly.\n\n“Gentilly and Elysian Fields is probably one of the busiest intersections in the city,” said Councilmember Cynthia Hedge-Morell, whose district encompasses the intersection. “It’s such a high volume of traffic because you can go anywhere in the city from that location.”\n\nAbout 28,000 cars a day drove down Gentilly Boulevard and across Elysian Fields Avenue, in 2004, the last year for which data is available, according to a traffic study done by the city’s regional planning commission.\n\n“It’s always been like a hub for the people who live around here,” said Rep. Juan LaFonta, D-New Orleans, who oversees the district and lives nearby. “It’s convenient for the people in Vascoville, Gentilly Heights and Sugar Hill.”\n\nBut the Gentilly commercial corridor is more than a cluster of stores and businesses along a busy road. It also serves as an economic barometer for the neighborhood and a harbinger of future residential and commercial growth.\n\nLike many of the neighborhood retail hubs scattered throughout the metro area, the resumption of business along the Gentilly stretch promises to provide momentum to a community struggling to rebuild. A revived business district also offers optimism to residents contemplating their own return.\n\n“It’s a vote of confidence in the city when a business opens,” Morrell said. “It’s a big shot in the arm.”\n\n“The development helps a great deal. It builds a sense of hope in people around here,” LaFonta said. “Then when people invest in their homes they feel it’s a good decision.”\n\nBut some of the retailers that once helped anchor the stretch in Gentilly have said they’re not coming back after Hurricane Katrina. Others, beset by insurance issues and concerns about the viability of the customer base, are wracked with indecision and unable to commit one way or the other. It’s unclear when or if the retail area will ever be the bustling vibrant corridor of commerce that it was prior to Katrina.\n\nFor Ji Kang and her father, who were scouting locations for their store Ebony Beauty Supply in 2004, the decision to lease a space in the 3100 block of Gentilly Blvd. was an easy one.\n\n“We knew that this was a good area,” Kang said. “We were like, ‘Woo, this is a busy area. It’s smack in the middle of everything.’ ”\n\nThree Regional Transit Authority bus lines pass through the strip. Last month, nearly 56,500 people rode a bus that passed through the area. What’s more, the stretch is hugged from every angle by residential neighborhoods.\n\nIt was not surprising then that the strip boasted a Blockbuster, Radio Shack, Walgreens, Rite Aid, post office, Auto Zone and numerous food restaurants, all within less than 1/2 mile of each other.\n\n“It was almost like you were in a small town,” Kang said. “Everything was right there. You could park your car in the parking lot and do everything in this area.”\n\nThat made it popular with nearby college students as well as older residents.\n\n“There used to be a lot of elderly people in the neighborhood because everything is in walking distance,” Kang said. “They could walk to the pharmacist and the grocery store.”\n\nDillard University students frequently walked the tract from their Gentilly Boulevard campus, for “junk food runs,” or “just to walk,” said Doneva Lewis, a sophomore at the university.\n\nThe reasons why some of those businesses have decided to close after the hurricane are many.\n\nRoy Zuppardo, whose family owned the Zuppardo’s Family Supermarket on Gentilly at Elysian Fields, said he has not yet decided if the store will be rebuilt. Had the store not suffered physical damage it would have reopened in Sept. 2005, Zuppardo said.\n\nThe 75-year-old structure had to be demolished because the roof fell in. The store was also “outdated” and in need of a facelift before the storm, Zuppardo said. The family owns another store in Metairie.\n\nZuppardo’s was the only grocery in the immediate area.\n\n“Our family owns the property, so there’s always a possibility,” Zuppardo said. “But we haven’t made a decision to come back or not.”\n\nNearby, Peaches Records and Tapes is uncharacteristically quiet. What had been the largest hip-hop music store in the city —— known as much for stocking the music of up-and-coming local rap talent as for the murals that adorned its storefront —— moved to another neighborhood. Rent at the Gentilly building tripled after the storm, LaFonta said.\n\n“This was the meet spot,” said longtime Peaches manager Eddie Gaspard, standing outside the shuttered store. “It was the hanging spot. Now it’s gone.”\n\nThe McDonald’s across the street also is not returning. The McDonald’s insignia has been removed from the storefront and replaced with a “for lease” sign.\n\nThe site, which did not have a drive-through, didn’t fit in with McDonald’s current operating scheme, Morell said.\n\n“It may come back but maybe not in that area,” she said.\n\nLike McDonald’s, two other national chains, Walgreens and Blockbuster, also are not returning, said Jim Brown, construction manager for the property where the stores were located.\n\n“(Blockbuster is) scaling back throughout the nation,” Brown said. “This just gave them a reason to scale back here.”\n\nMeanwhile Walgreens prefers stand alone stores that can accommodate large parking lots and a drive-through pharmacy. The Walgreens on Gentilly was in the center of strip mall and flanked by a pawn shop and hair care store.\n\nThe nearby post office will remain shuttered until there is enough of a population to justify its return.\n\nSome of the other closed businesses in the stretch have indicated that they want to return. Women’s clothing store Ashley Stewart will return next month, the property manager for the store said. The nearby Rite-Aid, which is operating from a trailer, will reopen in January.\n\nBrown said it has taken time to work through the insurance policies and get construction going on some of the sites. Also slowing the effort is that many of the businesses want their sites upgraded, a cost uncovered by insurance.\n\n“They pay for you to put things back the way they were,” Brown said. “Not to make all of these changes.”\n\nMorrell said that could mean that some new businesses will move in, if old tenants don’t come back.\n\n“It’s that they want to come back bigger and better than they were before,” Morell said. “At this time, I think it will be redeveloped, I just can’t say who and when.”\n\nThe goal is to have repairs completed on the stores that want to return, such as Payless Shoe Source and Simply Fashions, by early Spring.\n\n“When I first took this on I didn’t think it would take this long,” Brown said. “Insurance companies are not paying what it would take to put it back together.”\n\nIn the meantime, some locals who used to visit regularly say the shopping strip has lost some its luster.\n\n“Zuppardo’s, that used to be my store,” said Shelia Dillon, who lives in New Orleans East. “The prices were reasonable. The people were friendly. Everything you needed was there. I don’t care if it was chicken feet or chicken butt, they had it.”\n\nDillon said she now drives from the east to the West Bank to shop at the Wal-Mart on Manhattan Boulevard.\n\n“It’s far,” she said. “When you leave you come back two or three hours later.”\n\nHenry Jackson Jr.’s routine has also been altered. Jackson said he regularly took the bus from his home on DeSaix Boulevard to the retail corridor. He would drop off mail at the post office before buying a sandwich at the nearby Subway and eating it outside Baskin Robbins. Then he’d stop in Radio Shack or Walgreens. Jackson, 61, now gives his mail to the mailman or if he’s up to it, he’ll bring it to the main office on Loyola Avenue. As for lunch at Baskin Robbins and browsing the aisles of Radio Shack and Walgreens, he’s waiting to be able to that again.\n\n“I feel like this is a ghost town,” Jackson said. “I wish they would open up some places.”\n\nLewis, the Dillard student, said fewer businesses leaves students with fewer entertainment options. It used to be that they could walk to the stretch grab dinner and rent a movie.\n\n“That kept students on campus and active in campus life,” Lewis said.\n\nNow with fewer stores open nearby the students are always leaving campus.\n\nWhat’s more, she said, what had been a well lit, busy strip is no longer because businesses closed and those that are open close early. That means many students don’t feel safe making the walk.\n\n“If you haven’t eaten by 9 p.m., you won’t eat,” Lewis said. “It’s not safe anymore.”\n\nFor the businesses that have reopened, there is plenty of business.\n\n“We wanted to come back knowing that the Dillard students and the SUNO students and the UNO students would be back,” said Ji Kang, who owns Ebony Beauty Supply at 3114 Gentilly Blvd. “I’m a little bit shocked because I didn’t think I’d have this many customers because I don’t advertise.”\n\nMost of the customers, Kang said, are from New Orleans East and Slidell, where there are few beauty and hair care stores open.\n\nThe number of barbers at Good Phellaz Barber Shop, has slimmed from 14 to five since the storm. And with fewer barber shops open in the city, they’ve been busy, said Ferdinand White, who co-owns the shop on Caton Street, just off of Gentilly Blvd.\n\nThe shop opened in February. And although it sits in a strip mall where most of the other businesses are closed and the main traffic draw, a post office, still sits gutted to the studs, Good Phellaz has not had to advertise and most of its customers are new.\n\nStill, White waits for the day when more businesses open, making it easier for his customers to grab a snack or run errands before and after a haircut.\n\n“I was expecting them to come back sooner,” White said. “I think a lot of people don’t think people are back in the Gentilly area.”\n\nThere is rarely a slow time at the Family Dollar on Caton Street. The store, which reopened June 29 and sells milk, eggs and cheese along with dry food products, clothing and home ware is popular with nearby students and residents, assistant manager Erma Jones said.\n\n“It’s pretty lucrative around here,” Jones said. “At first business was slow, but as people come back and they realize we’re open they come in. This is one of the busiest and largest Family Dollars that the company has.”\n\nAbout 70 percent of the business has returned to Riteway Soul Food, co-owner Minh Tran said. While he’s impressed with that number, he said he has learned that many of his regulars who lived nearby haven’t returned because they are still lining up contractors to work on their homes.\n\n“I do believe the people around here want to come back but don’t have the construction,” Tran said.\n\n“I am satisfied with the progress, but I’m not happy. It could always be better,” Tran said. “I’m more optimistic than skeptical. I think it’s going to get better but I know it’s going to take time.”\n\nThat any business has reopened means the retail center and the community that surrounds it is poised for a comeback, LaFonta said.\n\n“That was an economically viable corridor before the storm,” LaFonta said. “And it will be again.”\n\nMorrell said that as the businesses come back so will the people who live nearby and vice versa. She is confident that Road Home money coming through the pipelines will help to boost both.\n\n“I think that’s going to spearhead a lot of development,” Morrell said. “We’re just getting to the point where people are making final decisions. As they do, everyone wants to have convenience.

The Smokey Mary train chugged back and forth along Elysian Fields, bringing New Orelans residents to Milneburg, a recreational village on Lake Pontchatrain.\nAlexander Milne\n\nAlexander Milne, a Scottish footman and philanthropist who made his fortune from a hardware business and brick making, astutely predicted that New Orleans would expand northward. It did. He bought large tracts of land in this area, and by 1834 he owned most of the lakeshore. The Milne Lighthouse still stands at the foot of Elysian Fields, and is perhaps the most historic structure still standing in present-day Gentilly. Milne’s name was also bestowed upon a majestic cluster of elegant white buildings that became a home for wayward boys.\nGentilly Terrace Land Company\n\nThe first major developers in Gentilly were Messers Lafaye, DeMontluzin, and Baccich. Other owners of the area included Lake Shore Land Company, Gus Seeger, Seabrook Realty Company, Bienville Realty and the New Orleans Industrial Canal Land and Harbor Development Company.The 1914 construction of Gentilly Terrace School, in the center of Lafaye, DeMontluzun and Baccich’s development, signaled that Gentilly Terrace—the area\\'s first neighborhood, now listed on the National Historic Register— was a place where families put down their roots, and grow.\nWhy Gentilly?\n\n    * Families fall in love with Gentilly, and they stay in Gentilly.\n    * Gentilly’s myriad of neighborhoods provide a style of living for everyone.\n    * Gentilly is home to four Universities (UNO, SUNO, Dillard, and the Baptist Theological Seminary), as well as numerous elementary and high schools.\n    * Our community relishes diversity.\n    * We know our neighbors, and haveactive neighborhood associations.\n    * Elysian Fields links Gentilly to Lake Pontchatrain, the French Quarter, and the CBD.\n    * Your family can spend a day at Lake Pontchatrain, or even City Park.\n\n\nAbout the GCIA\nMeetings\n\nGeneral Meetings are the 2nd Saturday of each month unless otherwise stated\nGCIA Founders\n\nScott M. Darrah, LaDonna Darrah, Morwen Madrigal, John Triplett, Vera Triplett, David Welch, Georgian Spata\n \nHistory\n\nIn October 2005 several members of the Gentilly after Katrina Yahoo group met at City Hall with New Orleans City Council District D Councilmember Cynthia Hedge Morrell to discuss strategy for the rebuilding and repopulating of the Gentilly Community. As a result of this meeting Scott and LaDonna Darrah reached out to Morwen Madrigal, John and Vera Triplett, David Welch, and Georgian Spata and presented the idea of forming an umbrella civic association with the mission of uniting the Gentilly neighborhoods and neighborhood associations. All agreed and Scott Darrah filed the incorporation documents with the Louisiana Secretary of State as a non profit entity with himself, LaDonna Darrah, Morwen Madrigal, John Triplett, Vera Triplett, David Welch, and Georgian Spata as the founding Board of Directors.\n\nThe Gentilly Civic Improvement Association was born and became officially recognized by the LA Secretary of State as a New Non Profit entity in November of 2005. With the continuous support of Councilwoman Morrell and Criminal Sheriff Marlin Gusman the GCIA began the task of organizing meetings as well as community improvement and beautification projects. Joining the Board of Directors later in November were new members Jim Hollingshad, Flora Williams, and Father Roger Allen of the Episcopal Diocese of LA, Chapel of the Holy Comforter, with Scott Darrah taking responsibility for its leadership as the Acting President of GCIA.\n\nIn early December of 2005 the GCIA had its first public General Meeting which was an open meeting at the Chapel of the Holy Comforter with approximately 65 Gentillyans in attendance. At this meeting The purpose of the GCIA as well as the interim board members were presented to the body in attendance. Nikki Najiola also stepped up and accepted a position on the interim board agreeing to serve as interim Treasurer. Scott Darrah was elected GCIA\\'s first President by the body in attendance, Vera Triplett was elected its first Vice President, Nikki Najiola was elected its first Treasurer, and Georgian Spata was elected its first Secretary. The remainder of the Interim Board were accepted by the body in attendance of this meeting to serve along with the executive board to include LaDonna Darrah, John Triplett, Morwen Madrigal, Dave Welch, Fr. Roger Allen, Flora Williams and Jim Hollingshad.\n\nLater that same December, the GCIA established working relationships with the University of New Orleans, Dillard University, and Southern University at New Orleans all of whom have been instrumental in assisting the GCIA and the Gentilly Community in helping with the planning and implementation of the rebuilding of the Gentilly Community.\nToday\n\nThe GCIA now proudly serves as the common vehicle for all Gentilly Civic and Neighborhood Associations to unite and work together to achieve our collective goals. We continue to work toward seeing to the long term interests of the Gentilly Community and the unified Gentilly neighborhoods hereafter. GCIA has been actively engaged with Urban Planning, Economic Development, Education Re-development, Land Use and Zoning, Safety and Crime Prevention, and a host of other initiatives in the Gentilly Community to see to her future.\n\nGeneral Meetings are the 2nd Saturday of each month unless otherwise stated.\n\nBoard of Directors Meetings (for the time being) are the First Wednesday and the Third Friday of each month at 7pm.\n\nThe location will be primarily room 161 of the UNO Old Business Building which is the new GCIA Office.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnw4d5mnh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.06429,30.00438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gentilly Planning District (6th Disctrict Orleans Parish)","description":"Posted by Rufusl<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnw79iinl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.05933,30.0006]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gentilly Terrace Neighborhood","description":"Posted by RufuslGentilly Terrace Neighborhood\n\n“Gentilly Terrace sits on a natural ridge created by Bayou Sauvage, a former flood plain.

California bungalow style houses, most of them constructed from 1910-1940, English cottages and Spanish- and Mediterranean-revival homes constitute this national historic district, the first 20th century New Orleans neighborhood to be listed.\nTerrace\\'s beginnings\n\t\n\nMathurin Dreux was granted a large tract of land in recognition of his services as a militia officer in the New Orleans province. He chose a tract along Bayou St. John that extended across the rear of the city, which included the present day Gentilly district. This was the highest spot in the city and virtually free from flooding.\n\nMathurin with his brother, Pierre, built their homes in the area and operated the land as a plantation. After their death, the estate stayed in the Dreux family for over two generations. The rural character of the area remained for almost two centuries.\nHigh ground key to development\n\nThe high ground and natural drainage with easy access to the city made this a prime section for development shortly before World War I. The Pontchartrain Railroad, built in 1830, provided transportation through the Gentilly district. It ran along Elysian Fields to Lake Pontchartrain.\n\nMichael Baccich, Edward E. Lafaye and R. E. Edgar de Montluzin laid out the neighborhood in the early 20th century. In 1909, Dennis Sheen purchased Edgewood Park, which extended from Gentilly Boulevard to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. After 1935, the neighborhood population grew rapidly.\nGentilly Today\n\nVarious organizations operate to keep the neighborhood safe and well maintained. Some of these organizations are the Gentilly Terrace Neighborhood Association, Gentilly Sugar Hill Residents Association, Gentilly Terrace &amp; Gardens Improvement Association, and the Neighborhood Watch Program.\nGentilly Terrace Creative Arts Elementary School\n\t\n\nThe neighborhood is proud to claim Gentilly Terrace Creative Arts Elementary as a Blue Ribbon School in 1991-92. The school plays an integral part in the community as neighborhood organizations and community groups, such as the Girl Scouts, use its facilities. In turn, the students participate in community activities. The banners that hang in the Kids Tent at the Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival are painted by the students each year.\n\nThe school building, built in 1914, reflects California Craftsman and Swiss Chalet influences. Its architectural significance contributed to the neighborhood\\'s national registry listing.\nFor more information:\n\nLouisiana Timeline\nwww.enlou.com/time/year1909.htm\n\nPreservation Resource Center\\'s Gentilly Terrace Historic District\nprcno.org/neighbor.html\n\nPreservation Resource Center Neighborhood Heroes\nwww.prcno.org/Schools/GentillyTerraceCreativeArts.htm\n\nNew Orleans Public Schools Blue Ribbon Schools\nwww.nops.k12.la.us/Schools/blueribbon.html\n\nNew Orleans Police Department Third District Neighborhood Watch Programs\nwww.new-orleans.la.us/home/nopd/content.php?dir=services/nwatch&amp;page=nw_3rd.php\n\nNeighborhood Profiles Project Document prepared by the City of New Orleans Office of Policy Planning and the City Planning Commission.

One client was Wal-Mart and, as the younger Sitt watched Walton personally tracking daily sales, he observed how differently Wal-Mart was run from other retailers he saw. He recalls cleanliness, friendliness and good prices. He also remembers his father\\'s prediction that one day Wal-Mart would be the biggest retailer in America.\n\nIt was an experience that still fuels the 38-year-old\\'s passion for retail. So did growing up in a tough Brooklyn neighborhood that lacked retail options. “Being frustrated as a kid that I couldn\\'t find decent retail was one of the biggest things that made me an advocate for bringing quality retailing into urban areas,” says Sitt.\n\nHis earliest venture was developing a 12,000-sq.-ft. retail project on East Tremont Avenue in a rough Bronx neighborhood when he was still in his 20s and studying at New York University.\n\nOther endeavors have included founding Ashley Stewart Ltd., a store specifically for African-American women. He eventually sold off more than 90% of Thor\\'s interest in the company. During his leadership, the store and its affiliates generated 00 million in sales in more than 300 stores. Thor also bought and sold The Children\\'s Place retail chain, which now consists of 629 stores nationwide. Thor has acquired or currently has under contract 5.5 million sq. ft. Projects in the works include Gentilly Woods in New Orleans, Military Circle Mall, Norfolk, Va., and an 80,000-sq.-ft. retail and office project on Chicago\\'s State Street.\n\nThe company is also in the midst of revitalizing the 475,000-sq.-ft. Gallery at Fulton Street in Brooklyn, striving for an upscale ambiance. The redevelopment has already attracted at least one big national retailer, Forever 21, which signed a 12-year lease. “This has been a tremendously underserved market,” Sitt comments. He estimates that more than  billion a year in retail spending has been traveling outside Brooklyn.\n\n“So many urban strip centers are run down to the ground. It\\'s disgusting,” he says. “People keep shopping at those places because there\\'s nowhere else to go.” Yet retail turnarounds don\\'t have to cost big bucks. Cleaning, repaving parking lots and installing lighting and music systems can transform an ailing property and the surrounding community. “It\\'s spending pennies to make dollars,” adds Sitt.\nWho\\'s the customer?\n\nRather than drop-kicking a suburban operation into the inner city, Sitt spends time hanging around with local leaders and in neighborhood churches, restaurants and clubs to identify residents\\' ethnic identities and preferences in music and clothing. Then Thor develops retail that caters specifically to local needs and tastes. “It\\'s important to inculcate into our heads an understanding of who that customer is,” Sitt says. For the Ashley Stewart stores, for instance, Thor listened to what aesthetics its target customer wanted. The store designs keyed into those desires with upscale leopard carpet, gold trim throughout and walls with a mahogany appearance.\n\nSitt calls it “Bellagio-ing” (referring to the chi-chi Las Vegas hotel) inner city stores — providing a first-class ambiance in areas that traditionally have been shunned by developers and retailers.\n\nThe development process is personally satisfying to Sitt, especially when customers kiss and thank him at grand openings. Thor\\'s approach also fits with the company\\'s earliest mission, which is embodied in its name. Thor, a Norse god, aims to defend the plant earth. The god\\'s objective correlates with Sitt\\'s aspiration of preserving and gentrifying urban areas. “People appreciate what we bring. The sales tax base jumps and projects spur the economy and bring jobs,” he says. “And when people shop and keep recycling dollars in the community, it furthers its growth.”\n\nUS News &amp; World Report\nUrban makeover artist\nBy Megan Barnett\n8/16/04\n8/05  \t\n\nYoung Adjustment co., Inc.\nRecent Claims Handled\nDate \tClient / Loss \tDamage Cost\nThor Equities � Gentilly Woods Mall- New Orleans, LA � Wind &amp; flood damage from Hurricane Katrina destroy shopping center\n\t5,000,000.00\n\nWhen Joseph Sitt turned 12, his grandmother promised to buy him the two things he wished for most: a video game and a parrot. Sitt was raised in what he calls the \"tougher neighborhood\" of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, N.Y., the setting of The Honeymooners and Welcome Back, Kotter. After the pair cased all of Brooklyn and came up empty-handed, they had to trek into Manhattan to find retailers selling what the boy wanted.\n\nAnd so a retail developer was born. Now 40, Sitt is the founder and CEO of Thor Equities, a real-estate developer focused on bringing retailers to blighted, urban areas of primarily low-income residents. He started the company in 1986 when he was just 21, with the purchase of a plot of land in the Bronx. He built a one-story retail building that eventually attracted Rite Aid Pharmacy and Payless ShoeSource. Today, the company owns more than 4 million square feet of real estate in cities nationwide, including Detroit, Chicago, and Atlanta. Thor Equities buys and develops primarily retail properties and consults with stores on their urban expansion strategies.\n\nNo sale. While Sitt knew firsthand of the opportunities for brand-name retailers in New York\\'s inner-city neighborhoods, selling that pitch to them wasn\\'t always so easy. For years, he endured rejection after rejection of his attempts to entice retailers to his shopping centers in some of the more crime-ridden areas of New York. The neighborhoods were too rough, there were no data on the market, and the suburbs had more money. Frustrated by the rebuffs, he started his own chain of stores to prove that inner-city retail prospects existed. It worked.\n\n\"Everybody said I was nuts,\" says Sitt. \"They said, \\'This kid\\'s gonna get his ass handed to him.\\' But the day has arrived. The white urban market is saturated. There is no place else to grow. Joe Sitt proved it.\" Indeed, the company Sitt founded in 1991, called Ashley Stewart, now counts 170 stores. He sold the clothing chain, which caters to the African-American professional woman, in 1998.\n\nSpeaking with a thick Brooklyn accent, Sitt is easily excitable. Ask him about inner-city economics, and you\\'re likely to get an earful of colorful anecdotes about urban prospects, places that have \"gold in our own backyards.\" His observations are now backed up by hard data, which have helped to win retailers like Forever 21, Foot Locker, and Old Navy to some of the toughest neighborhoods in the country. According to the nonprofit group Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, urban cores hold more than 5 billion in annual retail spending power. Moreover, the predominantly black and Hispanic populations in many of these neighborhoods are among the fastest growing.\n\nSitt credits these figures as just one of the reasons for the change of heart of some major retailers. His company\\'s improvements to malls are another attraction. In 2001, Thor Equities bought a run-down strip mall in the Gentilly Woods area of New Orleans. Residents told him they needed a linens store. Thor Equities remodeled the building, upgraded the parking lot, improved the lighting, and brought in Anna\\'s Linens as a mall anchor. \"It was an ugly space, and it took a lot of work on his part,\" says Pat Barber, Anna\\'s vice president of real estate. \"He did a beautiful job with it. The store is doing great.\" At the start of the project, Sitt says, only one in 40 lenders responded to his request to fund the project. After its completion, he was able to refinance with J.P. Morgan Chase. \"They all thought it was an unfinanceable ugly duckling,\" he says. \"I had to prove I was able to do it.\"\n\nThor Equities is doing similar renovations in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Puerto Rico. But Sitt still focuses much of his effort on his hometown of Brooklyn. Many firms cite high prices and space constraints as reasons to open in New Jersey instead of Manhattan. \"I think Brooklyn should be the weapon New York City uses,\" he says. Sitt is now weighing offers from three of the largest chains, including Wal-Mart, to anchor his Gallery at Fulton Street in downtown Brooklyn. With a big-box retailer like that, there will be no shortage of video games for all the 12-year-olds in Bensonhurst.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnwe7z0gs"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.039931,30.004041]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hebrew Rest Cemetery","description":"Posted by Rufusl2100 Pelopidas St., New Orleans, LouisianaHebrew Rest Cemetery: Located at 2100 Pelopidas St., Hebrew Rest was founded in 1872.

Just when one foot seems to lift out of the post-hurricane muck, the other slips.\n\nIn the latest entanglement, the move of a historic Catholic school, promising rebirth for the battered Gentilly neighborhood, has been stymied by preservationists. The school had planned to tear down an abandoned 1960s-era church in Gentilly in order to rebuild, but preservationists here said the austere, modernist structure was worth saving.\n\nProviding an unexpected assist to the preservationists is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is vital in financing the school’s move but is balking, for now.\n\nDismayed politicians and residents of the emptied Gentilly district, desperate for any hint of confidence in New Orleans’s future, are crying foul. Barely a third of residents have returned to the neighborhood, one of the city’s black middle-class centers.\n\n“This could be a blow that the neighborhood may not be able to come back from,” said Cynthia Hedge Morrell, the district’s city councilwoman.\n\n“Are you saying,” she said, “that a piece of concrete is more valuable than humans?”\n\nThe dispute is typical of the tough choices routinely forced to the surface here in Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath. Moving on or moving back is a theme playing out across the city, notably in a fierce struggle over the future of public housing projects.\n\nOther signs of faltering renewal abound, like companies shifting their headquarters and employees out of the city, developers waiting on tax credits, and homeowners looking in vain for aid checks. Building projects are numerous on paper, but actual construction is much harder to detect, and it will be several years before inexpensive housing is developed.\n\nA new survey by the University of New Orleans suggests that one-third of residents, weary of the waiting game, are thinking of leaving, and soon.\n\nAt the heart of the church standoff is the Holy Cross School, a fixture on the riverbank in the Lower Ninth Ward since the 1870s. It usually educates more than 800 boys in grades 5 through 12. The school, inundated by Hurricane Katrina, now operates out of trailers at about 60 percent of its old enrollment levels, and it wants to leave the moribund, vulnerable area it colonized when the Lower Ninth Ward was still farmland.\n\nThe school flirted with moving to the Jefferson Parish suburbs, an idea that is generally poison to city residents. But then it said it would stay in New Orleans, proposing to move to Gentilly. That decision was a rare thumbs up for the city, and even citizens living far from Gentilly felt a boost that a pillar of New Orleans’s old-line Catholic establishment would be staying.\n\nIn Gentilly itself, where on a weekday morning the loudest sound is the wind rustling through dead tree branches, there was jubilation, as well as visions of loud schoolboys and teachers crowding the empty sidewalks.\n\n“I can’t tell you the overwhelming joy people felt with this announcement,” said Scott Darrah, president of the Gentilly Civic Improvement Association. “It was one of the most joyous occasions people in this community had had since the flood, one of the most hope-filled occasions. People all over were sending me e-mails saying, ‘Thank you, we’re so thrilled.’ ”\n\nIt is not hard to see why. Vacant houses and empty windows stare across the street at the 18-acre site that the school’s independent board is buying, at a reasonable price, from the Archdiocese of New Orleans. At intervals a trailer in a front yard indicates an owner’s rare interest in the future. All seems ready for redevelopment — or abandonment.\n\nBut there was a hitch in the good news. The site chosen by the school contains the St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Church, one of the city’s rare expressions of mid-20th-century modernism, an unusual structure with a white knitting-needle spire poking out from a thin, curled concrete roof that seems to float over the church’s brick-box body.\n\nIt has hardly been on the city’s list of must-see landmarks, and with its resemblance to a giant kitchen appliance, it gets mixed reviews from architects.\n\n“It’s certainly an important modernist building, locally,” said Errol Barron, a leading New Orleans architect.\n\nThe church has been unused since the storm, and the local archdiocese was ready to part with it. The school, saying it needed the site cleared, was preparing a date with the wrecking ball. Fixing up the church and maintaining it would be too expensive, school officials said. They ringed the site with bright yellow signs advertising enrollment.\n\nBut rumblings from preservation-minded former parishioners, who had moved elsewhere, began percolating upward. The New Orleans Historic District Landmarks Commission voted to study the church, and school officials, construction plans at the ready, started to get uneasy.\n\nThen the city’s de facto tutelary deity stepped in: FEMA decided the church might be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. And that was a position with potentially deep consequences for the Holy Cross School, one that could mean no federal money — a potential 0 million — to help it relocate.\n\n“It was very much of a surprise to us,” said William Chauvin, chairman of the Holy Cross board of trustees. “The archdiocese had no intention of keeping that facility.”\n\nNow, all is on hold, a frustration to the school and its supporters. In a statement on Monday, FEMA said it was required to “evaluate the potential historic significance” of the church, though late in November an agency official wrote that it had already determined that the church was eligible to be in the National Register. Mr. Chauvin interpreted the shift in wording as a softening of FEMA’s position.\n\nThe State of Louisiana and the National Park Service must also weigh in on the church’s precise significance.\n\nIts fans are as passionate as those yearning for Gentilly to come back. “A very exciting place to worship,” said Stephen Verderber, a professor of architecture at Tulane University, “the exact opposite architecturally from the traditional design of a church.”\n\nBut Bruce Velez, a contractor living in a trailer across the street as he fixes up a gutted house, said, “If they keep messing around, the school will go somewhere else.” Mr. Velez longs for the school.\n\n“We were lucky to get it,” he said, looking down the empty street. “I wish they’d hurry up and tear the church down. You’re going to have kids from the 5th to the 12th grades. I mean, think about it. That’s a lot of people.”<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnwbfgudd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.075066,30.013971]}},{"properties":{"name":"Liberty Bank &amp; Trust","description":"Posted by Rufusl Strong Financial Institutions are the Bedrock of Thriving Viable Cities\n\nNew Orleans is a better place to live because of Liberty Bank.

Let Liberty Show You The Way. \n\nThe mission of Liberty Bank is to provide cost-effective delivery of high quality, innovative, customer-driven products and services to the diverse markets with particular focus on the disadvantaged African-American community who traditionally have been financially underserved.\n\nConcurrent with the bank\\'s mission, we strive to generate a fair return to shareholders while being an excellent corporate citizen. \n\nA Strong Foundation\nFounded in 1972, Liberty Bank has always been based on ideals of service and integrity. With a primary focus on bringing financial services to the traditionally under-served, Liberty quickly established itself as a financial force in the New Orleans community. By combining a vision of community uplift with a commitment to fundamental banking principles, the Bank helped to grow its customer base while growing its own resources and operations.\n\nMore than three decades later, Liberty Bank is a model of corporate stability. Consistent growth in assets and profitability has created a banking powerhouse with the capacity to participate in major projects and to provide services to the largest clients. The base is strong, making the possibilities virtually limitless.\n\nProfits and Assets: Strength in Numbers\nWhile Liberty has an enviable record of consistent growth, the last decade has seen a tremendous acceleration of both profitability and asset accumulation. Within that period, the Bank has grown from 0 million to 40 million in total assets and has significantly increased its profitability. In its most recent year-end report, Liberty showed single-year profitability growth of 22%, and enjoyed a return on common equity of more than 20% year over year for the past four years.\n\nLiberty\\'s growth has been the result of acquisitions, expansion of products and services, aggressive marketing, fruitful partnerships, strong management, excellent staff productivity, and the trust it enjoys in the community. It all adds up to an efficient, well-capitalized institution that is perfectly positioned to continue fast-paced growth in both profits and assets.\n\nExpanding Our Reach\nFrom its original office in a trailer on a corner lot in New Orleans, Liberty Bank has expanded to 13 branch offices in three cities and two states, with the majority of this growth taking place in the past decade. Liberty established its Baton Rouge presence in 1994, opening its third branch there in 2004. The Bank moved into Mississippi in 2003, acquiring First American Bank in Jackson, and has since opened a second Magnolia State branch on the Jackson State University campus.\n\nLiberty\\'s reach is not limited just to banking offices. Its rapidly expanding ATM network now features over three dozen locations. Independent loan production offices bring mortgage and other profitable lending activity into the Bank. And thousands of credit card holders carry the Liberty brand literally around the world.\n\nWhile Liberty\\'s recent expansion has been rapid, it has also been measured. Each new office, whether an acquisition or a new branch opening, is carefully situated for maximum marketplace impact. Each new territory, product or service is carefully researched to make sure it fits appropriately within the bank\\'s profile and plans.\n\nThe Power of Technology\nNew technologies have revolutionized banking and Liberty Bank\\'s embrace and application of the most powerful banking technologies are another reason for its success. From customer services like on-line banking, check imaging, direct deposit and automated bill paying, to merchant services that increase business speed and opportunity, to the most advanced corporate and governmental support applications, Liberty has harnessed the power of technology for maximum banking versatility, convenience and productivity.\n\nCorporate Partnerships\nHelping business do business is one of Liberty Bank\\'s top priorities. The bank\\'s business portfolio ranges from small business loans to combined ventures with Fortune 500 companies. But this is just one aspect of Liberty\\'s multi-faceted corporate service package. Financial management services, insurance, investments, and consulting make Liberty Bank a valuable partner for any growth-oriented enterprise.\n\nGovernment Partnerships\nPublic-private partnerships are increasingly being seen as a way to get more done while enhancing business profitability. Liberty Bank has had this vision for many years.\n\nCurrently, Liberty serves as the fiscal agent for the City of New Orleans, substantially improving the City\\'s cash flow and cash management practices and increasing its interest income, while also generating significant income for the bank. Liberty also provides expertise in areas such as collections, financial systems and customer service, and has become a key partner to city government.\n\nAt the federal level, Liberty Bank has worked with many different branches of government on everything from the takeover of failing financial institutions to initiatives such as New Market Tax Credits Program. Liberty was one of the first banks in the nation to win the U. S. Treasury\\'s stewardship of a 0 million allocation of tax credits. The program will attract investment to the economically distressed areas of New Orleans.\n\nThe Spectrum of Services\nWith size, strength and stability comes the ability to provide the full spectrum of banking services. As its resources have grown, so has the number of services Liberty offers to its customers, individual, business and institutional.\n\nLiberty Bank provides all types of deposit accounts, from basic checking to a variety of investment instruments. On the lending side, mortgages, commercial loans, personal loans, and credit cards are just a few of the available options.\n\nThe list continues at length: insurance, financial management, electronic banking, a full deck of credit, debit and stored value cards, and much more. Any Liberty Bank representative would be delighted to provide additional details. And every product we offer is backed by something no other financial institution can provide: Liberty Bank customer service, where every client is treated with the highest respect, value and attention to detail.\n\nEmpowering the Community\nLiberty Bank\\'s success over the years has elevated it to a lofty status in the banking world – yet its roots remain deep in its community. Believing that education is the future for our young people, Liberty sponsors the annual Support Our Schools initiative to help schools generate additional funds for supplies and activities, as well as the annual Liberty Track Meet that awards scholarships to talented student-athletes. Liberty is also a strong, longtime supporter of The College Fund, and contributes to many other worthy causes throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to direct financial support, Liberty Bank officers and staff members give countless hours of their time each year, providing expertise, counseling and sometimes just a helping hand to individuals and organizations in every community we serve.\n\nFor many years, Liberty\\'s motto has been \"Doing Well While Doing Good.\" This means focusing financial services and resources on those people and places that have traditionally been overlooked. The result of this has been Liberty\\'s \"Outstanding\" CRA rating for ten consecutive years. Simply put, we build people\\'s dreams while building a stronger community and a stronger bank.\n\nBank Power\nIn 21st century America, money is not just a purchasing mechanism, it is power, freedom, and the key that opens the door to opportunity, both business and personal. Over the course of three decades, Liberty Bank and Trust has built substantial financial power for itself and its legions of customers through innovative services, community outreach, sound banking practices, and a lot of hard work.\n\nToday, Liberty Bank is nationally recognized for its strength, leadership and business acumen. One of the five largest African-American-owned financial institutions, Liberty is a corporate partner of Fortune 500 companies, and a major supplier of financial services to government and government agencies throughout Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThis page provides important information about Liberty\\'s products and services, as well as its institutional capabilities and history. But the only true way to know Liberty Bank and Trust is to experience its power firsthand, to become its newest partner on the road to success.\nThe Liberty Foundation is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit corporation which was organized by Liberty Bank and Trust Company in 1993 to facilitate the bank’s philanthropic housing and education initiatives including, but not limited to, assisting in the implementation and support of community-based endeavors that are designed to improve the quality of life, expand access to secondary and higher education, and to increase the availability of affordable housing in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge areas of Louisiana and in Jackson, Mississippi. Its purpose is to have a positive impact on the people and the communities which Liberty serves, primarily by supporting education, neighborhood restoration, and affordable housing. The Foundation serves as a catalyst, providing seed resources that others are empowered to nurture, harvest and re-plant. Its objective is to make its community self-sustaining. Since 1993, the Liberty Foundation has raised and donated more than  million.\n\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnw7gokty"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.06081,29.99694]}},{"properties":{"name":"Milne Boys Home","description":"Posted by RufuslMusic Landmark Caught in Tug of Priorities After Storm\n\nNew York Times\nBy SUSAN SAULNY\nPublished: March 19, 2006\n\nNEW ORLEANS, March 16 — The doors of the deserted Milne Boys Home flap open in the wind, and anyone who cares to brave the dank interior here in the heart of the drowned Gentilly neighborhood can find crumbling logbooks noting who visited in the early 1900\\'s and yellowing sheet music in the attic.\n\nMany wonder if the Milne Boys Home, which was damaged by floodwaters after Hurricane Katrina, will have a place in the new New Orleans.\n\nAn old trombone and some music books in the attic of the Milne Boys Home on Franklin Avenue in New Orleans.\n\nA bronze plaque on the weather-beaten facade announces that Milne is \"A Landmark of American Music,\" but it hardly looks the part, taking its place among the city\\'s once-grand buildings ruined by floodwater after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nNonetheless, what happens to this 11-acre campus of wide lawns and oak trees is of more than casual interest to many people here because of its ties to Louis Armstrong, arguably this city\\'s most famous native son.\n\nBefore Milne was built in the 1930\\'s, part of it was called the Colored Waif\\'s Home for Boys, the institution where Armstrong was incarcerated at age 11 after firing a pistol to celebrate New Year\\'s Day 1913. It was there that he learned to play the cornet.\n\nArmstrong is but one of a host of noted jazz musicians to train at the Colored Waif\\'s Home, and later at Milne, to which he was a friend throughout his life.\n\nIn a city that long ago demolished Armstrong\\'s birthplace, along with Storyville, the neighborhood where early jazz developed, and the original waif\\'s home, Milne stands as one of the last physical connections to the city\\'s musical past, and many wonder if it will have a place in the new city. Other than the landmark plaque placed by a national music group, it was hardly noted in the old one.\n\n\"You might say this is the second, if not the third, opportunity to do something with a Louis Armstrong site where the opportunity has been missed,\" said Bruce Boyd Raeburn, curator of the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane University here. \"A lot of the old jazz sites have been torn down to make new parking lots.\"\n\nMr. Raeburn added, \"The track record on preserving jazz-related sites is pretty dismal for New Orleans.\"\n\nYet this is a city that is probably more dependent on the marketing of jazz than any other, as tourism is one of the few engines of the local economy. In an acknowledgment of that, the city renamed its airport after Armstrong in 2001. But when asked about the cultural importance of the Milne site, the city official overseeing arts and entertainment said he did not know much about it. Mayor C. Ray Nagin\\'s office did not return calls for comment.\n\nIn the chaos of dealing with an acute housing shortage, a coming mayoral election and tens of thousands of displaced residents, city officials have had little energy or resources to deal with issues like the arts or historic preservation.\n\nBut it is precisely at times like these, local activists say, that pieces of the culture slip away — especially in areas like Gentilly, where mostly modest homes line quiet streets that in feeling and geography are miles away from better known destinations like the French Quarter and the Garden District.\n\n\"It certainly is a chance once again for a rebuilt New Orleans to seize an opportunity that in the past it did not seize, and to actually help its own cause,\" said Lee Hampton, executive director of the Amistad Research Center, an archive for the history of African-Americans and other ethnic groups, at Tulane. \"Certainly I think it would be worth preserving and worth the effort put into upkeep. I think it could actually repay the city in its interest to outsiders, to tourists.\"\n\nLong neglected, Milne was not in pristine shape before the storm and had not housed children since the 1980\\'s, becoming instead the setting for after-school social service programs and athletics. The home, not far from the London Avenue Canal, which breached the levees in two spots, flooding Gentilly and surrounding neighborhoods, had capacity for 80 boys before it closed as a residence.\n\nThe home was named for a Scottish philanthropist, Alexander Milne, who arrived here in the late 1700\\'s and provided money for the care of troubled children in his will after making a fortune in bricks and hardware. \n\"The problem with the city now is, where do we place our priorities?\" said Tad Jones, a local historian and co-producer of the annual Satchmo Summer Fest, a celebration of Armstrong\\'s music. \"Since we\\'re not getting much direction from the city or the feds, all the local homeowner associations in Gentilly and around the lake are coalescing and talking about how to revitalize the neighborhoods. That\\'s a good thing and a bad thing because we\\'re not all on the same page.\"\n\nOver the decades, not everyone in solidly middle-class Gentilly has been thrilled about having a haven for troubled youth in the area. Some wanted Milne done away with years ago. Others want to see it come back just as it was, as a scaled-down social service and recreation center. Still others want at least part of it to be a memorial to Armstrong and a reminder of what can happen when a poor child gets a chance at a better life.\n\n\"Louis Armstrong is the poster child for that,\" Mr. Raeburn said.\n\nOfficials said the city was negotiating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to determine how much federal money might be available for the site. The city holds a 99-year lease on the property from the Milne Trust, a private foundation. Part of the complex has been gutted, and the roofs are protected by blue tarp.\n\nArmstrong was born to a teenage mother in a neighborhood so notoriously dangerous, even by New Orleans\\' rough port-town standards, that it was called \"the battlefield.\" He was largely abandoned by his father and dropped out of grade school, and entertained people by singing and dancing for change around the brothels of Storyville.\n\nHe occasionally got into trouble with the police, but around Storyville, he also got to hear the likes of Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton, pioneers of early jazz.\n\nPeter Davis, the music teacher who invited Armstrong to play in the waif\\'s home band, retired from Milne in 1949 and died in 1971.\n\nArmstrong wrote about Mr. Davis in his memoir, \"Satchmo: My Life in New Orleans.\"\n\n\"Every day I practiced faithfully on the lesson Mr. Davis gave me,\" Armstrong wrote. And later: \"All in all, I am proud of the days I spent at the Colored Waif\\'s Home for Boys.\"\n\nRichard Winder, director of the city\\'s Department of Human Services, which controls the site, said that these days, \"We\\'re in limbo.\"\n\n\"We don\\'t know where we are, post-Katrina,\" Mr. Winder said.\n\nStill, as a former superintendent of the home, he could not imagine losing Milne. \"Those worries should be removed down the line,\" he said, \"once we get some normalcy in this city.\" <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnwdrxqq8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.05304,30.01411]}},{"properties":{"name":"New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary","description":"Posted by RufuslOur Mission Statement\n\nThe mission of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary is to equip leaders to fulfill the Great Commission and the Great Commandments through the local church and its ministries.\nOur Seminary Target\n\nOur target as a Seminary is healthy churches.

Originally named \"Baptist Bible Institute,\" New Orleans Seminary was the first theological institution to be created by direct action of the Southern Baptist Convention. It was originally created as an undergraduate institution modeled after Moody Bible Institute. Gradually, the school began to move toward graduate level training, and in 1946 the Convention renamed the institution \"New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.\"\n\nThe school was the fulfillment of a century-old dream of Baptists to establish a missionary training school in New Orleans as a gateway to Latin America, and as a mission center in the ungodly city of New Orleans. In 1914, P. I. Lipsey, editor of the Mississippi Baptist Record, wrote an impassioned editorial favoring the creation of a theological school in New Orleans: \"A seminary (in New Orleans) would plant the Baptist cause in this city in a way that would immediately command the attention and the respect of all. It would be planting the siege guns at the enemies’ gates.”\n\nBaptist Bible Institute opened its first session in October 1918 under the leadership of Byron H. DeMent, who served as president of the BBI from 1917 to 1928. “The Baptist Bible Institute is preeminently a child of providence and prayer,” DeMent said at his inauguration. Since that day, New Orleans Seminary has been known as “The School of Providence and Prayer.”\n\nOthers who have served as president of the school are William W. Hamilton Sr. (1928-42); Duke K. McCall (1943-46); Roland Q. Leavell (1946-58); H. Leo Eddleman (1959-70); Grady C. Cothen (1970-74); and Landrum P. Leavell II, nephew of Roland Leavell, (1974-95). On February 23, 1996, Dr. Charles S. “Chuck” Kelley, Jr., of Beaumont, Texas, was elected unanimously as the seminary’s eighth president. Prior to his election he had served at the seminary for 13 years as the Roland Q. Leavell Professor of Evangelism and most recently as the director of the Seminary’s Leavell Center for Evangelism and Church Health.\n\nFrom its beginning until 1953, the school was located at 1220 Washington Avenue, in the heart of the Garden District of residential New Orleans. The current campus, at 3939 Gentilly Boulevard was purchased in 1947. The landmark entrance gates and fence from the Garden District mansion now are located on the front block of the Gentilly campus. The current property, once a 75-acre pecan orchard, has been transformed into a beautiful campus with 12 additional acres and more than 100 buildings. More than 20,000 men and women have prepared for ministry at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.\nOur Doctrinal Commitments\n\nAll the faculty members of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary subscribe to the school\\'s historic confession, the Articles of Religious Belief, and the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.\nOur Locations\n\nThe main campus in New Orleans is on a 87 beautiful tree-covered site in suburban New Orleans. However, the Seminary also is committed to making quality theological education as accessible and affordable as possible to as many ministers as possible. Therefore, New Orleans Seminary operates many extension center campuses across the Southeast.\nGraduate extension centers are located in:\n\n    * Pineville, Louisiana\n    * Shreveport, Louisiana\n    * Clinton, Mississippi\n    * Birmingham, Alabama\n    * Decatur (Atlanta area), Georgia\n    * Albany, Georgia\n    * Graceville, Florida\n    * Jacksonville, Florida\n    * Orlando, Florida\n    * Pensacola, Florida\n    * Miami, Florida\n\n\nUndergraduate extension centers are located in:\n\n    * Baton Rouge, Louisiana\n    * Lake Charles, Louisiana\n    * Shreveport, Louisiana\n    * Jackson, Mississippi\n    * Birmingham, Alabama\n    * Athens, Alabama\n    * Albany, Georgia\n    * Decatur, Georgia\n    * Jacksonville, Florida\n    * Miami, Florida\n\nNOBTS makes theological education accessible by a number of innovative delivery systems as well. On campus classes are offered in a wide variety of scheduling options throughout the week, as well as night class and weekend options. Many extension center classes are taught by Compressed Interactive Video (CIV) by faculty from the main campus. Internet classes are offered at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Short-term one week courses (academic workshops) are offered throughout the year.\nOur Faculty\n\nThe Seminary faculty consists of approximately 60 full-time faculty members. Their academic excellence is exemplified in the fact that they have earned a total of over 75 master\\'s degrees from 7 different seminaries and 15 universities, and over 55 doctoral degrees from 6 seminaries and 6 universities. Their ongoing research is reflected in the Seminary\\'s research centers and institutes, as well as numerous publications and presentations. The full-time faculty is supplemented by over 100 adjuctive faculty.\n\nThe NOBTS faculty also has unusual experience in ministry. The faculty averages over 15 years each in ministry experience in local churches and mission settings, including a number of pastors, education ministers, and music ministers; nine former international missionaries; two former directors of missions; and a state convention executive director. Others have served in counseling ministries and social work mission centers. Almost all of them are currently involved in some expression of ministry. That\\'s why we call NOBTS \"The Church Place.\"\n\nOur Seminary faculty is committed to doctrinal integrity. Each faculty member subscribes to our doctrinal statements, the Baptist Faith and Message and the Articles of Religious Belief.\nOur Enrollment\n\nTotal student enrollment was over 3,600 students in the 2002-2003 academic year, making NOBTS among the largest seminaries in the world. Approximately 1,900 of these students are located primarily on the New Orleans campus; the others are at extension centers (though part of their work is normally completed on campus). The student body comes from 39 states and 39 different nations of the world. The three home states represented by the most students are Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. For more information about how to enroll in the Seminary, contact the Student Enlistment Office.\nOur Funding and Endowment\n\nAbout half of the approximately 6 million annual Seminary budget is provided by the SBC Cooperative Program. The support of the Cooperative Program is an annual allocation equal to the income of over 00 million of endowment. The Cooperative Program is the financial lifeline of the seminary.\n\nTotal Seminary endowment is about 0 million, including about 0 million in the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary endowment and about 0 million in the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary Foundation endowment.

Greater New Orleans, with more than a fourth of the state’s population, was without a public college or university until that time. As a branch campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LSUNO was conceived as a liberal arts college for commuting students, which might within a few years develop into a true urban university.\n\nAn ideal campus site was acquired when the United States Navy abandoned its air station on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain in late 1957 and the Orleans Levee Board leased it to the LSU Board of Supervisors. A quick renovation of barracks, service clubs, and other existing facilities made it possible to begin classes in September 1958, a year ahead of the original schedule. The inaugural convocation was held in a vacant aircraft hangar. This event marked the opening of the first racially integrated, public university in the South. A total of 1,460 students, all freshmen and double the number originally anticipated, arrived for this occasion.\n\nBy September 1961, when the new school had become a full four-year institution, the enrollment exceeded 3,000, and the faculty had grown from the original 63 to 150 members. A Junior Division had been established for the academic administration of freshmen, and senior academic divisions had been established in liberal arts, in sciences, and in business administration. Dr. Homer L. Hitt, the first employee and the chief administrative officer, had been promoted from Dean of LSUNO to Vice President of LSU in Charge of LSUNO.\n\nTwo new permanent buildings, the Liberal Arts Building and the Sciences Building, and a central utilities plant were completed and in operation by the time of the first commencement in the spring of 1962. The architectural style, established by master planners, was described as a modern adaptation of Louisiana tradition. The first commencement was held in a circus tent temporarily erected on the campus for that purpose. The initial class of graduating seniors numbered 115.\n\nIn the summer of 1962, the senior academic divisions were designated colleges. In 1963, a school of education was established, as well as an evening division and a graduate division. The Vice President in Charge was designated Chancellor, following the establishment of an LSU System of Higher Education. This signaled the end of LSUNO’s status as a branch of the Baton Rouge campus. The school of education became the College of Education in 1964. In 1966, the graduate division became the Graduate School.\n\nTo the original 178-acre site, a 17.5-acre strip along its western boundary was added in 1963. This land was also acquired from the Orleans Levee Board, and it brought the total campus acreage to 195.5. Still more acreage was obtained in 1964, half a mile east on the Lakefront, when the United States Army abandoned its Camp Leroy Johnson facility and the Levee Board made this site, too, available to the University. A 50-acre parcel of this 150-acre site was released to the Gulf South Research Institute in 1965. The remaining 100-acre East Campus subsequently became the location of a Special Education Center, various outdoor sports facilities, and a multipurpose Senator Nat G. Kiefer/UNO Lakefront Arena.\n\nIn September, 1969, when the enrollment exceeded 10,000, LSUNO became the second- largest university in Louisiana. By this time it had developed into a large academic complex embracing several colleges, schools, and institutes, offering graduate work in many different fields and awarding both the master’s and the Ph.D. degree. Moreover, a residence hall for both men and women had been completed. In February, 1974, the LSU Board of Supervisors approved a name change, and LSUNO became the University of New Orleans. The new name more accurately defined the institution as the metropolitan campus of the LSU System.\n\nBy the fall of 1983, UNO had an enrollment exceeding 16,000 and had five senior colleges: Liberal Arts, Sciences, Education, Business Administration, and Engineering, in addition to its Junior Division and Graduate School. It also had a School of Urban and Regional Studies; a School of Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Administration; a School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering; and various centers, institutes and divisions for specialized research. A new Metropolitan College offered courses at off-campus locations in the evening hours, as well as credit and non-credit work in the evening on the campus. It also administered the nation’s largest summer program in Europe, UNO Innsbruck, which had been a continuing success since the early 1970s. In an administrative reorganization in 1988, the Junior Division was replaced by a system that enrolled all incoming students in one of the senior colleges or schools.\n\nCurrently, the UNO main campus contains twenty-three permanent buildings plus a dormitory, a housing complex for married students and a complex of contemporary, apartment-styled, student-housing units.  Land has been set aside for a new dormitory complex and fraternity and sorority houses. The Chemical Sciences Building opened in 1997, a state-of-the-art Recreation and Fitness Center opened in 2001, and the Homer L. Hitt Alumni and Visitors Center (named for our founding Chancellor) opened in 2003.  The Alumni Center is built around a red brick smokestack, one of the few reminders of the naval air base that became the UNO main campus.  Completion of Kirschman Hall, which will house the College of Business Administration, is expected in Spring 2005. A six building, University-sponsored Research and Technology Park is adjacent to the main campus.  The East campus, approximately one mile from the main campus, houses athletic fields, the Alumni and Development Center, and the Senator Nat G. Kiefer UNO Lakefront Arena and is the location for a planned Teleplex Building that will house both of New Orleans’ public television stations, a public radio station, and video broadcast training space for UNO students. UNO owns satellite campuses in downtown New Orleans, in the suburbs of Jefferson Parish, and in Slidell, in neighboring St. Tammany parish. UNO’s Ogden Museum of Southern Art is located in the Arts District near the central business district.  UNO is in the process of revising its Master Plan to include additional, state-of-the art student housing, a new University Center, phase two of the Research and Technology Park, and new landscaping and student-centered outdoor learning spaces.\n\nThe University of New Orleans has grown to become a major urban research university. Categorized as an SREB Four-Year 2 institution, as a Carnegie Doctoral/Research University-Intensive, and as a COC/SACS Level VI institution, its students now enjoy a broad range of academic programs nearly one-quarter of which are at the master’s or doctoral level. In addition, extracurricular activities, including NCAA Division One intercollegiate athletics, an extensive program of intramural sports, and frequent exhibits and programs in music, drama, ballet, and the fine arts round out the student experience. Culturally, socially, economically, and intellectually, the University of New Orleans is one of the major assets of the City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana. The University has conferred over 66,000 degrees since the first graduating class of 118 in 1962. The University of New Orleans has distinguished itself since 1958 and will continue to do so in the future.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a64tnw5ehuf5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.06729,30.02764]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/12616","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rufusl","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rufusl","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/12616","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":27,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=12616,platial:user=rufusl","published":"2010-04-23T16:00:00Z","id":38273}
