We prefer to sell biodiesel that is made from recycled vegetable oil. We currently sell  B99. The price includes sales tax, state excise tax, and federal excise tax.\n\nYou can pump directly into your car from our fuel station-style pump that\\'s California Weights and Measures certified. We also offer fuel in 5 gallon containers called carboys that give you the freedom of fueling whenever and wherever you like. Many of our customers fill up their tanks and then stock up with 10-20 gallons in carboys, so they only come to the Oasis every month or two and minimize their driving to get fuel. The carboys cost  for the container plus the cost of the 5 gallons of fuel.\nBioFuel Oasis was founded in 2003 to provide greater access to biodiesel, a renewable fuel that reduces harmful tailpipe emissions. We are a women/worker-owned &amp; operated cooperative that values sustainability, local production, and community.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xua78skms"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.297356,37.860227]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cardwell Distributing","description":"Posted by SystemBioDiesel Refueling Station, Public - card key at all times. 8137 South State, Midvale UT 84047. 800-561-0051 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xua58jbp1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.89042,40.602819]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cardwell Distributing","description":"Posted by SystemBioDiesel Refueling Station, Public - card key at all times. 1015 W Forest Street, Brigham City UT 84302. 800-561-0051 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67xuac040eh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.035266,41.510435]}},{"properties":{"name":"Carl's Corner Truck Stop on highway I-35 exit 374","description":"Posted by Swangkee<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/b8bb2e3b550c0e005b61350246ed5938.jpg\">IH 35 N exit 374Legendary Carl\\'s Corner.
