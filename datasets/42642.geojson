I was very, very pleasantly surprised at how chill and great it was.  The show was basically Karloz behind a sheet which had live video creations displayed on it.

The music was the kind of thing which takes you on a journey listening to it, and many times throughout the show I would find myself closing my eyes and letting it take me wherever it was going to.

Ended up timing it almost perfectly - the show started about 10 minutes after we arrived.  When we first got in the venue I noticed it was about 20 degrees hotter in there than outside.  Grrrreat!  \n\nMy wife had gotten me tickets to this sold-out show for my birthday.  I was initially excited but, as always, ready for the show to be a complete flop (because so many are.)  I was very pleasantly removed of that concern in short order. \n\nThey played a few tracks from their new album (yes, they actually do have a new album - and it\\'s actually good!), and they played a lot of their old hits.  Chains of love, blue savannah, Drama!, almost every damn thing off of their \"Pop 20 Hits\" album (although not You Surround Me, which is my favorite - ah well).  Despite the fact that they aren\\'t exactly young anymore, they were still great showman and Andy Bell had more energy than most 20-somethings.  The outfits he/they wore and the stage was just straight out of the 80s - it was hilarious.  This show is definitely in my top 10 list of shows.  After a while, I stopped caring that it was about 20000 degrees inside.\n\nSide note: after a very bad experience after a Skinny Puppy concert where I thought that I had permanent hearing damage, I am a real nazi about wearing earplugs at all concerts I attend.  Surprisingly the music was mixed so well and the levels were so perfect, I rarely felt I needed to wear my earplugs - except, for when the songs were over.  The crowd was so goddamn loud and insane (and the average age was around mid-30s, maybe even 40s!  I think we were some of the youngest people there.)  I have been to many-a-Morrissey show, who has a legendary cult following, but this crowd was about 10x more insanely in love with Andy Bell than the crowds I\\'ve seen for Morrissey.

A band which has influenced me more than any other musically, personally, emotionally and a lot more...  Seeing them live and in person was an unexplainable joy.   Although I think the show would have been even better had I caught them in their prime (at least during the Last Rights era), it was still great.

The Cure had no opening bands, and they played for 3 hours straight.  It was as perfect as could possibly be wished for.  Their long version of \"A Forest\" was unbelievably amazing.  It was one of those concerts where I could look around, and everyone in the place was as happy as they could possibly be.  They played a LOT of their old material, as well.  It was truly great.  A not so great story that accompanies this concert is this one:  To get tickets, I sat outside a mall for hours, starting the night before.  There were about 5 people ahead of me.  Because it was so damn hot outside, my friends and I took turns driving around the mall in the air conditioned car so that we wouldn\\'t die.  Anyhow, around the time the doors are about to open this hick pulls up, gives this guy that\\'s been waiting in line some sum of money, and takes his place in line.  Weird, I think.  The doors finally open, we rush to the ticket counter, and this bastard isn\\'t even buying tickets to The Cure, he\\'s buying tickets for some goddamn country concert!  AND, he\\'s clearly a scalper.  He is not just buying one, he is buying like 30, and he wants to hand-pick these seats.  I was closer to murder that day than probably any moment in my entire life.  Seriously.  I was indescribably pissed off.  Each seat that he picked to his crappy ass country concert was taking the time equivalent to a full row of Cure being wasted away.  By the time I got to order my tickets, I still got floor seats, but very far in the back.  Some people I knew who were waiting at another mall to get tickets that were similarly placed in line, but did not have said ticket scalper in front of them, got 2nd or 3rd row seats.  I was so, very, very, very, very, very, very, very angry.
