In curating such a unique aspect of culture, we value a collectivist approach that respects the diversity of experiences that fall under the heading \"queer.\"\n\n \n\nThe primary function of QZAP is to provide a free on-line searchable database of the collection with links allowing users to download electronic copies of zines. By providing access to the historical canon of queer zines we hope to make them more accessible to diverse communities and reach wider audiences.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g0r27hilu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.901546,43.071759]}},{"properties":{"name":"University of Iowa Special Collections and University Archives","description":"Posted by Jwbrett<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Iowa City, IA<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g0r7nqfb8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.53,41.661111]}},{"properties":{"name":"Urbana Champaign Independent Media Library","description":"Posted by Notmebug<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_plain_pink_verD.gif\"> Urbana, IL<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g0raq7reb"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.207222,40.110556]}},{"properties":{"name":"Vancouver Public Library, Central Branch","description":"Posted by Stopbuggingme<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/06/3/zinemap.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> 350 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC  V6B 6B1zines@vpl.ca<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a67g0r1o53v1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.11474,49.280263]}},{"properties":{"name":"West Coast Zine Collection at SDSU","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.qzap.org\" href=\"http://www.qzap.org\">Milo</a>5500 Campanile Drive, San Diego, CAThe West Coast Zine Archive\\'s aim is to provide a protected space for Do-it-Yourself collections while advancing public access to these important works. This archive will protect and preserve tangible evidence of these unique literary creations to come. Zines in this collection will not circulate beyond the library, but Archive is open to all patrons of the library.\n\nThe archive features zines related to gender and gender issues, music, art, and popular and alternative culture. This Archive focuses on publications West of the Mississippi and South of the U.S.-Mexico Border; but zines from other regions are also accepted and added to the Archive. We are requesting donations of single issues as well as large collections. Donations are tax-deductible and donor names will be credited in the Archive\\'s inventory list. Allow someone 100 years from now to read what life was like for YOU and have your publication live on indefinitely. Have extra zines just collecting dust where few people can enjoy?
