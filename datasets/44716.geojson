After a missed field goal by the Gators\\' kicker, the stadium erupted into a riot in a fashion that I have not seen since.  Goal posts were ripped down and thrown in the river while law enforcement had little power to control the victorious mob of Tennessee fans as they had their night of celebration.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a644y4tjcti6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.84765625,35.9602229693]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tennessee Vols vs. Mississippi State Bulldogs (Davis Wade Stadium)","description":"Posted by SivyI went to this game in the fall of 2007.
