We also had a run on parents checking their children out of school.   \n\n   We have been told that we won   t receive confirmation from the Center for Disease Control of whether these students actually have swine flu for three or four days,    Beard said.    The CDC is already backed up with tests from other parts of the state and nation. We are following, and will be referring, to guidelines outlined in both the District   s and the Texas Education Agency   s Pandemic Flu plan as we await confirmation of test results or should any other cases arise.   \n\nSiblings of the four CHS students, several who are enrolled on other district campuses, are being treated with anti-viral medication, according to Dr. James Zoretic, regional director the Texas Department of State Health Services, who notified the district of the conditions of the four high school students, who range in age from 15 to 17.\n\n   Our District will continue to follow instructions and recommendations from the Dr. Zoretic and the state department of health services as to the reopening of campuses and other actions we need to take,    Beard said.

None of the students' cases are considered serious and all are responding well to treatment. The College is, however, taking a series of steps, described below, to contain the virus and to protect our community.\n\nBackground Facts:\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health has tested two of the College's recent flu cases, and both tested as probable for H1N1. Additionally, Dr. Warren Morgan, our Director of Health Services, believes it is possible that four other recent flu cases on campus could be swine flu. As a precaution, we are treating these four additional cases as if they were confirmed as swine flu.\n\nThus far, most swine flu cases in the United States have been relatively mild. A task force made up of representatives from Health Services, Dean of Students, Dean of Faculty, Physical Plant, Public Affairs, Campus Police and other offices has been assembled and will meet regularly to assess facts as they develop.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAfter consulting with state and other health officials, we have decided that the campus will continue to operate regularly, while we continue to closely monitor the situation. We are taking a series of steps to protect the health and safety of students, faculty and staff at Amherst College as well as members of the surrounding community. Here are the steps we've taken so far:\n\nContainment: As a precautionary measure, the six students who have tested positive for Type A influenza, and therefore who may have H1N1, will be isolated for up to seven days after the onset of symptoms.\n\nPrecaution: We are asking that anyone on campus exhibiting any kind of flu symptoms report to a medical practitioner immediately. Students should go to Health Services and faculty and staff should call their primary care physicians. Also, anyone who had close contact with students with influenza should also contact Health Services.\n\nPrecaution: We are asking that students with compromised immune systems, serious heart, lung, kidney or liver diseases, and diabetes contact Health Services for advice regarding precautionary measures. Staff and faculty members with similar issues should initially consult their personal physicians. The number at which to reach Health Services is 413-542-2266. Hours have been extended this evening through 9 p.m. and Health Services will be open tomorrow (Friday) from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. When Health Services is closed on campus, students as usual should call the Campus Dispatcher at 542-2291 to arrange transportation to the U-Mass Health Services.\n\nCurtailment of Certain Activities: Because social interaction, including parties, can increase the risk of exposure to and the spread of viral infections, we are canceling all parties that have been scheduled for this weekend. We also are asking that students with cough and flu symptoms report to Health Services, not attend classes, and stay in their rooms. We also ask that students, especially those with symptoms, limit their visits to public places.","id":"a65rv5wevw94"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.518426,42.369186]}},{"properties":{"description":"Illinois Cases of H1N1 Flu\n(As of May 5, 2009, 10 a.m.
