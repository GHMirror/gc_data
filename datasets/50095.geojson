Born into an Irish working-class family, Margaret witnessed her mother\\'s slow death, worn out after 18 pregnancies and 11 live births. While working as a practical nurse and midwife in the poorest neighborhoods of New York City in the years before World War I, she saw women deprived of their health, sexuality and ability to care for children already born. Contraceptive information was so suppressed by clergy-influenced, physician-accepted laws that it was a criminal offense to send it through the mail.\n\nHer crusade to legalize birth control spurred the movement for women\\'s liberation, though her support of eugenics lead to criticisms of her cause and that of the organization that she founded- Planned Parenthood<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a4eie0hfjd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.053449,42.147874]}},{"properties":{"name":"1880 Marie Stopes born","description":"Posted by Vvkatievv<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/05/1/marie_stopes_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> Edinburgh, scotlandMarie Stopes was a paleobotanist, author, and social activist best known for her efforts in the early half of the 20th century to promote safe birth control for women.

Later in life, her father sent away her little sister Magnhild to give birth in Denmark, so that she could be forced to give up her child. Maghild was told nothing about pregnancy or birth, and for nine months she feared that her stomach would just split. She committed suicide because of the longing for the child she had to leave behind. For this, Elise could never forgive her father, and the fate of her sister became a strong driving force for her commitment to the struggle for women\\'s rights.\nElise Ottesen-Jensen was a Norwegian-Swedish sex educator, journalist and anarchist agitator, whose main mission was to fight for women\\'s rights to understand and control their own body and sexuality. She was a member of the Swedish anarcho-syndicalist union Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden.  Her followers consider her a pioneer in the field of womens\\' rights and feminism.

Her task was arguably more difficult than theirs.\n\nUnlike Stopes, she did not face religious opposition, but the militaristic regime in Japan during the 1920s and 30s was fiercely hostile to limiting the country\\'s growing population, and, in educated circles, the subject was just as unmentionable as it was in England. The notion of a Japanese woman stepping out of her traditionally submissive role to take any social initiative was anathema to her family and friends. \n\nShe was a courageous feminist campaigner for birth control and women\\'s rights in Japan\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a4ein7e0pr"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[130.958688,32.042139]}},{"properties":{"name":"Church","description":"Posted by Vvkatievv<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_worship_verD.gif\"> This is the church that I went to for Easter<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a4eicbiaj0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.0705635548,29.9583831801]}},{"properties":{"name":"Tulane School of Public Health","description":"Posted by Vvkatievv<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_architecture_verD.gif\"> 1440 Canal St., New Orleans, LAThis is Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a4eig9pbno"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.074942,29.956983]}},{"properties":{"name":"World's First Birth Control Clinic 1880","description":"Posted by Vvkatievv<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2009/04/3/Aletta_Jacobs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> amsterdam, netherlands1880, Dr. Aletta Jacobs opened a free clinic for impoverished women, distributing birth control despite opposition<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6a4eiosk7gh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.889999,52.369998]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/645650","metadata":null,"contact_name":"vvkatievv","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:vvkatievv","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/645650","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=645650,platial:user=vvkatievv","published":"2010-04-28T16:00:00Z","id":50095}
