The main reason is that it is the closest one to my house and I am a total sucker for convenience. The gas is usually a couple cents cheaper than the other local places. It\\'s a full service gas station and the people who work here always seem to be in a good mood, which I think is a sign of good management.They also have a car repair garage here, but i have been fortunate not have had an opportunity to try it out. I did buy cigarettes here late one night and was impressed by their display of post cards and holiday greetings from loyal customers. Generally, the place gives off a great vibe.
