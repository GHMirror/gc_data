These revealed a series of Roman buildings aligned along the present Cheapside and New Change, located to the west of St. Paul’s Cathedral. The earliest buildings, dating to the 1st century, were of timber with one particular building floored with a mosaic constructed with various shaped mosaic pieces with a black and white boarder. A number of Roman buildings had sunken into earlier quarry pits and were re-floored many times. Behind the buildings were yards and within one of the yards was a pottery kiln dating to around AD 60-70. The furnace chamber was roofed with re-used roof tiles. Recovered from the floor make up layers were pieces of highly decorated wall plaster. Other finds include a pipe clay statue of Venus and decorated Samian pottery with Gladiatorial scenes and figures of animals.Below one particular building was a 1st century cremation placed within a small pit which also contained a decorated knife handle and a coin. A further possible cremation was found nearby. Truncating the Roman deposits were numerous Saxo-Norman pits, many measuring over 4m in depth. One such pit had foot holes cutting into one side forming access for the pit digger.The medieval period was represented by a number of stone and chalk built buildings forming shops and properties aligned along Cheapside. A large stone-built cellared building and the foundations of a second large building were found immediately to the east of St. Paul’s Cathedral.  A number of chalk-lined cess pits were found associated with these buildings.After the Fire of London in 1666 a number of the medieval buildings were found to have been rebuilt in brick on their original foundations. One Tudor cellar contained fine decorated imported tin-glazed tiles along with tin-glazed pottery. Further brick-built buildings dating to the 17th century were excavated, one of which contained the remains of timber floor joists.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx3mtrdf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0961864,51.5142392]}},{"properties":{"name":"1 Pier Road, North Woolwich, E16","description":"1 Pier Road, North Woolwich, E16 TQ 43246 79904 MoLAS (David Sankey) evaluation August 2007 Allenbuild Ltd on behalf of Genesis Housing Group PIE07Two evaluation trenches were excavated, and these were supplemented with auger sampling of deeper deposits. A deep alluvial sequence was present, consisting of extensive peat and wood peat deposits which were formed in the wooded backswamp of a meandering &amp;quot;inland river&amp;quot; Thames, prior to its flooding in the Late Bronze Age or Iron Age.  The upper surface of the peat varies as a consequence of subsequent erosion by tidal creeks as repeated avulsions of the river banks (the natural levees torn away) and daily tidal flooding created a network of channels. The bank of a palaeochannel, either a creek or even the main river, was observed in one trench. The channels were filled by grey estuarine clays to within 1m of the ground surface.  Above this, a layer of gravel with coal ash and clinker was present, probably representing the track bed of the 19th century railway line which once crossed the site.

With the exception of TP6 (in present-day Clerk’s Place, on the western side of the site), the natural deposits had been truncated by quarry pits of Roman, medieval and 17th-19th century date. In TP1, in the centre of site, natural brickearth was cut by a Roman quarry pit, which was itself cut by pits of similar date.  A series of 16th-17th century dumped layers were truncated by a series of brick walls of late 17th-late 18th century date, while a modern pipe trench truncated all of the archaeological remains within this test pit.Within TP6, natural sand was overlain by medieval dumped deposits. These layers were truncated by the construction cut for a cellar of 14th-17th century date, within which the NE corner of the wall had survived with its surface truncated to 14.75m OD.  This structure may be related to the Parish Clerks Company, who were known to have occupied the site from the later medieval period onwards. The cellar had been filled with redeposited brickearth and construction debris, and overlaid by made ground.  A 17th-19th century robber trench had truncated both these deposits and the wall itself.

The site, just SW of the bridge, contained nine buildings. The oldest, a stone-built Tudor-style school house probably constructed in the 1850s, is listed. The other buildings comprised warehouses and factory buildings. Four were constructed of brick with timber or metal-truss roof frames, in about the 1880s and 1900s, around an 18th century dock formerly running W from the Lea. They housed a glass works and a carbonic gas works. Three buildings were constructed in the 1930s in concrete and brick, and one in the 1960s in reinforced concrete, the last post-dating the infilling of the dock. Latterly the buildings housed furniture and shoe factories. All the buildings, except the school house, were demolished in August 2007.A watching brief was carried out on three stretches of the former dock walls prior to basement reduction. One stretch, aligned NW-SE was constructed from red brick (with traces of whitish rendering) and had stepped foundations facing towards the interior of the dock.  Parts of the wall had been repaired at least once, sometimes using yellow bricks.  At some point during the life of the dock, a series of upright wooden timber posts had been driven through the brickwork on the exterior side of the dock wall, and several horizontal planks were found <em>in situ</em> between them.  Another line of posts had been driven into the alluvial silts SW of the wall, apparently at a right-angle to those inserted into the brickwork, and these may relate to the SW branch of the dock.The insertion of the timber appeared to have weakened the structure of the dock wall and signs of bowing were observed.  Several additional timber posts had been inserted into the interior facing of the brickwork, probably to prevent further leaning.  Some of these were oak and may have been reused ship timbers.  Three more posts had been driven into the silt inside the dock wall, although it is uncertain which phase of work they relate to. Later a timber revetment was added SE of the dock wall but on the same alignment, and this may relate to the blocking of the dock at its SW end at some point between 1913 and 1939.  On the opposite NW dock wall a similar sequence was visible, consisting of red brick construction with some evidence of rendering on the internal face.  No timbers had been added on the exterior side of the wall, but some timber posts and smaller wooden stakes had been inserted through the interior facing. In the NW end of the wall the brickwork had been broken and a narrow timber frame had been added to form an opening, possibly for loading and unloading barges.Finds including pottery of 18th-19th century date were recovered from the silt within the dock itself.  The dock had been infilled in the 1960s and was covered by modern deposits and concrete.  Natural gravels were seen below the base of the former dock.

Cartographic sources show the site as open land until the late 18th century when the first residential dwellings were constructed along the Phipp Street frontage.  The archaeological evidence supports this.  Prior to residential occupation, the land was utilised as a waste dumping area during the late 17th and early-mid 18th centuries, characterised by a series of ground raising or landfill rubbish dumps and pits, which overlay the natural alluvium and gravel.  This supports the cartographic evidence which shows the site as open land until the late-18th century when the first residential dwellings were constructed along the Phipp Street frontage.  Fire debris in the form of ash and coal dust was present in various deposits throughout the sequence, as were slag and building/demolition waste.

FRZ06Two phases of work were begun prior to demolition of the existing buildings following previous evaluation of the site by MoLAS in 2006. Previous site investigations which had taken place on the site without archaeological monitoring had destroyed some of the archaeological evidence. Phase 1 works consisted of the removal of modern material in order to record the extent and nature of survival in disturbed areas. This phase of works was able to identify that much of the site had already been excavated to proposed formation levels for the new buildings. At the north end of the site levelling deposits from the 18th-19th Century were identified as well as some remains of 19th century walls and Victorian foundations adjacent to Harp Alley. Over the rest of the site a sequence of levelling deposits provisionally interpreted as from the late 15th – early 17th century were identified as well as some fragmented remains of  late 17th – 18th Century brick walls. Phase 2 works consisted of the excavation down to formation levels of a number of areas of the site including part of the basement of 2 St Brides Street to the south of the site. This phase of works identified a small number of pits to the east of the site some of which contained cattle horn-cores providing evidence of local industry. These were provisionally interpreted as dating to the 17th Century, Further evidence was found across the site for land reclamation of the Fleet Valley as seen in the previous phase.

In the first, natural alluvial clay deposits were recorded.  A hand-dug sondage excavated within this material recovered occasional fragments of flint, ragstone and peg roofing tile of probable medieval date. A number of undated wooden timbers were also found lying horizontally, of which the two largest were of Elm.  These appear to have lain exposed for some time prior to deposition, with their surfaces showing coarse ‘dry shakes’ and axe marks.  These timbers may have been used as improvised staging on the foreshore at the low tide point.  Three smaller timbers may have been associated with these, or simply have drifted in.  An undated rounded revetment stake tip, made from oak, was also found in the east-facing section at the N end of the trenchA re-cut timber drain ran E-W across the trench.  This was cut into the natural clay and measured 3.20m wide at the top narrowing to 3.00m at the base.  The drain was revetted by two oak boards, held in place with posts and stakes while the N side of the drain was also revetted with a wattle hurdle – probably made of willow – and supported by stakes.  The backfill in the rear of the hurdle inside the construction cut included sherds of pottery dating from 1580-1600AD.  Two large posts had been driven into the natural clay, possibly supporting a walkway across the drain or a structure which straddled it.  The drain appears to have been in use for some time before gradually silting up, and contained fragments of building material, animal bone, shells, copper alloy dress pins, and pottery of 1600-1630AD.  After the silting up, the stakes holding the wattle hurdle collapsed.  A sandy silt layer was dumped over this.  The drain was later re-excavated with a linear cut following the approximate original drain line and revetted with oak boards which had white lead paint on the faces, suggesting a reuse of ship timbers. The N side of the drain had been revetted with reused timbers from a late medieval clinker-built vessel.  The drain seems to have gone out of use again and been backfilled with clayey silt containing horn cores, animal bone, building material, and pottery dated 1600-1630AD.   The top of this deposit had been partly truncated during the construction of a building on the site in 1985.  Modern levelling material overlay the archaeological material.In the second trench, truncation by modern concrete foundations and Victorian cellars had left only a small ‘island’ of archaeological deposits.  Within this, natural sand was overlain by a Roman dumped deposit containing charcoal, flint, brick and tile.  This deposit was truncated by a probable rubbish pit containing a dark silty clay fill including flints and more building material. These deposits were sealed by further Roman dumping, with the upper layer consisting of silty sand with charcoal and small abraded pieces of 1st century AD tile.  These remains suggest river channel reclamation during the early Roman period.

The site was divided into four areas. Area A in the northern part (which included the location of the 2006 work) contained mostly Roman dumped deposits sealing an E-W aligned boundary ditch.  Finds from this area included a worked stone gaming counter and two <em>fibulae</em>.In Area B, in the centre of the site, the earliest activity consisted of Roman quarry pits overlain by re-deposited brickearth, into which were cut a series of postholes. Above this, Roman horizontally stratified deposits had survived up to 0.70m thick and consisted of alternating levelling dumps and brickearth surfaces with postholes and beam slots.  Very few finds were recovered from the sequence. The Roman sequence was sealed by ‘dark earth’ into which were cut several medieval pits that yielded large assemblages of early medieval pottery.   Probable 16th-17th century activity was evidenced by a chalk and brick-lined cellar.In Area C, in the south-east of the site, early Roman levelling deposits that included evidence for destruction by fire were cut by a Late Roman masonry wall of a building aligned WNW/ESE.  This was truncated by Saxon pits and a well.  A timber lined pit was also excavated, containing two pieces of bone with patterns of concentric circles incised along their length.In Area D, in the south west of the site, the earliest deposits recorded consisted of a black waterlogged deposit, which may be a continuation of a cut feature (possibly a channel or quarry pit) found at Blossom’s Inn (GHT00). A geo-archaeological investigation was carried out on the sequence which had been cut down to natural strata.  This recorded natural fine sand at the base of the sequence, suggesting a moderately flowing channel deposit, overlain by silty deposits, which in turn are covered by sand and gravel.  The preliminary interpretation of this sequence is that a feature cut into Pleistocene sands in-filled by natural processes simultaneous with dumping activity and consolidation.Roman occupation deposits were found to survive to a depth of 1 metre and yielded pottery and other finds, including a bone comb, a ceramic oil lamp and a gaming counter.   The Roman layers were cut by a NE-SW aligned linear cut, possibly a roadside ditch, which was itself truncated by an E-W aligned drainage gully with evidence for a timber lining.  On the eastern side of the area, a least two phases of early Roman clay-and-timber buildings were recorded, cut by the Late Roman found masonry wall that extended through from Area C. Post Roman features consisted of a possible sunken building, and ‘dark earth’, cut through by medieval pits. Medieval masonry walls aligned north-south were recorded on the eastern edge and central areas of the trench. A possible 17th century red-brick wall (contiguous with the eastern edge of excavation) abutted a small section of north-south aligned medieval wall.

Natural sand and gravel was cut by a series of shallow quarries in the south of the site.  These were probably early Roman in date and were overlain by clay and timber buildings which were subsequently destroyed by fire, probably during the Boudican uprising of AD60-61.  A compacted gravel road aligned roughly north-south and running the length of the site was constructed above the levelled remains.  A series of clay and timber buildings were constructed on either side of this road, with those in the northern part containing evidence of possible metal working activity.

ODY03An evaluation in 2003 had confirmed the existence of the City ditch necessitating an excavation prior to redevelopment of the site and took place in areas that were designated positions for new piles and pilecaps. Prior to the main work of the excavation, a geo-archaeological borehole survey was carried out across the ditch. The excavation revealed that the City ditch had survived on the southern side of the site, measuring 10.90m wide by 1.80 metres deep, the basal fill of which consisted of black peat that had accumulated during the use of the ditch and contained pottery dated to the 15th century. Other finds consisted of quern fragments, whetstones, glass and leather shoe soles. The upper fill of the ditch was largely sterile and demonstrates its disuse by backfilling. The northern half of the site revealed the mass foundations of Sessions House, part of Newgate Prison/Central Criminal Court and constructed in 1834. The extent of the foundations of demonstrated the widespread truncation/ destruction of the City ditch and any other archaeological deposits. Given the extent, it was decided to plot the alignments of the foundations.The excavation was followed by an evaluation in August 2007. Three evaluation trenches were excavated in the yard area to accurately locate the Roman City Wall, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in order to inform the design for the redevelopment of this part of site. The results confirmed the areas where the City Wall survives and the level of the remains and associated structures and deposits.  This information was used by the project architects and engineers to assist in the design of the rear light well and ventilation duct for the new building and the treatment of the ground generally in the yard area.  Approximately 1m of the superstructure of the City Wall survives beneath the current ground yard surface to a maximum height of 12.98m OD on the south side of the site.  The yard surface was at 13.60m OD.  The eastern face of the wall and the internal earth bank appear to have survived in good condition.  The western face of the wall is at least partly damaged by the construction of the 1834 Sessions House.  In the central area of the yard the ventilation duct associated with the Sessions House has removed all traces of the City Wall.Between October and November 2007, during the watching brief, archaeological remains observed consisted of substantial 19th Century walls. All appeared to be of the same build and dimensions and is likely that they represent further remains of Sessions House. The base of the walls had been constructed directly on natural gravels.

Three trenches were excavated.In the first, natural brickearth was cut by intercutting Roman domestic pits which formed the earliest part of the archaeological sequence.  The pottery was largely from cooking pots, storage containers or tablewares and dated to the first half of the 2nd century.  Above the pitting was a dump containing fragments of wall plaster and tesserae.  These may have been the remains of an early building on the site.The remains of a second building overlay the first. Sealing the demolition material was a section of red mosaic border, which represented the south-western corner of a room in the later building. Large fragments of wall plaster overlay the mosaic; it became clear that these were the fallen remains of one of the walls of the room. The plaster was finely painted and illustrated plant candelabra with yellow and white stalks and six-petalled white flowers on a pale blue ground. In one fragment, a possible goldfinch perches on one of the candelabrum’s side-shoots; in others there are hanging bunches of purple grapes. Another fragment shows the legs of a reddish-brown ox or similar beast. The wall plaster suggests a high-status building at the outskirts of the forum. This phase of activity also dated to the first half of the 2nd century.  After the demise of the Roman building, it would appear that the site was left open until truncated by an episode of medieval pitting, which in turn was sealed by a large, homogenous medieval layer which probably represented open land. Above this was the basement floor slab.The second trench, located in the centre of the site, contained medieval dumping and pits beneath the basement slab.

A total of 15 geotechnical test pits were monitored while a series of 16 boreholes were drilled to record the nature and depth of the Quaternary deposits and hard-rock geology of the site.  In very general terms the data has shown that the area of the site is situated at the interface between high ground to the north related to a terrace of the Thames, and lower-lying ground to the south associated with Holocene alluvial sediments infilling the Thames floodplain. Much of the data shows that this largely flat area comprises modern (19th and 20th century levelling/make-up layers) layers directly overlying Pleistocene river gravels. However, a now predominantly infilled channel exists in the eastern area of the site evidenced by extant geological data which indicates a small valley connecting the high ground to the north with the low ground to the south, having partly incised down through the southern edge of the terrace. This channel may well have provided a focus of activity for prehistoric populations inhabiting this area of the Thames floodplain, and the fine-grained channel fills most likely preserve material which could aid in palaeo-environmental reconstruction of the site which could provide crucial environmental context to cultural activity occurring in this area of the Thames Valley.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqxaffe0i"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.0981669,51.5326942]}},{"properties":{"name":"Abbey Lane Pedestrian Bridge, E15","description":"Abbey Lane Pedestrian Bridge, E15 TQ 3870 8332 MoLAS-PCA (Emma Dwyer, Maria Utrero, Maggie Cox) standing building survey October 2007 Olympic Delivery Authority OL-04507This bridge carried the Northern Outfall Sewer across Abbey Lane, and allowed pedestrian access along the Greenway footpath that runs along the top of the sewer.

Originally built for the North London Railway in 1865, the viaduct ran N to S to a terminus at Broad Street Station. Twelve successive shallow segmentally-arched vaults were separated by substantial piers, all in brick. The E side of the viaduct was later rebuilt with jack arches of brick between rolled steel girders, reinforced with slightly overhanging cast-steel girders on the external face, probably when another railway was constructed in a cutting further to the E, forming the approach to Liverpool Street Station, opened in 1874. Possibly at the same time, the viaduct was widened to the W, in brick, more than doubling the number of tracks carried. To the S, coal drops in four vaults of this extension were connected with a coal depot at ground level, immediately W of the viaduct. An overhead travelling crane in a vault to the N may have been installed <em>c</em> 1916, when the railway was partially electrified; this vault housed an electricity substation, and the crane would have brought in heavy equipment.

Most of the drainage runs were too shallow to expose any archaeological remains. However deeper excavations for the installation of several inspection chamber pits and sumps did allow for some limited excavation.In Sump B, in the northwest of the site and adjacent to the Cheapside frontage, 300mm of redeposited Brickearth, possibly levelling a natural depression, was identified at <em>c</em> 11.20m OD. This layer was cut by a beam slot and a pit, and overlain by fire debris (seen in section). The beam slot measured 0.25m wide and 0.17m deep. Only 1m in length survived, aligned north northeast–south southwest and, probably, perpendicular to the Roman road. Burnt remains in the backfill of the beam slot suggest the disuse of the beam slot and the fire debris are related. The beam slot was probably cut by the pit to the southwest but a later square cut posthole removed the relationship. Both these features appear later than the probable Roman deposits they cut, possibly medieval. In the northeast of the sump, all earlier deposits were removed by a 19th century well, which might have been located in the cellar of a Cheapside frontage property.To the southwest, modern truncation of the former Bow Bells House drainage run had removed any archaeology remains in SW02 to 11.00m OD and CW01 lay within a probable 19th century cellar and was truncated to c 10.50m OD. The depth of the Brickearth in both these inspection-chamber pits was noted as it was up to 2m thick.In central area of the site, the drain run to the west of PW04 a chalk wall foundation, aligned north–south, was observed. The foundation was recorded crossing the 1m width of the drain run and was 0.40m wide. The top of the remains were recorded at 11.90m OD and the base was below the limit of excavation at 11.30m OD. The chalk blocks were roughly squared and there was no bonding material. To the east of the foundation two deposits were observed in section. These were comprised of 0.40m cess-like deposit over 0.30m of fire debris. It was unclear whether the foundation cut the deposits but the remains of a similar foundation in P122 to the north suggest the deposits were the backfill of a cellar.Adjacent to the Bread Street two pits and a probable well were observed. To the west of the trench was a sequence of 0.35m of occupation debris over a 0.10m thick Brickearth floor over 0.20m compacted gravel levelling over natural Brickearth at 11.10m OD. This sequence complements the remains found in P33 and suggests there was a Roman building in this location.Observations in Sump A, also on the Bread Street frontage, revealed the corner of a late medieval rubbish pit. Large quantities of cockles, oyster shell muscles, and animal bone suggest this might have been for the disposal of kitchen waste. The pit cut a 0.20m layer of redeposited Brickearth at 10.65m OD within the base of the former P32, which cover much of the area of Sump A. To the east the trench was cut by a modern drainage channel.Observations in the sprinkler test drain sump, to the north of Sump A revealed the top of a layer of fire debris at its base at <em>c</em> 11.30m OD.The watching brief has now been completed and the results have been integrated with the main site archive.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx83x7c0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0943497,51.5136969]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bow Goods Depot, Wick Lane, Bow E3","description":"Bow Goods Depot, Wick Lane, Bow E3 TQ 37452 83464 MoLAS (Sian Anthony) evaluation June 2007 London Concrete BGJ07Two evaluation trenches and two test pits were excavated.

The purpose of the evaluation trench was to record and sample the section by taking monolith samples through the deposit sequence, and to auger to the top of the floodplain gravels.The results of the field evaluation have helped to refine the initial assessment of the archaeological and geo-archaeological potential of the site. Although no artefacts or structures were found on the site the deposit sequence has good potential for past environment reconstruction.  The site appears to have lain within a palaeochannel in early prehistory, which subsequently became abandoned and began to infill with peat. Peat may have begun to form on the site earlier than on nearby sites, where peat belonging to a wet woodland, known as alder carr, ubiquitous on the prehistoric floodplain of the Thames is dated to the Neolithic and Bronze Age in particular. A long peat sequence was recovered from the site, which probably spans the later Mesolithic to early Iron Age and has good potential for preserving environmental indicators such as pollen and other plant remains.In the light of revised understanding of the archaeological potential of the site the report concludes the impact of the proposed development on the deposits of archaeological interest is likely to be minimal. However, two samples for radiocarbon dating and eight samples for each pollen and diatoms have been submitted to external specialists for assessment. The results will be integrated into a further geoarchaeological report, which will summarise the changing prehistoric and historic environment of the site and place it within the context of the surrounding landscape. The information obtained from this off-site geoarchaeological work, which should refine our understanding of the past environment of the site, is likely to be commensurate with the scale of the impact of piled foundations on the archaeological resource.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx0hs1w0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.1357039,51.5226189]}},{"properties":{"name":"Decker’s Sports Ground, Kingston Road, Tolworth, Surbiton KT4","description":"Decker’s Sports Ground, Kingston Road, Tolworth, Surbiton KT4 TQ 20100 65680 MoLAS (Elaine Eastbury) evaluation August 2007 Football Fever LLP DEK07Seven evaluation trenches were excavated.

The River Lea and the waterways which feed into it were in place during the medieval period. They were used a source of power, from a relatively early point in the medieval period. Except for the Lea itself the Bow Back rivers were artificially created millstreams, which in later years were also exploited for their navigability although little other physical development can be discerned during this time. The 19th century improvements, which took place in the 1850s and 1860s involved the construction of the Lea Navigation and various locks at points around the Bow Back river network.By the 1870s the Rail network had started to take precedence in the area, the Great Eastern Railway (the main London to Stratford line), the North London Line and the Northern Outfall Sewer had been constructed across the area. Their bridges became an essential component to the character of the waterways. These infrastructural features and the waterways divided Stratford into separate areas, which developed differently from one another, each with distinct characters.Thus the area between the High Street and the Bow Back River and the triangle of land between Blaker Road and the Northern Outfall Sewer were already built up, with dense industrial development, while at the same time the areas to the north remained sparsely developed. These appear to decrease in size, presumably due to silting, through the 19th century. During the 1930s following the 1930 Flood Relief Act, various rivers were widened, deepened, and some were infilled or culverted, the 19th century locks were replaced and new locks were added. Post-war work largely saw the waterways abandoned, with further infilling and culverting.The mooring posts, which are situated at regular points around all the waterways, could not be accurately dated through documentary research.  A number of the posts, however, can be assigned to distinct bank construction phases by a combination of map regression and examining the relationship of the dated banks to the post foundations.  There is a possibility, in some cases, that mooring posts from earlier phases of waterway embankment have been incorporated into later work.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx5gb6v0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0190481,51.5438156]}},{"properties":{"name":"EDF Ductshare Cheapside Project, EC4","description":"EDF Ductshare Cheapside Project, EC4 TQ 3170 8126 – 3230 8110 MoLAS (David Sankey) watching brief February – April 2007 EDF Energy DSC06Watching brief on a composite duct trench from the former Seacole House to Cannon Street via Cheapside, Foster Lane, New Change, St Paul’s Churchyard, Ludgate Hill and Old Bailey.

The cellar had been backfilled with a deposit of charcoal, brick, tile and chalk.

The basal fill of the ditch consisted of a slump fill of weathered gravels from the site of the ditch, and a base fragment of <em>Terra Sigillata</em> pottery (2nd-3rd century AD) was recovered from the interface of this deposit and the ditch cut.  This layer was covered by a clayey silt deposit containing inclusions of clasts and flint cobbles which may represent road metalling material washed into the ditch.  This was covered by a clay-silt layer containing charcoal, flint cobbles, abraded Roman brick and tile fragments, and a fragment of Black Burnished Ware Type 1 (1st-5th century AD) and a piece of sewn leather.

Truncated natural brickearth was observed in all of the trenches excavated across the site, due to brickearth extraction and other pitting activity. The earliest activity on site was attested by a small quantity of prehistoric worked flint which was found residually in later deposits. Of particular note was a fine Mesolithic adze which was located within a medieval pit at the western end of the site.Prior to 17th century and later urbanisation, the area was a mixture of agricultural and marsh land. This was known from the documentary evidence.  The earliest archaeological features consisted of pits and wells dating from c.1000-1200AD. This activity was more intense towards the western end of the site approaching Shoreditch High Street. The general lack of domestic assemblages within these features would suggest that they were peripheral to areas of direct settlement and examples towards the end of the medieval period may represent small scale brick-earth quarries.At the eastern and central areas of the site, there was greater evidence for brick-earth quarrying and brick production underlying the 17th-19th century building sequence. The remains of a possible brick-clamp (kiln), essentially a large in-situ area of intense burning and brick waste and debitage, was identified at the northern end of trench 11.  These features were of early-mid 17th century date, although licences for brickearth extraction in this area are known from 1580. Large dumped levelling layers of variable composition, in some instances exceeding a metre in thickness, effectively sealed the earlier agricultural landscape and brick production activities. These deposits would mostly appear to have been deposited in the mid-late 17th century prior to the construction of new buildings.Evidence for urbanisation was identified in all of the trenches excavated across the site (except trenches 12 and 16 which had been heavily truncated by the 1882 Bishopsgate Goods Yard structure and earlier Victorian buildings). As would be expected on such a large site the physical remains varied in terms of chronology, character and the level of preservation exhibited.Whilst post-excavation analysis has not yet begun it would appear that the earliest structures excavated were located at the western end of the site, approaching and on the frontage of Shoreditch High Street. In the case of trench 18 at least 4 properties were present within the excavation while dating from the clay pipes suggests that some of these structures date back to at least to mid-17th century. Where survival was adequate the structures exhibited a succession of brick, stone and wooden surfaces, both internal and external, as well as rebuilds and alterations to their associated walls.The majority of the internal surfaces excavated relate to cellar and sunken floors. Evidence of possible ‘cottage industry’ in one of these properties was attested by a furnace base and other internal features.  Further evidence for industrial activity in the central area of the site was found in trench 14 where one of the two properties located in the trench had a significant quantity of pottery associated with sugar production in a primary refuse deposit overlying a brick floor surface. Cartographic evidence has shown that the structures date from at least the late 18th century. External occupation areas excavated in the trenches across the site produced numerous examples of cess pits, wells, and rubbish pits and in some cases their associated yard surfaces.The site was initially levelled in the late 1830’s for the construction of the Bishopsgate Railway terminus which was completed in the early 1840’s and was associated with the listed Braithwaite Viaduct structure. This station was eventually demolished and superseded by the Bishopsgate Goods Yard in the early 1880s.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx53qdoj"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0757706,51.5338964]}},{"properties":{"name":"East London Line: Pedley Street, E1","description":"East London Line: Pedley Street, E1 TQ 34020 82220 MoLAS (Emma Dwyer, Simon Davis and Sian Anthony) standing building recording, evaluation and excavation January-March, June 2007 Transport for London PEL06Following work in 2006, a standing building survey followed by an evaluation and excavation were carried out. A stretch of John Braithwaite’s railway viaduct from Mile End to Shoreditch (later Bishopsgate) Railway Station, constructed in 1840 for the Eastern Counties Railway, and its later additions, were recorded prior to demolition. The viaduct, constructed of brick with elliptical arches and stone impost bands, was situated north of Pedley Street. It was widened on its northern side in the 1860s, and truncated by the low-level railway line to Liverpool Street Station in 1874. A further brick viaduct in Grimsby Street, north of the Braithwaite viaduct, was constructed in the 1870s to carry the railway line to Bishopsgate (which closed in 1874, reopening as a goods yard in 1881) over the low-level line. A water-softening plant constructed of reinforced concrete, which served steam engines, was added to the Braithwaite viaduct in 1937. The railway viaducts went out of use in the 1960s, following the closure of Bishopsgate Goods Yard, but the arches underneath have long been used for other purposes. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Pedley Street arches were used as the Great Eastern Railway’s Horse Infirmary, and in recent years have served the Shoreditch furniture trade and latterly provided a canvas for the artistic community around Brick Lane.In the evaluation, two trial pits were excavated.  In one, layers of dumped material probably related to ground consolidation prior to the construction of the 19th century viaduct were recorded in the northern part of the pit.  In the southern part, a substantial cut probably relating to the construction of the wall of the retained cutting to Shoreditch Station to the south was observed.

The trenches were excavated to the formation level of the proposed culvert. The earliest recorded deposits comprised Late Pleistocene river terrace gravel associated with the River Lea, overlain by early Holocene fluvial sand and gravel, both sloping gradually to the southeast. The latter deposit was thought to relate to a possible earlier course of the Channelsea or Leyton Rivers, possibly located to the southeast of the western end of the ditch. These deposits were overlain by between 0.60m and 1.1m of alluvium, thought to have accumulated gradually over time due to seasonal flooding. The earliest recorded cutting of Henniker's Ditch was cut through this deposit, dated to the second half of the 18th century. The ditch gradually silted up, but was also perhaps responsible for the formation of a relict pastoral topsoil recorded overlying the alluvium and the edges of the ditch. The ditch was re-cut in the second half of the 19th century; two possible tributary ditches adjoining the northern edge of the ditch were also recorded relating to this phase. A third re-cut was associated with the deposition of substantial amounts of made ground across the site during the 1950s-70s to create the existing Lea Valley Cycleway.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqwwu5d7v"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0154933,51.5499425]}},{"properties":{"name":"Henniker’s and Potter’s Ditches and the Channelsea River, Stratford, E15","description":"Henniker’s and Potter’s Ditches and the Channelsea River, Stratford, E15 TQ 3802 8540, TQ 3772 8490 MoLAS-PCA (Helen Robertson) standing building survey May 2007 Olympic Delivery Authority OL-02007The Channelsea River is an ancient waterway, known to have existed by at least the 8th century AD.

Trench 1 was located in the open area between the two buildings and ran approximately NE-SW while Trench 2 was located in the basement of Bishops House.The results of the excavations have supplemented previous investigations, to determine the location and surviving extent of the City wall and Ditch. Both trenches ran north-south across the site. Trench 1 was 33.5m in length and 3-4m wide and trench 2 was 17.4m in length and 3.25m wide. Trench 1 was divided in two by the 19th century Irongate Sewer.  Modern truncation had removed all deposits to brickearth at the northern ends of both trenches. To the south in both trenches the fill of the City ditch was observed for 17-20m. The north end of both trenches revealed dense quarry pitting. These pits are provisionally dated to the Roman period.The cut of the City Ditch was discovered in both trenches to a depth of 8.82 – 8.54m OD and successive layers of deposits were excavated. Roman, medieval and probable 16th century pottery was found within these ditch fills but comparatively little, suggesting frequent clearing of the ditch and episodes of re-cutting. Some fragments of leather including a complete child’s shoe and animal bone were also found.At the south end of Trench 1 where the City Wall might have existed only clean brickearth was observed, suggesting that the course of the wall lies beneath Camomile Street to the south of the site, or has been removed. To the south of Trench 2 a section of the Irongate Sewer had been exposed and a section of Tudor wall was observed.During the evaluation, eight shallow trial pits were monitored to evaluate the archaeological impact of works associated with the re-routing of the so-called Irongate sewer which runs beneath the centre of the site.  Most of the pits contained only modern services and made ground beneath concrete, tarmac and paving.

A substantial medieval ditch, or possibly an early tributary of the Walbrook was also uncovered, though full analysis of the finds and data from the site is as yet to be concluded.Excavations in Trench 3 uncovered the remains of a 17th-18th century building, accompanied by cesspits and cobbled yard surfaces. It is conceivable that they may have been part of the Earl of Rutland’s manorial complex, known to have been constructed on the site after the dissolution of Holywell Priory in October 1539.Significantly, remains of Holywell Priory itself were uncovered in Trench 4. The destruction of the dissolution of the Priory was evident in layers of debris and robbed out tiled floors, as well as several robbed out column pier bases situated in the north of the trench. In the south of the trench, on an east-west alignment, two in-situ columns were uncovered. Dated to c. AD1200 – 1230, it is probable they formed part of the nave.

Subsequent additions to N and W eventually encompassed the entire block, absorbing an intermediate side-street. The oldest existing building, of 1887, was in the NE, for the medical school, of yellow brick, on 3 storeys. A chapel in the centre of the site, begun 1891, was ranged S(N, with a red brick exterior and a marble and mosaic-clad Italian Gothic-style vaulted interior (architect, J L Pearson). Two 4 and 5-storey ward blocks were built to its W, in 1897 and 1910, in yellow and white-glazed brick. A 4-storey range was built on the N, in 1914, of yellow brick with a plain front on to Riding House Street, for pathology labs and the medical school. On the E, a 5-storey wing for paying patients was built in 1918, also facing the site rather than on to Cleveland Street. After the 18th-c hospital was demolished in 1929, the chapel E windows were completed (architect, F L Pearson) and a 7-storey main building erected, completed 1935, on the same H-plan as the 18th-c hospital but much larger in scale (architect, A W Hall). Steel-framed, in red brick with Portland stone dressings, in severe neo-Classical style, this contained original top-floor operating theatres with green marble dado and built-in glazed stainless-steel cupboards, a children’s ward with tiled murals and a balcony facing W, staircases to W and E surrounding a low-headroom goods lift, walls faced with green and cream glazed tiles, internal wired-glass windows with copper glazing bars, and large teak-framed sash and pivoting external windows; lower-floor internal balconies facing S had since been closed up. A 7-storey staff residential block, along the S of the site, a 4-storey radiotherapy wing, on the W side, and a 4-storey medical school block including a library, in the N centre, were subsequently added in a similar style. On the NW earlier buildings were demolished and replaced by a cancer research block in 1968, raised to 8 storeys in 1974, and a 4-storey psychiatry block added to the N in 1979. Basements and sub-basements extended over most of the site. A 4-storey building on the SW, at 10 Mortimer Street, constructed in 1898 in red brick with Portland stone dressings, large metal-framed windows and fine wrought-iron railings (architect, W M Walker), as offices for Bratt-Colbran and Co, iron-founders, was incorporated in the hospital. All the buildings were demolished from December 2007 except the chapel and 10 Mortimer Street (both listed).A watching brief was also carried out on a series of test pits within the basement of the building.

This revealed a deposit sequence which measured up to 9m in thickness and is likely to date from the Mesolithic to Historic period. The basal deposit consisted of Late Pleistocene floodplain gravels which were found to occur at between -9.5 and -7.5 m OD. However, a prominent gravel high was located in the north eastern corner of the site where the gravel surface occurred at -6.5m OD.  As yet no dating or environmental assessment has been undertaken on the core samples collected from the site. However, the sequence has preliminarily been interpreted on the basis of the known stratigraphy from this part of the lower Thames and dates recently obtained from other sites in Erith.  Above the gravels, sands of an Early Holocene date were deposited as possible channel bars in a braided river environment. The lower lying part of the site saw the development of a thin humified peat unit which probably dates to the Mesolithic period and equates to the Tilbury II marine regression. Following a rise in RSL the site was inundated by alluvial clays and silts which probably equate to the Thames II marine transgression. Following a drop in RSL a thick peat unit probably began to develop across the site encroaching from the north. This peat unit represents a wooded flood plain floor and probably equates with the Tilbury III and IV marine regressions. The upper part of the sequence consisted of alluvial clays deposited by overbank flooding, giving rise to a mud flat environment, followed by the development of a seasonally flooded grass meadow. These upper units are probably of an Iron Age to historic date.  The core samples obtained from the boreholes have good potential for environmental examination and dating and could contribute to our understanding of the evolving landscape of the Erith area. It is hoped that dating and environmental analysis of the core samples will be undertaken as a further phase of work. <a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqwwbu1lx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.1665233,51.4943464]}},{"properties":{"name":"Planning Delivery Zone 10 Olympic, Paralympic and Legacy Transformations Planning Applications: E15","description":"Planning Delivery Zone 10 Olympic, Paralympic and Legacy Transformations Planning Applications: E15 TQ 38050 85310 MoLAS-PCA (Sarah Barrowman) evaluation December 2007 Olympic Delivery Authority OL-08107Natural river terrace gravels were seen in the trench base from 2.70m to 2.98m OD, cut by an undated east–west ditch at the north end of the trench.

These may represent dry land surfaces deposited within the Late Iron Age/Early Roman period, possibly being part of the Horsleydown eyot.  Within the eastern part of the trench, this deposit produced several worked flints, some burnt flint, and sherds of heavily abraded Roman pottery.   A channel, probably the result of natural water activity, was recorded cutting the surface of these sands and running towards the south of the trench where organic deposits within the overlying alluvium may suggest a slight drop to the south and east, resulting in a ‘puddling’ effect.The alluvial deposits, representing inundations from the Roman period onwards, were cut by a large timber-lined drainage channel consisting of several phases of construction between the late 16th - early 17th centuries.   The structure ran E-W along the N side of Tooley Street, then turned 90° towards the river Thames in the E half of the trench, and continued to the N and W beyond the limit of excavation.  The channel increased in depth to the S, suggesting that it may have been used to supply water, possibly for an industrial purpose, beyond the SE extent of the site.

Eventually, the channel was used as a rubbish dump, and the waterlogged conditions preserved items including a wooden shovel, a rare surviving fence panel, leather shoes and fragments of leather clothing.

The grid reference to the approximate centre of Building 1 was TQ 38340 84425.The Great Eastern Railway constructed a powerhouse (or electricity generating station) S of the Channelsea River, W of Stratford station, c.1906. A large steel-framed shed, partly brick-walled, partly clad in corrugated steel, originally a turbine room, contained an overhead travelling crane on steel lattice-girder supports, running over deep concrete-lined pits which originally contained condensers underneath turbines. Initially housing three turbines in line end-to-end, the shed was soon extended to the W for a fourth. Single-storey brick buildings to the E were possibly for rectifiers, converters, batteries and transformers. A railway track originally entered the shed from the W, to deliver and remove equipment, and a switchgear gallery was attached internally to the N side-wall. All equipment was later removed and the pits filled in. A boiler house, documented as originally adjacent to the S, included an economiser house and chimney to the E, and coal bunkers, supplied by rail, further to the S. Subsequently eight air-raid shelters were constructed N and S of the Channelsea, probably in 1939–40 for railway workers. These were semi-sunken Anderson shelters, with walls and roofs of concrete poured in situ on curved corrugated steel, under mounded earth; the position of the two largest shelters on the site of the powerhouse cooling towers, between the turbine room and the river, indicated that the powerhouse was decommissioned by then. The boiler house and economiser house were demolished c.1951, leaving the turbine room, which later housed a substation and transformer. By 1951 a pump house was built N of the Channelsea, over a deep concrete-lined tank where oil could be skimmed from water, presumably waste water from Stratford railway works to the N, the cleaned water being pumped into the river.

Modern concrete and makeup deposits overlay a pit containing an undated but probable post-Roman organic fill.  Of the three boreholes, one revealed truncated natural sand and gravel beneath modern brick rubble and concrete, the second contained only natural deposits, and the third exposed an undated silt and gravel dumped deposit over natural sand and gravel.The following excavation revealed quarry pits, at the bottom of the Roman sequence indicating that the site was an open area in the early Roman period. There is evidence for a possible water course running roughly east west from the Roman amphitheatre (present day Guildhall Yard) which may be the elusive Walbrook tributary discovered during excavations at the Guildhall.Early Roman ground survives at about 10.2m OD but probably represents only the earliest phases of Roman occupation with later phases truncated by basement construction of Bartletts House. The lack of later Roman features cut into the sequence suggest the area remains either open or built upon for a substantial part of the Roman period but this is tentative analysis given the small area excavated.A large Saxo-Norman domestic refuse pit dating to circa 10th-11th centuries was found. This feature was well constructed with a wooden lining and appears discrete in the sequence with no near contemporary truncation suggesting a modest density of occupation activity. The top of the pit was backfilled with recently demolished roman concrete and masonry mixed with bricks as a slumping remedy for the construction of the 1920’s basement slab.

A watching brief was carried out on secant piling around the site perimeter, and two auger holes were drilled to establish the nature of the deposits down to natural levels.These showed that the earliest deposits were Shepperton Gravels deposited during glacial outwash c.15-10,000 years BP. Gravelly sand at the base of the sequence may represent reworked terrace gravels accumulating at the base of a later channel feature. Sands above this are almost certainly derived from a freshwater river and are probably comparable to those found elsewhere in Westminster possibly accreting from the mid Neolithic. A temporarily land surface within the top of the sand deposit may indicate a local event such as channel abandonment/migration or wider-scale stabilization or fall in river levels. Terrestrial surfaces and Bronze Age revetments are recorded at approximately the same height at sites in the vicinity.Fluvial conditions appear to cease and are replaced by slow-moving environments such as mudflats or reed beds that remained waterlogged. These sediments are likely to represent estuarine depositional environments as the tidal head of the Thames reached the city and the lower reaches of the Tyburn by the Early/Middle Bronze Age.  Above these natural deposits were dumps of probable 16th century date which were cut by pits suggesting that the area was open land at the time.Above the backfilled pits were the remains of a possible building of late 17th-century date consisting of a pitched tile hearth and mortar floor, although no walls were found, possibly removed by later activity.  The building was later abandoned and more pits cut through it, before a new three-roomed building with mortar and beaten earth floors was constructed on the site, probably during the 18th century.  A possible partial covered area to the east with the remains of two fireplaces or hearths was also found.This building was partially demolished and the area to the north levelled for the construction of a brick surface that appears contemporary with a brick-lined well. The southern wall of the previous building may have still been standing at this stage acting a boundary to the yard. The upper levels of the well were partially robbed before it was backfilled and the area levelled. A cobble and flagstone surface was then laid down again probably respecting the boundary wall to the south. At some stage the area appears to have become open land again with deposits being laid down. A vaulted brick culvert was dug into these deposits. This culvert had a possible down pipe that was later robbed out and the shaft containing it enlarged to gain access to the culvert so that a ceramic drainage pipe could be laid within it.

Built for the East India Company in 1769–71 as ‘Bengal Warehouse’, the building was ranged from E to W, on five storeys and a basement, with two wings projecting N to the street (formerly Hand Alley). The walls were of Portland stone to 1st-floor level and brick above, with timber floors supported on timber posts. Internal stairs were complemented by external hoists, to the N. Later in the 18th c more warehouses were built adjoining to the E, at Cutler Street, and the building was known as ‘Old Bengal House’. The warehouse was subdivided just E of the W wing, documented in 1839, when the St Katharine’s Dock Company bought the E part; another floor was added to the W wing, round-section cast-iron columns replacing the timber posts on every floor. Later, <em>c</em> 1854, another floor was added to the E, reusing existing roof timbers, with a timber-framed wall to the rear, a new internal brick wall, and some timber posts being replaced by cruciform-section cast-iron columns. In the 20th c, owned by the Port of London Authority, the building was used as an oriental carpets depot and, later, a tea and coffee warehouse.

In three trenches, natural sand and sandy gravels were overlain by modern gravel, hardcore and concrete.  In the fourth, natural sand had been cut by three undated pits, which were overlain by a sandy clay deposit, which was cut at the S end of the trench by a large E-W aligned linear feature which was been interpreted as the City Ditch.  The medieval fills of the ditch were partially truncated by 16th-18th century activity and modern foundations.A single evaluation test pit with an auger sample was excavated in the SE corner of the site, revealing disturbed brickearth, possibly from Roman quarrying at the base of the sequence.  This was overlain by two organic clay layers which may represent the post-Roman (possibly Medieval) ground levels where freshwater ‘ponding’ or marshy conditions developed. These layers were sealed by 16th-18th and 20th century dumping, beneath modern tarmac and concrete.A section of the Roman and medieval City ditch was then excavated. A large Roman drainage ditch cut the natural brickearth in the south-east corner of the site. This was possibly associated with an area of metalling to the north and was sealed by a layer of re-deposited brickearth, through which the Roman City ditch was cut. The fills of this suggest that the Roman ditch had silted-up over a considerable period of time.The Roman ditch appears to have been cut by the later medieval ditch and by medieval cess pits and wattle-lined wells. The fills of the medieval ditch suggest two prolonged periods of natural silting, the second of which was of sufficient duration for trees to grow and a wattle hurdle to be constructed on the northern edge of the ditch. This sequence was then apparently truncated by a final phase of clearance and deliberate backfilling, dated on other nearby sites to around the 16th century.North of the medieval ditch several large intercutting cesspits were excavated, probably related to properties fronting onto the current Little Britain. These and the upper fills of the medieval ditch were sealed beneath rubble and mortar dump layers, which were truncated by the construction cuts for two walls of late 16th-17th century date.

The highest level of truncated natural brickearth was recorded at 11.3m OD.Roman activity on the site was only observed within the Curates House and consisted of relatively shallow brickearth quarrying and general pitting, which are mostly dated to the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. A disturbed burial was found redeposited in a medieval pit. It had probably been laid on a bed of chalk and the body was aged 6-12 years. The site is located to the south and east of the 13th century church of St Mary Spital and to the north of a road that lead from Bishopsgate to the cemetery that lay to the east.From the late 12th through to the 13th century the site had been in open land. Previous work on the site, however, had identified that by the 14th century two tenements fronted onto the north side of the road. Current work located the northern extent of these buildings within the hall and which extended east where they were recorded beneath the Curates House. Within the lift pit, further south and east, a substantial building was constructed projecting into, and thus restricting access to, the cemetery road during the 14th century. This had a vaulted undercroft accessed by a set of steps to the east with a light-well projected down to a single-light greensand window with iron window-bars set in the east wall.

There may have been further Roman remains in the central part of Area 7, but these would have been destroyed by extensive Saxon pitting.Three phases of possible Roman activity were recorded at the western end of Area 7. The earliest was represented by a supine, E-W aligned burial cut into the natural brickearth. Only the lower arms and upper legs had survived, in poor condition.The backfill of the burial was sealed by a brickearth surface showing signs of weathering and evidence for roots, suggesting that the area had been abandoned or left open to the elements.  This was truncated by a group of stakeholes and postholes thought to be associated with a later mud brick oven which represented the latest phase of possible Roman activity at the western end of Area 7.  Several deposits of debris from this feature were recorded and are still being assessed.To the west, a separate room or property contemporary with the oven was represented by mortar scars, a beamslot and postholes. The remains of another room/building were present even further to the west and included a probable beamslot and fragment of floor.The oven had been truncated by the remains of an E-W beamslot, from which pottery of 6th century date was recovered. To the west, and apparently contemporary, was another early two-room Saxon building represented by a N-S aligned beam slot and a possible E-W brickearth sill (which would have supported a wall) between two fragments of brickearth floor.Sealing the rooms was a later building which had an internal brickearth floor to the west and an external metalled area to the east with evidence of domestic rubbish and organic dumps.The latest phase of Saxon building consisted of a brickearth floor, which sealed a pit and a number of dumps, associated with the demise of the previous building. These features had been heavily truncated by two ditches, which represent a late phase of possible Saxon activity at the western end of Area 7. The ditches were parallel, orientated NE-SW. Very little dating evidence was recovered from these features, however (one Saxon pottery sherd in total), and it is possible that this phase instead relates to the medieval period and that the sherd was residual. The ditches were certainly sealed by a medieval layer representing a period of open land.The central section of Area 7 produced a series of large pits containing Roman, Saxon and medieval pottery. These appeared to be rubbish pits and related to an external/open area of land between the eastern and western areas of construction.At the eastern end of Area 7 was a large circular cut, probably a Saxon well, servicing the buildings on either side of it. The western building comprised the remnants of a brickearth floor and a number of stake and postholes. To the east were two possible beamslots, forming a NW-SE angle, with the remains of a brickearth floor between them. Also associated with this building were a number of stake and postholes.The remains of a ragstone and tile wall or post pad were recorded to the west of the well; this was largely robbed out before the well was installed, however. The remains of a second possible wall, made from ragstone and chalk, and possibly aligned N-S, survived to the west of the central ‘open area’ in the middle. This had been laid over the backfill of a Saxon ditch, suggesting that the Saxons had reused Roman building material to construct their wall as masonry is not normally associated with Saxon construction in Lundenwic.The Saxon deposits had been sealed by a homogenous layer of probable 16th-17th century date which showed signs of horticultural activity.  Above this, a similar layer of probable 18th century date had been truncated by a number of construction cuts, probably for scaffolding associated with the erection of the National Schools building. In addition, the sequence of Saxon buildings at the western end of area 7 had been cut by 18th-19th century walls and culvert drains.The watching brief in Area 8 revealed a number of Saxon rubbish pits cut into the natural brickearth, one of which had been truncated by a segment of 18th-century wall that was sealed by the existing concrete basement floor.Refined dating from the burials excavated in Area 4 (in 2006), suggests a group of late Roman inhumations in the vicinity of the sarcophagus. As well as the discovery of the early Roman structure in Area 7, therefore, evidence now points to the possibility of a late Roman sacred site or small settlement on the site, which the Saxons appeared to respect and continue as a religious place.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqwx6qat1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1264125,51.5085478]}},{"properties":{"name":"St Mary at Hill Church, St Mary at Hill, EC3","description":"St Mary at Hill Church, St Mary at Hill, EC3 TQ 33075 80760 MoLAS (Jez Taylor) watching brief June-July 2007 Barry Stow Architect Ltd on behalf of the Parochial Church Council MYI07The investigation was carried out in the south-west corner of the church interior and involved excavation of a drop-shaft and tunnel to link-up with a pre-existing sewer beneath Lovat Lane. Removal of a section of the concrete slab that forms the church floor exposed an entranceway through the roof of a brick-lined burial vault; one of two built on the same vertical alignment. The location of the vault walls enabled excavation of the shaft within the vaults' interior. Provisional dating of the vaults suggests they were contemporary, most likely dating to 1787-88 when the tower was rebuilt in brick, or alternatively in 1826-27 when the church was extensively altered. During 1892-94, the church was closed and some 3,000 bodies were exhumed from vaults and other graves within the church. Inclusions in the soil backfill removed from the vaults indicated late Victorian deposition. The presence of the two burial vaults obscured and truncated any earlier archaeological sequence that may survive in and around the area of investigation.

Remains of 18th-19th century structures associated with the development of the area as ‘Devonshire Place’ were also recorded, including garden walls, two wells or soakaways, and part of a courtyard which pre-dated the 1950s extension to 23 Devonshire Place.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx82jf2n"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1507703,51.5226933]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Odeon, Leicester Square, London W1","description":"The Odeon, Leicester Square, London W1 TQ 2983 8062 MoLAS (Jodi Davidson) geo-archaeological evaluation November 2006 Mace Ltd, OEN07.The site work consisted of three boreholes situated in Whitcombe Street and St Martins Street, and two test pits located in the basement of the bookmakers next to the Odeon, Leicester Square. These revealed a deposit sequence which measured up to 6m in thickness. However, the area appears to have been heavily truncated by erosion of the valley side or by the construction of the existing buildings down to the level of the Pleistocene sands and gravels (11.9 to 13.20m OD). The nature of the made ground suggests that it is modern brick rubble and that any possible Saxon/Medieval material has been truncated or mixed during the construction of the existing buildings. The site is situated on the northern edge of the Taplow Gravels and just below the junction with the Hackney Gravels. As a result due to its location on the interface of two gravel terraces it was thought that fine grained deposits relating to the interglacial or interstadial episodes of the Pleistocene could have been present. However the sequences observed in the boreholes and testpits did not show any of these fine grained sediments and overall there is very low potential for Late Upper Palaeolithic/ Early Mesolithic preservation.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx92kvm7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.130574,51.509602]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Paddock, adjacent to All Saints Church, Fulham High Street, SW6","description":"The Paddock, adjacent to All Saints Church, Fulham High Street, SW6 TQ 24368 76051 MoLAS (Anthony Mackinder) evaluation April 2007 Barton Finch PDK07Following the recommendations of the Inspector of Ancient Monuments one archaeological evaluation trench was excavated on the site primarily to establish the course of the moat surrounding Fulham Palace Scheduled Ancient Monument.

The site is located in the eastern part of the hospital complex, bounded by Cavell Street to the east, Newark Street to the South, and by hospital buildings including the Childrens Unit to the west and the East Wing and Holland Wing to the north. The site was divided into nine areas labelled A–J.In the north of Area A, in the area formerly known as Bedstead Square, natural brickearth was cut by an E-W aligned ditch which contained pottery dated to the late 11th–early 12th-century. This was sealed by marsh deposits which extended across the site into Areas E, F, and G to the east and Areas B and C to the west.  Several undated linear features, cut into the marsh deposits may represent attempts at drainage.  A short NE-SW aligned trackway formed by sinking brick rubble into the marsh was also recorded.  Patches of fire debris and rubbish overlay marshy deposits in the S half of the area, to the south of Bedstead Square, while a substantial lime capping covered them in the N. These were sealed by dumping to reclaim the land, possibly associated with the expansion of the hospital in the first half of the 19th-century.  In the northern half of the area, an early–mid 19th-century cemetery associated with the Hospital cut through these deposits. This consisted of 265 burials (including 177 articulated skeletons, with 66 showing evidence of autopsies) plus 89 ‘coffin loads’ of dissected remains. The southern boundary of the cemetery was defined by an E-W brick wall and no further burials were found beyond this. Outside the boundary, a substantial dump consisting mostly of pottery sherds and wasters from sugar refining vessels such as sugar moulds was recorded.  Such material was often sold as hardcore (N. Jeffreys <em>pers comm.)</em> and this may have been the case here.  The dumps were sealed by a lime layer probably deposited to mask smells from the marsh below, and these were covered by dumped deposits including some containing disarticulated human bone.In Area B, natural brickearth overlain by marshy deposits was observed, as in Area A.  Dumped deposits similar to those in Area A were recorded. During the watching brief a large cut feature (possibly a tanning vat) containing large numbers of cattle horn cores, was recorded cutting into the marshy deposits. Three N-S aligned linear features were observed cutting the brickearth and sealed by the marsh. These were undated but are likely to have an agricultural function. The southern half of the area contained several rows of early–mid 19th-century burials and 28 grave cuts were recorded by MoLAS, with each containing 2-6 individual skeletons, plus various disarticulated human and animal bone.  Five graves were partly beyond the edge of the excavation and may be excavated during future work. This area lies within the former Garden Field, appearing on plans of the hospital as a burial ground from <em>c </em>1830–1853.In the N end of Area C (within the basement of the East Wing) a few trenches targeting piling locations were monitored, revealing natural brickearth below the basement slab, while several probable tree- boles were recorded.  Monitoring in Area D (the basement of the Old Home and Alexandra House) revealed marshy deposits overlying natural brickearth beneath the basement slab.  No archaeological features were observed. Ground reduction in Areas E, F, G, and J was monitored, exposing dumps similar to those in Area A, although no human remains were present.  Several wood-lined pits were observed in Area G, possibly representing soak-aways draining the marshland.

In the W basement of Walbrook House, a well-preserved C1st-2nd Roman sequence with few later intrusions was present. Natural gravels were cut by a series of irregular cuts/drainage channels, with those to the N containing alluvial-type silting at their bases, possibly derived from periodic flooding along the E bank of the Walbrook. A shallow, poorly constructed plank-lined Roman well or sump was recorded at the N end of the trench, containing pottery including a flagon, a bowl and a large cooking pot of late 1st century AD date.The area over the well and surrounding water-saturated ground had been raised and stabilised by a series of dumped deposits interlaced with horizontal timbers and timber piles.  At least two relatively insubstantial N-S aligned timber revetments had been constructed to retain the W edge of the building platform while an E-W aligned box-lined drain had been inserted into the dumped deposits.The earliest of a series of Roman clay-and-timber buildings had been constructed over the dumped deposits during the late 1st century AD.  The internal walls employed a range of construction styles. Part of the westernmost NE-SW aligned wall was formed by jointing regularly spaced posts into a timber base-plate and infilling the gaps with courses of mud-brick or fragmented roof-tile.  Many of the walls were plastered and painted using simple geometric designs. The parallel internal wall to the east had been robbed or modified within the life of the building leaving traces of a timber base-plate at the bottom of a beam slot.  During the dismantling of the W wall, a small pot was found – possibly a ‘foundation deposit’ – containing a bone die, an intaglio, a worked bone fragment, a marble, a fragment of resin (possibly amber) and a corroded iron object.The internal surfaces of the building were mostly composed of brickearth or gravel with an <em>opus signinum</em> floor in the N room. The uppermost floor surfaces were sealed beneath layers of destruction debris, probably from the Hadrianic fire of AD 120-130. The only later Roman structure in the trench was a NE-SW aligned un-mortared ragstone and tile-rubble foundation first seen in 2006.  The base of its construction cut was shallower and stepped at its north end, where the remains of a heavily truncated westward return wall were discerned. These integral walls represent the NE corner of a building constructed after the Hadrianic fire.The eastward continuation of the late C1st-2nd buildings was subsequently excavated across the footprint of the Walbrook House and Granite House basements. It was hoped that the S side of these areas would produce evidence of the pre-Boudican E-W road which constituted one of the major early roads across the settlement.No conclusive evidence survived of the road itself, although the area around its projected position had been deliberately levelled with massive dumps of sterile brickearth, which predominantly overlay naturally accumulated colluvium washed down the hill slope towards the Walbrook. It is likely that the levelling deposits formed the platform for the first road and also created a raised approach to the bridging point over the Walbrook channel, located c.55m to the W beneath Bucklersbury House.The area at the W end of the Oxford Court roadway was excavated in conjunction with the S side of the first area as it physically connected with the Roman levels.  Natural gravel was cut by the southward continuation of the large V-cut ditch recorded in 2006.  This probably formed the W side of the defences around a large fortified enclosure established soon after the Roman Conquest and could represent the W limit of the early Roman city.A series of early Roman pits – probably for gravel extraction – were sealed by 1st-2nd century clay, timber and masonry buildings which flanked the E side of the N-S road recorded in 2006.  A substantial medieval deposit, probably a re-worked garden or agricultural soil, sealed these layers.  This deposit was cut by a pit whose sides and base had been rendered waterproof with clay for some unknown purpose. Several truncated medieval walls and footings were recorded, of which the earliest were two pier bases including one which retained two courses of its greensand ashlar superstructure.  A narrow N-S aligned ragstone wall had later been built against the N face of this.  The latest of these footings was the E wall of a heavily truncated chalk-lined cesspit which had been built against the W pier foundation.Two external metalled gravel surfaces, separated by a number of levelling deposits, were recorded.  The uppermost clearly represents part of the narrow E-W aligned road known to have existed before the Great Fire of 1666 and was the precursor of Oxford Court.  The surface was sealed by a thin layer of charcoal which had been subject to in-situ burning and probably represented fire debris from buildings along the edges of the street destroyed during the Great Fire.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqwygsd92"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0903331,51.5118689]}},{"properties":{"name":"The Warrington Hotel, 93 Warrington Crescent, W9","description":"The Warrington Hotel, 93 Warrington Crescent, W9 TQ 26135 82485 MoLAS (Andrew Westman) standing building survey April-May 2007 Gordon Ramsey Holdings Ltd WZH07This building, a public house documented by 1859, of brick with a slated roof, on three storeys with a cellar, was probably one of the first in the newly laid-out street.

In another trench on the W side of the road, N of Falconberg Court, natural gravel was recorded, together with an 18th-19th century wall which had been truncated by modern services.  A N-S aligned Victorian brick culvert was also seen, having been truncated by the insertion of ceramic drain pipes.Earnshaw Street: Deposits of probable 17th-18th century date were observed beneath modern made ground and services.  Brickwork of Victorian type was also observed in section in parts of the trench.Falconberg Court: A trench on the N side revealed natural sand beneath an organic fine silt, probably representing marshland or a man-made channel silting up in antiquity.  It was sealed by a sandy silt layer containing 18th century pottery beneath Victorian and modern backfill.Falconberg Mews: In one trench, a sandy silt deposit was recorded beneath a brick/stone culvert, and probably represents leakage from it.  Clay tobacco pipe suggesting an 18th-19th century date was recovered.  In another, an undated organic clay-silt deposit was observed, indicating marshy conditions although it is unclear whether these were natural or man-made.  A later deposit, dated to the 18th-19th century, was recorded beneath the modern road surface although this may represent backfilling during the Victorian period.Manette Street: <em>In-situ</em> natural gravel was cut by a N-S aligned Victorian sewer.  Two thin external surface layers were observed in the section and these may represent early occupation despite containing no dating evidence.  These were truncated by a brick and stone structure of uncertain purpose which may date from the 16th-18th century.St Giles High Street: At the junction with Earnshaw Street, a brick arch of likely Victorian date and an associated brick wall were recorded beneath modern concrete and tarmac.Soho Square: A series of archaeological layers of probable 17th-18th century date were recorded.  A NW-SE aligned brick drain or sewer was also observed, probably cutting these deposits although the exact relationship was obscured by shoring within the trench.  In a trench in the SE corner, a brick yard surface, provisionally dated to the 17th-18th century was overlain by an arched brick structure containing clay tobacco pipe of similar date.  The exact purpose of this structure is unclear, as it appears to be a sewer but contains no evidence for silting.Tottenham Court Road: On the W side of the road at the junction with Oxford Street, the trench revealed an 18th-19th century sand/clay/silt deposit beneath modern services, while in the NE corner of the trench a small area of possible pre-Victorian brick wall was observed.Work continues.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx0vyyt4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1302931,51.51584]}},{"properties":{"name":"Towpath Wall, River Lea, Stratford E15","description":"Towpath Wall, River Lea, Stratford E15 TQ 3735 8390 MoLAS-PCA (Kari Bower) standing building survey August 2007 Olympic Delivery Agency OL-06207A record was made of the wall which runs along the eastern edge of the River Lea towpath.

The data from this monitoring was combined with borehole data from the local area to construct a deposit model for the site, placing it in its topographic position in relation to the Lea Valley floodplain and adjacent high ground.In broad terms the area of the site is situated on a gravel promontory, or island, which extends from the slope of the high ground of the terrace to the west out eastwards into the Lea Valley floodplain. Former courses of the Hackney Brook (currently culverted), previously a west to east flowing tributary of the Lea, which drained the higher ground to the west, exist well beyond the northern and southern boundaries of the site. A past watercourse was identified, however, flowing close to the western boundary of the site, which may have fed into one of these channels. Abandoned channels associated with this watercourse may exist in the western part of the site and are likely to have potential for the preservation of organic remains suitable for past landscape reconstruction.Owing to the high elevation of the gravel promontory relative to the main valley of the River Lea, this topographic feature, with a gravel surface elevation ranging from +2 to +3 m OD, would have remained a dryland environment through much of prehistory, finally becoming inundated later in the Holocene as a result of rising river levels and silting up of the Lea floodplain. Dating evidence from the Omega III site, approximately 500 m to the south east, indicates that the local landsurface at about 2.5m OD, was inundated during the Romano-British period, around 80 – 110 cal AD. If this data was broadly applied for the Wallis Road site then there may be potential for dryland activity throughout all periods of Holocene prehistory, i.e. from the Mesolithic to the Iron Age.A subsequent watching brief carried out on a trench excavated by contractors revealed only dumped deposits of recent date which contaminated with fuel and other chemicals from the vehicle dismantling business which previously occupied the site.

Evidence for Roman activity was limited to residual finds in later contexts.  The remains of a series of substantial and exceptionally well preserved timber waterfront structures, in places standing over 1.7m high, were revealed.  The earliest of these is a front-braced revetment, thought to date to the 13th century.  The timber used in a second revetment south of the first was felled in 1339 AD.  This waterfront was associated with a timber wharf that extended north-south across the site, and was later rebuilt in stone. Fragments of mid/late-14th century and later waterfront structures were recorded in trenches to the south of this.  These were mainly constructed from timber but included a possible chalk wall. The dumped deposits associated with these waterfront structures contained an impressive array of finds including waterlogged leather and metalwork dating from the 14th – 15th century.In addition the excavations uncovered a series of 15th-16th century industrial stone hearths that may have been used in the brewing or dyeing industry.  In the less truncated areas of the site the fragmentary remains of 16th-19th century brick structures were also recorded, including some that may relate to the City of London Brewery that stood on the site until it was bombed in 1940.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqx1fj2pf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.08991,51.5095778]}},{"properties":{"name":"White Post Lane Bridge E15","description":"White Post Lane Bridge E15 TQ 3728 8451 MoLAS-PCA (Emma Dwyer) standing building survey October 2007 Olympic Delivery Authority OL-07007The White Post Lane Bridge carried a road that dates back to at least the mid-18th century over the Hackney Cut of the Lea Navigation. The present bridge was built in the late 19th or early 20th century. The bridge deck and parapet walls are constructed of riveted wrought-iron plate girders and rendered brick jack-arches, carried on abutments and piers of dark blue engineering brick, laid in English bond. The bridge piers are rendered in pebbledash, and carry the downward-curving ends of the wrought-iron plate parapets. They are capped by moulded artificial stone copings.

The truncated surface of natural brickearth was recorded in section at a level of 11.21m OD in the SW corner of the pit. Unfortunately, all horizontal archaeology within the footprint of the shaft had been removed by a massive E-W brick foundation of a late-Victorian building – which had 2 smaller brick piers set onto a Yorkstone slab which formed a capping to the wall. The loose bulk infill present on either side of this wall indicated that the building originally had cellars or deep basements to N and S and it is assumed that these were part of a warehouse destroyed during the Blitz in 1940. The frontage wall of the building was not seen and it must lie beneath the post-war remodelling of Wood Street.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2007&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66kqwyn5hjy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.094064,51.516717]}},{"properties":{"name":"Woolwich New Road sewer extension SE18","description":"Woolwich New Road sewer extension SE18 TQ 4374 7884 MoLAS (Simon Pennington) watching brief July 2007 AMEC WAX06Work on new drainage shaft was monitored during diversion of a sewer necessitated by the construction of the Woolwich Arsenal extension of the Docklands light railway.

The alluvium was sealed by substantial depths of made ground. The alluvial deposit sequence present on the site records several phases of channel activity. Interbedded sands, clays and gravels of likely prehistoric date were recorded at the base of trench PDZ12.01. These deposits accumulated on channel bars within shifting stream channels, a gravel horizon, within the sand bars produced flint debitage and a number of unabraded sherds of Neolithic pottery; an assemblage of animal remains, including horse, and a possible wooden stake structure. The sand bar deposits were truncated by a channel containing a possible dislodged/disaggregated wooden structure comprising of the remnants of at least four roundwood timbers. The remains are presently undated but are not thought to predate the Iron Age.The active channel deposits across the base of the trenches were overlain by a sequence of organic clays and peats, which are likely to represent a channel marginal backwater environment that gradually silted up. Substantial gravel dumps were laid down to consolidate the ground above the alluvium prior to post-medieval construction which, characterised by a range of wells, cess pits, brick walls and drains, was present in the upper levels of the sites.
