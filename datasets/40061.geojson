I happened to meet a roving group of models while in line for The Palace. They helped us move swiftly passed the doormen and then gave us a tour of the East Village while still singing Groove Is In the Heart. I thought the East Village was exotic. I thought Deelite was exotic. I guess it was easy then to be enraptured by everyone around you when you only heard The Steve Miller Band and Elvis prior and knew people who organized parties at the VFW.  I\\'m still intrigued by everyone around me but I don\\'t pine for Deelite, gogoboots or models very much.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bxqd9tzjd9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.980045,40.724299]}},{"properties":{"name":"Dj Masavo's Sensual Goddess","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.platial.com\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\">Deisnor</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/0c4a17557cc1d4c6ee033b6b0109fbf2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_house_verD.gif\"> 2347 NW Kearney Street, Portland, ORAn essential part of the Eastern mix which moved us from Amsterdam to Portland.
