It is known as the birthplace of King David and Jesus. For generations, it was a lively and bustling town. Today, however, Bethlehem resembles an open-air prison, occupied by Israel's military and encircled by Israel's separation wall. These circumstances have caused Bethlehem's citizens, particularly its once-vibrant Christian population, to emigrate from the city in substantial numbers.\nOn December 22, 2009, from 7:00 PM – 8:30 PM at the Arlington Central Library, the American Association for Palestinian Equal Rights (AAPER) is hosting a free screening of “Sacred Space Denied: Bethlehem and the Wall,” to be followed by an informal group discussion. The film is a short documentary examining the situation on the ground in Bethlehem today. \nThis event is being held as part of AAPER’s Free Bethlehem Campaign, to raise awareness of this aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to foster debate oriented at obtaining lasting peace for both sides. \nCome enjoy a night of lively debate and fresh perspectives in a stimulating environment. Although admission is free, we ask that, for logistical purposes, you RSVP to <a href=\"mailto:afroh3000@yahoo.com\">afroh3000@yahoo.com</a> so that we may plan accordingly.

Five Talents provides access to microcredit programs, business skills training and spiritual development, because a primary reason for a rural family’s inability to escape poverty is their lack of access to financial resources.\nIn December 2004, the devastating tsunami that hit Southeast Asia did not spare the rural fishing villages of South India.  Within minutes of the waves crashing to shore, livelihoods were destroyed and hopes smashed. No more boats, no more nets, no way to make a living.\nHowever, despite being haunted by memories of the catastrophe, it was unthinkable for the villagers to leave – these rural villages and ocean shores had been home for generations. In response to this tragedy, Five Talents started a Self-Help Group program and within a year more than 500 women had access to training and loans as small as $33 to start new businesses! This was nearly five years ago and is just one example of Five Talents’ work worldwide!\nToday, there are more than 3,400 women in this program. By empowering these women, children are now attending school, husbands are encouraged and communities have been transformed in ways never imagined before the tsunami!\nRSVP by Friday, October 29 at (703) 242-6016\nor <a href=\"mailto:FiveTalentsEvents@FiveTalents.org\">FiveTalentsEvents@FiveTalents.org</a>.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6760797/VA/Arlington/Stories-of-TransformationA-Glimpse-of-India/Westin-Arlington-Gateway-Hotel-801-N-Glebe-Rd-Arlington-VA/","id":"182"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.1142,38.8805]}},{"properties":{"title":"Oct 23, 2010: Wine Tasting &amp; Silent Auction - Cockers Uncorked! at Lyon Park Community Center","guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6791796/","published":{"end_time":"2010/09/06 21:24:14 -0400","original":"2010-09-06T18:24:13-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/09/06 21:24:13 -0400"},"description":"Celebrate the coming of fall at Cockers Uncorked!, Oldies But Goodies Cocker Rescue’s inaugural wine tasting and silent auction!

This course will improve the ability of students to select the right clauses, identify the correct procedures and improve their bargaining position during negotiations. In addition, students will learn how to keep up with changes to the FAR so they can always be sure that they have the latest and most relevant information. Rather than using a text book about the FAR, each student will receive a personal copy of the FAR which will be used as the course manual.

How can an agency manager maximize their allocation?\nThe rules governing federal appropriations are complex, extensive and fill four binders.

Without it, complex societies like ours can't exist. Yet we generally take its availability for granted. Only in times of crises do we cry out for change, but only briefly. So it may seem that not a lot is changing. But actually the energy transition towards a more sustainable system is in full swing and many scientific developments are entering the business realm. Alternative energy supply options are becoming competitive very fast.  Energy efficiency tools and regulations are becoming standard elements in virtually every value chain. Benninga will discuss a number of practical developments comparing recent European and US experiences. He will take us out to sea to explore the developing concepts of Ocean Energy and back on land with a couple of energy technologies and solutions that make a lot of sense and are available right now! \nSUPPORT THIS CAFE: The Ballston Science and Technology Alliance, a nonprofit organization, is the sponsor of Café Scientifique Arlington.  Since April 2006, the goal of Café Scientifique has been to make science more accessible and accountable by featuring speakers whose expertise spans the sciences and who can talk in plain English.
