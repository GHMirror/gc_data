We had a large group and got there early. Good thing too, because it gets packed! Strength lies in numbers, so we were able to stake out some places at the bar and dance floor. The mix was awesome, playing old school stuff up to new music - all into a great dance mix. Its a smoke free bar - so it made it nice to not smell horrible when you are stumbling out at 2am. Super expensive drinks - go with a rich friend (or a generous one), but they are at least strong. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6hfqtb9tks3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.4106,29.740504]}},{"properties":{"name":"Family Trip","description":"Posted by Rwalkerg<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> Washington D.C.Wayne, Mom Geordie and I went on a trip to D.C.

Good place to dress up slutty and have a great time. Mid-priced drinks. Dance mix varies. Some nights they played awesome stuff, other nights was all techno. I like the techno included in a mix, or apart of a concert, but all house gets boring. Fairly large dance floor. We always go as a big group and lounge around on the top floor in the back.
