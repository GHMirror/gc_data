The map displays the dominant segment's LifeMode summary group color. The &quot;dominant&quot; segment is most useful at at tract and block group levels. \n\nTapestry Segmentation, Esri's geodemographic market segmentation system, classifies U.S. neighborhoods into 65 segments based on their socioeconomic and demographic composition. For a broader view of markets, segments are grouped into 12 LifeMode Summary Groups that reflect lifestyles/life stages and 11 Urbanization Summary Groups that show levels of affluence and population density. \n\nThe geography depicts States at greater than 50m scale, Counties at 7.5m to 50m scale, Census Tracts at 200k to 7.5m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 200k scale.","is_raster":true,"short_classification":"Y","is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/USA_Tapestry/MapServer","metadata":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"source":null,"contact_phone":null},"source":"http://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/USA_Tapestry/MapServer","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":0,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-18T00:49:19-04:00","id":431974}
