The work clarified the results of the earlier fieldwork and showed that there are further potential Roman and medieval building foundations, surfaces and deposits surviving. A single slot was excavated through 18th and 19th century deposits to reveal several potential Roman features such as ditches or pits, with a burnt deposit also indicating a potential hearth area.

Natural deposits consisted of sandy gravel capped in places by brickearth.Early Roman occupation on site consisted of surfaces, post pits, beam slots and other structural evidence from the first and second centuries, although these were somewhat fragmentary due to later truncation. A line of large structural post holes on the north side of the site, early in the sequence, indicated the presence of a first-century building. Some of these features may belong to the 1st-century fort found to the east at Plantation Place under the site code FER97.In the centre of the site three sides of a late Roman cellar were found. It measured 5m by 7m and over 2.5m deep, the eastern extent being beyond the edge of the excavation. Most of the masonry had been robbed out after its disuse but the substantial ragstone foundations remained to show that it was part of an impressive building. To the north the wall was dug deeply into the natural slope, forming a terrace behind it. The ceiling had been supported by a large square column base built of Roman bricks. It was floored with mortar directly onto the natural sands. Later, part of the cellar was divided off by a thin partition wall between the column and the south edge. A second mortar floor may have been associated with this phase. In addition to an abundance of pottery, finds from the site included items of jewellery, a quantity of Roman painted wall plaster and a glass sherd with the letter ‘A’ inscribed on it.Survival from later periods was mostly confined to deep pits due to truncation. These included medieval chalk-lined cesspits, a barrel well and 17th-century refuse pits.Although truncation by modern and Victorian basements was severe, substantial deposits remained across the site. Work continues.

Truncated natural sands and gravels were observed in auger holes in two of the trenches.  In the first trench, three timber-lined tanning pits were discovered. These appear to have been constructed at the same time (probably during the 18th century) and to have been contemporary with an internal working floor and external cobbled yard surface.  The corner of a brick-built structure of probable 19th-century date was recorded in the southern part of the trench and may represent the base of a wooden drying shed (for leather) or similar building. This structure had been demolished in the late 19th/early 20th century and the area and tanning tanks backfilled with a sandy silt deposit containing large amounts of building material, and a residual clay pipe bowl dated 1700-1740.In the second, a large area of horn cores was found, tightly interlocked together over a bed of quick lime and were roughly aligned north-south indicating that they had been deliberately placed rather than randomly discarded. The horn cores were probably within a pit but this is not certain. This deposit was truncated by two small pits of similar construction to those in Trench 1 and contained pottery of 18th century date.  They may have been used for colouring the tanned leather.  A cobbled yard surface associated with these tanks suggests that they were originally in the open, while a N-S aligned C19th wall indicates that they were later enclosed within a building.  An internal brick floor had been constructed over an open drain, which was replaced with a new square brick one inside the building.  Eventually, the open tanks were backfilled and a layer similar to that in Trench 1 was dumped across the area.  A fragment of a Bristol glaze shouldered jar (1830-1900) was recovered from this layer.In Trench 3 a layer of quicklime, sealing horn cores was found in the northern half of the trench.  These were tightly packed within a timber lined pit which extended beyond the area of excavation.  They had been laid over a sandy silt layer containing pottery of 17th century date, below which was a second deposit of quicklime over horn cores, which in turn covered a sandy silt layer with fragments of mussel and oyster shell.  The pit appeared to cut through a layer of clayey silt associated with two more timber lined pits similar to those in the other trenches.  These had been backfilled with material including pottery of 19th century date.

A 9.6m length of this 2.15m wide wall was exposed, on the expected E-W line of the riverfront wall constructed in the 1550s. The wall survived highest at its E end, becoming lower and more truncated further W.The S (riverward) face was built almost completely in stone, although a small area of later brick patching was observed.  The better preserved E end was built from large, but relatively roughly finished, stone blocks and was likely to be a later rebuild. A drain (with the date ‘1847’ punched into its lid) was inserted through the wall here. The likely original lower part of the wall was built from finer grained and better worked stone, with closely fitted joints, resting on a timber baseplate. The wall core consisted of brick and stone, the proportion of stone increasing lower down in the core where chalk, greensand and ragstone had been used. The lower part of the wall was preserved <em>in situ</em>.The N face of the wall was built almost completely in brick, although some stone had been used.

The other two trenches revealed positive archaeological remains and were enlarged to form one large excavation trench within the untruncated area at the northern end of the site.The excavation revealed a sequence starting in the prehistoric period, when the Thames was much wider, shallower and slower-flowing than it is today.  The Southwark bank was a marsh with channels between gravel islands of higher, dryer ground.  The site was located on the S side of one of these ‘eyots’, where previous evidence of prehistoric activity had been found (at 47-67 Hopton Street under the site code HPT94. A possible Neolithic/Bronze Age land surface was recorded, with ard (plough) marks scattered across an area of about 75 sq. m., and the land surface cut by a number of N-S aligned ditches which may represent either boundaries or water-management activities.  Stuck flints were recovered from the basal fill of one of these ditches.Following the prehistoric period, the area was subject to continued flooding from the Thames, and alluvium was deposited during this time.  There appear to have been attempts to drain the area during the medieval period by cutting a series of N-S aligned ditches, and a carved wooden ball of 11th-13th century date was recovered from one of these.  The alluvium was overlain by walls of four 17th-century buildings, of which one may have been an inn.  A ditch some 40m long was associated with these buildings, and appears to have been cut in the 16th century, lined with wooden posts and planking (re-used from Thames boats and other vessels) during the 17th century and continued in use into the 18th.  A number of finds of 17th century date were recovered from the ditch, including delftware pottery, a German stove-tile, a pewter candlestick, wine bottles, fine glass vessels, clay tobacco pipes, several iron knives with bone handles, and a bowling ball.After the ditch was backfilled, a number of brick-lined cesspits were constructed over it, with other cess pits constructed nearby.  Material dumped in these cesspits included many pieces deposited almost whole, indicating an episode of house clearance.

The first, an external trench in the area north of Bourdon House, revealed natural terrace gravels, which were unexpected: British Geological Survey maps predicted London clay in that area, rather than Lynch Hill Gravels with potential for prehistoric material.These were cut by a brick wall consisting of purple-red bricks in lime mortar.  It appeared to have been cut through by the construction of Bourdon House (1723-4) and may represent a garden wall associated with the first phase of this building and subsequently truncated by an extension to it between 1737 and 1779.  Joining onto the north wall of Bourdon House was an external vaulted cellar which would have been accessed by its own stairs or ladder from the north side.  This part of the structure probably also dates to the later 18th century.The west wall of Bourdon House had been underpinned, faced and extended northwards to form part of the St George’s Baths, an iron-framed structure built during the 1850s.  A concrete wall and a tile-faced wall which formed part of the plunge pool of these baths were also recorded.  The bottom of the plunge pool was formed from cream coloured glazed bricks often used in 19th century lightwells.  A series of cast iron stanchions and columns associated with the baths were also observed.The second trench, excavated inside the building, revealed natural terrace gravels beneath modern fills (which included re-worked and older deposits).  Finds from among these include the bases of two 17th-18th century wine bottles and a tobacco pipe dated 1610-40 (consistent with it having been lost during the construction of nearby Civil War Defences).  These were found near the end wall of the vaulted cellar observed in Trench 1 and presumed to have been part of the later 18th century extension but which did not align with the stairwell wall above it.  The weight of the stairwell was taken by a central brick pier.  The cellar had a single layer of bricks laid as a floor, then the walls and pillar truncating natural gravel.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2008&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66skz7n45a1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1471711,51.510865]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bow Baptist Church, 1 Payne Road, E3","description":"Bow Baptist Church, 1 Payne Road, E3 TQ 37720 83046 MOLA (Sarah Ritchie, Adrian Miles) watching brief and excavation September, November-December 2008 TEAM Limited BBP07Following an evaluation in 2007, a watching brief was carried out on two geotechnical test pits and a single borehole.

The watching brief monitored a series of ‘starter pits’ and trenches on the E side of Dowgate Hill, dug for the insertion of king posts on the W side of the viaduct.Truncated, <em>in situ,</em> natural London Clay was observed in deep trenches towards the north end of Dowgate hill and in a car park area beneath the station. Elsewhere, <em>in situ</em> natural alluvial clay was recorded within the viaduct towards the W site limit, while in the central and E areas, <em>in situ</em> natural sands were recorded.The Roman archaeological sequence is predominant, with all Roman masonry being provisionally dated to the 1st-2nd century. Extended excavation of areas previously visited in 2004 increased exposure of 1st century internal brickearth partition walls as well as substantial 1st-2nd century masonry walls/foundations. Whether the masonry all relates to the ‘Governor’s Palace’ is unclear, but it seems particularly likely that structural remains located towards the E site limit are associated with buildings interpreted by Marsden as lying within the ‘Garden Court’. N of the Garden Court, newly exposed masonry included two, c.2m wide, ragstone walls associated with a massive building central to the Palace complex, Marsden’s ‘Great Hall’ (or Room 42). One section formed the SW corner of the Hall, the other section extended from and to the W of the Hall and corresponds with a separate fragment of masonry previously recorded by Marsden (Wall 42A). Further west, fragments of two adjacent wall foundations, also <em>c</em> 2m wide, may represent an apsidal ‘chamber’, mirroring foundations of a structure Marsden recorded east of the Hall (Room 44).Several features of provisional 11th-12th century date were recorded, including a large chalk foundation located towards the centre of the site.  While only partly visible, it appeared to form the SE corner of a substantial masonry building.  A chalk and ragstone lined cess/rubbish pit of similar date was partly exposed in a drain sump pit near the W site limit All surviving Roman and medieval masonry has been preserved <em>in situ</em>, sealed within a geotextile skin below a layer of sand.The majority of 16th-18th century deposits were destroyed when the viaduct was built in the 1860s.  However, limited remains were recorded towards the W site limit, including a brick cellar wall and a substantial brick foundation, both of probable 17th century date, possibly relating to post-Great Fire redevelopment along Dowgate Hill.  Deep trenches excavated near the northern limit of Dowgate Hill revealed Victorian brick basements relating to the former City Terminus Hotel, a five storey structure which provided the frontage to the original railway station from 1867 until its demolition in 1963.

From map evidence the chimney appeared to date from between 1893 and 1896, when the site was leased by the Gas Light and Coke Company. The chimney had an E-facing opening at its base, with a triple rowlock set arch, probably housing a flue which connected the chimney to a building containing the furnace, located immediately to the east.

Three areas were examined during the first phase of work: One trench at the rear of the existing Conservatory and the Hockey Field revealed natural sandy brickearth sealed by later deposits probably relating to the landscaping of the area.Two trenches were excavated in the Car Park. One contained natural brickearth beneath a clinker path aligned with the entrance to the Northern Walled Garden, beneath an undated dump of slag and clinker below the modern tarmac surface.  The other revealed natural brickearth cut by a series of bedding trenches filled with loose garden soil with fragments of pottery, clay tobacco pipe and glass.A fourth trench at the rear of the Conservatory revealed natural brickearth cut by a shallow N-S aligned ditch of possible 18th century date which was in turn sealed by a probable 18th century mixed brickearth/occupation layer. This had been cut by a brick wall and – in the N half of the trench – by a deep pit containing 18th-19th century demolition material.  Compact dumped layers of probable 18th-19th century date had been built up against the remaining courses of the wall, probably forming external surfaces.  This was overlain by a truncated brick and pebble surface beneath the make up for the current yard surface.Further work in August involved the excavation of five trenches. Two were located in the Northern Walled Garden, one on the E side of the path and the other across the path 10m south of the gate.  Both revealed a similar sequence of natural brickearth beneath two soil horizons which were interpreted as earlier planting beds beneath modern topsoil.  These features suggest formal gardening and may relate to the period when the area was in use by the Royal Horticultural Society or earlier.Three trenches were excavated in the Southern Walled Garden: The first exposed part of a gravel path overlying an earlier brick surface, two cuts containing an ashy demolition deposit including flower pots, window glass and brick, as well as pottery of 18th-19th century date, and a domed brick-lined well of similar date. The demolition deposits may relate to a ‘stove house’ or a conservatory used for growing fruit trees, exotic plants, or early spring flowers. A second revealed a gravel path, probably associated with that in the previous trench, overlying garden bedding deposits of probable 19th century date.  Some residual prehistoric burnt and worked flints were also recovered from these deposits. A narrow N-S aligned robber cut removing a probable 18th century wall, which may have been associated with a pre-1743 phase of landscaping.  The last trench, close to the gates, revealed a chalky deposit which probably represents many phases of repair to them and continuous use of the gates for access into the garden area.  Several phases of a soil or brickearth path which were then truncated by 19th century planting beds were recorded.  A single residual fragment of probable Iron Age pottery was found within these deposits.An additional watching brief was carried out after contractors exposed a masonry structure while excavating a trench for a water pipe in the SW corner of the West Yard.

Over these was a series of Roman clay-and-timber buildings, the earliest of which were provisionally dated to the 1st century AD.  Along the E limit of the area, a mud brick wall was found with white wall plaster and a plain white fine tessellated border.  In the NW corner of this area, cutting the clay-and-timber building was a sunken Roman plunge pool constructed from brick with a thick <em>opus signinum</em> floor and rendering on the internal faces.  These features were cut by pits of late Roman or medieval date beneath a dumped soil horizon (dating pending) which in turn was truncated by the basement of the modern building.A watching brief was undertaken on a trench for a secant wall on the E side of Crosby Square, followed by an excavation.  This revealed natural brickearth beneath the fragmented remains of Roman clay and timber buildings.  These had been cut by a series of late Roman or medieval pits, which in turn were sealed by yard surfaces and walls of late medieval date which may have been associated with the 15th century Crosby Hall which stood nearby.  Walls of 17th-18th century date were also found. The removal of the Hall to Chelsea in 1908 had truncated later deposits in the 2m below present ground level.A small excavation undertaken between on a sewer drop shaft at the junction of Great St Helens and Crosby Square revealed natural brickearth sealed by a thick Roman dumped deposit.

This was covered by a mixed deposit containing 19th century pottery which probably represents deposits in open ground prior to the development of the area in the mid 19th century. Cutting through this was a cess pit built of re-used red and yellow bricks, the fill of which contained mid-late 19th century pottery, and probably relates to activity at the rear of the properties on Theobald Street shown on the 1872 and 1916 Ordnance Survey map. Modern make up deposits sealed the archaeological sequence.The area of excavation was formerly occupied by a privately owned burial ground, open from c.1820-1853. Natural deposits consisted of mixed gravels and clay at approximately 1.2m OD although most of the surface of the gravel was truncated by the burial ground. A single, heavily damaged, Roman cremation urn was found on a baulk between two graves. A total of 796 burials, all in wooden coffins, were recorded, of which 784 were retained for assessment by the osteologist. Approximately 45 burials were recorded as coffins only, then immediately reburied due to the level of soft tissue survival encountered. A brick wall recorded at the western edge of the excavation area was found to be the limit of the burial ground.Little intercutting of burials was found, except when associated with modern activity, and only a small quantity of disarticulated human bone was recovered, which was not retained. The burials were very dense, with coffins placed head to toe to maximise the use of the available space. Burials were in ‘stacks’, single grave cuts containing multiple burials, up to eight being common. Although the burials were placed in so tightly, head to foot, that they appeared to be in large pits or trenches, the differing levels of the bases of the graves showed that they had originally been dug as single graves.

Cartographic and drawn evidence, together with an examination of the building materials used, suggest that the construction of the central dock within Dead Dog Bay dates to the mid-late 19th century during extensive development of the site area for industrial use. This structure was subsequently blocked and partially in-filled during the 20th century. There is evidence for several phases of repair and consolidation, both to the masonry and working surface of the dock.

These remains probably represent the S edge of the City ditch, cut by the Irongate Sewer.  No evidence for the City Wall was observed and this is thought to lie to the S of the site.Between two piles, natural gravels were cut by the City ditch, which was observed on an E-W alignment and measuring some 4.8m deep.  No dating evidence was recovered from the homogeneous black fill of the ditch.  A third area, in the SE corner of the site, revealed brown silty sand cut by brick foundations of probable 18th-19th century date, and overlain by 20th century demolition debris.  Following this, a watching brief was carried out to ensure that any human remains from the Roman extra-mural cemetery were not disturbed and that the City Wall (a Scheduled Ancient Monument) was not exposed by enabling works.

The majority of the investigations were made on grassed areas, revealing natural clay beneath a sandy clay topsoil and modern turf.  On the Netball court (a raised area to the south of the site), deeper deposits of topsoil containing brick fragments, coal and slag were observed.  These may be associated with gardens belonging to houses on Stillness Road, one of which was destroyed by WW2 bombing and is now the location of the court.  Around the Pavilion, deposits had been disturbed during its construction and made ground was recorded in several pits, though one pit in this area contained gravel deposits approximately on a predicted alignment of the Roman road from London to Lewes (Margary 14).  Evidence was also found for disturbance around a grandstand to the east, probably associated with its construction but possibly related to earlier re-modelling.  No other archaeological remains were observed.The geophysical survey concentrated on the west side of the site and the Roman road alignment. Two anomalies, potentially associated with the road, were identified.During the third phase of work, seventeen evaluation trenches were excavated including four to establish whether remains of the Roman road were present and might be affected by the proposed development.  Three revealed areas of stiff, dark grey clay on which gravel layers were deposited almost exactly on the predicted road alignment. The fourth, furthest to the south, demonstrated that the road metalling had been truncated by the levelling of sports pitches as the road rose up a natural slope.  A section placed where the survival of the road was greatest suggested the presence of a camber on either side. No other archaeological features associated with the road were identified. The other trenches contained only remains relating to the construction and landscaping of the modern sports ground. Three shallow pits were also found, one of which contained fragments of brick and tile, which are likely that they are all contemporary with the ground reduction and subsequent levelling of the sports ground.

Two phases of the London–Silchester Roman road were revealed immediately next to the modern London Road. The earlier road was flanked by a ditch and later by a fence. Evidence for occupation on the SE side of the road, clearly represented part a linear settlement that, as previous excavations have shown, extended alongside the road into what is now the centre of Brentford. The evidence included the remains of two substantial timber buildings. These had burnt down and their earthen floors were covered by charcoal and burnt wall daub. Outside the buildings were bread ovens, hearths, pits, gravel surfaces and a possible cremation burial.Further investigation was undertaken of a large palaeo-channel, probably a former branch of the River Thames, recorded on the SE side of the site during the evaluation in 2004.  A trench revealed part of the profile of the channel, which was filled with a sequence of fine-grained sediments. No artefacts were recovered from these deposits during the excavation, but during the evaluation  Roman pottery and a coin of Valentinian I or Valens dated to AD 364–78 was found in an upper fill. The lower channel fills are as yet undated, but included thin layers of peat/organic matter that might be dated by radiocarbon assay.Successive Roman field systems, clearly delineated by ditches and gullies, lay between the settlement and the channel. The ditches defined individual fields and a track, possibly a droveway, running down from the settlement to the channel. A skeleton lay in one ditch and crouched burial lay in a small grave next to another ditch.Most artefacts, especially metal objects, were found in the settlement, although some were recovered from field ditches. The finds included a large quantity of pottery, fragments of tile and burnt daub, 120 coins, two bronze finger rings, brooches, tweezers and other toilet instruments, a stylus, lead discs, iron rings, blades and hooks, pieces of shale bracelets, quernstones and whetstones.

The wall, statutorily listed grade II, was originally built to enclose the 'Betahaim Novo' (New Cemetery) of the Spanish-Portuguese Jews' Congregation. The western part of this stretch of wall, originally in the south-east corner of the cemetery, probably dated from the establishment of the cemetery in 1726-33; the plain wall ended in a gate pier for one of the two cemetery gates, since rebuilt, and bore traces of a structure abutting its internal face, probably a documented mortuary chapel, removed in the 1960s. The cemetery was enlarged to the east in 1849-53, and the boundary wall extended as a panelled wall with a ridged brick coping. The external face of this extension was partly abutted at first by small houses and gardens, and later, after they were demolished and probably after the cemetery went out of use c.1936, by a four-storey office building, a workshop and a garage (both the latter recently demolished).

The data from this exercise have been used to place the site in its topographic position within the Lea Valley, to understand the archaeological potential of the site and target further work. The site is located on the east side of the Lea Valley and would have occupied a prominent position overlooking the Lea floodplain.  It may have been chosen for occupation in both prehistoric and historic periods, although preservation of archaeology and the potential for past environment reconstruction was poor due to hillslope processes, modern truncation and the lack of organic deposits on the dry, valley-side.The sequence generally comprised bedrock, overlain by gravels, brickearth and some weathered alluvium under 19th century and modern make up, although the geology was highly variable most likely due to the slope of the valley side leading to exposure of different bedrock types.  Thanet sands were observed overlain by the Lambeth Group.  This comprised both stiff grey clay of the younger Palaeocene Reading Beds and mollusc-rich, dark silty Woolwich Shell Beds. Pleistocene terrace gravels (deposited by former river channels with heavy bed-loads) were seen in few boreholes between 1 and 3.5m below ground level, with firm orange brown sandy clay brickearth present in almost all interventions.

These had been constructed within pits probably representing industrial activity on the site before the foundation of the friary. Within the church, three complete and several truncated burials of adult males were recorded, including one wearing a studded belt.  The church floor had been laid with 14th-century ‘Penn’ floor tiles from Buckinghamshire, although only one was still <em>in situ</em> and the remainder were found re-used in later structures.  A medieval chalk cellar was located to the S of the church remains. Several other structures associated with the friary were found, including a chalk well (with later brick repairs) in the NW of the site, chalk foundations on the N side and series of pits of the W side containing 13th-14th century pottery including an aquamanile in the form of an animal being ridden by a knight.

An 18th-century brick wall also incorporated chalk blocks and stone fragments from the friary in its foundations. Several 19th-century brick cellars were located along the N perimeter of site, backfilled with rubble prior to the construction of Mariner House in the 1960s.

The W end of the medical school, rebuilt in 1897, also survived in the NW corner of the site, subsequently converted to wards.

The site was located on a low gravel terrace that was probably dry land during much its history probably a gravel island, associated with the braided river channels of the Lea Valley.A segmented ditch system ran across the eastern and northern part of site. This contained good assemblages of Middle Bronze Age and Late Bronze Age ceramics. Two crouched inhumations may also be associated with this phase of activity. The absence of residual ceramics suggests the area was not intensively used at time of burial.The main occupation phase comprised numerous small pits/postholes plus the partial remains of four &amp;quot;drip gully&amp;quot; features. An enclosure ditch, heavily truncated by later activity, was also recognised and is believed to be contemporary. Late Bronze Age ceramics were recovered from the enclosure ditch as well as many of the settlement features.The remains of three larger &amp;quot;drip gully&amp;quot; features that contained ceramics of Middle Iron Age date were also present. Associated features were noticeably scarce when compared with the preceding activity. Three sides of a second enclosure ditch were present which partly truncated two of the Middle Iron Age drip gullies. This rectangular enclosure had two opposing entrances and was located at the western end of a contemporary east-west orientated ditch, which was integral with the enclosure, forming its northern boundary.A substantial ditch partly truncated the Middle Iron Age ditch system contained small amounts of Roman material. This ditch revealed at least two phases of re-cutting. Two flexed inhumation burials are believed to be associated with this phase of activity, although unfortunately neither contained associated grave goods. One was adjacent to the Roman ditch system and orientated east-west, perpendicular to the nearest ditch cut running north-south whilst the second was adjacent to the Middle Iron Age ditch system and was orientated north-south respecting the alignment of the earlier Iron Age ditch. This second burial suggests that the Middle Iron Age ditch was still a recognised boundary in the Roman period, which possibly survived as a low bank or hedgerow.

This was carried out within a sheet steel piled cofferdam and a mechanical excavator removed a substantial thickness of modern overburden before archaeological deposits were exposed.Natural gravel was overlain by silty sand beneath patches of clayey sandy peat deposits. Artefacts comprising flint flakes, charcoal flecks and daub contained within the peat indicate the earliest evidence for human activity within the trench, presently a generally prehistoric date. The natural deposits and peaty clay were sealed by an alluvial layer approximately 2.5m thick.Two parallel N-S aligned lines of timber piles inserted into the alluvium formed the earliest structure, dated to 16th century (on woodwork typological grounds). Part of a timber-revetted water channel was unearthed in the S of the trench that may date to the 17th century, possibly used as a mill race or leat. The earliest brick building, which may date to the late 17th or 18th century, was also located in the S of the trench. This was rectangular and probably had an industrial purpose as an adjacent sunken brick feature probably represented a furnace. The remnants of a cobbled surface may possibly be associated with a later phase of masonry construction forming a southern building and western terrace of cottages presumed to be early 19th century.  These were constructed over the demolished remains of the timber leat and associated brick structures.Possibly in phase with the industrial structures was an ‘anchor’ for a tie-back revealed in the SW part of the trench. This would have formed part of the revetment to a water channel located beyond the W limit of the excavation. The late 17th-18th century structures described above were overlain by made ground upon which a late 18th-early 19th century phase of building and associated surfaces was constructed. This included the east side of a N-S aligned terrace of six cottages, which would have backed onto the Temple Mill Stream (as indicated on the Ordnance Survey 1867 first edition map).

In the N of the Bartlett House site, truncated natural gravels were observed, although no brickearth had survived due to truncation from the previous buildings.  The gravels were cut by an E-W aligned palaeo-channel, which had been re-cut and partly canalised during the Roman period.  Within the man-made cut, a wooden drain constructed from oak timbers was recorded, while Roman pottery was recovered from the upper fills of the channel. The drain may date from the early Roman period, and appears to have been backfilled later, possibly to enable construction during the expansion of the Roman city.  A small area of clay-and-timber building and associated occupation layers was excavated in the N part of the site. To the E of this, two deep pits were recorded, one containing a 1st century AD samian bowl.Along the E edge of the site, two inter-cutting ditches curved in a SW direction, possibly reflecting the curve of the walls of the Roman amphitheatre which was located to the W.  These may relate to late Roman activity, as they cut the upper fills of the palaeo -channel and are themselves cut by pits of c.970-1000AD containing large assemblages of domestic refuse. Several also contained the decayed remains of wattle-and-post linings.  They were presumably located to the rear of buildings fronting Basinghall Street,In the central N part of the site, two 12th-century chalk foundations were recorded cutting a number of earlier pits, including a barrel well containing a large assemblage of pottery.  A ragstone wall along the E site boundary may be the W wall of the medieval church of St Stephen Coleman or part of Mason’s Hall, a substantial 15th century building.  Several medieval pits were excavated across the site, including one containing a large assemblage of pottery.At the SE corner of the excavation a stone-lined well/soakaway of probable 15th/16th century date was recorded.  Constructed from high quality stone, it had been partly incorporated into a brick rebuild of the S party wall of Bartlett House.  All later activity on the site had been truncated by the foundations and basements of 20th century buildings.

The evaluation area lies within the Roman Cripplegate fort and close to the medieval tower of Elsing Spital, also known as St Alphage Tower, a Grade II listed building which was founded in 1329. In the first trench, on the E side of St Alphage Tower, a yellow stock brick foundation or plinth associated with the rebuilding of the NE wall of the tower during 1962 consolidation works was observed.  This was sealed by a compact mortar surface and modern paving.The second trench, at the E end of the roadway in St Alphage Gardens revealed a dump probably deposited between the 16th-19th centuries (containing residual Roman brick and <em>imbrex</em> roof tile) cut by modern services at the N end.  In the S part of the trench, a possible late Roman make-up deposit was sealed by two medieval occupation layers, one of which was cut by a small pit containing metalworking debris.  This was covered by an external gravel surface which had once been laid up against a medieval chalk wall, for which only a robber cut was present.  This wall may have been part of St Alphage Church, and the demolition material found nearby probably represents the robbing out of the material from it.  The gravel layer was sealed by several medieval occupation layers, which in turn were cut by two medieval pits.  One of these contained residual fragments of Roman samian pottery and <em>imbrex</em> tiles.  A layer of probable 16th-19th century date covered these features, and was cut by modern services and sealed by modern deposits and paving.The third trench, at the W end of the roadway in St Alphage Gardens, had been truncated by modern services at its N end and partly truncated to the S by Victorian basements which had been backfilled with rubble and ash, probably from WWII bomb damage.  Nine pieces of worked Caen stone were recovered from the backfill, and these may originally have been part of St Alphage Church. Due to truncation at the N end, deposits could only be recorded in section. A fairly sterile Roman brickearth dumped layer was sealed by a medieval consolidation deposit, beneath a medieval gravel yard surface, which was sealed by later medieval dumping.

This opened in 1840 and ran from Minories (on the eastern edge of the City of London) to Blackwall, via Stepney.  It was constructed in three phases: The earliest was the southern side of the viaduct, visible in Shadwell Place; It was subsequently twice widened to the north, initially prior to 1870 and again prior to 1914, when the Ordnance Survey map shows that houses in Martha Street have been demolished to make way for it.  The piers of the viaduct were constructed from red stock bricks, and cast iron ‘weepers’ had been built into the piers during the second phase of construction to drain off rainwater from the deck above.

No in-situ Roman remains were found although three re-deposited fragments of Roman pottery and tile were recovered.The site lies within the boundaries of the medieval Carthusian monastery of Charterhouse, and plans of a similar site at Mount Grace, Yorkshire, predicted a latrine to be present on the western boundary of the site.  The feature, which had an outfall or lip feeding into an E-W aligned linear drain, was located during the evaluation.  The drain appeared to have had a stone lining, although this had been robbed.A gravel surface was found which was probably contemporary with the listed late-16th century wall preserved in situ on the northern edge of the site and may represent the surface of a courtyard on the south side of the wall accessed from the garden to the north via a doorway.   The doorway had been blocked and this may be contemporary with the deposition of up to 2m of dumping on the site.  The garden wall appears to have acted as a retaining wall for a laystall (a dumping place for nightsoil).   The front walls of the monastic cells may have remained for come time after the Dissolution, and it is possible that the western laystall wall could have been the back wall of these buildings.  The dumped deposits, which included remains of painted plaster, suggested that substantial remains of the monastery still existed and were being robbed in the late 16th/early 17th century. The dumped material is similar in composition to deposits recorded at several other sites nearby including 1-13 Seward Street (SDS99) and 15-29 Seward Street (SDT99), both located some 400m N of the site.The bulk of the pottery from these deposits is of 16th-early 17th century date and relates to household or light industrial refuse.

Sixteen large pile holes were excavated, and a watching brief was carried out on works in the area of SWA81.The late 3rd century Roman riverside wall survived to a height of 1.40m under the southern pavement of Lower Thames Street. This was built over several timbers probably associated with the Roman 2nd century waterfront.There were a series of medieval timber waterfronts, timber drains and associated dumps. Along the Angel Passage frontage (on the W side of site) there were at least four E-W running post and plank revetments. There were also several chalk walls and foundations of buildings that are assumed to be medieval in date.A wide range of medieval items were recovered; these include numerous coins and tokens, pilgrim souvenirs including badges, a large decorated ampulla to hold holy water and a large decorated panel, knives, pins, buckles, fishing weights, horse shoes, a candle holder, cloth seals, chapes, a needle holder, razors, a spoon, a curry comb, several finger rings and numerous dress decorations.Non metal items include leather shoes and scabbards, stone hones to sharpen knives, the worked bone items include handles, awls and an ice skate, and several wooden skewers may be to hold fish for drying.A devotional lead openwork panel, with four scenes from the life and death of (‘St’) Thomas of Lancaster, probably mid 14th century date was found. It is a visual record of the last days of Earl Thomas, cousin and principal political opponent of Edward II in the early 14th century, who was executed in 1322 following his capture and trial at Pontefract, which was subsequently the centre of his popular cult as an unofficial saint. This remarkably accomplished and complete find of one of the largest known pilgrim souvenirs from the Middle Ages (a couple of small side panels may be missing) has several parallels, most being small fragments, and the British Museum has long held a near-complete six-panelled version of markedly poorer style.

Some revetments were running east-west, but others running north-south and front braced were probably defining property boundaries. There were also several timber tiebacks belonging to a waterfront running beneath Swan Lane.

Specific aims were to investigate the interior of a medieval building that had been excavated and reburied in the 1970s, and to expose its exterior for consolidation and display. The building had been identified as the abbey guesthouse, but the results of a desk-based assessment in August 2007 suggested that it was the abbey gatehouse (Great Gate). This was confirmed by the discovery of hitherto unknown walls extending south from the previously recorded part of the building, suggesting that the structure once straddled the access road to the abbey (now Bakers Row). The gatehouse had been constructed in two major phases. The earliest part, to the south, was divided into two rooms that probably lay on the north side of the entrance passage. Later in the medieval period the gatehouse was enlarged by the addition of a rectangular extension on its north side. Several cut features and layers close to the building produced medieval pottery or building material and might be contemporaneous with the abbey. A stone wall to the east of the gatehouse was also probably medieval, and may have been part of the abbey precinct wall. The gatehouse was further extended and altered in the 16th/17th century, and two bricklined cesspits were built next to it in the 16th/mid 17th century and mid 17th/18th century respectively. Later features and strata included the remains of a 17th-century brick building, a drain, walls, gravel paths, moat fills and garden/agricultural soil. The latest features were the remains of Victorian terraced houses fronting onto Bakers Row, and associated features including yard surfaces, brick-lined cesspits and possible garden paths.

The main archaeological investigations were:Work on a manhole at the junction of the Charing Cross Road with Manette Street revealed natural terrace gravels cut by large scale quarrying pits.  These had been backfilled by probable 15th- early 17th century landfill dumps, which were cut by two later structures: A brick arched foundation (of possible 15th-17th century date) was recorded on the side nearest to the centre of the modern road, representing either the foundations of buildings pre-dating the 19th-century widening of the Charing Cross Road or a structure such as a Tudor culvert.  To the S of this foundation, the dumped deposits were cut by an 18th century brick cellar on a slightly different alignment, which extended E beyond the area of excavation. Modern deposits formed the upper part of the sequence.  A second manhole in the same area uncovered no archaeological remains but exposed natural at a similar depth.  A deep service trench on the W side of the Charing Cross Road from Manette Street to Old Compton Street revealed only modern layers.In Manette Street, excavation at a manhole near the junction with Orange Yard exposed natural laminar terrace gravels which had been truncated by widespread quarrying, backfilled with a grey ashy (nightsoil) deposit and sealed by modern layers.  Work on a manhole on the W side of Greek Street, opposite the junction with Manette Street, produced a similar sequence, as did  three manholes/shaft excavations across Soho Square from the junction with Greek Street, on the SE side of Sutton Row, and on the E side of the square N of the junction with Sutton Row.At the junction of St Giles High Street with Andrew Borde Street, a large trench to divert services exposed natural terrace gravels which had been truncated by quarrying and backfilled with grey ashy nightsoil deposits.  However, the quarry pit respects the line of a series of building frontages located directly to the N, indicating that these were standing when they were dug.  These 18th century buildings, which may have been built on 17th century originals, included a lightwell to a deeper (unexcavated) coal cellar and cut through the natural gravel.  A clay tobacco pipe dated 1640-1680 was recovered from the fills of the quarry pit, which appears to have been dug in the historic St Giles High Street.  It is possible that this indicates disruption at the time of the Civil War and corresponds with the construction of forts and artillery emplacements to the north.  The upper layers of the quarry were overlain by alternate layers of gravel and sand, presumed to be the bedding for a road or pavement.   A trench located N of the junction with Denmark Street and another running from Earnshaw Road to 16-21 St Giles High Street both exposed only modern intrusions.A manhole excavated on the W corner of Tottenham Court Road exposed natural terrace gravel beneath modern truncation. Another, on the E corner, at the junction of New Oxford Street, natural gravel was recorded beneath truncation by a series of sewer pipes and water mains. One, in the SW corner, was constructed from red unfrogged bricks and lime mortar and probably dates to the late 18th/early 19th century.

At East Slingsby Place the monitoring of underpinning works at basement level continued from the previous year and was completed in February.Work on the NCP site commenced in July and at 10-14 Upper St Martins Lane in September. At the NCP site four excavation trenches were located at ground level and eight at basement level, and in addition the excavation of drain runs located at basement level was also monitored. At 10-14 Upper St Martins Lane an archaeological excavation took place across the site. This was largely from basement level, but in two unbasemented areas the excavation commenced at current ground level.The underlying drift geology of the site comprises river terrace gravels overlain by a layer of brickearth, which was not encountered during the excavation.  However, the remains of two clay-filled palaeo-channels were encountered, one crossing the NCP site approximately east-west, and a second much larger channel crossing 10-14 Upper St Martins Lane approximately N-S. No features of confirmed prehistoric date were recorded, although the terminus of a ditch running E-W excavated on the NCP site is potentially pre-Roman. Residual Roman finds were recovered from features at both the NCP site and 10-14 Upper St Martins Lane.The most substantial remains were of Saxon date. In areas of the site where modern basements had been constructed these were limited to cut features such as gravel quarry pits, rubbish pits and wells, but in untruncated areas the remains of floors, buildings, hearths and external yard/alley surfaces were also recorded. The finds and environmental assemblages from the site are currently being assessed, but it is hoped that they will add considerably to our understanding of the Middle Saxon settlement of Lundenwic.In unbasemented areas the Saxon features were sealed by a layer of soil which contained both medieval and post-medieval pottery, and by later (17th-18th century) dumped deposits.

The trial pits were excavated within the shallower basements on the site. The most important discovery during the original evaluation was that part of the foundation of the north aisle ‘sleeper’ wall of the Temple of Mithras still survived on the east side of the site. It had been thought that the building had been completely dismantled and the stone and tile re-used in the reconstruction which was later built on a podium facing Queen Victoria Street.The largest of the trial pits in the current work was located to determine whether the south wall of the temple had survived to a similar level. Despite the high level of truncation across the western half of the trench, the archaeology to the east was well preserved and the remains of both the south aisle and external wall of the temple were uncovered. Interestingly, the external wall was much shallower founded than the aisle wall to the north and had a timber drain or shuttering against its S face. The base of the deeper aisle wall was defined 1m lower and it is assumed that the foundation was strengthened as it constituted one of the main load-bearing walls of the building – which supported an internal colonnade along the side of the sunken nave.It was known from Grimes’s original excavation in the 1950s that the temple had been constructed on unstable reclaimed ground on the east bank of the Walbrook – with the result that the building had been affected by subsidence and required repair and modification. The reasons for this were evident in the exposed face of the trial pit, which provided a sectional view of a large number of highly organic and originally waterlogged reclamation dumps that the temple had been constructed on.As well as revealing the foundations for the east end of the Temple of Mithras, further south, part of a Roman clay-and-timber building was defined occupying a similar position on reclaimed ground on the east bank of the Walbrook. The structure was composed of a substantial brickearth clay wall based on a timber baseplate supported on driven timber piles, with a number of internal floor and occupation deposits defined on either side of the wall. The Roman sequences recorded in the other trial pits, included waterlogged fills and dumps in, or on the margins of, the Walbrook channel, two intercutting plank and tile lined drains cut into the reclamation dumps on the W bank of the Walbrook, and a decayed box-lined well.Later features and deposits of medieval and probable 16th-18th century date survived in four of the trial pits, including external levelling dumps, unlined rubbish and cess pits, and an 18th century brick-lined well or drainage sump.

The building, comprising a steel frame with brick walls and concrete floors on five storeys, with a flat roof, was constructed in 1937–8 (Higgins and Thomerson, architects) for Yardley and Co Ltd, manufacturers of perfume and soap. Packaging was very important to the company’s products and the building served as a factory making boxes, and a warehouse, with offices on the upper floors. The shape and exterior of the building is in an Art Moderne style, with white walls and brown ceramic window and door surrounds, since painted over, and a bowed end to the west containing nearly-continuous windows. A projecting full-height stair compartment on the south flanks the main entrance from the street, which is marked externally at 1st-floor level by a large ceramic mural of lavender-sellers, the company’s trademark. On the north the building faces the Waterworks River, a branch of the River Lea, beside which was a separate single-storey factory and warehouse, with a roof formed of successive convex shells in reinforced concrete. On the NE, Warton House contained an external goods hoist to the upper floors and, on the ground floor, a large goods entrance, possibly inserted as part of large-scale modifications including reinforcement of the 1st floor. A passenger lift had also been inserted in the north-west of the building, and glazed entrance porches added to the east. After the Yardley Company left the building in 1966, it was radically adapted for, among other things, educational uses and TV studios.Following demolition, an evaluation was carried out, consisting of nine trenches spread evenly across the site of which two were later expanded for full excavation.  This phase revealed the remains of timber waterfront revetments belonging to the original Waterworks River dating from the 17th-18th century to its backfilling and re-alignment in the 1930s.  These showed evidence of large and small scale repairs and a major mid-19th century refurbishment in response to severe local flooding.  A small brick-and-flint building and the base of a timber crane indicated the presence of industrial activity on the S bank and an Ordnance Survey map of 1869 showed a timber yard on the site.The excavation phase at the N end of the site revealed natural gravels cut by Roman quarry pits, which were later truncated for the cutting of an irrigation channel during the early medieval period.  This channel was truncated by another channel of possible 15th-17th century date, which suffered from flooding and silting up, leading to the construction of the timber revetments recording during the evaluation.  Excavation at the S end of the site exposed the substantial brick remains of a mid-18th century pump house, navigation channel and wheel-race to the former West Ham Waterworks Company ‘Waterworks Mill’. The navigation channel displayed evidence of damage caused by a barge striking on of the brick revetment walls. The pump house and mill race showed at least one phase of re-fitting, possibly with an iron waterwheel, while the pump house also showed evidence of structural alterations indicating a change of function, possibly as a factory, although it was unclear whether the water wheel was still used.  There were also signs that the 18th century pump house was incorporated into the remains of a 17th century corn mill which once occupied the site.  Removal of the 17th century brick walls exposed the truncated remains of a peg tile and mortal sill-beam to a potential timber building, possibly a mill of medieval date.<a href=\"http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteSummariesDetails.asp?year=summaries2008&amp;siteid=\">See site report</a>","id":"a66skyvqt4qa"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.0066361,51.53544]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wellesley Square, Wellesley Road, CR0","description":"Wellesley Square, Wellesley Road, CR0 TQ 32400 66210 MOLA (Sadie Watson) evaluation February 2008 Berkeley Homes (South East London) Ltd WQU08Six evaluation trenches were excavated prior to redevelopment of the site.

The sandy gravel deposits were present at c 0.8m to 2.4m OD across the north-west of PDZ4 and were overlain by a thin layer of organic material which was sealed by an alluvial clay sequence (ranging from 0.85m to1.90m in thickness), suggesting that much of the area was waterlogged marsh environment or subject to flooding over time.
