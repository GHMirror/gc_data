I\\'m just glad we still had our shirts on; it made things a lot easier (for me, at least, but then again I don\\'t have dangly bits to protect).\n\nBut still, my grandmother practically breaking down the door, catching us <i>in flagrante delicato</i> -- I swore up and down that day that Murphy Was Watching. \n\nThe worst of it, of course, wasn\\'t the act of having been caught, but the fallout: being called a slut and whore and a hypocrite by my father, and being told that if I didn\\'t stop seeing you he\\'d have me thrown in jail; being questioned every time I left the house, and having to keep a very strict curfew. My heart broke into a thousand pieces every time I remembered how careless we\\'d been and what agony it was causing us now -- I hated not being able to see you, and more, I hated being made to feel ashamed for <i>wanting</i> to see you. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6tksc0sefno"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.205126,32.826438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Cheesy menu, great food.

The menu\\'s simple -- breakfast foods, sandwiches, and a small selection of entrees. The shakes and malts are where it\\'s at for drinks, and I personally recommend the Sloppy Bob. \n\nThe atmosphere\\'s kind of reminiscient of the bastard child of Denny\\'s and Planet Hollywood, come to think of it. \n\nBut it\\'s a great place to take yourself and some friends if you\\'re starving in the wee hours of the morning. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6tksbyuv3nk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.126698,32.827828]}},{"properties":{"name":"Fetish, fetishes galore!","description":"Posted by Baby221<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 3847 Park Blvd San Diego, CA 92103An almost one-stop shop for fetish gear with a knowledgable, friendly staff.

And I\\'d slip into not-quite-dreams of you and I together and all the pieces of us, the pieces of our past, began to coalesce and suggest ... \"Why not?\" And I began to think in earnest of how important you were to me, how you\\'d always been there for me, how much I cherished you. We had just passed the turnstiles when I realised that I loved you, and that it was high time I began to act on it.\n\nSo when we sat down in those tight little bullet sleds and your body buttressed mine, I leaned back against you and stroked your thighs. Your body tensed up, your breath came short, and you froze -- and clung on to the handholds as the ride began to jostle us about in earnest -- but by the time we were pulling into the station you were returning my caresses. You rubbed my arms and held me closely against you, and you pressed a kiss to my temple. \n\nMy knees were wobbly and I was more dazed than sleepy when we finally disembarked, but the look in your eyes told me it was all worth my while. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6tksc74pc7c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.91781,33.81341]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mediocre.","description":"Posted by Baby221<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 7865 Balboa Ave San Diego, CAA disappointingly limited selection, but at least they stock the Rockchick and Feeldoe. Pornography and bachelor/bachelorette parties seem to be their main deal, though, given the amount of space dedicated to gag gifts and penis party favours, and the disproportionate amount of shelving dedicated to adult videos. The few nods to kinky sex included nipple clamps and fluffy, leopard-print patterned handcuffs, and they do stock a sort of \"bend over beginner\" strap-on set. \n\nThe staff don\\'t seem particularly in-the-know, and some of them are reluctant to actually provide assistance if you\\'re shopping for toys as opposed to, say, videos (they tend to be more enthusiastic about the videos). \n\nAdditionally, it\\'s a little difficult to get into and out of (pun unintended, but unavoidable). The entrance is also the exit, a single lane that makes traffic a little tight at times. The situation is complicated by the fact that there are two or three parking spots along this single lane, which are at a precise angle as to require backing out of them onto Balboa Ave -- which is a pretty busy street to be backing out onto, even if you didn\\'t have to dodge incoming patrons. I\\'d recommend avoiding the front parking spots and instead following the lane until it opens into a wider lot. If you\\'re worried about safety, though, you can always park alongside the building, which makes the distance between the door and your vehicle considerably shorter. \n\nAll said, I wouldn\\'t recommend this place unless you know exactly what you want and plan on spending ten minutes maximum getting it. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6tksc69lj9k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.154467,32.821691]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mmm, jacuzzi.","description":"Posted by Baby221<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_lodging_verD.gif\"> 2008 Harbor Drive North Oceanside, CAI know it was for friends\\' birthdays but we made sure to get to the room extra early to enjoy the amenities. It was a honeymoon suite, after all, complete with an absolutely delicious sunken whirlpool tub in front of a blazing fireplace, a king-sized bed, a fully-equipped kitchen, a chaise lounge, and a bathroom with see-through doors. I don\\'t think we were in there more than five minutes before we were naked and kissing and filling the tub to play in and make love in. I loved trailing my fingers through the droplets on your skin and fisting my hands in your hair as your mouth gave me all kinds of pleasure. I loved giving it all back to you, lip for lip, nibble for nibble, your skin newly clean and tasting very slightly of peaches. I never felt so beautiful, so cherished, as I did then with you.  <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6tksbyayl8r"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.397761,33.209795]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oh the terror!","description":"Posted by Baby221I\\'m sure you remember this one better than I do.

And then we were on, and strapped in, and the thing started to move -- and I started screaming. I don\\'t remember anything else until we were in the gift shop and you had pinned me to a wall, holding me, comforting me, trying to keep me from crying and trying not to laugh.

She was reluctant to let me go to the theatres alone with you, and spent at least fifteen minutes before we left explaining to me how much younger you were, how inappropriate it would be for us to be dating, how this was not -- in fact -- a date at all, and how she expected me to be on my best behaviour. \n\nBest behaviour indeed.\n\nI remember climbing to the very top of the theatre, head swimming with anticipation, and ducking down next to you in the cornermost seats. The theatre wasn\\'t empty, but it wasn\\'t full to bursting either, and as you draped your jacket over us and I snuggled closer against you I remember thinking that we were going to get away with it.\n\nWe didn\\'t, not entirely of course, since those damn giggling girls had to come and sit in the same aisle as us (though thankfully several seats down). We both knew they were giggling at us -- not that we let it stop us. Your hands between my thighs produced an absolutely wonderful, novel feeling that was utterly undimmed, and perhaps even a little enflamed, by our shameless amateur voyeurs. I remember trying to reciprocate and not quite knowing where to touch -- I was still a virgin then -- but I followed the heat of your body well enough. That first touch felt so alien; I didn\\'t know what to do with something so foreign. So I stopped trying to reciprocate and just let you explore. \n\nI can\\'t for the life of me remember anything of the movie save the title, but damned if it wasn\\'t worth it. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6tksc14ov2z"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.206142,32.830016]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sex Toys For A Passionate World","description":"Posted by Baby221<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> 7007 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CAThe best place to ever shop for adult tastes.
