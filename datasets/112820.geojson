In this image, Somalis wait for registration at a camp in Dadaab.</i>\nUNHCR / R. Gangale / May 2010<u><b>50,000 civilians flee Somalia in first quarter, double from a year earlier</b></u>\nGENEVA, April 29 (UNHCR) – The UN refugee agency said Friday that an increasing number of Somali civilians were fleeing their country amid the deteriorating security situation, with 50,000 arriving in neighbouring countries in the first quarter of this year compared to 23,000 in the same period in 2010.\n\"UNHCR is alarmed by the continuing deterioration of the situation in Somalia,\" the agency's chief spokesperson, Melissa Fleming, told journalists in Geneva. \"Kenya again received most of the new arrivals – more than 31,400. Virtually all of them have been registered by the Kenyan authorities and UNHCR in Dadaab refugee camp complex – on average some 10,000 a month,\" she added.\nUNHCR has also noted a sharp rise in the number of Somali refugees arriving in Ethiopia. \"We registered more than 12,200 Somalis crossing, mostly through the Dollo Ado corridor,\" Fleming said, adding that UNHCR was running two refugee camps there. \"Both camps are fast reaching their maximum capacity,\" she noted.\nThe majority of these refugees came from the Bay and Bakol regions of southern and central Somalia – two of the major conflict zones in the country. They all speak of a grim situation inside the country, marked by relentless violence and human rights abuses. Somali refugees told UNHCR staff about forced conscription by some of the warring parties and crippling drought.\nThe dire situation in Somalia is leaving no alternative for many, forcing them to take a desperate decision to cross the Gulf of Aden or the Red Sea to Yemen. Despite the risks involved, and despite the anti-government unrest in Yemen, more than 22,000 refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa arrived on Yemeni shores during the first three months of this year.\nThis is more than twice the number of arrivals during the first quarter of 2010, when some 9,400 people reached Yemen. It also topples the record-breaking first quarter of 2009, when nearly 17,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\nSimilar to 2010, Somalis continue to represent only every fourth arrival in Yemen, although their number doubled in comparison to the first quarter of 2010 (3,200 in 2010 to 6,000 in 2011). Ethiopian migrants, whose arrivals almost tripled (nearly 17,000 in 2011), continue to account for 75 per cent of all of the crossings.\n\"Some of the new arrivals told us that they were unaware of the political and social upheaval in Yemen, but many coming from Somalia said they had no other option but to flee. For these Somali refugees the situation in Yemen was still, by comparison, much safer than the one back home,\" Fleming said in Geneva.\nSomalia remains one of the countries generating the highest number of refugees and internally displaced people in the world. An estimated 1.4 million Somalis are displaced within the country while another 680,000 live overseas as refugees.","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/unhcr/5678741685/","id":"1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[40.291618,0.06492]}},{"properties":{"title":"Dignity (Part 2: Yemen)","guid":"tag:flickr.com,2004:/photo/5664554227","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/28 12:01:49 -0400","original":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 09:01:48 -0700","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/28 12:01:48 -0400"},"description":"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/anii579/\">anii579/ Ani</a> posted a photo:\n\t\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anii579/5664554227/\" title=\"Dignity (Part 2: Yemen)\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5103/5664554227_ddf6c77aa1_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Dignity (Part 2: Yemen)\"></a>\n\nDefinition in Wikipedia: Dignity is a term used in moral, ethical, and political discussions to signify that a being has an innate right to respect and ethical treatment.\nI uploaded and deleted this photo in Flickr for tens of times.

Hockstein / August 2009<u><b>Pressure grows at Dadaab complex amid fresh influx of Somali refugees</b></u>\nDADAAB, Kenya, July 1 (UNHCR) – As thousands of Somali refugees continue streaming across the border into Kenya, the mounting pressure on the sprawling Dadaab refugee complex saw violence erupt there this week.\nRioting broke out on Thursday when Kenyan police sought to disperse a crowd that was protesting against an attempt to demolish illegal structures around a food distribution point in Dadaab's Dagahley camp. Tear gas was used, and, later, live ammunition. UNHCR's information is that two refugees were killed and around a dozen injured.\nThe security situation was still being evaluated late Thursday. \"Sadly, this incident is symptomatic of the pressures at the camp amid overcrowding, compounded by the very high number of arrivals we have been seeing recently from Somalia,\" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said on Friday.\nMore than 61,000 Somalis have sought safety in Kenya this year, including 27,000 since June 6, bringing the total number of people living in Dadaab's three camps to more than 370,000. This makes it the world's largest refugee camp complex.\nThe new arrivals have reported to three new emergency centres to be registered and screened. About 1,300 are arriving every day, mainly farmers and cattle herders from Lower Juba and the town of Dhobley. Many have fled their homes because of severe drought and lack of food.\nUNHCR is concerned both at the overcrowding at Dadaab and the health of the new arrivals. \"The physical condition of these people is a matter of significant concern to us. Many families have walked for days, and are exhausted and desperate for food, water and other aid,\" said Fafa Olivier Attidzah, head of the UNHCR sub-office at Dadaab.\nOne of the new arrivals, 69-year-old Husane, said he and his family had to walk for more than three weeks to reach Kenya from their home in Soko, southern Somalia, where it has not rained for three years. \"Others are on their way because there is no food,\" he said, adding: \"I have lost all my livestock.\"\n\"Some of my children were crying for food but I told them to be patient. Let's keep walking, I told them, we'll get there,\" his wife, Mathina, said.\nUNHCR is working with the Kenyan authorities and other aid agencies to respond to the fresh influx. Malnutrition is a particular concern and all new arrivals are given high energy biscuits. Additional food and other aid is distributed after registration.\nFinding space for the refugees is becoming more and more difficult and growing numbers of refugees are settling outside the camp boundaries. A recent directive for government agencies to decongest the Dadaab camps has yet to be implemented. A new site, Ifo II, is now ready to receive refugees but official authorization to open the camp has yet to be granted.\nCurrently, more than 50,000 refugees, mostly women and children, are living in unregulated areas, some of which are vulnerable to seasonal floods. While UNHCR and its partners provide tents, latrines and water, many of the refugees have limited access to basic humanitarian services.\nNuria, a widow with six children, fled to Dadaab with money raised by the imam in her village. \"The journey was difficult. When we had run out of food and money we had to beg from people along the way,\" she said. She and her children were attacked by bandits and their belongings stolen.\nMeanwhile, Ethiopia has also seen a big influx, with 55,000 Somali refugees arriving since the start of this year. More than a quarter of them are malnourished, while among children this rate is higher at about three-in-five. UNHCR has introduced a blanket feeding programme for children below the age of five. Urgent funding is needed to deal with this situation.\nThe two existing camps in south-east Ethiopia, Bokolmanyo and Malkadida, accommodate more than 70,000 refugees and have reached full capacity. To provide protection and shelter for new arrivals, a third camp in the south-east was opened last Friday at Kobe, some 50 kilometres the town of Dollo Ado.\nUNHCR has transported 7,500 Somali refugees from the transit centre at Dollo Ado to the camp at Kobe, which can accommodate up to 20,000 people. However, there is significant congestion at the reception and transit centres and Kobe is expected to reach full capacity in a matter of days. The Ethiopian authorities have allocated land for a fourth camp near Kobe.\n\"Together with our partners we are rapidly expanding basic infrastructure, including water and sanitation services, a health centre and basic communal facilities.
