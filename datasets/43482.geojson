This is the most desolate place in America, during our drive we only saw one other car, which made this place even more creepy yet slightly beautiful.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41pvwcpfz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.05933,36.48314]}},{"properties":{"name":"Highway 1, California (10)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/coverphoto.jpg\">Destination 10. All I can say is \"Oh My God\", this is the most beautiful highway anyone can ever drive on in their life. On one side you have the California mountains and on the other is the Pacific Ocean. We we first got on Highway 1 it was really late at night around 2:00 am in complete darkness, yet after driving on it for a while we finally got to enjoy the spectacle of the sunrising and actually being able to see into the ocean.

At the time the U.S.A. was on a high alert status because of the September 11th attacks in New York and because this place was considered a risk area we were only able to see a little bit of the dam, but it was still pretty exciting. For the most part it\\'s just your average everyday dam yet the most exciting part of it was actually the history behind the magnificent human feature. If you have the time sit down and watch the video documentary that they show within the dam, it\\'s really interesting to see as how the developers tackled the construction of this concrete monstrosity that provides so much power to Nevada, California and Arizona.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41pvzlgqz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.73743,36.01592]}},{"properties":{"name":"Hot Springs, Arkansas  (1)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/bathhouse_row.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/gymnasium.jpg\">This was the first city that we visited during our road trip. The town is know for its natural hot springs which were used during the middle 1800\\'s up till the present day. It was a very interesting place to visit. ---After visiting all the spas within the town we ate at a Popeye\\'s chicken restaurant. I\\'m not exactly sure why it\\'s significant for me but it was one of the most prominent memories from my time in Hot Springs. Maybe it was because they serve really good chicken, who knows?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41ptvou9m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.05351,34.50344]}},{"properties":{"name":"In-N-Out Burger (10 &amp; 1/2)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Eating.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/in_n_out.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/In_Cali_At_the_In_N_Out.jpg\">Just a side note: If your ever in California, Nevada, or Arizona you HAVE to eat at an In-N-Out Burger. Their menu consist of 4 things total: hamburger, cheeseburger, fries and a drink. That may seem abnormally small but with the ability to ask for a 100x100 cheese burger (meaning you have 100 patties and 100 pieces of cheese) you simply have gone to hamburger heaven. Their hamburgers are DELICIOUS along with their fries and milkshakes. For all outsiders, In-N-Out has a bunch of secret menu orders that you can ask for.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41q5jycj8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.27333,34.26821]}},{"properties":{"name":"Las Vegas, Nevada (6)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/074_VegasTreasureIsland.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/las_vegas_strip_paris.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/bellagio.jpg\">6th destination on our trip and quite possible one of the best places on our trip. Unfortunately I was only 16 at the time, so their wasn\\'t really a whole lot of legal stuff that I could do. We did stay in the Treasure Island Hotel which was had a really cool feeling, but that really goes toward all the hotels that have a theme. Other than that it was just my family and I partaking in the family attractions like walking through the hotels and seeing what they have to offer.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41pxvjevx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.17281,36.12349]}},{"properties":{"name":"Las Vegas/Hollywood, California (11)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/217391590_1aa69d4577.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41q6q61uu"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.37769,34.0811]}},{"properties":{"name":"Luckenbach, Texas (13)","description":"Posted by RednightLast but not least was stop number 13. Another rather boring visit except this time we saw my dad\\'s uncle who strangely is about the same age as my dad. He lives in the desert too yet he won the lotto so he has a pretty cool house. Just a side note: He knows alot about making salsa and if one day he decided to bottle his recipe I\\'m sure he would sell millions.

The very first place we went to in Oklahoma City was the Oklahoma city bombing memorial museum, it was pretty depressing knowing that a over 100 people died at that very point. On some of the surrounding buildings you can actually see where shrapnel has been embedded into the concrete structure. What was really creepy was the fact that you are in a very large metropolitan area yet it has to be one of the most quietest places. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI\\'m not exactly sure why we my parents decided upon this but for some reason they drove to some random house in Oklahoma City that had about a million different pieces of framed artwork. It was really awkward because from the outside it just looks like someones house yet once you go inside it\\'s littered with pieces of art that is up for sale. It was just weird.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41q2nxw8y"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.51705,35.47325]}},{"properties":{"name":"Peoria, Nevada (12)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/bank707.jpg\"><a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41pyu1d26"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.26791,33.66435]}},{"properties":{"name":"San Francisco, California (9)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/san_francisco.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/tb_san_francisco_usa.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/Alcatraz_Abv.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/california_sanfran_fishermanswharf.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/KUL_preparations_for_Chinatown_night_market_b.jpg\">Our 9th destination on our road trip. We really only went up to San Francisco because my Aunt and Uncle moved up there. So while we were up there, my aunt and uncle drove us around the city and showed us the cites. I knew San Fran. was hilly but I never imagined at how large some of those hills really were, it was pretty incredible to think that a massive city was built there. While there we also checked out Alcatraz which was a really cool experience, I really wish they let you explore the whole building because that would have been really awesome but they didn\\'t. We also hit up Fisherman\\'s Wharf and Chinatown which each brought a unique feeling to the city.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41pv1lyde"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.3877,37.83148]}},{"properties":{"name":"Santa Fe, New Mexico (3)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/SW_Trip_015.jpg\">This was our third official location we stopped on during our road trip. Although we didn\\'t really spend a whole lot of time here like our other locations, I guess the biggest attraction that we saw was the Chapel of San Miguel, which is the oldest church in Santa Fe. Other than that we really didn\\'t see much else.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41ptpyya6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.93815,35.68357]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yavapai Observation Station, Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona (4)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/grand_canyon_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/749.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\">Â This was our 4th destination on our trip. Man, this place is amazing, literally for miles all it is is desert except for this \"scar\" on the earth\\'s surface. We went to a bunch of lookouts throughout the park but the most remarkable one was the Yavapai Observation Station. On the bottom floor  of the building were some artifacts found within the park from the ancient indians living there, but the top floor was the best part. A 360Â° view of the Grand Canyon, it was a jaw-dropping view.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41pw40ma9"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.13704,36.05838]}},{"properties":{"name":"Yosemite National Park, California (8)","description":"Posted by Rednight<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/elcap_optimized.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\">Â Destination number 8. I\\'ve been to alot of national parks throughout the U.S. and by far this was the best one I have ever been to. Although I didn\\'t get to physically hike and camp within Yosemite we did drive to some pretty remote places and get out and hike a couple miles to some really extraordinary places. It was definitely an amazing place to visit. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6p41q3r7eyl"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.60815,37.8228]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/245032","metadata":null,"contact_name":"rednight","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:rednight","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/245032","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":null,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=245032,platial:user=rednight","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":43482}
