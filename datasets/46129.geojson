My little brother Zane was born there and shortly after his birth we moved to Las Vegas. Most of my embarrasing child photos for some reason come from when I lived in Albuquerque. Also, the Navajo Indians would have a yearly celebration and I\\'d always join in with the dancing and whatnot.

It was not a very nice move and people weren\\'t too open toward a girl from Vegas. After a year living there, everything fell into place. The environment is gorgeous. We have all four seasons. We are on the water, near a superb mountain for skiing and snowboarding (it has the world record for the most snowfall in the year), close enough to Seattle and Vancouver. Bellingham is mostly retired folks and hippies. I think it is like #3 for best places to retire... so keep that in mind.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642ct7iksya"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.449113,48.707438]}},{"properties":{"name":"Canada Eh?","description":"Posted by Hesterdingle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/484890183203_0_ALB.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/Copy_(2)_of_RugbyMeRenee.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/nicetry.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/258700841_l.jpg\">vancouver canadaSince I was so close to Canada I would take day trips up to explore and eat really good vietnamese food.

My dad was a ski bum until he was 21 while my mom went to college. They met while working at the Green Mountain Inn. My parents designed and built the house and it was in the middle of a forest. I lived there for two years and my parents decided the house was too small since my sister was on the way.

We planned to live there for only 3 years but we ended up living there for 10 years. I went to public schools until my freshman year of high school where I attended a magnet performing arts school. For the first time whites were the minority race in the school. A month into school I was shipped up to Bellingham, WA. There is nothing to do in Vegas when you are underage besides swimming, walking around in air conditioned stores/malls, watching movies, and just staying inside since the temperature reaches the 120s. The city is owned and run by Mormons and a lot of the jobs are held by Mexican immigrants.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a642ctkg9kjm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.103492,36.04792]}},{"properties":{"name":"Where the name comes from","description":"Posted by Hesterdingle<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/09/3/DCP_1900.jpg\">dingle irelandMy dad is a full blood Irish man.
