The whites, however, claimed the treaty was a &quot;solemn obligation&quot; and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war.[9]","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"Id":{"max":0,"min":0,"median":0}},"features":[{"properties":{"Id":0,"id":"a64ueyz6em1u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-98.5081765525763,42.9994879601969],[-98.7685902576545,42.9971715299152],[-99.1590304114198,42.9953709749831],[-100.567047831242,42.9969439192321],[-102.580171473193,42.99548385484],[-104.049820959449,43.0002698128379],[-104.041162414317,45.9382463374404],[-100.973697828031,45.9442979396241],[-100.700293568037,45.939937501402],[-100.498291961278,45.9489938530259],[-100.424996432125,45.8921472179249],[-100.396560221897,45.8757460046964],[-100.38111548814,45.8584776469143],[-100.37991147227,45.8251412789261],[-100.356030778584,45.7784004950349],[-100.344688581952,45.7599070338249],[-100.322260729141,45.7319425992145],[-100.308384264143,45.7084869018037],[-100.310700521291,45.6808422273528],[-100.33988974233,45.6629679952882],[-100.383717960064,45.6592032669397],[-100.407352142443,45.6483683846963],[-100.421136037234,45.6145252834933],[-100.448699113378,45.5706933954856],[-100.48079158114,45.5590678553434],[-100.48492307702,45.5321849859413],[-100.457793005247,45.5137696019128],[-100.419447641742,45.5122351789584],[-100.380935393426,45.5127615533616],[-100.352810410043,45.4949741725981],[-100.327622065352,45.4419312562951],[-100.311619098491,45.4305130705073],[-100.292154416681,45.406489652631],[-100.273687261384,45.3800653253868],[-100.280319310703,45.3595347889565],[-100.295306992171,45.3448972142364],[-100.312703597991,45.3248086462178],[-100.31004181714,45.3094418094297],[-100.30179170967,45.2903770626003],[-100.284335718413,45.2757857287601],[-100.264039150018,45.2600333918637],[-100.256788850395,45.2410068460375],[-100.262025933744,45.2252737879101],[-100.27122813557,45.2090115706697],[-100.272373166497,45.1833988404079],[-100.280868875416,45.1518490251461],[-100.302680301421,45.1250093393294],[-100.326083245394,45.1023918579954],[-100.323762492774,45.0828779794544],[-100.313979872919,45.0588962716688],[-100.29457989914,45.0449198435302],[-100.276392015756,45.0282162306066],[-100.28406783637,45.0181312661936],[-100.305677030784,45.0169429631602],[-100.327753146994,45.0220114310233],[-100.359301074772,45.0309293540216],[-100.384535630859,45.0333412413169],[-100.399183378421,45.0214500731059],[-100.416969580245,45.0069091556044],[-100.427503458363,44.9851394073488],[-100.418223958071,44.9626285588366],[-100.41482662231,44.9235994736626],[-100.405247821384,44.8968594757023],[-100.392009524103,44.8671965774431],[-100.402943556209,44.8523804360121],[-100.423478416351,44.8393362534657],[-100.444593539331,44.8311662827862],[-100.479089940868,44.8138144756847],[-100.546850179665,44.7505829160061],[-100.605023656071,44.6893223452188],[-100.571749241916,44.6093920915332],[-100.478978522482,44.5888980728394],[-100.474623908545,44.5437865660559],[-100.50853559253,44.5114238232833],[-100.411639985254,44.4457733017956],[-100.390836886876,44.4112296596692],[-100.336356209521,44.3450297546469],[-99.967617676527,44.2692824684711],[-99.9071978186466,44.2655967782904],[-99.8910635223431,44.2428525151032],[-99.7882564147594,44.2401977939512],[-99.7858451567431,44.2831300893729],[-99.4221857950265,44.2829174530636],[-99.4220900726979,44.2398707244608],[-99.2992785250141,44.2427971226777],[-99.3021356530069,44.1988973247835],[-99.286904411426,44.1981340986488],[-99.2883743522071,44.1111232293893],[-99.2468015996383,44.1100312897308],[-99.2470411375224,44.0790133028747],[-99.1066170841818,44.0808401036472],[-99.1098244163337,43.9368674249681],[-99.3577226100615,43.9374076179107],[-99.3159299785516,43.8571155059478],[-99.3680944223403,43.7979169627633],[-99.4273439587208,43.7446579491244],[-99.4551422141246,43.6954586559842],[-99.428467557043,43.6492193459462],[-99.356189792333,43.5951072291539],[-99.3184701565223,43.5033571850649],[-99.1806331183717,43.4121443377636],[-99.0738326671554,43.3223839921071],[-98.9373336080943,43.2253318740893],[-98.8083318015463,43.1341424306],[-98.6991156082973,43.0776051135746],[-98.6006674631546,43.0665029646163],[-98.5081765525763,42.9994879601969]]]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.villageearth.org","metadata":"http://www.villageearth.org","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Treaty of 1868","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.villageearth.org","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":1,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2010-10-01T18:43:12Z","id":65354}
