To measure the least racially diverse cities we used the percentage of white population. I was able to successfully geocode 77 of the Top 100 Cities, so thats what you get in this dataset. I've also added a field for an inverse ranking, this gives a higher value to the highest ranked cities. for example, the whitest city is ranked #1, this would assign a value of 100 to that city, making it the hottest city on the map.
