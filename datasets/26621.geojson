(Only unlike Pancho Villa, there’s no security guard / doorperson on hand here.) So what sets El Tepa apart?

But it’s a classy kind of ultramega. Tiled floors, towering archways, and vaulted ceilings lend an air of Latin American elegance.

Today, La Fajita sports the same look, menu, and sky-high prices as its boneheaded predecessor, yet some significant improvements have taken root, as far as their burritos are concerned. Word to the wise: unless you’ve just completed your ninth year of pre-school, kindly let them know you’re capable of holding an entire burrito. Otherwise, it will arrive cut in half.

The catch? None really, unless you’re one of those picky music types who can’t bear having to hear Foreigner and Sheena Easton while you chew your food. Request a foil wrap, or be foiled yourself.

El Norteño, this dancehall-sized Bayview burrito shop underwent a name change in the summer of 2006. New management slapped a really yellow coat of paint on the front of the building and ditched the previous proprietor’s awesome sign that featured a hat-clad, taco-munchin’, Corona-swillin’, boot-wearin’ horse; disturbingly, they retained El Norteño’s lo-carb / hi-silliness “burrito” that employs lettuce (rather than a tortilla) as its outer wrap.

It probably has something to do with the counter (not table) ordering and the four or five burrito options on the menu.

Papalote has become a quietly infallible kingpin of the Mission’s vaunted taqueria scene – slightly off the beaten path, humbly sized, family operated, and pretty much a sure thing every time. Pancho Villa may have the security guard and the gymnasium-size dining hall, La Taqueria may have the tacky neon sign proclaiming its burritos the greatest things since sliced sesos, and Taq.

Whereas this storefront’s former tenant, Tango 20!, bludgeoned the consumer with giant-sized prices, kid-sized portions, lentils, and daal, Papalote’s creative take on traditional taqueria menu items boasts considerably wider appeal. Top-shelf ingredients and an unassailably delicious salsa recipe - available for an exorbitant fee to any willing moneybags - pack customers into three small tables and a long dining counter.

It’s in an underground food court, about a 30-second walk from an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch shop. It looks and feels a bit too fast-foody for its own good. And it\\'s brash enough to offer something called “Street Burritos” – these mini-slabs don’t wear big pants and say “hella” a lot, but rather, they’re billed as Rubio’s paean to lo-fi, mobile food vendors.

As if Salsa Taq.’s tremendous outer murals portraying dancing, mustachioed vegetables and sash-wearing Mexican entrees aren’t enough, a look around the interior of this homey, corner foodspot reveals florid décor and an inordinately spotless sheen. Certain menu copies indicate Salsa’s street address as 1198 Meats St., and we’re not kidding. Best of all, their yellow “Grand Opening” banner from 2002 remains fully intact over the doorway.

It’s up for debate as to which is more colorful: its décor or its clientele. And that sure is one deafening jukebox they have here. Be sure to have a beverage at the ready as you slather their sub-mediocre chips with some of the most ferocious green tomatillo salsa in town. No carnitas for you! Breakfast available, though.

First there was Taq. La Trampa, which delivered solidly on our sole visit in the summer of ’03. A couple years later, the Taq. El Charro team moved in, upped the slabular quality even more, and printed up cheeky take-out menus featuring the once-in-a-lifetime offer, \"Buy One Super Burrito and the Agua Is Free.\" By late 2005, established neighbor Taq. Castillo decided to corner the market on burrito shops lining the fringe of the Tenderloin by opening a second branch here at 10 Mason, to a chorus of Bronx cheers from our judges panel. But what chafes us more than anything is that we can’t make any more coy references on this page to the ultimate entertainer, Charo.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j97svn9vna"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.40906,37.78377]}},{"properties":{"name":"Taq.

Chile Verde does indeed serve the foil-wrapped blimps-o’-the-gods. More yellow walls inside a taqueria you will never find, and dig those crazy mirrored posts.

It’s our favorite among all the area El Balazos, and not just for its inviting, two-tier layout and the miniature flag on a toothpick that punctures each foiled slab.

But dreams like this come true daily at this overlooked El Balazo location, set inside Showplace Square Car Wash. For what it’s worth, no taqueria in town forges a woozier union of delicious guacamole, car-vacs, massive bass thump, and cell-totin’ playaz decked out in camo fatigues and team jerseys. Save the super sudsy asada jokes - they’ve already been made - and be sure to keep the particularly bold pigeons away from your lunch.

Public opinion tends to favor this location over the other two El Castillitos around town; we’ll go along with that.

The narrow aisle here can make taking/keeping your place in line more tense than it really needs to be, and things can get colorful when all the neighborhood gangstas roll through to get their late-night slab on.

Give them a call to check on their completely amorphous business hours – perhaps they’ll pick up the phone after 12 rings. If they put you on hold, maybe they’ll remember to pick back up five minutes later (if they haven’t already hung up). If they tell you they open at 5:00 PM, there’s a good chance they’re just putting you on. If you make it in the door, feel free to choose anything from the menu - but if it’s a burrito, don’t be surprised if the person in front of you with the big take-out order accidentally ends up with your slab. And considering the tag-team production process they employ at high-traffic times, it’s a crapshoot as to whether you’ll get what you actually ordered. But the true moneyshot?

Guadalajara enjoys brisk business from neighborhood families and anyone else in search of the real Excelsior deal. Furthermore, it boasts an unbeatable roster of quarter-fed toy vendors, including <em>Golden Bling!</em>, <em>Homies (Series #6)</em>, and a nameless machine that traffics exclusively in messianic stickers and decals. In other news, Guadalajara’s ultra-scorching habañero salsa has reportedly claimed several fatalities over the years.

It’s never okay to play Spandau Ballet or Chicago at a taqueria.)

New management assumed control about a year later, gave it new multiple names, and upped the quality significantly. Then, in mid-2005, local heavyweight Taq. Can-cún took over - but interestingly, left the name(s) alone. The strangest twist came when, in typically classy taqueria style, the Can-cún brass hoisted their own familiar menu behind the counter, scrawled “Reina’s” on a rectangular piece of paper, slapped it over the menu header, and congratulated themselves for saving a few bucks.

San Francisco that’s a byproduct of not only the friendly guys who run it, but also of the belching tuba-pop oozing from the jukebox and, most obviously, their top-shelf burritos. This is a place that once put a handwritten note on the wall apologizing for a 25-cent price hike.

You’re on your own after that. Breakfast available. Closed evenings, although on game nights they’re open until just after first pitch.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6j97so1qd9x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.393231392,37.7786014651]}},{"properties":{"name":"Zona Rosa","description":"Posted by Burritoeater<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/3/152_zona_rosa.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> Despite relatively rich prices, this corner joint has maintained a devout following through the years. There’s a good chance on any given visit you may end up sitting adjacent to someone who’s certifiably insane, but the honorable quality of Zona Rosa’s burritowork makes the inevitable crapshoot worth it.
