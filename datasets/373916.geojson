Coming back, on my bike, I didn't want to ride down the hillside to Yellowstone so I rode to Jackson near the Academy of Hair Design and had to cross Yellowstone Hwy. to get home.  I waited probably 5 minutes to cross the trail to the east side of Jackson, then another 5 - 10 minutes waiting to cross north on Yellowstone...and I was afraid I would become a hood ornament.  It was scary.  There is NO safe connection to North Casper.
