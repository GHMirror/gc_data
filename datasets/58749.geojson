On April 24 it was found that the wellhead was damaged and was leaking oil into the Gulf. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry has described it as \"a very serious spill,\" leaking as many as 5,000 barrels of oil a day, or 210,000 gallons into the Gulf. Such a significant spill poses a serious threat to wildlife, affecting as many as 400 species all along the coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.
