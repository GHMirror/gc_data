The Anacostia Tributary Trail System, a link in the national shore-to-shore American Discovery Trail, provides miles of uninterrupted trails along the tributaries of the Anacostia River. The southernmost point of the trail is located at Colmar Manor Community Park, and trail spurs extend northeasterly and northwesterly from there along beautiful stream valley parkland. The trail system\\'s continuous greenway traverses a variety of natural environments including woodlands, open fields, and wetlands.\n\nThe trail affords ample opportunities for fishing, bird watching, hiking, biking, jogging, horseback riding, and in-line skating. Sites along the Anacostia Tributary Trail System worth a stop include College Park Airport, College Park Aviation Museum, Ellen Linson Swimming Pool, Herbert Wells Ice Rink, Lake Artemesia, Adelphi Mill, College Park Community Center, Paint Branch Golf Course, the 94th Aero Squadron Restaurant, and many local neighborhood and community parks. The flat, barrier-free trail system is designed for a wide variety of users, and a signage system with mile markers assists with location awareness. The trail system links several neighborhoods to Metro stations, but commuters needing to travel at speeds greater than 12 miles per hour should consider alternative routes.\n\n     Proposed Bike Trail\n\n    The Anacostia Watershed Society has been working to increase recreational access for the public to the Anacostia River, as a way to draw attention to this under-appreciated resource.  We have been working to help create a bicycle link from Bladensburg, where the 21-mile Anacostia Headwaters Bicycle Trail ends, down into DC to the national Mall and downtown, as a way for local citizens to gain recreational access to the extensive trail network that currently exists, and as an effective bicycle commuter route.  This is an excellent opportunity to create linkages between DC and MD, and with the newly formed Anacostia Trails Heritage Area.\n\n    The District of Columbia is actively planning their portion of the trail, but only up to the border with Maryland at the New York Ave./ Rte., 50 bridge. The crucial link that is needed to connect the DC portion of the trail with the existing Maryland trails is a 7,000 foot linear segment from the Bladensburg Waterfront Park to the DC border. We estimate that this segment will cost 0 per linear foot, bringing that to 80,000 for the trail. Two bridges will be needed to cross over two existing streams, and they will cost 20,000. To cover the costs of the design work for the trail and the bridges, we estimate we will need 0,000, bringing the total for the entire project to 00,000.\n\n    We have been working closely with the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission on this project, since they are the majority land owners. They are fully supportive of this trail, but have let it be known that they are not in the position to assume another project at this time due to their already full work load. They have indicated their support for having the Anacostia Watershed Society manage this project, and have offered the services of one of their key planners to help with the engineering details for this trail.

Incorporated in 1989, AWS was founded with a vision of this “forgotten river” attaining the status of swimmable and fishable.\n\nThrough volunteer restoration activities, residents of the Anacostia watershed have been provided with an opportunity to get involved; they have invested their time in a cause, actively working for a positive change. AWS also provides advocacy and coalition building skills to emerging as well as established grass roots organizations within the Anacostia River communities. By assisting local groups, partnerships are formed and efforts to protect the local environment as well as focus decision makers are strengthened.\n\nSince its inception in 1989, AWS has mobilized over 30,000 volunteers who have planted over 11,300 trees and stenciled 1,008 storm-drains within the watershed as well as removed 458 tons of debris and over 7,500 tires from the watershed. Furthermore, AWS has educated 14,535 people with its slide presentation which explains the river’s history and the current threats it faces, as well as the different lifestyle choices and changes citizens can undertake to improve the condition of the watershed. In addition to these education and restoration events, AWS has introduced 8,200 people, of which 4,500 were children, to the river through paddling clinics, canoe adventures and pontoon boat tours along the “Kingfisher Canoe Trail,” a scenic five-mile stretch of the Anacostia River. All AWS programs teach citizens that they are integral participants in the restoration and preservation of this urban river.\n\nThe fruit of AWS\\' educational and grass roots organizing efforts is to develop an enlightened community of citizen stakeholders who are aware of their connection to the natural world and who work to promote the healing of the Anacostia River and its watershed communities. It seems that urban children, often residing in neighborhoods similar to many of those in the Anacostia watershed, have limited opportunities and sometimes turn to unhealthy or dysfunctional activities to fill their time. They have little or no regular contact with the natural world and are consequently insulated from the beauty and character-forming influences that can be found in nature. AWS’ work with urban children assists in the development of an informed and empowered generation of young people. The students are made aware of their connection to the natural world and thus begin to work to promote the healing of themselves as well as the river.\n\nAWS receives 48% of its funding from foundation grants, 20% from federal grants, 23% from cash contributions and 9% from miscellaneous contributions. The key to the Anacostia Watershed Society’s success is its large and growing network of citizen volunteers.\n\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a698ncjgn6lm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.941204,38.940886]}},{"properties":{"name":"Bladensburg High School - 2005 - 0 million","description":"Posted by Rufusl<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 4200 57th Ave., Baldensburg, MD 20712\nMission Statement\n\nThe mission of Bladensburg High School is to ensure that all students acquire knowledge and develop skills and understandings that will enable them to be productive citizens and life-long learners and to prepare them to excel in an information-based, technologically driven society.\n \nTo achieve this mission we are committed to:\n\n    * strong instructional leadership,\n    * high expectations for success for all students,\n    * an emphasis on teaching for learning,\n    * a safe and orderly school environment,\n    * frequent monitoring of students\\' progress with appropriate instructional adjustments,\n    * high levels of accountability,\n    * responsive support services, and\n    *\n\n      extensive and meaningful parent and community involvement.\n\n      Top of Page\n\n \n\nOUR ALMA MATER\n \nBladensburg, all hail to thee.\nThy name we praise.\nBlessed be thy memories\nThrough all our days.\nPure white and scarlet hue\nSeen from below.\nBladensburg all hail to thee,\nBladensburg, my own.\n\nTop of Page\n\nA Historical Review of Bladensburg High School and Its Principals\n\n    * 1770 - James Hart opened the first Early Learning Academy in Bladensburg.\n    * 1795 - The Reverend Samuel Knox, pastor of the Presbyterian Church, supervised the school (acting like the principal).

Rapid advances in research, education, and service have propelled the University into the top tier, and we are now ranked 17th among national public research universities according to the U.S. News &amp; World Report. This year, the University of Maryland received approximately 52 million in direct research funding. On average, each faculty member brings in 45,540 in research funds each year.\n\nThe University of Maryland\\'s close proximity to Washington, D.C., grants us the opportunity to interact closely with nearby federal research agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). As a result, the University is able to work closely with government researchers and the policy-makers who guide federal research initiatives. Much of our research funding comes from federal sources, and the collaboration between the University and the federal government has enabled the Campus to participate in a variety of incredibly important scientific areas, including food safety, secure wireless communications, nanotechnology and biotechnology, homeland security, and transportation safety. Our faculty researchers also work with the State of Maryland, and the work that they do significantly impacts the economic life of the State and the surrounding region. The creation of a new research park, the 128-acre University of Maryland Enterprise Campus (also known as M Square), has already had significant impact on the University\\'s ability to attract new research activities and businesses to the area. Private funding is also central to our research programs, and many large corporations use the University\\'s broad expertise in science, engineering and business to design and build better models and products for consumers and industry.\n\nThe momentum of recent years has poised the University of Maryland to take leadership in shaping the research university of the 21st century. By virtually every measure of quality, the University of Maryland has gained national recognition as one of the fastest rising comprehensive research institutions in the country. It is, indeed, a very exciting place to be. You are cordially invited to visit the College Park campus.

City \nofficials expect the two projects to set off a wave of \nredevelopment along the Route 1 Corridor, which has \nalso been the focal point of planning since the area \nwas designated by the state as an Arts &amp; Entertain- \nment District and a Community Legacy Area. \nHyattsville hopes to transform the area into a vibrant \ncommercial and residential downtown.  The City’s \ndevelopment standards call for pedestrian-friendly \ndesign to support alternative transportation choices, \nincluding bus service to nearby Metro and MARC rail \nstations.  Another City priority is a hiker/biker trail that \nwould connect residents to the University of Maryland. \nIn designating Hyattsville’s Route 1 corridor as a \nPriority Place, the State will leverage substantial \nprivate investment.  HIP, which specializes in \nworkforce housing, is working with the City and for- \nprofit partners on a 5 million redevelopment called \nRenaissance Square that will have rental apartments, \ncondominiums and a YMCA.
