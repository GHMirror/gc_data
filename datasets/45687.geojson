Vick is known for his 360 degree spin, forward/back flip, and his stiff arm; it was because of his spectacular moves on the field that caught my eye and has had me hook for years. The Virginia Tech quarterback is not the only Vick in the family that is doing big things. Little brother Marcus Vick followed in his footsteps to be two of the best quarterback at VA Tech. And at this time I will like to take a moment and say that my thoughts and prayers go out to those that lost their lives in this recent tragedy. I also would like to note that Michael Vick has teamed up with the United Way to donate 0,000 to assist families affected by the massacre at Virginia Tech.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6edpthaf44k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.388056,33.748889]}},{"properties":{"name":"Heniz field","description":"Posted by Dcrutch2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/steelers.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/pitt.jpg\">pittsburgh pa My dad is a huge Pittsburgh Steelers fan and it is because of his love for the Steelers, that I have become a fan also.

I have followed the team since they were the Memphis Oilers. I have seen the team go from losing the super bowl by inches, from countless losing seasons, until to now. The Titans are a young up and coming team under the leadership of Vince Young. I believe that with his leadership next season we go all the way.

Every since Donavan McNabb became an Eagles I have been following the team. I love his determination on and off the field, and you have to love his Campbell’s Soup commercials. They the best. \nThis season I can say that I really did watch the team more because of the new addition to their team, Omar Gaither, an outstanding rookie from the University of Tennessee, and hopefully the Eagles can be just successful as they were last season.   \n\nFormer Tennessee Volunteers:\nOmar Gaither \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6edptsrjkuh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.167427,39.900848]}},{"properties":{"name":"Monster Park (Formerly Candlestick Park)","description":"Posted by Dcrutch2<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/49ers.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/3/stade_49ers_int.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 602 Jamestown Ave, San Francisco, CAI recently became a San Francisco 49ers fan this season; this is because of a recent addition or player to their team, Parys Haralson.
