This popular holiday town is surrounded by a sunbathed peninsula and the refreshing waters of the Indian Ocean. It is a busy summer destination as well as an ideal winter retreat. It is blessed with a mild climate all-year round but its most important feature is its status as the historical capital of the Garden Route.\nWell-traveled pleasure boats dock regularly as well as other international seafarers using the modern docking facilities. Mossel Bay is a rapidly growing tourist destination as more and more travelers are discovering the Jewel of the Cape Garden Route. Bortholomeu Dias CrossBack in 1488 a man called Bartholomew Dias threw anchor in the Bay of St Blaize. \"Aguada de Sào Bras\" as it was originally known. This town was then developed as a busy export harbour for wool, ochre and ostrich feathers. The many beautiful historical buildings in the town is evidence of the long ago happenings which the town as it is today. In 1601 the Dutch navigator, Paulus van Caerden, renamed it Mossel Bay, as he found that mussels were a most welcome addition to the diet of his crew. Today, mussels gathered in Mossel Bay each spring are rated by gourmets among the finest in the world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ngxl20tks0"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.10449,-34.19817]}},{"properties":{"name":"Natural Bridge Caverns, TX","description":"Posted by Jintexas<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/NaturalBridgeCavernSatpic.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/CavernsInterior2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/0/CavernsMap2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> 26495 Natural Bridge Cavern Rd, Natural Bridge Caverns, TX 78266(Passage from website) In March of 1960, four college students from St. Mary’s University in San Antonio obtained permission to explore the area that is now Natural Bridge Caverns. The students were convinced that large underground passages existed under the amazing 60-foot limestone bridge. On their fourth expedition, Orion Knox Jr., one of the discoverers, felt a cool draft from a rubble-filled crawlway. Such air currents often indicate the presence of additional rooms or passages.\n\nThe explorers made their way carefully climbing and crawling through two miles of vast cavern passage. After making this amazing discovery, they returned to the surface to tell the landowners. The discoverers knew immediately what an astonishing find they had made and the land owners decided to develop the first ½ mile, the most spectacular part of the caverns, for the enjoyment of guests from around the world. That first ½ mile is now the North Cavern Tour. Natural Bridge Caverns’ North Cavern Tour was developed with two main goals in mind: preservation of the cavern environment and comfort of its guests. The result is one of the world’s premier show caverns. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ngxkum5pla"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.310196,29.709791]}},{"properties":{"name":"Normanton, Queensland, Australia","description":"Posted by Jintexas<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/04/1/Normanton_3_.jpg\">Normanton (17°40′S 141°04′E) is a small cattle town in the north of the state of Queensland, Australia, just south of the Gulf of Carpentaria, on the Norman River. The town\\'s population is 1447, over half of whom are indigenous Australians (2001 census). The town is one terminus of the isolated Normanton - Croydon Railway, which was built during gold rush days in the 1890s. The Gulflander motor train operates once a week. The shire is the administrative centre of Carpentaria Shire Council.\n\nAmong Normanton\\'s most notable features is a statue of a 8.64m long salt water crocodile, the largest ever shot.

These dunes are static, held in position by vegetation, and vary in size from 3 metres in the west to around 30 metres on the eastern side. The most famous dune, Nappanerica, or, more popularly, Big Red (named by Simpson traveller Dennis Bartell), is 40 metres in height.\nThe southern edge of the desert is bordered by Lake Eyre, to the west stony tablelands and the rivers of the Finke, Macumba, Sevenson and Todd Rivers, to the north the Plenty Highway, and to the east the rivers of the Diamantina, Georgina, Warburton and Goyder\\'s Lagoon. Witjira National Park is on the western boundary, Simpson Desert National Park on the eastern. The original inhabitants were Wangkangurru Aboriginal people who lived at wells called Mikiri. The main tracks across the Simpson Desert are the French Line, the Rig Road, the WAA Line and the QAA Line. These lines were built by oil exploration teams. The most popular trek through the Simpson Desert is from Oodnadatta to Birdsville.\nWhilst the desert has a uniform topography and a severe climate - from below freezing on winter nights to temperatures reaching into the sixty deegree celcius range in summer, it is a place of extraordinary beauty and a great diversity of flora and fauna.\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ngxl0mtm1m"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[138.16406,-25.99755]}},{"properties":{"name":"Thiruvananthapuram","description":"Posted by Jintexas<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/India1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/India2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/1/India3.jpg\">It\\'s really Thiruvananthapuram - they shortened it\n\nThiruvananthapuram is one of the most beautiful cities in India, known as The City Of Holy Serpent- the holy serpent on which Lord Vishnu reclines.\n \nThiruvananthapuram is an ancient city, with roots going back to 1000 BC.\n \nThiruvananthapuram was also the centre of India\\'s space program.

Yuma is reported to be the third fastest growing area in the US. Despite the  proximity to lots of desert, dunes etc., it\\'s actually a very pleasant place, with a great climate year round. A little heat for a while in the summer, but the rest is easy to live with. It\\'s also ranked in the top 10 golf destinations in the US, and is one of only two places west of the Mississippi to be declared by Congress as a National Heritage Area\n\nI passed through Yuma just after New Year 2007 on a road trip from San Antonio TX  to San Diego CA, up to Desert Springs CA, then over to Nogales AZ, and back to San Antonio.\n\nLocated at the point where the Gila and Colorado Rivers converge, Yuma originated as a major transportation hub, as goods came from the west coast and were shipped up river. Since prehistoric times, Yuma has been the best site for crossing the Colorado River - Spanish conquistadors traveled this route in the 1500\\'s and the only Ocean to Ocean bridge was constructed here in 1920, linking the Eastern U.S. and the West Coast. \n\nYuma\\'s access to the Colorado River is a great asset to this desert community. Yuma has perpetual rights to the water derived from the Colorado River, and uses only about 50% of its allocation. This abundant, inexpensive water supply is much coveted by the water poor areas of Las Vegas, NV, and California.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ngxkuum5co"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.68079,32.73184]}},{"properties":{"name":"houston","description":"Posted by Jintexas<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/170/388707923_7ad7d620c9_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/164/388637127_63bb22956a_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/127/388635626_8220bd2114_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/148/387269028_fab06a3c0b_o.jpg\">houston<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ngxkwouj3p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.369416,29.760828]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237840","metadata":null,"contact_name":"jintexas","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:jintexas","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237840","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":15,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237840,platial:user=jintexas","published":"2010-04-26T16:00:00Z","id":44863}
