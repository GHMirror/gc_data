On the eastern side of the cove you will find an extra: a miniature cove with a beach - perfect for couples or families.

You can reach it by boat, or you can take the walking path which descends from the village down to the beach. (It takes about half an hour to get down, and more than an hour to get up again, it\\'s quite steep!) Apart from the fact that the place is becoming popular for tourist boats and ships, this beach is near-perfect.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a696ylak3q6x"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.321612,44.885979]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meli","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/meli1.jpg\">Beatiful hidden beach on Cres island, probably my favourite. If you want to get there, turn east from the main road 7km north of Osor, near the bus stop, where the sign on the opposite side of the road points west for the village Ustrine. From there, a bad macadam road goes through villages Srem and Plat. Important: There are many gates on that road that keep the sheep confined; after you open them and pass through, make sure to close them again in order to prevent the sheep running away and getting lost. After you reach the village Plat, you have to continue on foot for about half an hour. The path will lead you to a tiny harbour. Follow the path for the additional 30m and the hidden Meli lagoon will appear. The beach is truly beautiful, so keep it preserved and clean!<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a696yll7acnf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.473543,44.740142]}},{"properties":{"name":"Meli nr Punta Kriza","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/07/0/Meli_PuntaKriza.jpg\">In the Punta Kriza village take the road to the left just before the small church. When you reach the sea, proceed right on the macadam road. After 3km or so you\\'ll find plenty space to park on a straight section of the road. From there take one of the forest paths on the right that lead to the nearby sandy coves. The coves form a beautiful sandy shallow lagoon, perfect for children, nudists and having fun in the sea.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a696ylfkan80"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.528561,44.628474]}},{"properties":{"name":"Milna","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/3/milna250.jpg\">Milna bay has a beach which is not bad at all, but the fact that it\\'s just under the road somewhat ruins the experience plus it gets crowded easily.

Near the beach there is San Marino hotels village and the biggest camping on the island, as well as many private apartments to rent. Sandy shallow waters are long and it takes about 500m until the sea comes half the waist of an adult.

Clear water and the fact that it\\'s not too popular make it one of the best. You can get food and drinks there too. To get there take a boat trip from the island of Vis which will also take you to the famous Blue cave on the other side of Bisevo.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a696ylm9rhms"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.00468,42.98255]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pupnatska luka","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/lukpup1.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/08/2/lukpup2.JPG\">This beach is quite popular for those who don\\'t mind the bad roads which lead to it. (When you come from the Pupnat village, do not take the eastern macadam road down to the cove, since the western one is much better.) The beach is quite big and made of pebbles and round stones of all sizes. There\\'s a small bar down on the beach. I guess when the roads get better, this beach could get really crowded.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a696ylnpk1fg"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[17.002577,42.927968]}},{"properties":{"name":"Rucica","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/P8020272.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/06/2/P8020277.JPG\">A hidden beach near the village Metajna on the island of Pag, Croatia.

A large sandy beach with pebbly coast, with shade available and even a nice beach bar. This place is (as expected) quite popular with the yachting people, but fortunately boats are not allowed to get too close, which makes this place great for any activity: swimming, playing games, fooling around... It can get busy around here, but since the beach is huge (for Adriatic standards), it never feels crowded. There\\'s even a smaller and less popular beach a short walk to the south.

One of my favorites. Almost at the end of the road to the village Rukavac turn right (you\\'ll see a sign) and after a short ride you will reach a macadam parking place.

The beach itself is small, pebbly and in fact not so convenient, but the entire scenery is so special and exotic it shouldn\\'t be missed. The easy way to get there is by boat, but you can reach it on foot too. On the main road Komiza-Vis follow the signs to Marine Zemlje village (it\\'s better to enter the village from the  western road) and eventually you\\'ll reach a small parking lot. Park there and take a path down to the cove. The path is short but quite difficult and steep (put some trekking shoes on!), but you won\\'t be disappointed once you get down: the cove (inside a cove) is enclosed with high rocky \"walls\" with only a narrow entrance from the sea. On this famous beach you\\'ll even find a small bar/restaurant.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a696ylcshc4p"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[16.1717,43.02096]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stoncica","description":"Posted by Dsinisa<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/2/stoncica12v_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/2/stonc1v_2_.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/08/2/Uvala_Stoncica_2_.jpg\">Easy to find and therefore one of the most popular beaches on Vis. Rather small, but packed with a tiny beach bar, a restaurant and a beach volley field. In high season the cove gets crowded with yachts which somewhat ruins the experience. The seabed is sandy which makes it perfect for kids.
