Very popular with Long Island surfers. The bay at ditch is a great place to kite on a very strong Southwest windy day. When iwindsurf is show solid green and the surf reports show some waves this place goes off. Most windsurfers on Long Island keep to the flat waters like ponds so windsurfers are super rare. Big kites are perfect here. Keep your distance from surfers in the water. Not a beginner spot because if you go downwind more than a 1/4 mile its all rocks for a beach. Best Wind direction: Southwest - South. East and West winds are super rare. Dont even try on an North winds. Direction: Ditch Plains road is a right turn to make off of Montauk Hwy after passing thru the town of Montauk NY. Take road to end.

If you have a trailer or for a lower cost approach you can get a launch sticker and park at the launching ramps for 0 a season. The alternative to getting a sticker is a 25 parking ticket -- which we hear is a certainty since the town tickets aggressively.
