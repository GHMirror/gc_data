In 1942 she was arrested for drunk driving and made the mistake of going to Mexico, which violated her parole. When she returned, she was put in a mental institution where she reportedly underwent shock treatments and a lobotomy. She was released in 1949 and began a comeback in 1957, eventually getting her own TV show called Frances Farmer Presents. In 1970, Farmer died of cancer at age 56.\r\n\r\nIn this song it appears Kurt Cobain is likening himself to Frances Farmer. While Frances was almost infamous for her difficulty to work with and her battle with her movie studio, which forced her into bad roles. She demanded much and later all she got for it was a series of mental collapses and a failed battle with alcoholism. Kurt related Farmer\\'s battles against her contracts with corporate Hollywood with his difficulty with his record label, which he felt was holding him back and stifling his art, making him release poppy stuff he was never satisfied with.

For the 2003 TV series, see Arrested Development.\nArrested Development is an American progressive hip hop group, founded by Speech and Headliner as a positive, Afrocentric alternative to the gangsta rap popular in the early 1990s.\nIt took the group three years, five months and two days to be offered a record deal. Hence the name of the first album was 3 Years, 5 Months &amp; 2 Days in the Life Of..., which produced several hit tracks. These included Tennessee, People Everyday, and Mr. Wendal, which hit the top ten. The group won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and Best New Artist, and were also Band of the Year by Rolling Stone magazine.\nTheir 1994 follow-up Zingalamaduni, which did very well with some critics but was panned by many others, sold poorly. After the group broke up in 1996, Speech released a solo album, but sales were poor. The group reunited in 2000 (sans Headliner) and has been touring and releasing records via Speech\\'s Vagabond Productions and Speech Music. While Arrested Development has struggled to regain a following in the United States, they have met moderate, consistent success in Japan.\nAlthough she was never an official member of the band (and frequently clashed with Speech), the haunting voice behind Tennessee, Dionne Farris, released a successful solo album in 1994, Wild Seed-Wild Flower. The album spawned the hit single I Know.\nIn November 2003, the group sued the FOX network over their TV show Arrested Development.
