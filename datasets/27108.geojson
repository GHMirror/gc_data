The Metro had also arranged buses to take people to the nearest subway station but you still had to pay the fare.  I realized I had no cash on me and a kind man next to me offered to pay my fare.  Luckily, the bus driver waved me onto the bus, anxious to drive away from the swelling crowds.  When we got to the metro station, I was surprised to see that the subway cops were combing through passengers to ensure they had paid their fares.  (After other large protests, I had been waved onto the trains by cops eager to disperse the large crowd.)\n\nIt was my fault for neglecting to get cash beforehand!  I had been in such a hurry to find old friends in this familar activity, the Los Angeles May Day Immigrants Rights March, that I have lovingly participated in for years.\n\nCrestfallen and with a long way to go to get home, I turned to go back up to the street level to seek out an atm.\n\nSomehow the same man who had offered me a fare for the bus had found me in the subway station.   He put his crumpled day-pass in my hand.  I asked him if he was done with it and he said he wasn\\'t but that he had money to purchase another.  It was such a kind and unexpexted thing.    I tried to give his pass back with much thanks but he insisted and started to walk away.  \n\nI chased him and asked him his name, which was Guadalupe.  We shook hands and I looked for him on the platform downstairs but he never appeared.\n\nI can\\'t stop thinking about what a kind and warm moment it was and how this kind of generosity stays with you and rekindles your warmth towards others.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62nzcgzz3i4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.291808,34.07651]}},{"properties":{"name":"LA Adams Vermont Farmers Market","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_shopping_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 1432 W.

The land has been divided into 360 plots and is believed to be one of the largest urban gardens in the country.  \nThe City of Los Angeles acquired the 14-acre property by eminent domain in the late 1980s, taking it from nine private landowners.  The largest of these owners, Alameda-Barbara Investment Company (â€œAlamedaâ€), owned approximately 80 percent of the site.  The partners of Alameda were Ralph Horowitz and Jacob Libaw.  The City originally intended to use the property for a trash incinerator, but abandoned that plan in the face of public protest organized by Juanita Tate and the Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles.\n\n\nAs part of the eminent domain proceedings, the City granted Alameda a right of first refusal if, within 10 years, the City determined that the parcel formerly owned by Alameda was no longer required for public use.\n\n\nFollowing the uprising in 1992, the City set aside the 14-acre site for use as a community garden.  In 1994, the City transferred title to the property by ordinance to its Harbor Department.  When it received title to the property, the Harbor Department contracted with the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank to operate the property as a community garden; the Foodbank has been operating it as such since then.\"\n\nFor the full story on why farming families are in danger of eviction, visit the website and join them in their struggle to preserve this community resource.\n\n\n   <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a62nzcq8vrtp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.2395,34.00798]}},{"properties":{"name":"Southern California Library for Social Justice and Research","description":"Posted by Hundredflowers<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_activism_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_wild_verD.gif\"> 6120 South Vermont Avenue, los angeles, caOur Mission\nThe Southern California Library is a vital community resource in the heart of Los Angeles dedicated to education for social change.
