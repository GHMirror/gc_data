Ginsberg had been attending the university, on and off, since 1943, and needed only to finish one course in Victorian Literature to graduate. \n\nWhile attending Columbia he had developed a deep appreciation for the work of William Blake, an appreciation that was discouraged at the time by his professors, who considered Blake too far afield a writer for serious consideration. One afternoon, after masturbating in his apartment, Ginsberg \"heard the voice of William Blake\" receiting his poem \"Ah, Sunflower! So Weary of Time\". The voice went on to recite \"The Sick Rose\", as well. \n\nThis vision weighed on Ginsberg heavily for the next ten years. In this particular timeframe the subject comes up frequently within his journals. It was a moment in time that stayed with him for the rest of his life, and he referred to it as a major breakthrough for himself, providing him with a vision of the \"eternal\", an infinite consciousness transcending through time, connecting all thought and action with each individual through history, living and deceased.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ai2si4nrsd"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.95357,40.80783]}},{"properties":{"name":"Avalon Kalin's Sidewalk Library","description":"Posted by Red76<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Books.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 3rd btw. franklin and broadway, Oakland, CaliforniaAvalon Kalin created a temporary library on 3rd St. in the cultural district. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ai2sc3ds9j"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.275096,37.796458]}},{"properties":{"name":"Beating of Johnson X Hinton","description":"Posted by Red76506 Lenox Ave. NYC, NY.After intervening in the arrest of a Harlem resident, and being beaten by the arresting officers, Johnson X Hinton, a Black Muslim, was taken to the 38th Precinct House in Harlem. \n\nSoon after, news of the incident spread through the Black Muslim community of Harlem, and Malcolm X, and other members of the Nation of Islam, made their way to the police station.

Malcolm, other members of the Nation of Islam, and the crowd that had begun gathering while at the station, stayed outside the hospital till they were assured that Hinton was receiving the medical attention that he needed to survive.

The draft lottery was haulted Sunday, to resume Monday morning, July the 13th. Early in the morning, before the office had even yet to open, crowds began to march from lower Manhattan from the Bowery, and the Five Points, up 8th Ave. converging in a vacant lot, east of Central Park. At 8am the crowds gathered into two formations and began making their way to the mid-town draft office, down 5th and 6th Avenues, converging on the draft office located on the corner of 3rd Ave. and 46th St. The estimation of the crowd amassed outside the office was at 10,000, packing the Avenue for a half-dozen blocks on either side of 46th St. Anti-draft placards passed from hand to hand down the street. Ready to ignite, the crowd went into an uproar at the arrival of Volunteer Engine Company 33, known as the Black Joke – a fraternal organization of Five Points street brawlers – whose leader had been picked in the draft. Their aim was to storm the draft office and break the lottery wheel used to draw the names, in addition to burning all the records kept at the office. In the crowd a pistol was fired in the air, and the Black Joke stormed the draft office. After a brutal fight between the mob and police officers and draft officials, and the officials subsequent retreat, the members of the Black Joke destroyed to lottery wheel and promptly set fire to the building. As other volunteer fire companies arrive the building engulfed in flames. The crowd would not let the companies attend to the fire, and the entire block was set ablaze.\n\nThe riots continued till the following Saturday, reeking havoc and destruction all over Manhattan, including the burning of the 2nd Avenue Armory. As the week went on, the rioters set their sites on black New York residents. On Clarkson St., just north west of \nWest Houston and 7th Ave. William Jones was lynched from a tree after attempting to defend his wife and children and the burning of their home.

In pre-revolutionary America the tavern served as a meeting spot for the Sons of Liberty, and later, after the war, on December 4th, 1783, George Washington used the tavern to host a farewell banquet for his officers after defeating the British in the Revolutionary War. \n\nDuring the war the tavern suffered damage from a cannon ball fired by the British at America citizens on the Battery. In August of 1775, Americans took possession of cannons from the Battery at the tip of Manhattan and exchanged fire with a boatload of British soldiers. A British gunboat fired on the Americans, sending a cannon ball through the roof of the tavern. Close to two hundred years after this incident, on January 24, 1975, a bomb exploded in the building, killing four and injuring more than 50.

The police were met by doors welded shut, barricades made of over-turned furniture and trashcans in the street. Roughly sixty protesters, who were not residents, helped form a barricade in front of the buildings. Since the late 1970’s many abandoned buildings on the Lower East Side had been taken over and rehabilitated by squatters. In the early 1990’s, as more and more of NYC was becoming gentrified and “improved”, the city regained their interest in these abandoned sites. In August of 2002, after years of hostility, and slow negotiation, the city sold 11 buildings on the Lower East Side for  each to the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a non-profit agency who have been fighting for affordable housing in New York City since 1973. <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ai2sotw9lf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.98045,40.729539]}},{"properties":{"name":"Infernal Noise Brigade Round-Up","description":"Posted by Red76<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/11/1/16_Irving.jpg\">The Infernal Noise Brigade, a marching band comprised of 15 members, was begun in late 1999 to provide the backing track for the protests slated for the WTO convention in Seattle that October.

We sat for ages and then were taken by busload to a pier (I think maybe 76 or something) that was emptied out and had several fenced off areas (girls here, guys here kind of thing).

Okay, well hardly ever: on occasion, it’s happened. In the summer 1999 I was out of a job and living in Brooklyn, not very sure of what directions my life was headed, and feeling rather crappy. My friend Marc and I would often go out drinking with one another, and whatever money, we could muster between the two of us. Towards the end of those nights Marc usually ending up talking about what a horrible state his life was. That summer the times those portions of the evening usually arose started arriving sooner and sooner. These were not what most would call “happy times”. \n\nOne day Marc, and our friend Miriam, spent the afternoon at Coney Island. I rode the Wonder Wheel (one of the few things that invariably made me happy in this period of my life). Later we bought some beers to drink while staring out at New York Bay, sitting on the rocks by the water near Amherst St. \n\nAfter spending much of the remainder of the day and night at a bar drinking and playing pool somewhere in Brighton Beach the three of us took off and started walking to the subway. I’m not sure how it all came about; Marc started pushing me, at first playfully. This pushing kept going on, and soon something came over Marc’s face that made it seem like it wasn’t playful anymore. Out of the blue he took a swing at me and missed. Instinctually I threw a punch and knock him in the hard jaw, sending him flying back in one swift motion against a gated up storefront. Within this entire period I wasn’t at all mad, just reacting to the situation at hand, it seemed. I stood over Marc and offered my hand, trying to help him to his feet. Miriam told me to just leave. I got onto the subway and never saw either of them again. \n\nOddly, this may have been one of the best things that ever happened to me. I felt freer. Soon after this incident I made the decision to leave New York. Having grown up in the area I was sick of it, and within a few months I packed up all my belongings and moved about as far away, within the continental U.S. as possible, to Portland, Oregon: free from the bonds of history.”\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6ai2sf0zm11"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.96,40.58065]}},{"properties":{"name":"Sincerly, John Head Tailgating Party","description":"Posted by Red76<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/Nat.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/228_2817_IMG.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2006/04/2/227_2775_IMG.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_culture_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 2nd and franklin, Oakland, CA.Sincerly, John Head has been holding tailgating parties around the Pacific Northwest of late.
