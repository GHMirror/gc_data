(847) 234-4420.Lake Forest Book Store was opened in 1949 by a group of local women who decided that the small North Shore community needed a book store.  For 55 years the book store inhabited 1000 square feet just south of the town square. Two years ago Lake Forest Book Store moved into the cornerstone space vacated by B. Dalton on historic Market Square, a downtown shopping area that was completed in 1917.  Now located directly across from the Lake Forest train station the store is right in the middle of the town square area and has grown to 1800 square feet selling space.  The book store is a general full service store with strong links to the community.  We have partnerships with many local organizations and join together with them for many author and book events.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d50pargyt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.840017,42.251958]}},{"properties":{"name":"Lake Forest Food and Wine Specialties","description":"Posted by Glbabooks<img src=\"http://www.dogtreat.com/USA/images/LF-out-store.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_food_verD.gif\"> 672 N.

Laurel Ave. Lake Forest, IL 60045\"Local restaurant open for brunch through dinner.\n\nIf you\\'re a tad tired of food that is complicated and gimmicky with a glut of exotic ingredients in miscellaneous combinations, plan an outing to the Grille on Laurel. \n\nOpen since August 2004, the Lake Forest eatery is Kathy and Jim Govas\\' newest baby, preceded by the late Noyes Street Cafe in Evanston and current culinary charmer, The Metropolitan Cafe in Highland Park. \n\nChef Thomas Mini succeeds in serving simple cuisine with pure ingredients all in a casual yet stylish setting. \n\nAn appetizer of grilled vegetables, for example, rubs shoulders with a simple but punchy balsamic glaze and creamy goat cheese. Fans of entree salads will like the impressive bunch here: Ahi tuna salad features the popular fish sesame-crusted and seared for a smoky charcoal finish yet succulent inside, with artichokes, black olives and chopped tomatoes peeking out from under. Among the half-dozen others, the sirloin salad, Caesar with grilled salmon and the Mandarin with grilled chicken, oranges, grapes, strawberries, walnuts and goat cheese don\\'t disappoint. The Grille on Laurel excels with prime aged steaks and chops served with first-rate sides of grilled veggies, baked white or sweet potato, risotto or mac \\'n\\' cheese. Other tasty entrees include baby back ribs, grilled half chicken, sautéed red snapper and grilled grouper. Desserts are prepared in-house: toasted almond cheesecake and black and white chocolate cake will cure most anything. If not, there are 42 wines by the glass and weekend live entertainment to finish the job. \n\n-- Jacky Runice AOL City Guide <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a69d50w54343"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.842739,42.25905]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/1831","metadata":null,"contact_name":"glbabooks","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:glbabooks","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/1831","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=1831,platial:user=glbabooks","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":48393}
