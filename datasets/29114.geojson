Go Fish! is an odd little restaurant whose specialty is sandwiches in the shape of fish, containing no fish-derived products (hence, \"no fish\").\n\nHOWEVER, the real appeal of No Fish! Go Fish! is the unique event they hold every Friday night:  Strip Jeopardy.\n\nStrip Jeopardy is just like real Jeopardy:  Three contestants who must answer in the form of a question, a host, an audience.  But in strip jeopardy, if a contestant answers a question wrong, they have to remove an article of clothing.  If they fail to answer in the form of a question, they lose another article of clothing.  Get a daily double, and answer right?  The contestant can choose one of their competitors, who must then lose a garment.  And there are also situations where the host takes off clothes, or audience members too.\n\nStrip Jeopardy starts at 10 p.m. every Friday night.  And yes, people get naked.  One of our hostel staff lost early when he played, and ended up sitting in front of the restaurant wearing nothing but a funny hat for 40 minutes.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6gdbksgaqgk"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.622043,45.511891]}},{"properties":{"name":"PDX International Airport","description":"Posted by Hawthornehostel<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/02/2/portland_international_airport_from_rocky_butte_2005.jpg\">7000 NE Airport Way Portland ORHere\\'s how to get to the hostel from the airport.\n\n<b>By Public Transportation</b>\nBuy an all-zone ticket () from a ticket machine\nTake the <a href=\"http://www.trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm\">Red Line</a> MAX light rail car (City Center &amp; Beaverton TC) over the river to downtown\nGet off at Morrison/SW 3rd in downtown\nWalk one block east to SW 2nd and Alder\nBoard bus #14 (Hawthorne to 94th and Foster) and show the driver your MAX ticket\nGet off at SE 30th and Hawthorne.
