This report is a resource for Social Security Administration (SSA) staff in formulating policy and for local service providers and economic planners.\n\nThe SSI program is a cash assistance program that provides monthly benefits to low-income aged, blind, or disabled persons in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The states and other jurisdictions have the option of supplementing their residents' SSI payments and may choose to have the additional payments administered by the federal government. When a state chooses federal administration, SSA maintains the payment records and issues the federal payment and the state supplement in one check. The data presented in this document are for federal and federally administered state payments only. State-administered supplementation payments are not included.\n\nThe tables present SSI data by eligibility category (aged, blind, and disabled) and age. \nSSI recipients who also receive Social Security (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) benefits are shown also in Table 3, which presents data at the county level.&quot;\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{"age65":{"max":752,"mean":182.8,"variance":42264.1777777778,"stdev":205.582532764284,"min":60,"median":104},"latitude":{"max":44.695709,"mean":43.4418246,"variance":0.371472959292045,"stdev":0.609485815497002,"min":42.866779,"median":43.321688},"blind":{"max":4491,"mean":1431.5,"variance":1351515.16666667,"stdev":1162.54684493429,"min":566,"median":894},"total":{"max":4914,"mean":1515.0,"variance":1641466.88888889,"stdev":1281.19744336651,"min":589,"median":930},"oasdi":{"max":1753,"mean":558.8,"variance":202789.066666667,"stdev":450.321070644786,"min":220,"median":370},"amount":{"max":2434,"mean":738.1,"variance":408865.433333333,"stdev":639.425862264996,"min":283,"median":436},"age1864":{"max":3464,"mean":1123.6,"variance":804585.155555556,"stdev":896.986708683889,"min":466,"median":677},"longitude":{"max":-70.932159,"mean":-71.6299694,"variance":0.1941375675956,"stdev":0.440610448804383,"min":-72.243141,"median":-71.494412},"aged":{"max":423,"mean":83.5,"variance":14816.7222222222,"stdev":121.723959113324,"min":21,"median":40},"age17":{"max":698,"mean":208.6,"variance":33840.2666666667,"stdev":183.957241408613,"min":63,"median":149}},"features":[{"properties":{"age65":81,"latitude":43.52486,"county":"Belknap NH","blind":841,"total":871,"oasdi":330,"amount":417,"age1864":671,"longitude":-71.4459,"id":"a648iuksznfb","aged":30,"age17":119},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.4459,43.52486]}},{"properties":{"age65":60,"latitude":44.297877,"county":"Carroll NH","blind":566,"total":589,"oasdi":220,"amount":283,"age1864":466,"longitude":-71.541849,"id":"a648iue4drjd","aged":23,"age17":63},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.541849,44.297877]}},{"properties":{"age65":104,"latitude":42.94685,"county":"Cheshire NH","blind":894,"total":930,"oasdi":370,"amount":436,"age1864":677,"longitude":-72.243141,"id":"a648iudfry7r","aged":36,"age17":149},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.243141,42.94685]}},{"properties":{"age65":104,"latitude":44.695709,"county":"Coos NH","blind":776,"total":813,"oasdi":327,"amount":383,"age1864":623,"longitude":-71.387352,"id":"a648iumf1dgr","aged":37,"age17":86},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.387352,44.695709]}},{"properties":{"age65":103,"latitude":43.559004,"county":"Grafton NH","blind":836,"total":876,"oasdi":324,"amount":413,"age1864":638,"longitude":-71.941453,"id":"a648iuf0cdhs","aged":40,"age17":135},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.941453,43.559004]}},{"properties":{"age65":752,"latitude":43.144303,"county":"Hillsborough NH","blind":4491,"total":4914,"oasdi":1753,"amount":2434,"age1864":3464,"longitude":-71.932722,"id":"a648iulpnzqf","aged":423,"age17":698},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.932722,43.144303]}},{"properties":{"age65":155,"latitude":42.866779,"county":"Merrimack NH","blind":1788,"total":1845,"oasdi":641,"amount":976,"age1864":1405,"longitude":-71.494412,"id":"a648iuilrl6l","aged":57,"age17":285},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.494412,42.866779]}},{"properties":{"age65":211,"latitude":43.049544,"county":"Rockingham NH","blind":1774,"total":1876,"oasdi":668,"amount":866,"age1864":1442,"longitude":-70.932159,"id":"a648iu9nncr2","aged":102,"age17":223},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.932159,43.049544]}},{"properties":{"age65":178,"latitude":43.321688,"county":"Strafford NH","blind":1532,"total":1598,"oasdi":644,"amount":747,"age1864":1226,"longitude":-71.156752,"id":"a648iudozoj9","aged":66,"age17":194},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.156752,43.321688]}},{"properties":{"age65":80,"latitude":43.011632,"county":"Sullivan NH","blind":817,"total":838,"oasdi":311,"amount":426,"age1864":624,"longitude":-72.223954,"id":"a648ium0dmt7","aged":21,"age17":134},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.223954,43.011632]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_sc/2007/index.html","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"Social Security","contact_phone":""},"source":"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_sc/2007/index.html","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"economy,income","published":"2008-05-01T12:00:00Z","id":1013}
