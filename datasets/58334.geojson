The building reopened as a museum in 1939. Over 8,000 objects, including pill rollers, mortars and pestles, drug mills, and hand-blown medicine bottles with gold-leaf labels, were left in place. Medicinal herbs and paper labels remain in their wooden drawers. Large show-globes from the mid-19th century remain in the windows. The first floor room was fitted out in the Gothic Revival style around 1835, and still contains the apothecary furnishings of that period. On the second floor, wooden boxes, hand-lettered with numbers and names of herbs and medicines, line the walls and shelving. This supply room also contains tins, hand-blown bottles and paper labels for packaging the drugs. The Apothecary has a spectacular collection of archival materials, including journals, letter and diaries, prescription and formula books, ledgers and daybooks, orders and invoices, and stock certificates. A video program is available on the first floor for those unable to visit the second floor.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/5929369/VA/Alexandria/Stabler-Leadbeater-Apothecary-Museum-Permanent-Collection/Stabler-Leadbeater-Apothecary-Museum/","id":"134"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0425,38.8043]}},{"properties":{"title":"Jul 13, 2010: Guided Winery Tours at Linganore Winecellars at Berrywine Plantation","guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/5931048/","published":{"end_time":"2010/05/15 12:44:48 -0400","original":"Sat May 15 12:44:47 -0400 2010","granularity":"sec","time":"2010/05/15 12:44:47 -0400"},"description":"Learn the science and art of fine winemaking in a casual and fun atmosphere.

You might have also heard him as the voice of Robert \"Granddad\" Freeman on the hit animated series \"The Boondocks.\" No matter how familiar you are with John, once you see him perform live you completely understand why he's has earned his reputation as one of the funniest dads in America.\nJohn's scene-stealing roles in \"Boomerang,\" \"Little Nicky,\" \"House Party,\" \"Vampire in Brooklyn,\" and \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,\" has established him as a Hollywood mainstay. Witherspoon's resume spans over four decades and his performances in blockbuster movies, hit-television shows, and top-rated music videos have left an impression on legions of fans who instantly recognize his signature catchphrases like \"Bang!Bang!Bang!Bang!\" \"You gotta co-ordinate!\" and \"Don't nobody go in the bathroom...\"\nAccording to the Orange County Register, John's expressive talent puts him in a class of his own. \"Witherspoon is one of those performers who doesn't need a funny line to be funny. Just standing there in a truculent posture with a suspicious look, he is funny and enlivens every scene he's in.\" The Detroit-bred comic has proven that he is a Hollywood mainstay and continues to land coveted spots in some of America's favorite movies and television shows. Witherspoon continues to tour around the country with his wildly popular stand-up show, plus he's recently launched The John Witherspoon Collection, a complete line of humorous greeting cards called Spoon Cards.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8139175/DC/Washington-DC/John-Witherspoon-from-quotThe-Boondocksquot-quotHouse-Partyquot-and-the-quotFridayquot-trilogy/DC-Improv-Comedy-Club/","id":"a622wi8u5jnz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.041,38.9051]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8082666/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Wicked, the Broadway Musical at Kennedy Center Opera House","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/16 18:26:09 -0400","original":"2011-05-16T15:26:08-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/16 18:26:08 -0400"},"description":"Find all dates and times for this exciting broadway musical being held June 16 through Aug. 21.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8082666/DC/Washington/Wicked-the-Broadway-Musical/Kennedy-Center-Opera-House/","id":"a622widroarf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0549,38.8973]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7710478/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Down to the Bone at Birchmere","published":{"end_time":"2011/02/02 13:48:08 -0500","original":"2011-02-02T11:48:07-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/02/02 13:48:07 -0500"},"description":"","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7710478/DC/Alexandria-VA/Down-to-the-Bone/Birchmere/","id":"a622wi8yb5gp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0622,38.8392]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8155948/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Chicago Cubs at Washington Nationals at Nationals Park","published":{"end_time":"2011/06/22 19:21:04 -0400","original":"2011-06-22T16:21:03-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/06/22 19:21:03 -0400"},"description":"The Washington Nationals take on the Chicago Cubs in this MLB matchup.","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8155948/DC/Washington/Chicago-Cubs-at-Washington-Nationals/Nationals-Park/","id":"a622wi7t8n92"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9866,38.8777]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8087415/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Washington Nationals vs. Chicago Cubs at Nationals Park","published":{"end_time":"2011/05/18 00:59:23 -0400","original":"2011-05-17T21:59:22-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/05/18 00:59:22 -0400"},"description":"Event: Washington Nationals vs. Chicago CubsVenue: Nationals ParkStart: 7/7/2011 7:05:00 PMCategory: SPORTS BASEBALL","link":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8087415/DC/Washington-DC/Washington-Nationals-vs-Chicago-Cubs/Nationals-Park/","id":"a622wi0i0xfw"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.0087,38.8719]}},{"properties":{"guid":"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/8000015/","title":"Jul  7, 2011: Jammin Java’s Mid-Atlantic Band Battle 5 at Jammin Java","published":{"end_time":"2011/04/22 20:31:17 -0400","original":"2011-04-22T17:31:16-07:00","granularity":"sec","time":"2011/04/22 20:31:16 -0400"},"description":"Jammin Java presents The FIFTH Mid-Atlantic Band Battle.
