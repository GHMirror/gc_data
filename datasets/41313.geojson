A group of about 45 now pink-skinned students boarded a charter bus that would take them from Regal Palms Resort in sunny Orlando, FL, back to Valparaiso, IN, where the icy fingers of winter were slowly releasing their grip. Everyone was thinking about the poor trade in location and mulling over the almost twenty-four hour trip ahead. One student was beginning to get stir-crazy at only an hour in. This was bad news for those around him who were within ear-shot. A game was made up to keep him occupied, therefore getting his mind off of the thought of the many hours of sitting ahead.There was at least one person on the ride who was enjoying himself though. He was someone who chose to be on these kinds of long drives day in and day out. His name is Tom and he was the bus driver. He is a slight middle-aged man with a high-chipper voice; a voice that loves to utter Roger Rabbit impressions which laughably don’t sound too far off his normal tone. Students get on and off his bus and he always greets them with a smile and a bright hello. Most students like him, but few get to know him as being more than a smiling face and someone to whom they give a quick “thanks” as they hop off the bus. This is okay with most people, but for the inquisitive minded, one may want to know more about the journey of this little driver beyond the bus’ front seat: Where does he come from, how did he get to where he is, and where does he sees himself going?<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfnrsboe"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.673553,28.310337]}},{"properties":{"name":"2) Tom's Neighborhood","description":"Posted by Laura886Fort Wayne, INTom was born and raised in Fort Wayne, IN. He saw himself as a farm-boy even though he did not live on a farm. He lived in a mobile home that rested on a spacious two acre plot. For Tom, this plot of land was only good for exploring; he did his farm-work for an older-aged couple down the road. There Tom cared for eight horses and there at the age of eight he milked his first cow, drank his first glass of milk, and fell in love with the couple’s granddaughter. He lived a fairly carefree life back then. This area where Tom grew up was quiet and had a friendly, down-to-earth feel about it. Nobody was in too big of a rush.---Tom felt safe going out to explore the land, which was a great thing because his house was so small. He had a childhood partner-in-crime, Tim, who like Tom, had an interest in history and adventure. Throughout the town there were many abandoned houses, barns, and churches. Together they’d climb into the windows of these windows into the past and let their imaginations run wild. They liked to search for treasures that gave them hints to the building’s past.---This setting was perfect for Tom. He needed places to escape to and feel happy. He was a loved child, but his parents were both busy with work and his siblings were two sisters whose interests did not always line up with his. His stepmother, whom raised him like her own since Tom was two, worked on the line at an automobile assembly plant. She tried to be there for Tom. Tom always felt closer to her than he did to his father who had two jobs: one at Fallstaff Brewery and one as a mechanic at a local motorcycle shop. Tom’s father was not around very much and wanted to “do his own thing”. Along with this disconnected feeling Tom had towards his father, he also had this feeling towards his extended family. It took really dramatic events, like death, to bring them together. He thought much of this had to do with their moving away to other higher-paced places across the country and becoming too busy. ---Soon Tom became busier with activities of his own. He attended a small country high school, Leo High, who’s mascot was a lion. There he played French horn in the band and tried out cross-country. He didn’t stick with cross-country for long though, because he surprisingly found the races to not be long enough for his country-boy spirit of running the fields. So at the age of fifteen he trained and ran his first marathon, in a local race called the TV 33 Marathon. At one point he was able to run in front of one of the cameras. He said his phone was ringing off the hook after that, as many were impressed by the feat. Tom was very proud.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfvh878q"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.128889,41.130556]}},{"properties":{"name":"3) Bell's Roller Skating Rink","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> 7009 Us Highway 30 E, Fort Wayne, IN---During high school Tom kept busy through both school activities and also through a close friendship he created when visiting a skating rink twenty miles from his house. He met a very sweet girl, who eventually became his girlfriend. She didn’t live very close because her home was near the skating rink. The distance did not deter Tom from seeing her though. Every Saturday morning Tom would get up and bike the twenty miles to the skating rink where they’d meet and skate together. The rink was open from noon to five. Then from five to seven he’d hang out at a local mall and go back to the rink from seven to midnight, when the rink closed. Then early the next morning he’d ride back in time for church.---This went on happily for a while, then tragety hit. Tom’s sweet friend was killed one afternoon while babysitting. The ten-year-old boy she was watching was playing with his father’s gun and accidentally shot her. Tom was only sixteen, and this left him devastated. He backed away from any possible relationship for the next four years, though the effects still lingered on. As if this stage in Tom’s life was not difficult enough, he faced yet another huge obstacle at the age of sixteen. He was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an ongoing illness which causes an inflammation in the digestive tract, especially in the smaller intestines, and can be very painful.---During this time of struggle, Tom was also shown healing and miraculous blessings. One instance that Tom vividly recalls is when he got into a motorcycle accident at this very trying age of sixteen. He was going 30 mph and when the collision occurred. Tom remembered floating gently through the air and being placed on the ground on the side of the road, while his bike was ruined. He left the scene with only a scratched elbow. After revelations of God\\'s presence in his life, at the age of eighteen, Tom gave his heart to God: something he hadn’t done in all his years of going to church.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfr2kpyx"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.049015,41.069841]}},{"properties":{"name":"4) Red Lobster","description":"Posted by Laura8864825 Coldwater Rd, Fort Wayne, IN---Tom persevered and with the help of God was able to attend college at IPFW. He studied criminal law there. At twenty, Tom was a student cop. Crohn’s disease eventually got in the way of going into this type of profession so Tom went in a completely different direction, towards his love of cooking.---When Tom was in high school he had some experience in restaurants. He was a dishwasher, but had always wanted the opportunity to be filling the dishes with rich foods rather than scrubbing the plates of people’s leftover scraps. So when things did not go as well as he’d have liked with the criminal justice career, he knew where to turn. Tom’s first job as a chef was at Heritage House Smorgasbord. It was a buffet style restaurant with many feel good Midwestern foods. Tom spent three years working in this friendly environment where he was taught the basics and more of cooking.---From the homey Heritage House Smorgasbord, Tom moved on to a more fast paced Red Lobster cooking position. Here things were a little less personal. Tom felt like one in an assembly line of many. Tom looks back proudly on his expertise in the positions he was given though. He wanted to take whatever position he got and be the best he could be at it. Tom’s famous role at Red Lobster was “the fry guy”. It normally took two people to hold this fish frying position, but Tom was a quick and accurate chef and only one person was necessary when he his quick hands hovered over the frying baskets. It was a delicate process, they had to be in for only a certain amount of time: too much or too little and the basket of fish would be ruined. Tom spent much of three years buzzing around these sizzling baskets of seafood.---There found there was a small margin of error with all other areas of cooking at Red Lobster as well. Some meals were made or plated incorrectly. Pieces of the meal were then taking apart and Tom would scramble to find a sampler platter that needed a few fish sticks or onion rings that a messed up meal was not supposed to have. There was a margin of about five minutes that meals could be re-arranged before they’d be taking back to an extras table. The food that couldn’t be used would be placed on a list in the cooking area. When Tom would get a break, he’d look on the list to see what options were available. He’d head back and choose a “mess-up” dish to fill his stomach with some energy for more flipping and frying and tossing and chopping.---After three years here, Tom was offered a position at a Red Lobster in Tampa, FL. When he arrived he felt a little out of place. The hot, steamy tropical environment did not feel like home to him. Tom decided after only two months that he’d much rather live in a place that has four seasons, so he headed back to Fort Wayne. When he got back Red Lobster offered him a management position, but Tom wasn’t too sure if this area was where he’d want to continue his life’s journey.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfwyqo3c"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.135688,41.122867]}},{"properties":{"name":"5) Marriott Fort Wayne","description":"Posted by Laura886305 E Washington Center Rd, Fort Wayne, IN---Tom prayed about it and a new position opened up. This position was not at the Red Lobster though. Tom’s new position was as a chef at Fort Wayne’s Marriott Hotel. Looking back Tom saw the move as a shift from glorified fast food, much of which wasn’t from scratch, to a place where cooking was more of an art. At the Marriott, Tom learned the delicacies of finer cooking from the hotel’s head executive chef. From him Tom priceless lessons about drive and energy, but also beauty and creativity. In time, Tom received his own prestigious position: head buffet chef. Two of his major events each week were the extravagant lay-outs served at the Sunday brunch and also the 4-7 happy hour buffets. Tom was given room to be creative with what was being served at the happy hour buffets. Many times he’d be given the task of creating dishes out of left-over ingredients of a previously made dish. Some of his specialties were his famous cheese-stuffed burgers, fettuccini alfredo, and various beef and chicken dishes.---While working as a chef at the Marriott, Tom was able to make some close friendships. Tom found the environment to be an easier to be involved with those around him than at the Red Lobster. His closest relationship was to the head chef, whom he still keeps in contact with today, but he also found close friendships in the restaurant\\'s waitresses. Tom was single and often a cheerful charming presence that didn’t threaten the waitresses. He recalls having to spoil them with positive affirmations and special treats. Tom found that fresh coffee in their systems made them more enjoyable.---There were many exciting yet hectic times for Tom as he worked as a chef at the Marriott Hotel. The hotel was located near Fort Wayne’s Coliseum, which was the concert arena for many big name music stars. The Marriott often was often the temporary home to the stars, many of whom Tom cooked for. Some of them included Morgan Fairchild, the Beach Boys, and the Judds. When these big names came to eat, Tom requested not to know whom he was cooking for because it would turn him into too much of a perfectionist to the point of taking too long or screwing things up.---While Tom enjoyed the life of high-end buffet chef, he grew tired of the high-paced, stressful aspects of this career path. He found himself slowly burning out. So Tom prayed.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfwmpy33"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.138129,41.132867]}},{"properties":{"name":"6) Leo Elementary School","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_family_verD.gif\"> 10404 Hosler Rd, Leo, INAfter praying about his situation, Tom felt a calling to be with children and be a mentor.  He wasn’t married and didn’t have children of his own, but longed for that interaction.  Through praying and meditating on the situation he thought back to a game he’d play as a child.  He would climb onto his bed and pretend that he was driving a bus full of children to and from school.  Tom recalls playing this game because, as a child, the person who had one of the biggest influences on his life was his bus driver.  Because of Tom’s father’s lack of attention, Tom found a man who cared about him and his daily life in his bus driver.  Tom decided he wanted the chance to give this gift back to children, and so took a position as a school bus driver.  A bus driving position would also give Tom a more low-key job position than the fast paced life of a chef.\r\nEvery day Tom would be a cheerful face for the children to be greeted by as they’d hop on the bus to go to school.  Tom many times hammed it up for the children with his zany cartoon voice impersonations.  The children were good for Tom as well; they gave him a reason to stay young.  He began to notice when children were glum and needed cheering up.  He noticed when children tried to hide their true selves from the children around them.  He picked up on aspects of many of the children’s home lives.  Tom tried to be there for them and make them feel that the bus was a place of comfort and trust.  He wanted them to know that he’d be a listening ear on the ride back from a rough day at school.  Through these interactions Tom became close with many of the children and kept in contact with quite a few of them from grade school into high school.\r\nOne of the most important things to Tom in this position was that he wanted people to know he was different.  When he’d first meet children, he found that they thought he was weird because he had such a cheery attitude for a bus driver.  He wanted others to see in him someone who was serving the Lord.  Tom found that no matter what job he was working at he could find enjoyment in it.  He said that he never had a job he didn’t like.  Each job was a stepping stone to a new place God was calling him.  Tom’s affirmation phrase was “Don’t work for man, work for the Lord”.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfp3wr9d"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.013864,41.223041]}},{"properties":{"name":"7) Parkview Hospital","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_health_verD.gif\"> 2200 Randallia Dr, Fort Wayne, IN---Tom spent thirteen years as a school bus driver. During this time, in 1991, Tom had to take some time off as he was going through a very rough time with Crohn’s disease. He was in great pain. When he went to the hospital about the situation he found himself in a dire situation, with only a fifty-fifty chance of survival. He went through a surgery where three-fourths of his bowels were removed. Tom used this trial as another opportunity to witness to other’s through his positive attitude. He wanted others to see how being a Christian changes one’s life. Tom lifted the spirits of many of those in the hospital also going through serious health complications.---Tom left the hospital with a lighter abdomen and lighter spirits. The effects of his surgery affect his daily life. Tom is a very tiny man, because through the removal of three-fourths of his bowels, food goes right through him. He could eat six-thousand calories a day and still not gain weight. Tom is reminded of God’s miraculous healing despite his rough medical times. He takes each day and the people in his life as wonderful blessings. Tom has learned not to take people for granted for tomorrow is not promised. In the most recent four years Tom has been clear of all major Crohn’s disease related issues.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfxcml81"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.111368,41.096061]}},{"properties":{"name":"8) Carson Beach","description":"Posted by Laura886<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_recreation_verD.gif\"> <img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> South Boston---After Tom’s 1991 victory, he started back up bus driving, but this time more in realm of charter bus transportation. This new position gave Tom a chance for adventure and seeing the world outside of the Midwestern city of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Through traveling tours of middle-school, high school, and college age students, Tom has been exposed to many types of vacations. Some that were education oriented, some purely vacation oriented, some service oriented, and some sports oriented. Most of the time Tom participates in whatever activities that group does. Some times he goes off on his own though and does a little spontaneous exploring of his own. One tour that Tom enjoyed in particular was a middle school East coast city tour including: Cape Cod, Long Island, NYC, Philadelphia, Boston, and Washington D.C. The city Tom most enjoyed of these was Boston, Massachusetts. There he’d go on a wondrous whale-watching tour off the Boston Harbor. They’d go out for three hours and breath the salty fresh air, feel the mist of the waves, and gaze across the brilliant blue waters which held the magnificent giants that burst through the surface.---Through tours of the cities, Tom has discovered not only diversity in nature and landscape, but also diversity in attitudes and lifestyles. Every big city has its own quirks. In New York City people keep to themselves. In Philadelphia, people are friendly and approachable. In Boston, people are very busy and the streets are very congested. It is considered among the bus drivers as one of the hardest places to drive; but Tom, as usual, was not detered by a challenging path.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfxq2kk7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.047297,42.327522]}},{"properties":{"name":"9) Tom's Farmhouse","description":"Posted by Laura886Fort Wayne, INTom greatly enjoys seeing the world both through the student tours and through the front seat of a bus as he drives across the countryside.  His home base remains in Fort Wayne, Indiana though, the place he had lived practically his whole life, and a place he feels comfortable in.  He now lives on an acre of land in a beloved old farmhouse that he fixed up himself.  There he uses his cooking skills to host dinner parties with his friends.  Also he is known to make a wonderful lemon meringue pie for church get-togethers.  Through his often sporadic schedule, Tom has found that his true friends will always be there for him: many of whom are either neighbors or members of his church that he has gotten close to over the years. \r\nWhile he has lived in Fort Wayne for all forty-three years of his life, there is one thing that would convince him to move: a relationship.  Tom hopes that in the future, he may find someone to share a seat next to him on his journey’s in Fort Wayne or beyond.  Until then he’ll keep on following where God leads.

The sidewalks are covered in mud.  My shoes are covered in mud.  Mud seems unavoidable these days.  These mud covered pathways are all fenced in to separate the muddy paths from the muddy ditches.  As I walk across campus I have found that some serious acrobatics need to be put into action to get past the perilous puddles.  One time I clung to the fence’s edge and tip-toed on the bit of hardened mud and slush crusting the edges of the pathway.  I made it without too much of a mess.  Today, though, the waters had risen and the hardened crusts were now squishy.  I stood staring at the lake, then down at my dress shoes, and back to the lake.  This went on for about a minute.  There was no way to avoid wet socks.  I turned around and took a longer route through a nearby building.\r\n\tNew projects pop up everywhere one looks.  Holes are being dug.  Pipes lay across the slush covered grass.  How many pipes can possibly need fixing?  I awake many mornings to the sound of beeping trucks.  I even heard one in the middle of the night the other night.  It’s the middle of the winter and late, is digging a hole really that urgent?\r\n\tThough I’ve had some run-ins with flash sidewalk flooding and am greeted many morning by big yellow and black alarm, I found today to be beautiful.  I look past the puddles and the pipes and see the pink and purple streaks across the sky.  As I walked back from my cross-country practice that involved high-winds and pelting bits of hail, I breathed in the moist air and smiled.  I smiled at the soil smell in the air from the dug-up earth.  I smiled at the fresh breeze.  I smiled at the pink and purple streaks across the sky.  Despite the construction and mud I had a feeling of renewal.  Days are getting warmer, spring break will soon be here.  In less then two weeks, it will be day lights savings; the lights in the sky will burn further into the night, uplifting us from the winter slumps.\r\n\tThis scene reminds me that no matter where you are there is a natural God-given beauty that can’t be suppressed.

This term seems to encompass so many possible definitions.  Some are exclusive and some are definitions so broad that sacred ground can be found anywhere.  As a Christian, a place that stands out to me as obvious sacred grounds are churches, houses of God.  In the chapel on campus I have felt the presence of God in the empty hushed pews, where I sit peacefully, being quieted with the love of God.  Also I feel the presence of God in rejoicing and lifting a heartfelt harmony to the heavens.\r\n\r\nMy family and I make going to church a priority.  When I was younger, I sometimes took for granted the wonder of being in a sacred place, a House of God.  In churches that aren’t ornate, filled with things such as statues or stained glass, it can be more easily forgotten that the place you are in is still sacred.  A simple church is the same as any other; the physical atmosphere is not what determines its value.  While churches are considered houses of God, do there have to be walls?  What about an outdoor gathering place, with nothing more than stumps for pews?  Even further, are not the bodies of Christians’ houses of God?  Our bodies are temples that house the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nOver time I have come to really appreciate the sacredness of a church.  I no longer see it as just where I go to respect God.

There also is a plan to make Valpo U a walking campus within the next ten years.  Places are always changing: some good changes and other’s detrimental.  In the surrounding Valparaiso, a shopping complex has sprouted and it is expanding even further into the city.  It is incredible how new restaurants and businesses can sprout up over night.

I am about 25 miles north of Detroit and am surrounded by a completely different environment from the downtown area, yet people that live near me or even a little further love to claim that they are from Detroit.  This is a mystery to me why people love to make this claim; if you’ve been there you’d wonder why, too.  I don’t know, maybe it has something to do with the fact that Eminem hails from 8 mile and it makes people feel dangerous.  Who knows?  It’s probably my own issue that I’d rather not claim to be from this area rather than the people who make this blanket statement\r\n\r\n\tThe other day I was talking to a guy named Josh. I asked him where he was from and he said Chicago.  My response was: which direction and how far from the city?  He kind of laughed and emphasized that no he really was from the city, deep down, Westside of Chicago.  \r\n\tFrom appearances Josh is a typical college male: scruffy stubble, rustled hair, and a hooded pullover.  While growing up in the Westside of Chicago, Josh felt anything but typical or as one who fit in.  His neighborhood was predominantly poor black families, and being white, Josh felt like an outsider on a street where he has lived since birth.  Although he lived in this area he didn’t go to school there.  He stressed that it just wouldn’t have worked out.  So every school day Josh would travel to go to a “super-white affluent” district.  From this experience he grew up seeing both extremes contained in one city, yet never felt committed to either.\r\n\tFrom his early schooling through high school, Josh just coasted by.  When the time came to decide on what to do after high school the decision was easy.  His parents both attended Valpo and so without second thought, Josh wrote out and sent his in only college application which landed him a spot in Valpo, as well.\r\n\tJosh’s father is a social worker in this poorer area of Chicago, while his mother used to work in a school nearby.  Josh looks on his family’s decision to live there through bittersweet lenses.  He acknowledges that there was something very unique about growing up in this culture and area yet he resents how it made him feel like an outsider.  While he has these mixed feelings, he enjoys going back to get away from the everyday Indiana environment he experiences at college.\r\nLooking back Josh somewhat regrets his quick decision-making in finding a college.  He feels that there may be something more out there for him.  An unforgettable experience that made his time at Valpo worthwhile, though, was the opportunity he found for studying abroad in Germany.  It had left a wonderful lasting impression on him seen through his raised eyebrows, sentimental grin, and the twinkle of his eyes as he gets started on talking of this place. He knows that this is where he wants to be after he graduates.\r\n\tIn Germany, Josh feels he has finally met his match of a culture that he feels at home in.  While over there for a year he built up quite a network of friends.  With a laugh in his throat he adds that being 15,000 miles from here didn’t hurt either.  There is one thing Josh will miss though: the bars—cheap, hill-billy, kick-up dirt Indiana bars.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfvl2k9h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.58301,41.37681]}},{"properties":{"name":"No Matter Where I Am","description":"Posted by Laura886There is a place where ghosts are hunted, sardines are packed, and undercover spies are rampant. Furthermore there are cops that chase robbers, who exceed the speed limit on bike. When these robbers are caught, a coupon is ripped from a local drugstore’s booklet, instead of a ticket. Too many coupons meant a “night behind bars” of a front porch railing. It is a place where new restaurants open and within days are closed and replaced by new ones. Movie stars and pop-singers perform weekly. A day at the spa is only a water-hose and sandbox away. And if one really wants a special treat, a nice blend of perfume can be made straight from the branches of a lilac bush. The process, quite simple: 1 part water-filled tin pots heated in the sun, 1 part Mom’s garden, and 2 parts ability to convince others of its wonderful scent.A few blocks from this place from a store that sold all the essentials one needed in life. It was called “D &amp; C”, a dime and cent candy store. A special item at the store was a foot-long, bright pink plastic piggy bank. It always stared at you with a huge grin plastered on its face until one day you can’t take it anymore. You buy it in excitement and then get home to realize that now you have no pennies to put in it. On other trips you may pick up a necklace or lipstick or cigarettes, the sugar variety only. This place is quite wonderful, especially in the summer. You wake up to the sun shining brightly through the window-panes and the sounds of bouncing balls or jump-ropes hitting the pavement below. The breeze through the window screens brings laughter of children, the best alarm clock of all. You jump out of bed, throw on a zip-up one-piece outfit covered in tropical fruit shapes or ice cream cones, and are ready to start the day. Then you run downstairs to find a smiling face, a warm “good morning sleepy head”, and a piece of homemade cinnamon toast. There is an exchange of “I love you” and out you go. What shall you do? Probably get chased by a cop, hunt a ghost, go undercover to do a background check on the old lady on the corner; or if you’re feeling a little less adventurous you may settle for a relaxing mud bath.This is a wonderful place. I will store it in my memory forever. It will always be a part of me wherever I go. All I have to do is pick up the phone and I can hear the old familiar laughter and feel the love I’d find at the bottom of the stairs on those adventurous summer days. Even now as I sit in Northwest Indiana, I have it with me.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfuz5kxc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05841,41.44684]}},{"properties":{"name":"Pitter-Patter","description":"Posted by Laura886Should we go east or west today? Which way is the wind blowing?  Off we go.  Pitter-patter, pitter-patters sound as a couple dozen feet move together.  The air is cold and seeps into our lungs replacing a warm cavity with a breath-taking chill.  Steady trained lungs try to adjust but at moments get caught off guard by a whistling gust.  The gusts whip by your ears and cheeks, stinging like an undeserved slap.  Slap of cold is just a brief reminder that your cheek is still there.  The cold has seeped so deep that you can feel it surround your bone and if its possible for the cartilage of your nose to freeze, you’ll believe it has.  Over the gusting of wind, you here voices telling stories.  You join in and hope that they will distract you from your frozen state.  Soon you realize that your words are no longer words, but more like the garbled expressions of a toddler, as your lips become numb.\n\tShould we go east or west today? How about North or South, Coach?  No, no, too dark, not enough street lights or sidewalks there.  So we head out east or west.  It brings a certain fishbowl feel; except the fish get to stay inside where it is warm.\n\tPitter-patter, pitter-patters sound as a couple dozen feet move together.  Up and down the all too familiar roads.  When your feet take you so many miles, yet they never get too far from the beaten path.  You think back to the fall with runs past the Indiana cornfields.  Beautiful copper, yellow, and maroon leaves drift from elegant branches into the sea of golden maize.  Your mind drifts to another beautiful place so close but so different from sparkling cold dark streets you now know so well.  You are now enveloped in the tall lush forest of trees behind the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Under your feet is hard rich dirt and in the distance you can see hills of silky sand.  Places like these are sights to behold and your feet behold the interesting ground with a happier gate.  Oh how they wish for this happy gate on cold days like today.\n\tAhh, for freedom.  Legs take me wherever you want to go.  Up and down.  In and out.  I think someday these pitter-pattering feet will pitter-patter to the South.\n\t \n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfpp21cm"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.10785,41.4489]}},{"properties":{"name":"Stepping into the South","description":"Posted by Laura886I am a traveler.  I love being emerged in different cultures and sights.  To me, the world is a masterpiece with infinite unique beautiful sights to discover.  When I have a spare moment to relax, I\\'ll sit at the computer or open a travel magazine and plan an adventure.  Many times I plan a vacation in some exotic land out in nature or a tour of the historical wonders of Europe.  Although I haven\\'t done any traveling outside of the US and Canada yet, I have taken in the breath-taking sites and experiences of our country quite extensively.  Something I have found is that there are many charming sites to discover in almost any place you go, if you really look.  While going to school in Northwest Indiana, my friends and I sometimes feel it necessary to find some change of scenery  outside the campus\\' cement paths.  We heard of a place called DC\\'s Country Junction in Lowell, Indiana, and late one Saturday night decided to give it a shot.  We pulled up and discovered it was an old barn turned into a country line dancing extravaganza.  When we walked into the doors it felt as if we stepped into the South.  Most people had on cowboy boots, tight jeans, and a few even went as far as a cowboy hat and flannel button-up.  There was an indoor bbq pit and picnic tables where people took a break from the rowdy dancing to sip a cold drink or suck on the ice that filled most of the plastic cup.  On stage there were old men with round bellies, long beards and toothy grins playing away on there guitars and drums.  We were in the South.  I couldn\\'t believe it, Texas was thousands of miles away, but for tonight I felt like I was there.  No long drive, hotel, or flight to plan.  I was already on vacation.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfkmir6w"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.41341,41.29174]}},{"properties":{"name":"Up Close and Personal","description":"Posted by Laura886When I walk the halls of the Strimbu Gallery, it is as if I am walking down Bourbon St. in New Orleans.  The people I pass are loud and up in my personal space; so close that if I don’t watch where I’m walking glitter, feathers, and fuchsia lip stick may be smeared and clinging to my clothing.  Each frame’s captive I pass looks at me with vigor and vitality, as if teasing and tempting me to laugh or blush.  With the up close and personal view that Professor Tomasek takes I can almost hear their hearty laugher and the faint scent of alcohol that comes along with it.\r\n\tMixed in with these mischievous characters are those who are out to make a different kind of statement.  This is the first Mardi Gras after Hurricane Katrina hit.  Many people become walking billboards that object to the seeming lack of aid or urgency in restoring New Orleans, their home.  Some costumes even display moldy cockroach infested refrigerator doors.\r\n\tThen there are those who walk down the street in normal clothing or even a lack of clothing as their attire, as if just being there is all the effort they can afford.  As we heard from Sheryl St. Germain, many New Orleanians just wanted to keep the festival alive and to show it was of importance of them to have something remain constant in the city.  Being on the streets with others would give them a sense of togetherness.\r\n\tThis togetherness was shown in the smiling face of a couple dressed up as Pop-eye and Mary-Jane.  I imagine them as an old couple who has always known New Orleans as home.  They dress up every year. It is a time to relax, be merry and in the moment just like old times; just like before Katrina hit.  I wonder what happened to their home.  I’m glad the picture has captured their light hopeful spirits.\r\n\tFrom drag queens to objectors, a collaborating couple to those who just were, these pictures gave us a glimpse into it all.  We traveled through many different feelings of those who still wanted New Orleans culture to hold on, to still be celebrated.  This is what makes these pictures captivating: we not only see but we also feel. \r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfkhf5qf"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.03957,41.46386]}},{"properties":{"name":"Valpo Pride?","description":"Posted by Laura886When talking to many students at Valparaiso University, there are often mixed emotions about why one came to Valpo and what makes them stay.  There are various wonderful things to be said about the university’s programs, size, and Christian atmosphere.  A common theme of second-guessing one’s decision based upon distaste for the small town atmosphere and dreary weather conditions come up as well.\r\n\tThe other day, in when talking to my younger sister, Katie, this topic of deciding on a college came up.  She is a senior in high school, so this is a decision that has come up in many of her conversations lately.  At times, she has considered Valparaiso University, simply for the fact that I go to school here.  She asked a man at her work about what he though about this idea as opposed to Concordia University, which is located near downtown Chicago.  His response was “that’s not even a toss-up, there’s nothing exciting about Valparaiso, IN.  There’s just nothing there.”\r\n\tKatie is a free-spirited girl who loves travel and adventure.  I consider myself to be very similar to her in these aspects, but yet here I sit in Valparaiso, IN.  Some of her other college ideas include schools in California, Texas, and North Carolina.  She feels drawn to these schools, but yet her ties to family keep her looking seriously at Midwest schools.\r\n\tThis is an idea that I find to be a huge factor in why many people are where they are.  They are in certain places to be near people they love.  This can make a dreary winter day bearable and a not so “exciting” location a place of fun memories.\r\n\tOther people, on the other hand, genuinely love the small-town feel.  Last week, when shopping in downtown Valpo, I overheard a woman taking about her feelings towards this small Midwestern city.  She said, “If I can’t find what I need in Valpo, then I don’t need it.  There are quaint antique shops and unique restaurants.  One doesn’t have to go too far to be satisfied.”  She seemed very comfortable with where she lives and even takes pride in its quaintness.  Everyone perceives place through different lenses.  A phrase that she said towards the end of the conversation sticks out to me as I think about people’s various reaction to place: “Each place can’t be everything to everyone”. \r\n\t\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfo5jdlc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.08313,41.43861]}},{"properties":{"name":"Visiting Valpo","description":"Posted by Laura886If chocolate, coffee, and a cozy conversation are your thing (and let’s face it, who’s thing isn’t this?) then Valparaiso, IN, is a spot you should consider when visiting the greater Chicago area. In downtown Valpo, as the natives like to call it, you will find unique boutiques and cafes that will tickle your senses. From Designer Desserts to Express Yourself to the Chocolate Cafe, there are flavors of fine coffee and candies that will awaken your imagination and sooth your soul.\r\nOne pleasant place, Uniquely American Legacy’s main goal is to awake the costumers five senses. Walking into this store I am immediately greeted by a rich, luxurious yet warm and comforting feeling.  There are beautiful displays of candles and lotions whose scent fills the air in a light, not overly bearing way.  They mingle among vintage vases, colorful boxes, and delicate flowers.  The sound of a soothing saxophone floats through the air.  As one walks further in there are bright, classy handbags, dishes, and ornate quilted blankets.  Even further back, there is a candy and coffee shop.  They have candy samples out at all times.  When I arrived they were featuring cashew crunch- a delicious brittle as well as chocolate covered caramel corn, which melts in your mouth.  These are candies to savor.  A perfect accompaniment to the savory delights is the featured coffee, which I sampled, “Chocolate Thunder”.  It was the perfect combination.  During the Christmas season, the feature coffee was “Cranberry Crème-Brule”, which was fantastic as well.  Uniquely American Legacy’s ambiance and coffee are reasons enough to make a stop in downtown Valparaiso.\r\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6fwcfwix6s7"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.05566,41.4736]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/237294","metadata":null,"contact_name":"laura886","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:laura886","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/237294","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":19,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=237294,platial:user=laura886","published":"2010-04-25T16:00:00Z","id":41313}
