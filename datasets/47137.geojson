Well, that map got flooded in the storm, and then I heard about platial on NPR and thought, hey, maybe I can just make my map there. So, this is MY New Orleans. It's about what makes the city important and meaningful to me as an individual who lived there, walked my dog down the sidewalks, rode my bike through the streets, drove my truck through the maze of traffic, and spent much time in and out of the many crumbling yet beautiful buildings throughout the city. This is why I love New Orleans. By the way, I have like 200 sites I want to put into this map, but, obviously, that will take a good bit of time, so it may take me awhile to get a decent amount of content in here.\n","next_feature":null,"is_raster":false,"short_classification":"Y","stats":{},"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Abandoned Castle","description":"Posted by Kylebravo2256 N.

I\\'m not sure how it came to be the one and only place we get poboys out of the plethora of poboy shops around here. But for whatever reason, it’s become a staple every time my parents visit.

It\\'s a nonprofit that does many different things, but what I did was work as an art instructor for  kids from the neighborhood (pre-k through 6th grade). During the school year they have an after school program for the kids with art, science, music, etc, and during the summer they have an all day camp. It was a never-dull experience dealing with these kids and trying to get them pumped about art. In spite of, and sometimes because of, their bad-ass attitudes and constant energy, I really grew to love the spunk and irreverence of the youth of New Orleans. I feel like my experience with them gave me an awesome opportunity to get to know and better understand  New Orleans through the eyes of its children. Immediately after the storm they weighed heavily on my mind. What happened to them? Are they ok? Will I ever see any of them again?
