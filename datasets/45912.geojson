Food? or is it cliché.\n\nMY DREAM COLLABORATOR IS: \nFor me it is collaborators, Johnny Depp because he is really good at what he does, I mean there is a lot to learn from him, not acting wise, but determination and focus, he gives all of what he has got to what he does. Steven Spielberg because I would like to able to see everything from different angles like he does. I mean he has got his signature on what he does, an un-seeable signature.\n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS: \nAgain plural for me, Pyramids to study how people managed to built it when there wasn’t a manageable power to do it in those days and Eiffel Tower because it is romantic (I think).\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6htbmq4xryo"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.35917,55.88232]}},{"properties":{"name":"Gemma McGinley (YOUNG Co.)","description":"Posted by <a title=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\" href=\"http://www.tag-theatre.co.uk\">Tagtheatre</a><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/06/1/images.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/06/1/images_salou.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/06/1/gemma_062.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2007/06/1/gemma_519.jpg\">I am from Glasgow have lived there for 19 years and I am currently studying acting at Reid Kerr college.\n\nAGE: 19\n\nMY FAVOURITE THING IN THE WORLD IS: \nA picture of my gran and granda because I never got to meet my gran but she’s part of my family.\n\nMY DREAM COLLABORATOR IS: \nAdam Sandler - so I could see his progress in creating all his different characters in his films and to see a day in the live of him.\n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS: \nSalou (Spain) as that was my first ever time abroad and it was with my family.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6htbmdn8mrt"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.36908,55.84928]}},{"properties":{"name":"Helen Black (TAG/YOUNG Co.

I’m the geek who puts together this web stuff!\n\nAGE: 31 (in early July)\n\nMY FAVOURITE THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD IS:\nI wrote this question, but now that I have to answer it, it’s really hard! I love taking photos, rock climbing, exploring mountains, my bloke and our cat Flo. I guess my favourite thing is being happy!\n\nMY DREAM COLLABORATOR IS:\nNot an individual but a group…The Band! If only I’d lived earlier (and had a significant singing talent) then I could have been one of their amazing guests in their last concert “The Last Waltz”. If you haven’t seen it, check it out.\n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS:\nSan Francisco. It’s probably my favourite place I’ve been to. So many different areas to visit, each with a totally unique atmosphere. It also looks awesome…lots to photograph. Now that I think of it, it’s also where “The Last Waltz” was filmed.

I was lucky enough to see his production of the Mahabharata in 1990 when Glasgow was European City of Culture. It is the story of the Hindu religion, told in 9 hours, it completely blew me away. I think it was the first truly multi-cultural piece of theatre I had seen, it told a great story full of humanity, humour and more theatre spectacle than I believe I will ever see again. \n\nMY DREAM DESTINATION IS: \n…hard, there are too many places I haven’t seen and want to. As a child I always dreamed of diving off the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, I would still like to do this although fear for its destruction from tourism. I’d also like to travel across India.
