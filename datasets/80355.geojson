The desserts are over priced, the service is mediocre and it can seem crowded at times.....\n\nbut I've enjoyed almost every show I've seen here. The Patsy Cline retrospective was great. Really liked \"All Shook Up\",and \"Joseph and the Amazing...\" were all very well performed and fun.

First Street Minneapolis\nhttp://www.mnopera.org/operacenter\n$20-200?\n\nFrom Gilbert A. on Yelp.com:\nThe Minnesota Opera is the state's resident opera company, with all performances staged at the Ordway Center in St. Paul. Five productions comprise the opera house's season, with the first in late September, and the last running through April and May.  \n\nDale Johnson, the Minnesota Opera's Artistic Director, has won some acclaim nationally for the opera house's eclectic programming. While the season typically features two beloved warhorses--such as La Boh√®me or Carmen--the remaining three productions explore obscure, lesser known works from the bel canto repertoire (a 19th century sub-genre that celebrates ornate singing and vocal agility), as well as works by contemporary American masters over the last three decades.\n\nIn offering such a diverse program, the Minnesota Opera seems keen on pleasing multiple audiences:  the opera aficionado, for whom the charms of bel canto are likeliest to appeal, and the novice, likely to be seduced by Puccini, Verdi or Mozart. Contemporary works (such as last year's much hyped staging of Pinocchio) are a hit or miss; musically they tend to lack traits many of us adore about opera, such as histrionic plots, showstopping arias and gorgeous period costumes. At the same time, contemporary pieces are crafted with a sense of realism often lacking in operatic standards (the incestuous Wagnerian storylines reach great heights of sublime absurdity).\n\nAudiences at a Minnesota Opera production resemble those at other local classical music events: older (55 seems to be the median age), White and wealthy. Still, a small cadre of younger opera queens and students of voice are always present, offering us a glimmer of hope that refined musical tastes can survive in an age of Miley Cyrus and American Idol. Sartorially, Minnesota Opera goers are comparatively informal; business wear and cocktail dresses are the norm, rather than the suits and gowns often seen at the elite opera houses, such as the Met or Lyric Opera. The occasional khaki or jean-wearing buffoon makes an appearance, but this is Minnesota, after all.\n\nIn terms of seating, first row balcony boxes are the best (and priciest), and the first 10 or so rows on the main floor are the worst, acoustically and physically (you'll have to stretch your head and neck up to read the translated libretto above the stage). Rush tickets are available, but not when La Traviata or Madama Butterfly are on stage.","id":"a69g0ldoq38e"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2740611111111,44.9893833333333]}},{"properties":{"name":"Minnesota Orchestra","description":"Minnesota Orchestra\n1111 Nicollet Mall Minneapolis\nhttp://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/\n$45-175\n\nFrom Meghan B. on Yelp.com:\nTop tier symphony orchestra.

Their staff and volunteers seem pleasant and helpful.\nI'd like to see them improve their method of snack offerings - which, yesterday, consisted of wedges of cake on plates (sitting out in the open, uncovered, no barrier between them the public lined up), and packaged cookies (located at the opposite end of the counter from where people were lined up to buy something - so how do they expect to sell them?), and coffee (regular &amp; decaf, and a few other \"specialty coffee drinks).\n\nI wonder why it is that the \"very second\" the production was finished, hoardes of people were up and scampering out of their seats, hurrying out of the auditorium as if there was a bomb threat?  My friend informed me that it's like this after 'every' production she attends.","id":"a69g0l7h7ihy"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.0983760000855,44.944665000239]}},{"properties":{"name":"Orpheum","description":"Orpheum\n910 Hennepin Avenue, Minneapolis\nhttp://www.hennepintheatretrust.org/our-theatres/orpheum-theatre\n$33-133\n\nFrom Ngoc N. on Yelp.com:\nI love going to the Orpheum to see shows.  I've had the chance to see Wicked, Mary Poppins, David Gray, a Chorus Line, Grease, Phantom of the Opera and a few others here and there in the last year.  \n\nThe theatre is so gorgeous inside! It's so worth it to come a little early to enjoy the beauty of the architecture.  The ceilings and the chandelier right in the middle are beautiful. :)\n\nThey bring some of the best Broadway tours to the city and all the performances I've seen have been wonderful.  This place made me fall in love with theatre.  I'm always excited to go to my next show and will happily skip out on anything just to see a show here.  \n\nIt's also pretty awesome that you can bring drinks with you inside and drink as you watch a show. Sarah is right, there's not a bad seat in the house.  I've been in various seats and all have be fine.  The only bad thing is if you end up sitting behind someone with a big head.","id":"a69g0lalaif4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2775083333333,44.9763972222222]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"","metadata":"","contact_name":"","contact_address":"","source":"","contact_phone":""},"source":"","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":5,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"","published":"2014-08-10T11:14:05-04:00","id":80355}
