Other seasons, the nearby river was beautiful, the clear sky filled with millions of stars, some late evenings illuminated with fireflies, which we were told, are the souls of our caring ancestors. Bright sunrise and sad deep ever changing sunsets - nature was my soul mate. Schooling was a pain.I dreamt in colors and patterns and never in words. I started drawing at a very young age and my artistic talents somehow got accepted in school!I better give a brief sketch of Kerala, my home province. We may have been poor, but we had our village libraries, a from where I managed to read books - translations of classics like Le Miserables,Crime and Punishment, Brothers Karamazov and Malayalam modern classics.It is this combination of unpolluted natural environment and aptitude for drawings and a nostalgia for my childhood visuals in my current realities of urban landscapes that make me what I am now. This perhaps, sums up my art.\n\nBorn in 1969 Keezhara, Kannur , Kerala, INDIA\n\nExhibitions\n\nConducted solo and group exhibitions in more than 30 villages in Kerala, 1986-91,\n\nSelected for the

I have also worked with a number of independent filmmakers, and in 1991 received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to produce the documentary film “Late City Final: Motion Pictures from the End of Times Square” with director/D.P.’s Jem Cohen and Jeff Preiss. In addition to my work on various corporate and commercial productions, I also worked from 1992-1997 on a series of television projects for Sheila Nevins at HBO, culminating in 1997 with the feature documentary film, “Dragtime,” which I co-produced with Patti Kaplan for HBO’s America Undercover series. In 1998 I produced and directed \"Bruce Davdison – Making Contact\" for WNET's \"City Arts\" series for which I was nominated for a New York Emmy Award for Outstanding Fine Arts Programming. In 2001 I was a staff producer for the Metro Channel’s Gotham TV series during which time I produced a number of documentary segments as well as a series of short pieces with comic Marc Maron (for which Maron won a NY Emmy). In 2002 I was a producer on the independent documentary film \"The Desert is No Lady\" (Women Make Movies). In 2003 I developed a pilot for the intended music series “The Edge of Brooklyn” with Ravi Coltrane in conjunction with City Lights Media Group and Context Studios. I am currently shooting an independently produced project, Nobody Knows, about men in long-term relationships. In 2010 I received a fellowship through the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network in 3D technology and am currently developing a collaborative 3D video project w/kids at Clubhouse programs around the world, shooting in Jordan, Mexico and South Africa. Anyone interested can check in w/this project and more at the fellowship blog, 3diy.blogspot.com.","organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.571,"user id":"4fdfb6388d53629e8c000efc","subject":"Select

reading a book, a good story incites the imagination, but radio pages are deep in dimension where sounds, music and voices reach you often unaware and unexpectedly- usually in a solitary state like your car, waking up in the morning, or cooking in your kitchen. And the radio becomes company that sweeps you comfortably along in an experience- sometimes riveting, personal and emotional and other times not asking too much- you can half pay attention and no one cares.  Right now, I would spend my days playing with photography and radio storytelling. I am interested in how the two mediums layer, each telling the same story in a very different way, where the photography can then be much more abstract and maybe simply thought-provoking. I want the pictures to make people wonder while the voices send.","organization name":"SHIFT","organization city":"Salt Lake City","organization country":"United States","last name":"Montgomery","state/province":"Utah","work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":"84102","organization address1":null,"country":"United States","about me":"I am from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada- farther north than most of you have been- bordering the icy green Saskatchewan River... with three great brothers and a sister- a family full of differing opinions and pursuits.

I have seen technology centers, along with other non-profits, fail to holistically approach integrating technology into their programs or allocate enough resources and time to weave technology into the context of their daily operations. The adults and youth in my recent new media workshops are not only often surprised at how easy it is to create the media but also that their voice might matter in a larger conversation. To fight this ignorance, I continue to teach workshops in blogging and digital storytelling in community technology centers and after-school programs, as well as with my fellow VISTAs, literacy educators, and public access producers. I often present new media and technology fluency as both a persuasive and accessible skill as I search for practical solutions to issues of urban planning, public policy, and community development.","organization name":"Intel Computer Clubhouse Network (Museum of Science, Boston)","organization city":null,"organization country":null,"last name":"Martin","state/province":"MA","work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":null,"organization address1":null,"country":"USA","about me":"I support organizational adoption of participatory media and digital storytelling tools for community organizing and youth development goals.  You might remember me as the coordinator at the Charlestown Boys &amp; Girls Club (MA) Computer Clubhouse from 2001-2005.  I’m now the Knowledge Manager at the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network, at the Museum of Science, Boston.  I document local practice, train new coordinators &amp; staff, manage the online community, the Village (a social network where youth members meet and post their digital media projects), and support local affiliate sustainability within the Network.\r\nThe Clubhouse learning approach is designed to empower youth from all backgrounds to become more capable, creative, and confident learners. This approach is grounded in research from the fields of education, developmental and social psychology, cognitive science, and youth development. It builds on research on the role of affect and motivation in the learning process, the importance of social context, and the interplay between individual and community development. It leverages new technologies to support new types of learning experiences and engage youth.

100 afterschool Digital Connectors youth service programs nationally and managed social media campaigns publicly and internally with youth on ConnectorsClub.org.  I graduated as a Master in City Planning from MIT in Sept. ‘09, spending two years with the MIT@Lawrence university-community partnership and co-producing the documentary, Sustained City-Campus Engagement: Reflections on Our Practice.  Before MIT, I served as an AmeriCorps*VISTA at the Community Technology Centers VISTA Project at UMass Boston [later known as the Transmission Project].  In 2010, I piloted an afterschool program in Boston around conflict-transformation and photo-journalism with Peace In Focusand co-created a research group within MIT’s Center for Future Civic Media, the Department of Play, focused on the design of new mapping and mobile technology and methodologies to support youth as active participants in their communities.","organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.571,"user

state-wide events.  My favorite aspect of 4-H is the opportunity to use and cultivate youth-adult partnerships while helping youth learn about topics for which they have a passion.\r\nI have worked with media production on a limited scale during various undergraduate, civic, and personal projects and have an avid interest in photography.  Largely from having oodles of photographs to play with, I picked up the hobby of scrap-booking a few years ago, and have created numerous print publications for professional purposes.  Due in part to these projects, I have recently become more interested in the computer-aided manipulation of images and video production, so I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about Adobe's products and how to use them to assist youth development.\r\nI am the online course facilitator for the first year of the 4-H partnership with AYV and am looking forward to putting the training I gained at the face-to-face San Jose training to work with other educators online and through multiple projects in my personal life.","organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.0,"user id":"4fdfb6198d53629e8c000d4a","subject":null,"website":null,"work with

I am Christy the new Program Assistant, today is my first day. I'm really looking forward to learning more about this job so I will be able to successfully connect with everyone here.  Saori has left me and Hadia some wonderful notes on doing this job.  I can see that Saori had a fantastic time helping run the Adobe Youth Voices program, but by far her favourite part of the job was connecting with so many people around the world and I am very excited to have the same opportunity!\r\nHere is a short biography about me.  I have just graduated with an MA in the Anthropology of Development and Social Transformation from the University of Sussex, England. I had the greatest time of my life living on Brighton beach and making friends from all over the world! However, even though I really enjoyed school I don't think I could do a Phd degree! So I put my efforts into searching for a job in my home town of Toronto, Canada instead.\r\nMy hobbies include: trying to teach myself japanese from a book, painting, playing tennis and badminton, as well as reading.  I think my favourite books so far are \"Love in the time of Cholera\" and anything written by the Dalai Lama.   ","organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.0,"user id":"4fdfb62a8d53629e8c000e36","subject":null,"website":null,"work with disabilities":null,"postal code":null,"min age":null,"work with at risk of dropping school":null,"user type":"grantee","linkedin":null,"id":"aaddjemxrjes","display name":"christyk","first name":"Christy","phone number":null,"work with other underserved youth":null,"hope for participating this site":null,"languages":null,"organization state/province":null,"geo_precision":"unmatched","email":"christinek@takingitglobal.org","facebook":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"created at":{"end_time":"2012/06/18 20:13:48 -0400","original":"Mon Jun 18 16:13:47 -0700 2012","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/06/18 20:13:47 -0400"},"address1":"Jakkur,Yelahanka","city":"Bangalore","contact in future forsurveys":"false","address2":null,"twitter":null,"active/inactive":"Active","work with economically disadvantaged":null,"work with young people":null,"media interests":null,"organization name":"CLT India","organization city":"Bangalore","organization country":"India","last name":"Shivshankar","state/province":null,"work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":null,"organization address1":null,"country":"India","about me":null,"organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.0,"user id":"4fdfb62b8d53629e8c000e43","subject":"Science","website":null,"work with disabilities":null,"postal code":null,"min age":null,"work with at risk of dropping school":null,"user type":"grantee","linkedin":null,"id":"aaddjeg8wzbh","display name":"Deepak","first name":"Deepak","phone number":null,"work with other underserved youth":null,"hope for participating this site":null,"languages":"English","organization state/province":null,"geo_precision":"unmatched","email":"deepakshankar@cltindia.org","facebook":"http://facebook.com/DEEPSHIV"},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"created at":{"end_time":"2012/06/18 20:13:48 -0400","original":"Mon Jun 18 16:13:47 -0700 2012","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/06/18 20:13:47 -0400"},"address1":null,"city":"Torquay","contact in future forsurveys":null,"address2":null,"twitter":null,"active/inactive":"Active","work with economically disadvantaged":null,"work with young people":null,"media interests":null,"organization name":"Westlands School","organization city":null,"organization country":null,"last name":"Bowers","state/province":"Devon","work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":null,"organization address1":null,"country":"United Kingdom","about me":null,"organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.0,"user id":"4fdfb62b8d53629e8c000e51","subject":null,"website":null,"work with disabilities":null,"postal code":null,"min age":null,"work with at risk of dropping school":null,"user type":"grantee","linkedin":null,"id":"aaddjei6ltnk","display name":"AnnaB","first name":"Anna","phone number":null,"work with other underserved youth":null,"hope for participating this site":null,"languages":null,"organization state/province":null,"geo_precision":"unmatched","email":"abowers@westlands.torbay.sch.uk","facebook":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"created at":{"end_time":"2012/06/18 20:13:48 -0400","original":"Mon Jun 18 16:13:47 -0700 2012","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/06/18 20:13:47 -0400"},"address1":null,"city":"Toronto","contact in future forsurveys":null,"address2":null,"twitter":null,"active/inactive":"Active","work with economically disadvantaged":null,"work with young people":null,"media interests":null,"organization name":"TakingITGlobal","organization city":null,"organization country":null,"last name":"Raheel","state/province":"Ontario","work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":null,"organization address1":null,"country":"Canada","about me":"I am a Program Assistant at TakingITGlobal working on the Adobe Youth Voices Program.  I was till recently volunteering at ADP, a U.S based venture-philanthropy donor organization where my responsibilities included project screening, project evaluation and fundraising.\r\nI am extremely passionate about contributing to long term social and economic development that is youth driven.

To me, global education is about increasing the awareness of the interconnectedness of our lives across borders and recognizing that global citizenship is the moral responsibility of every person around the world. I am particularly interested in media education, environmental education and education for participatory democracy. I feel that our current school system does not do enough to ensure that youth get what they need in order for them to become the global citizens they all can be. TIG and AYV begin to bridge this gap, and I am thrilled to be a part of this movement as the TIGed Program Officer and AYV Course Facilitator.I am a Toronto native and a city girl at heart. I love the vibrancy and constant buzz of Toronto, and am always glad to come home after travelling. I do love to travel though, and have been fortunate enough to visit a few beautiful countries, and to live in Ecuador for six months. I attended the University of Toronto and earned an HonBA with a major in English Literature and minors in Social and Cultural Anthropology and Religious Studies. I also hold a Masters degree in Education from Brock University, a great school in the Niagara Region of Ontario. My research was about the effects of globalization on universities. I love being active and attend yoga and other fitness classes regularly. I love to read novels by authors from all around the world, and I love to spend time with my family.Thanks for reading!Kate","organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.0,"user id":"4fdfb6338d53629e8c000eb5","subject":null,"website":null,"work with disabilities":null,"postal code":null,"min age":null,"work with at risk of dropping school":null,"user type":"grantee","linkedin":null,"id":"aaddjel7p3l8","display name":"Kate Lang","first name":"Kate","phone number":null,"work with other underserved youth":null,"hope for participating this site":null,"languages":null,"organization state/province":null,"geo_precision":"unmatched","email":"kate@takingitglobal.org","facebook":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":null},{"properties":{"created at":{"end_time":"2012/06/18 20:13:57 -0400","original":"Mon Jun 18 16:13:56 -0700 2012","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/06/18 20:13:56 -0400"},"address1":"2300 W. 64th Street","city":"Chicago","contact in future forsurveys":"false","address2":null,"twitter":null,"active/inactive":"Active","work with economically disadvantaged":null,"work with young people":null,"media interests":null,"organization name":"Claremont Academy","organization city":"Chicago","organization country":"United States","last name":"Johnson","state/province":"Illinois","work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":"60636","organization address1":null,"country":"United States","about me":null,"organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.714,"user id":"4fdfb6348d53629e8c000ec0","subject":"All","website":"http://claremont.cps.k12.il.us","work with disabilities":null,"postal code":"60636","min age":null,"work with at risk of dropping school":null,"user type":"grantee","linkedin":null,"id":"aaddjeup9tna","display name":"Anna J","first name":"Anna","phone number":"773 535-8110","work with other underserved youth":null,"hope for participating this site":null,"languages":"English","organization state/province":"Illinois","geo_precision":"zip","email":"aljohnson@cps.edu","facebook":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.68732,41.811929]}},{"properties":{"created at":{"end_time":"2012/06/18 20:13:58 -0400","original":"Mon Jun 18 16:13:57 -0700 2012","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/06/18 20:13:57 -0400"},"address1":null,"city":"Boston","contact in future forsurveys":"false","address2":null,"twitter":null,"active/inactive":"Active","work with economically disadvantaged":null,"work with young people":null,"media interests":null,"organization name":"Artists For Humanity","organization city":null,"organization country":null,"last name":"Talbot","state/province":"MA","work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":null,"organization address1":null,"country":"USA","about me":"I paint, draw, sculpt, shoot, videos and make music.

The films have established the filmmakers in the UK and Internationally.

I have studied video with the SHIFT/Adobe program during the last school year, and went to Adobe headquarters in San Jose this month to attend the Lead Educator Training.  This past year has been an exciting time for me and my students, who made lots of videos as a result of the training I received with SHIFT/Adobe.  \n  Also I have been particularly inspired by Marc Prensky and his take on technology in the classroom in Teaching Digital Natives.  Prensky encourages teachers to \"step away from the podium,\" and use technology in the classroom, even though teachers may not have more expertise than their students.

After studying for a semester at the Jordanian University in Amman, I spent six months working with a cultural center and a news organization in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories. Then the following year I spent six months working in the Education Department of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Beirut, Lebanon. In addition to my interests in education, I'm also a practicing musician. I began playing the guitar at age 13 and quickly became interested in a wide variety of musical styles, particularly hip-hop. As a producer and MC I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to collaborate with artists from all over the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Inspired by the time I spent working with youth at the Ibdaa Cultural Center in the Dheisheh Refugee camp in Bethlehem, I became very interested in the role of arts in education, particularly how arts may be used to address issues of social justice and to build community.

received her Bachelor’s Teaching Degree in French and German and then taught French at the University of Utah while doing post-graduate work in Literature, Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition, resulting in a post-graduate TESOL certificate. This led her to Europe, where she was first introduced to the practicalities of Waldorf family home-life by catching frogs in the forest as a nanny with 3 little boys in Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany.  \n \nAs a Fulbright Scholar, she spent the next year in Berlin, Germany, teaching in the John F. Kennedy School, a bi-lingual international school.  Then it was back to Hannover for a few years, teaching 2 week long intensive International Negotiation Techniques and Business English courses in convention centres and hotels. While attending local and international folk dances, she met more people involved in Waldorf communities, as well as her future husband.  \n\nKaren began teaching at the Independent Waldorf School of Hannover/Maschsee in 1988, and completed the 3 year Waldorf Teacher Training (M. Ed. equiv.) program there in 1991, along with the official unlimited renewal Teaching Certificate. She also worked in Hannover as a translator.  When her son was three, her family moved to a national park and bird refuge: a little island in the North Sea, where cars are prohibited and the whole family cycled for 6 years. It was there that her daughter was born.  Two years later, they moved to Hessia, in central Germany, where she began teaching at the Independent Waldorf School of Diez/Lahn in Rheinland/Pfalz.   \n\nSince 2006 her family has lived in the US, where she continues to enjoy what she left in Europe: playing cello for international folk and contra dances, as well as playing lute-guitar, hurdy-gurdy, medieval bagpipes and singing old French, German, Latin, English, Scottish, Irish and Swedish tales and ballads at Renaissance Fairs and Celtic Festivals.  Otherwise she enjoys reading and discussing books and history at family meal times with her husband and children.  When this is not possible she is knitting or spinning. \n\nShe was very happy to be teaching German and Spanish in her first US Waldorf school in Tucson, Arizona until 2012 and loved being part of the unhurried, humane and holistic educational journey which allows more than one answer to be “correct. ”  That simply makes sense.  In the fall of 2012 she returned to Utah, where she is now bringing her many years of experience into hands-on enhancement and enrichment activities for students working on their world languages course in French, German, Spanish, Latin, Russian, Japanese and Chinese in a blended learning situation at a local charter school.","organization address2":null,"geo_score":0.714,"user id":"501ff0748d5362925f000353","subject":"Foreign/ World Language","website":null,"work with disabilities":null,"postal code":"84116","min age":null,"work with at risk of dropping school":null,"user type":"grantee","linkedin":null,"id":"aaddjegucfgg","display name":"KPKunigk","first name":"Karen","phone number":null,"work with other underserved youth":null,"hope for participating this site":"I hope to gratefully benefit from the enormous experiences of others -   Finding my own voice in different ways and supporting the empowerment of students in finding and expressing their ever-changeable voices!","languages":"English, German, French, some Spanish","organization state/province":"Utah","geo_precision":"zip","email":"k.kunigk@cityacademyslc.org","facebook":null},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.999902,40.798495]}},{"properties":{"created at":{"end_time":"2012/09/21 19:59:11 -0400","original":"Fri Sep 21 15:59:10 -0700 2012","granularity":"sec","time":"2012/09/21 19:59:10 -0400"},"address1":"ramon lopez velarde no. 49 ampliacion la cebada santa fe","city":"ciudad de mexico","contact in future forsurveys":"false","address2":null,"twitter":null,"active/inactive":"Active","work with economically disadvantaged":null,"work with young people":null,"media interests":"ArquitecturA\nFoto\nDiseño \nFutbol","organization name":"Casa Meneses","organization city":"Distrito Federal","organization country":"Mexico","last name":"Romero","state/province":"Alabama","work with no not at this time":null,"max age":null,"job title":null,"organization postal code":null,"organization address1":null,"country":"Mexico","about me":"Buena onda, serioo..
