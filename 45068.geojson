The new zoning regulations that came into being in 1947 deemed terrace houses like this to be undesirable, and illegal to build, and hard to maintain or sell. This photo was taken one year later, in 1948. Some time in the 1960\\'s, the Biggs gave way to a gravel parking lot.\n\nIn such close proximity to the Exchange District and the exclusive Waterfront Drive, the Biggs Terrace would have made for fashionable townhouses  today.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68gsxlhpn0h"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.135223,49.899286]}},{"properties":{"name":"Childs Building (1910-1987)","description":"Posted by Rgalston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/a70f48583808cca21a2d480486626d04.jpg\">At 13 stories, the Childs Building (officially know as the McArthur Building) was the tallest building in the city from its construction in 1910 until the 1960\\'s. \n\nThe Childs was built to eagerly anticipate buildings of equal or greater height being built alongside of it. Unfortunately, by the time the taller buildings came, architecture was governed by Modernist dogma: Rather than a building being part of a whole which creates a block, a space, and a city, each building was an entity of itself which stand-alone and has no use for neighbors. \n\nAnd so, the Childs --like the rest of this corner of Portage and Main-- was demolished in the 1980\\'s to make way for the TD tower. \n\nAccording to one report, the steel piles driven into the ground to support the Childs Building still sit there today; so strongly built into the earth that demolition crews gave up trying to get them out.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68gsx8k6p7k"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.139332,49.895491]}},{"properties":{"name":"Eaton's Department Store (1905-2002)","description":"Posted by Rgalston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/7992cd6a1d6f6b067146d745f1329e10.jpg\">In 1904, work began on a new department store on Portage Avenue between Donald and Hargrave Streets. This would be the first western expansion of the Timothy Eaton\\'s department store empire. When it opened a year later, Eaton\\'s store changed the course of downtown development; shifting retail away from Main Street, and to Portage Avenue. \n\nThe T. Eaton company became an important institution in Winnipeg, and thier store on Portage was hugely popular with shoppers until well into the 1970\\'s. However, the gradual de-urbanization of Winnipeg which began after World War II, caught up to the old department store, and traffic, sales, and active floor space declined. \n\nMeanwhile, the company as a whole began to run into financial difficulties and finally went out of business in 1999, and the lights at the department store that defined Portage Avenue finally went out for the last time.\n\nThe store sat vacant for three years, until it was demolished (despite valliant and credible efforts to save it) to make way for an arena, the MTS Centre. While the MTS Centre has proven to be successful in its own right, it has thus far failed to uplift the ever-declining Portage Avenue, which lost a defining physical presence in the Eaton\\'s store.\n\nIn defence of the demoltion, the argument is often made that the store would still be standing vacant today were it not for the MTS Centre. On a formerly grand retail avenue so destroyed by megaprojects, its vacant windows would have fit right in.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68gsxckxo2t"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.143999,49.892844]}},{"properties":{"name":"Grace Methodist Church (1893-1957)","description":"Posted by Rgalston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/0ef379f6977ec318d6d746a306c578f7.jpg\">Built in 1893, Grace Methodist stood at the intersection of Notre Dame, Garry and Ellice until 1957, when it was demolished for a parking lot.

Just as the old City Hall characterized the unabated optimism of the early city, the modern \"Civic Centre\" characterizes the apathetic pessimism of today\\'s Winnipeg.\n\nPerhaps the most best known and loved of Winnipeg\\'s lost buildings, the Old City Hall is still talked of with fondness today.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a68gsxn8hebh"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.139525,49.899258]}},{"properties":{"name":"Portage and Main (1862-1979)","description":"Posted by Rgalston<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/922b4a1839853cdd8fd7613b332263aa.jpg\">Closed to pedestrian traffic in 1978 to improve vehicular traffic flow through the central business district.
