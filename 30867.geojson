In the summer they host an Arts festival, during which I pig out big time on the best festival food ev-ah.  And then you can also rent these little paddle boats and cruise around the lower lake (never done this, but will one day).  And I think nearly every year my friends and I would have some sort of party at a park pavilion.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6awtzj8v8sc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.46876,40.3242]}},{"properties":{"name":"Underground Atlanta","description":"Posted by Lxk18455 Martin Luther King Dr, Atlanta, GA 30303It\\'s a shopping center.
