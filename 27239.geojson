Burke, Inc. has been reliably delivering premium diesel fuel, motor oil and gasoline to fleets and industry throughout the Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island area. \n\nWhile Detroit offers several variations of new Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV) that average over 50 miles to the gallon, independent fuel marketers are introducing \"Biodiesel,\" a healthier, renewable energy solution that seems to be meeting just about everyone\\'s approval. The Burke Gas Station on Beacham Street in Chelsea is the first station in the state of Massachusetts to offer biodiesel products  Biodiesel B20 at the pump and Biodiesel B100 in drums and pails. \n\nBiodiesel is a clean, diesel fuel substitute made from soybeans, canola, and recycled cooking oil from restaurants. It can be burned safely in any standard, unmodified diesel engine, either in pure form (B100) or in a 20% blend (B20) with 80% petroleum diesel. Most truck manufacturers recommend using B20 in their engines. Pure biodiesel is completely biodegradable, and poses minimal concerns to soil and water contamination. Biodiesel is also non-toxic to plants, animals and humans. On the performance side, biodiesel\\'s higher cetane rating results in excellent engine performance and fuel economy. Biodiesel has outstanding lubricity characteristics. Blend ratios as low as 1% can provide up to 30% more lubricity over conventional diesel fuel. And a higher flash point means it\\'s safer to handle. \n\nAs one of New England\\'s largest suppliers of diesel fuel, gasoline and motor oil products, Dennis K. Burke is proud to be first in bringing biodiesel to Massachusetts.\n<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bkn8jtq4n5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.047724,42.39452]}},{"properties":{"name":"Distribution Drive","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://www.distributiondrive.com/HomeLogo.jpg\">BioDiesel Refueling Station, Public. 2561 E Long Avenue, Fort Worth TX 76137.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bkn8g9ic2u"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.310834,32.810409]}},{"properties":{"name":"Distribution Drive--Dome Park","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://www.distributiondrive.com/Smokey%20Truck%201.JPG\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/categories/ICON_nature_verD.gif\"> BioDiesel Refueling Station, Public. 14707 Le Grande Drive, Addison TX 75001. 972-948-8355 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bkn8bv3oc3"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.843128,32.946989]}},{"properties":{"name":"Duke's Liberty","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:EL75CvLxKFgwHM:journeytoforever.org/media/s/sunflowers.jpg\">BioDiesel Refueling Station, Public\n710 Port Republic Road, Harrisonburg VA 22801 \n540-434-8805 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bkn8ddownp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.87441,38.427158]}},{"properties":{"name":"Earth Biofuels","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:MT_C_I9GJ-xYaM:www.montagna.org/image/view/1906\">BioDiesel Refueling Station, Public \n5780 Terry Road, Byrum MS 39272 \n601-482-2167 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bkn8jgcwsv"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.288494,32.161845]}},{"properties":{"name":"East End Exxon","description":"Posted by System<img src=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:43p0UufipzbU_M:www.needasticker.com/BIO-RECYCLE-1.jpg\">BioDiesel Refueling Station, Public\n717 Main Street, Luray VA 22835 \n540-743-4993 <a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6bkn8e46t43"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.448828,38.665411]}},{"properties":{"name":"Energy PLUS 24 -
