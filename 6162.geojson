Authors: Robert S. Norris and Hans M. Kristensen (Google Earth formatting was done by NRDC's Matthew McKinzie). Though it is the smallest it has been since 1958 with thousands of weapons deployed from the coast of Washington State to the coast of Georgia and beyond. In total we estimate that the United States deploys and stores nearly 10000 nuclear weapons at 18 facilities in 12 states and six European countries The Pentagon developed this extensive network of installations over the past six decades in order to ensure the survivability of its nuclear arsenal. Post-Cold War base closures and arms reductions led to the consolidation of weapons at the current facilities; the number of weapons and their locations will change as the Pentagon implements the June 2004 Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Plan and the New Triad.Approximately 62 percent of the current stockpile belongs to the air force and is stored at seven bases in the United States and eight bases in six European countries; the navy stores its weapons at two submarine bases. The statistics contained in this article represent our best estimates  based on many years of closely following nuclear issues.
