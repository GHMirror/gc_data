However, in my opinion, the only thing to do there is shop.  I much prefer the smaller rural areas in Southern Japan.  With one of the largest shopping districts in the south, Tenjin, Fukuoka remains an economic presence in Japan.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs3uc8gr6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[130.424194336,33.6054696123]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kagoshima","description":"Posted by Wensming<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/kagoshima.JPG\">Kagoshima is one of the most beautiful places in Southern Japan.  It still has the feeling of a small traditional Japanese town with all of the essential commodities.  The ocean and the mountains provide beatiful landscapes.  I only stayed here for a couple of weeks, but I have wanted to return ever since.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs3wcpkbn"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[130.561523438,31.5785354265]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kita Kyushu","description":"Posted by Wensming<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/Kitakyushu1.jpg\">Kita Kyushu is kind of like the Detroit/Philadelphia of Southern Japan, in that it is an industrial town with many factories.  The bomb that hit Nagasaki was originally intended for Kita Kyushu; however, the clouds that hung over the city that day, saved the people of Kita Kyushu.  Even though it has a rich history, it was not by any means the prettiest place I visited during my two years.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs453971b"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[130.880126953,33.8840973793]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kumamoto","description":"Posted by Wensming<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/IMG_4396_10_.jpg\">KumamotoKumamoto may be my favorite city in all of Japan. I come to love their dialect, water, and local food (which consisted of delicious raw horse). Kumamoto is also home to the third largest castle in Japan with one of the longest castle walls in the world.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs3u9zlvc"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[130.716659,32.799999]}},{"properties":{"name":"Kurume","description":"Posted by Wensming<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/IMG_3261.jpg\">KurumeKurume is the first place I lived in Japan. Of all the places I lived, it was the nicest balance between rural and urban. It had all of the commodities of a large city with some very beautiful surroundings.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs3tytamp"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[130.516006,33.303181]}},{"properties":{"name":"Mount Aso","description":"Posted by Wensming<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/800px_mount_aso_naka_dake.jpg\">Mount Aso is the only volcano in Japan where visitors may climb right up to the edge and look in.  I have probably been about four times.  It is incredible and very well maintained.  Surrounded by beautiful mountains and grasslands many retired Japanese people move here.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs41u1nqz"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[131.121826172,32.9994500082]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nagasaki","description":"Posted by WensmingI was surprised to learn that Nagasaki was a relatively small town in comparison to other cities I had been.  Americans had actually planned to bomb Kita Kyushu but due to inclement weather, dropped the bomb on Nagasaki as their back-up plan.  Nagasaki has a rich European influence including a slightly larger Christian population.  Bomb survivors remain to this day to share their stories.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs457d8f8"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[129.90234375,32.7318408969]}},{"properties":{"name":"Nobeoka","description":"Posted by Wensming<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/2/97nagahama_beach_nobeoka.jpg\">Nobeoka is literally in the middle of nowhere.  It is a small town that you have to take a bus to.  It has no train station, which is pretty rare.  With that said, Nobeoka, is the most \"old-school\" part of Japan I have witnessed.  With very little American influence, Nobeoka, and towns like it, work hard to protect its culture and its heritage.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs3y0apo2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[131.66015625,32.5884777695]}},{"properties":{"name":"Oita","description":"Posted by Wensming<img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/IMG_4473.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/img/2008/04/1/IMG_4468.jpg\">Oita, Beppu, and Yufuin are very famous for its natural hot springs.  It is a heavily populated area with no other large cities nearby.  Oita is also filled with beautiful gorges and beaches.  In Yufuin, I actually found a blow up Smokey Dog outside of a shop.

I learned a lot about the Battle of Okinawa in WWII.  Almost as many people died in this battle than those killed by both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs.  There is a memorial there like our Vietnam Memorial.  However, Japanese, Korean, and American names are written.<a title=\"Built for Community Mapping\" href=\"http://www.platial.com\"><img src=\"http://media.geocommons.com/platial/images/logotype_small.jpg\"></a>","id":"a6jvs3xs4rh4"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[127.683105469,26.2047342671]}}],"is_temporal":false,"author":{"url":"http://www.platial.com/map/291357","metadata":null,"contact_name":"wensming","contact_address":null,"source":"platial:wensming","contact_phone":null},"source":"http://www.platial.com/map/291357","pagination":{"sort":null,"start":0,"total":10,"limit":1000000},"state":"complete","tags":"platial,platial:id=291357,platial:user=wensming","published":"2010-04-27T16:00:00Z","id":47701}
